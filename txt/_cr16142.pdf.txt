IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Albania

On May 27, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV Consultation with Albania.1
Albania continues on a path of a gradual economic recovery despite difficult external conditions.
GDP grew by 2.6 percent in 2015. Inflation remains low, reflecting the negative output gap and
weak import prices. Large current account imbalances are financed mostly by foreign direct
investment (FDI), while official foreign reserves have been rising.
Reforms are progressing well. In the past two years, Albania has made good progress with
strengthening public finances and implementing structural reforms in the power sector. A sizable
fiscal consolidation is underway and public debt is projected to start decreasing in 2016.
However, other reforms critical for improving the business environment—including those related
to property rights, resolution of nonperforming loans, the judiciary, and governance—are
lagging.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable. GDP growth is projected to reach 3.4 percent in
2016, and around 4 percent over the medium term, reflecting a recovery in private sector credit,
continued FDI, and structural reforms, as Albania advances through the European Union
accession process. Headline inflation is likely to remain subdued. The current account deficit is
expected to widen and remain elevated as import-intensive investment picks up.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the increased strength of Albania’s economic recovery and
emphasized that the medium-term outlook remains favorable, provided the reform momentum is
maintained. Directors commended the authorities for their strong program ownership and for the
implementation of an ambitious structural and fiscal reform agenda. Going forward, Directors
encouraged the authorities to address fiscal vulnerabilities, strengthen efforts to reduce nonperforming loans (NPLs) which will boost private sector credit, and press ahead with reforms to
improve the business environment to strengthen competitiveness and support growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and gradual debt
reduction. They underscored that continued fiscal adjustment will be crucial to lower fiscal
vulnerabilities and ensure debt sustainability. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider
adopting a fiscal rule to anchor long-term expectations and strengthen credibility.
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to focus fiscal adjustment efforts on the revenue side,
given the relatively low level of public spending. They emphasized that the consolidation
strategy should aim to broaden the tax base, limit exemptions, and strengthen compliance and
revenue administration. Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite steps to introduce a
valuation-based property tax. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to address tax evasion and
informality by targeting high-risk, high-value segments and harnessing modern compliance risk
management tools.
Directors emphasized the need for persistence in implementing structural fiscal reforms to reduce
fiscal risks. In this regard, they urged the authorities to strengthen efforts toward improving
public investment management, preventing new arrears, and conducting risk analysis of publicprivate partnership proposals in line with international norms.
Directors shared the view that the current accommodative monetary policy stance under the
inflation targeting framework remains appropriate. They encouraged the authorities to consider
measures to reduce euroization in the banking system in order to enhance the monetary
transmission mechanism. Greater exchange rate flexibility would support the monetary policy
framework, but it is also important to pay attention to financial stability risks emanating from
unhedged exposures.
Directors noted that the Albanian banking system remains well capitalized and liquid. They
welcomed the progress made in reducing NPLs but underscored the need to speed up
implementation of the comprehensive NPL strategy, which will help revive credit growth. In

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

particular, Directors supported simplifying the legal framework for insolvency and facilitating
out-of-court restructuring. They also encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening
financial supervision and regulation, and to boost the non-bank financial regulator’s supervisory
capacity.
Directors emphasized that further structural reforms to improve the business environment are
critical for strengthening Albania’s competitiveness. They noted the importance of implementing
judicial reform, strengthening property rights, improving infrastructure, and diversifying the
export base. Directors commended the authorities for their continued progress on power sector
reforms, and urged steadfast implementation of the reform agenda in the sector.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SEVENTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT,
AND REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF APPLICABILITY AND
MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context: Over the past few years, Albania has successfully maintained macroeconomic
stability amidst a turbulent external environment. However, growth remains sluggish due
to a weak Euro Area recovery and risk-averse banks. The current account deficit is
expected to remain elevated as import-intensive FDI picks up. Headline inflation will
likely remain subdued, due to imported disinflation and domestic slack. The
medium-term outlook remains favorable, provided the reform momentum is maintained.
Policies: The policy mix focuses on fiscal adjustment, while supporting growth through
gradual monetary easing. Fiscal consolidation is underway and public debt is projected
to have peaked in 2015. The authorities have implemented ambitious and difficult
reforms, including in pensions, the electricity sector, and public financial management.
However, other reforms critical for improving the business environment are lagging. The
key policy priorities are to lower fiscal vulnerabilities through continued consolidation,
revive private sector credit by cleaning up bank balance sheets, and continue
implementing growth-friendly structural reforms.
Program Background and Performance: In February 2014, the Executive Board
approved a three-year Extended Arrangement with access equivalent to SDR
295.42 million (212.1 percent of current quota). So far, five purchases totaling the
equivalent of SDR 180.84 million have been made, and another one equivalent to SDR
28.65 million will be made available upon completion of the seventh review. The
program remains broadly on track. All performance criteria (PCs) were met, as were most
indicative targets. Most structural benchmarks were also implemented, albeit one with a
delay (as a prior action). The authorities request, and staff supports, a waiver of
applicability for two end-April 2016 PCs and a modification of PCs for August and
November 2016.
Risks: Risks to the program remain high. With the next general election due by
mid-2017, political tensions could test the authorities’ perseverance with reforms and
commitment to fiscal adjustment and debt reduction.

CONTEXT
1.
Albania is gradually recovering from a
protracted growth slowdown. The country
weathered the global financial crisis well, but
economic difficulties in key Euro Area trading
partners (Italy and Greece) and stagnant bank
lending have weighed on economic activity in the
post-crisis period. A gradual recovery is now
underway, supported by prudent policies and a
gradual restoration of confidence.

2.
Reforms are progressing, backed by the ruling coalition’s strong legislative majority.
Since the approval of the Extended Arrangement in early 2014, the authorities have implemented
ambitious and difficult structural reforms, including in pensions and the electricity sector. A
substantial stock of central government arrears was cleared. An ambitious fiscal consolidation is
underway and public debt is projected to have peaked at 72 percent of GDP in 2015. These
achievements have allowed a successful Eurobond issuance and a recent credit rating upgrade.
However, other reforms critical for improving the business environment—including those related to
property rights, NPL resolution, the judiciary, and governance—are lagging (text table and Box 1).

3.
The main policy priority is to continue lowering fiscal vulnerabilities while advancing
structural reforms to achieve sustainable growth. Given prospects of lower commodity prices for
the foreseeable future and a slow recovery in Europe, Albania will need to reorient towards a more
diversified and open growth model. Faster implementation of structural reforms will be critical to
strengthen competitiveness, improve the investment climate, and catalyze stronger growth. The
ongoing Extended Arrangement and prospective negotiations for EU accession provide a strong
impetus to advance these reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic growth is gradually strengthening while inflationary pressures are subdued
(Figure 1). GDP growth accelerated to 2.6 percent in 2015, from 2.0 percent in 2014, driven by
higher electricity production due to exceptional rainfall, a pickup in tourism, and a recovery in
construction. Nevertheless, growth remains below potential. Headline inflation is very low
(0.3 percent in March 2016), reflecting low food and fuel prices as well as fading base effects from
the impact of the floods last year, while core inflation remains negative reflecting imported
disinflation and domestic slack.
5.
The current account deficit narrowed temporarily in 2015 but remains large (Figure 2).
Despite reduced oil exports, a one-off reduction in electricity imports (due to improved hydropower
conditions) and strong tourism receipts helped narrow the trade deficit. Remittances, accounting for
5.7 percent of GDP, have remained broadly stable despite weak growth in the main source countries
(Greece and Italy). Consequently, the current account deficit declined from 12.9 percent of GDP in
2014 to 11.1 percent of GDP in 2015. However, risks from the large external deficit are limited, as
more than three quarters of the current account deficit are financed by foreign direct investment.
6.
External financing remains ample, primarily due to FDI inflows but also increased
external borrowing by the public sector. FDI is mainly concentrated in the oil sector and has
slowed down recently with falling crude prices. However, FDI remains strong at around 8–9 percent
of GDP on the back of large energy projects, such as the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the
Statkraft/Devoll hydropower project. With a Eurobond issuance in November 2015, gross FX
reserves climbed to over six months of imports at end-2015.
7.
Fiscal performance is broadly on track. The 2015 fiscal deficit target was met with a
comfortable margin (Tables 2a–2b and Figure 3), despite persistent tax revenue shortfalls. Fiscal
revenues underperformed by 0.6 percentage point of GDP, due to lower-than-projected imports of
fuel and tobacco products in Q4. However, an across-the-board underexecution of recurrent
expenditure (0.8 percent of GDP), including further savings on public support to the electricity
sector, allowed the authorities to meet their overall budget target comfortably. In the first two
months of 2016, the fiscal deficit has been lower than projected: fiscal revenues came in as
expected, but the authorities underexecuted their budget, by nearly 0.5 percent of GDP.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
8.

The program is on track (MEFP ¶5-6 and MEFP Tables 1, 3a, and 3b):



All performance criteria and most indicative targets were met. The authorities are seeking a
waiver of applicability for the end-April ceilings on the general government’s primary fiscal
balance and primary expenditure, for which data are not yet available. Staff expects these PCs to
have been met. The December 2015 indicative target on contracting non-energy guarantees was
missed by a very small margin (0.03 percent of GDP). Going forward, the authorities are
proposing to remove this IT, as non-energy guarantees are now fully captured in their fiscal
framework. The IT on the accumulation of new central government domestic arrears was missed
by a small margin (0.09 percent of GDP) in December 2015. However, the authorities will repay
all accumulated arrears by mid-2016, except for those on court decisions regarding layoffs and
expropriations which will be settled in accordance with a special Council of Ministers (CoM)
decision. As a remedial measure, the authorities are improving public investment management
and seeking rapid implementation of multi-year commitment limits.



Most structural benchmarks (SBs) were implemented, albeit one with a delay. Of the six
SBs, three were met on time. Of the remaining three, one was implemented with a delay (as a
prior action), and one is proposed to be rescheduled. The need to build support and allow
sufficient time for consultations with stakeholders delayed amendments to the Budget Law, but
these were submitted to Parliament in early May 2016, as a prior action. The roll-out of the new
treasury IT system (AGFIS) to 15 budget institutions has been delayed to end-May 2016, to allow
time to train new users of the system. The need to fine-tune the implementation plan to
restructure the tax agency’s headquarters delayed its adoption to May.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The near-term outlook remains broadly unchanged from the combined 5th and 6th
reviews under the Extended Arrangement:


2016 GDP growth is projected at 3.4 percent, up from 2.6 percent in 2015. A reduction in
oil production due to the declining global price will be mostly offset by a recovery in
construction as the moratorium on construction permits was recently removed. Furthermore,
favorable weather conditions are projected to boost electricity generation, while increased
disposable incomes from the drop in fuel retail prices will shore up consumption.



Inflation will remain subdued due to a persistent negative output gap and supply shocks
to food and fuel prices. The headline inflation projection in 2016 has been downgraded from
2.5 percent in the last staff report to 2.2 percent. Nevertheless inflation is projected to gradually
rise, based on strengthening domestic demand.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA



The current account deficit is projected to increase to around 13 percent of GDP in both
2016 and 2017 (Tables 3a–3b).1 Imports are expected to pick up with increased foreign direct
investment in large energy-related projects. Export growth will continue to decline given the
terms of trade shock and slowing global demand.

10.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable, supported by ongoing FDI, a recovery in
the euro area, and continued reforms towards EU accession:

Growth is expected to rise to around 4 percent over the medium term, down by about half a
percentage point from the medium term

improvements, due to continued high FDI and structural reforms to improve the investment
climate as Albania advances through the EU accession process (text chart). Ongoing FDI in the
hydropower sector will boost energy supply, a major bottleneck for business growth. Relatively
favorable demographics, a flexible labor market, and declining emigration will also support an
increased growth contribution from labor (Figure 8).



Inflation will pick up gradually as domestic demand recovers and the output gap narrows,
reaching Bank of Albania’s inflation target of 3 percent in 2018.



The current account deficit will narrow over the medium term, as FDI in large import-intensive
energy-related projects tails off, and exports in the energy and services sectors pick up and
offset gradually declining remittances. External financing will continue to be dominated by FDI
and official financing. Reserve cover is expected to stabilize at around 4-4½ months of imports.

11.
The balance of risks to the outlook is on the downside (Annex I). Political tensions
ahead of the 2017 general election could hinder the implementation of structural reforms. A further
drop in oil prices could damage fiscal revenues and growth, by forcing a scale-back in investment
and production in the domestic oil sector. While direct spillover channels from emerging economies

The recorded current account deficit overstates external imbalances because of sizable errors and omissions
(around 2–3 percent of GDP). Most of these are probably unrecorded private remittances.

are limited, renewed turbulence in Greece or weak growth in Italy could spill over to Albania and
test the banking sector or the authorities’ perseverance with fiscal adjustment and structural
reforms. Erratic rainfall could affect electricity generation as in the past, with power shortages
damaging growth and expensive electricity imports posing quasi-fiscal risks.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s outlook and assessment of risks (MEFP ¶3–4).
However, they emphasized that the governing coalition remains stable and is fully determined to
continue implementing reforms. While acknowledging the negative impact of lower energy prices,
they noted that risks may be mitigated by the recent acquisition of the main domestic oil producer
by a larger foreign company which would allow it to expand operations. Regarding risks to the
financial sector, they noted that significant contingency planning has already taken place and banks
are insulated from shocks by their substantial capital and liquidity buffers.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability and Implementing Structural Fiscal
Reforms
Background
13.
The high level of public debt poses a key macroeconomic risk (Figure 3 and Annex II).
Public debt stood at around 72 percent of GDP in 2015, among the highest in the region. Although
the recent issuance of a five-year Eurobond and the increase in donor financing have alleviated
somewhat rollover risks in the near term, financing needs of 23 percent of GDP are still sizable, with
an average maturity of the public debt stock below two years and substantial reliance on domestic
banks with significant sovereign exposure. Moreover, high debt constrains fiscal policy and is a
potential drag on medium-term growth.
14.
To address this risk, a sizable fiscal
consolidation is underway (text table). Under the
program, the structural primary balance is expected
to improve by 2.4 percent of potential GDP in 2014–
16. The overall deficit (excluding arrears clearance) is
expected to improve from 5.2 percent of GDP in
2013 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2016, bringing the
primary balance into a small surplus (0.3 percent of
GDP). The authorities are firmly committed to
lowering public debt. However, a fiscal framework to
anchor the fiscal target and operationalize the fiscal
consolidation path is yet to be finalized.

1/ Energy spending includes energy sector subsidies, compensation for the poor, and policy net lending. Prior to 2014, energy subsidies were not recorded in the
fiscal accounts, but handled through extra-budgetary guarantees and debt-financed policy net lending.

15.
The revenue-based fiscal consolidation is made difficult by poor tax design and
weaknesses in revenue administration and compliance.3 While tax rates are in line with
neighboring countries, fiscal revenues are low in Albania relative to the region, reflecting low
efficiency of the country’s tax system. Policies such as the 2014 switch to a progressive personal
income tax with a high exemption and the 2016 exemption of all small businesses from income tax
are eroding tax efficiency. Furthermore, tax compliance is costly and burdensome (Figure 7)
contributing to low tax yields and a difficult business environment. For example, a preliminary
estimate of the compliance gap for VAT suggests that Albania loses between 34 and 39 percent of
potential VAT revenues on account of low compliance, compared to an average estimate of
15 percent of potential VAT revenues for the EU countries. Recognizing these challenges, the
government launched a large-scale effort to tackle tax evasion, non-compliance, and informality
which has yielded substantial increases in the number of registered employees and small businesses.
More recently, the campaign has changed focus to target high-risk, high-value segments and
harness modern compliance risk management tools.

Policy advice
16.
Continued fiscal consolidation is crucial to reduce the risks to debt sustainability and
foster Albania’s growth potential. Staff projections show that lowering public debt below
60 percent of GDP by 2019 would require measures of around 1 percent of GDP each year. To
provide a fiscal anchor, the authorities need to adopt a quantitative fiscal rule with an embedded
automatic correction mechanism. The credibility of the medium-term budget would be
strengthened by using independent macroeconomic forecasts and assessments, which could be
provided by an independent fiscal council. In addition, debt management should further lengthen
the maturity of public debt and diversify the investor base, thereby lowering the risks arising from
elevated financing needs.
17.
The fiscal adjustment should continue to target mainly the revenue side to make room
for more productive spending. The level of public spending is low by regional standards
(30.5 percent of GDP in 2015), and areas such as health, education, and infrastructure demand more
resources. In addition, the authorities are already implementing ambitious reforms of the pension
and social assistance systems. The consolidation strategy therefore has to focus on broadening the
tax base and on strengthening compliance and revenue administration. Furthermore, to address
compliance and evasion issues, policies need to focus on strengthening the cooperation between
the tax and customs departments, enhancing performance monitoring of tax administration, and
improving policy design to boost tax compliance.
18.
Revenue measures to broaden the tax base and strengthen efficiency are crucial. The
main headline tax rates in Albania are above the Balkan average, but the tax thresholds are also
comparatively higher. There is scope to lower the zero-tax threshold for personal income tax. The
authorities should accelerate work on a fiscal cadastre (SB), in order to support the goal of
introducing a valuation-based property tax by end-2017. Towards this end, they will start developing
a valuation formula and methodology (SB). Eliminating import tax exemptions would also reduce the
risks of misreporting and facilitate proper monitoring of the VAT supply chain. The authorities need
to refrain from granting any further tax exemptions or preferential tax treatments, and should strive
to remove existing ones. To support this effort, an annual survey of tax expenditures is being
prepared (SB).
19.
Budgetary discipline and persistence with structural fiscal reforms is needed to reduce
fiscal risks.


2016 budget (MEFP ¶8-9): To protect the 2016 primary surplus target from a renewed slide in
global oil prices, the authorities are committed to maintaining strict budgetary discipline,
ensuring savings in current expenditure, and strengthening the revenue base and tax
compliance. They have also committed to taking additional measures, if needed, to meet the
target. The authorities remain prudent in projecting the revenue gains from the campaign
against tax evasion, non-compliance, and informality. Large unbudgeted windfalls due to
disputed tax payments will not be counted as revenue under the program until the tax dispute is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ALBANIA

resolved. On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to restrain the central government’s
wage bill and reap further dividends from the electricity sector reform.


Electricity sector (MEFP ¶10): Fiscal support to the power sector (in the form of public
guarantees, policy net lending, and targeted transfers to the poor) continues to weigh on public
finances, while weather-related risks remain high. The authorities are committed to gradually
unwind public support for the sector by 2020, while addressing its infrastructure gap. To cement
the gains from the power sector reform (see ¶45 and ¶47 below), further steadfast
implementation would be critical, as will be strict monitoring of the investment plans of the
electricity SOEs.



Revenue administration (MEFP ¶12–15): Timely implementation of the tax administration’s
corporate strategy is needed. The plan includes a function-based restructuring of the General
Directorate of Taxes (GDT) headquarters as well as the adoption of modern compliance risk
management tools (SBs). The tax and customs administrations have to improve informationsharing, coordinate more closely on risk assessment, and maintain the momentum of the
campaign against informality.



Public financial management (MEFP ¶11 and 16–17): Strengthening public investment
management and boosting the credibility of the authorities’ Medium-Term Budget Framework
(MTBF) are crucial in order to reduce the risk of unfunded commitments and arrears.
Unbudgeted commitments on existing infrastructure projects continue to exceed the MTBF
envelope. The appraisal, selection, management, and evaluation of public investment projects
have been fragmented across the government, although efforts are underway to streamline
them under the MoF. In line with the recommendations from the recent Public Investment
Management Assessment, the public investment management process needs to be further
strengthened. This includes operationalizing the public investment unit at the MOF to
strengthen the appraisal process for large projects, integrating various public investment
projects into the budget cycle, and reviewing and streamlining project classification to reduce
fragmentation. Specifically, the authorities should develop transparent criteria based on which
they should review all outstanding unbudgeted investment projects and identify low-priority
projects that will be cancelled.



Public Private Partnerships (MEFP ¶11): The authorities are keen to pursue new PPP projects
which pose quasi-fiscal risks. All PPP proposals would need to be subject to a detailed feasibility
study and cost-benefit analysis and be evaluated by the Ministry of Finance before approval. The
impact of any new PPPs on the fiscal accounts and debt statistics should be reflected
transparently and in line with international norms. Efforts are underway to launch a public
register of all active PPP projects and to publish summaries of all PPP contracts.



Fiscal decentralization and arrears clearance and prevention (MEFP ¶11): Fiscal
decentralization has been relatively limited in Albania, with local government spending currently
accounting for only 11 percent of total general government spending. Tight controls on local
government borrowing have limited debt to 0.1 percent of GDP. However, the authorities are

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

pursuing a fiscal decentralization strategy which involves devolution of certain functions and
new financing sources for local governments. In this context, the review of the local public
finance law should be expedited to improve reporting and monitoring and mitigate fiscal risks. A
recent survey of local government finances uncovered potential arrears of around 0.6 percent of
GDP as of mid-2015. Once audited and verified, these claims should be promptly resolved, with
external auditors ensuring the integrity of the process. To prevent recurrence of new central
government arrears, multi-year commitment limits and the rollout of the new treasury IT system
(to 15 budget institutions accounting for 84 percent of the budget and one local government)
should be implemented urgently (SB) and subsequently expanded to cover other local
government units as well. The authorities will also continue to publish the regular survey of new
central government arrears (SB), and gradually expand its coverage.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to gradually reduce the public debt
(MEFP ¶7). While cognizant of the risks that excessive consolidation may have on the nascent
recovery and the political difficulties of maintaining the pace of consolidation, the authorities remain
committed to lowering the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent by 2019, in line with the
program. They support a consolidation strategy based on broadening the tax base, improving
revenue compliance and administration, and implementing structural reforms that yield fiscal
savings over time. There is a strong political consensus on maintaining a small government with a
low tax burden. The authorities are thus wary of raising tax rates which they believe would be
counterproductive and further undermine compliance. They are cautious about adopting a stringent
fiscal rule that limits flexibility to respond to shocks and are also skeptical about the value added of
a fiscal council given a limited pool of available expertise.
21.
The authorities are addressing potential risks by strengthening the fiscal framework
and institutional capacity. The authorities have recently submitted to Parliament amendments to
the Organic Budget Law in order to strengthen the MTBF and allow for multi-year commitment
limits. The amendments also seek to strengthen the MoF’s role in the assessment of PPP proposals
and to better integrate PPPs into the budgetary process. The authorities nevertheless noted that the
key challenge arises from implementation risks. They highlighted that clearance of central
government arrears has been completed ahead of schedule. Regarding the emerging legacy stock
of local government arrears, the authorities argued that early estimates of the stock are unverified.
To mitigate moral hazard risks, they emphasized that they will ensure that local governments deal
with arrears using their own resources. The local government unit at MoF will also start preparing
quarterly surveys of local government arrears (SB).

B. Fine-Tuning Monetary Policy to Support the Economic Recovery
Background
22.
The Bank of Albania (BoA) has been maintaining an accommodative monetary policy
stance in line with its inflation-targeting framework (Figure 4). Headline inflation has, however,
been running below the 3 percent target against the backdrop of declining food and fuel prices,
imported disinflation, and a negative output gap. The exchange rate against the euro has been
stable. Core inflation has hovered around zero since 2013 and has turned negative in recent months,
partly reflecting the recent pass-through of imported inflation and a decline in retail fuel prices. The
BoA has lowered its policy rate by a cumulative 400 basis points since mid-2011 to the current
historic low of 1¼ percent. With increased reliance of public borrowing on external sources since
late 2015, market liquidity has also increased significantly, creating further downward pressures on
domestic T-bill yields.
23.
Structural constraints in the financial sector continue to hinder monetary policy. The
monetary transmission mechanism is limited by heavy euroization, with foreign currency loans
accounting for two thirds of all loans, of which around half remain unhedged. While deposit rates
continue to decline steadily, lending rates are falling at a slower pace, reflecting continued riskaversion by banks still plagued by high NPLs (18 percent of total loans at end-December 2015).
Credit growth remains very weak (¶31), although this also reflects weak demand (especially for
corporate loans), deleveraging pressures on foreign subsidiaries, and continued difficulties with
collateral execution. The BoA plans to maintain its easing bias, and at some stage could consider the
use of unconventional policy tools for monetary easing.
24.
The authorities are implementing an ambitious agenda to improve governance at the
central bank, rebuild its credibility, and strengthen its safeguards and independence. Over the
last 18 months, the authorities have taken steps to fill all vacancies in BoA’s top management lineup,
resumed normal operations at the Internal Audit Department, and constituted an Audit Committee.
The BoA has also prepared its 2015 financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and discussions are
underway to align the BoA Law with modern central banking legislation.

Staff assesses the external position as moderately weaker than implied by
fundamentals (Annex III). The lek-euro exchange rate has remained very stable over the past six
years, despite limited interventions by the central bank. The REER has been broadly stable,
appreciating by 3.7 percent in 2015 compared to 2013. International reserves, which rose in 2015
owing to strong donor flows and Eurobond issuance, are deemed adequate based on metrics for
floating regimes. Nevertheless, the current account deficit is sizable and the net international
investment position (-47 percent of GDP in 2015) has declined rapidly reflecting the high FDI and
increasing external public borrowing. The new EBA-Lite and external sustainability models that take
into account Albania’s high remittances and FDI suggest a moderate exchange rate overvaluation of
around 10 percent.

Exchange restrictions. Albania maintained an unapproved exchange restriction under
Article XIV of the IMF Articles of Agreement in the form of outstanding balances under inoperative
bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became a Fund member in 1991.
These balances relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible currencies.
On February 21, 2015, the Republic of Albania removed two other exchange restrictions and
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. The
authorities continue their efforts to resolve inoperative balances on bilateral payment agreements,
maintained subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a), through regular attempts to contact their
counterparts.

Policy advice
27.
Given the continued disinflationary pressures, persisting with further monetary easing
is appropriate. There still remains space under the conventional monetary policy framework for
further loosening. Strengthening the credit channel will require structural reforms to improve
collateral recovery and lower commercial banks’ risk aversion (MEFP ¶24) such as through
amendments in the Bankruptcy Law and Bailiff’s Law as well as improvements in the credit registry.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would support the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework,
but should be weighed against financial stability risks emanating from unhedged exposures.4 The

The 2014 FSAP estimated that the direct impact of exchange rate devaluation on bank balance sheets would be

ALBANIA

BoA should take further steps to rebuild its credibility, safeguard its independence, and improve its
operations and governance, including through amendments to the central bank law to strengthen
protections for staff and increase operational autonomy.

Authorities’ views
28.
With inflation significantly below the BoA’s target of 3 percent, monetary easing is
expected to continue in the near term (MEFP ¶18-19 and 26). The authorities agree that there is
still space for conventional monetary easing through lowering the policy rate, and underscored that
any decisions on additional measures will be taken in consultation with Fund staff. The authorities
remain concerned that lowering the lek-euro interest rate differential below a certain level could
lead to heightened exchange rate volatility, thereby aggravating financial stability risks given the
significant unhedged exposures. They agree on the importance of amending the central bank law
and have already launched the process, but cautioned that more time might be needed to consult
stakeholders and build support.
29.
The authorities agreed that there may be some overvaluation in the exchange rate, but
stressed that the exchange rate is floating freely and is driven entirely by market forces (MEFP
¶20). They emphasized that interventions in the FX market are small, infrequent, and typically
announced months in advance. They consider structural factors and balanced financial flows and
entrenched expectations to be the driving factors behind exchange rate stability.

C. Unlocking Private Sector Credit and Safeguarding Financial Stability
Background
30.
The banking system remains stable, well capitalized and liquid. The system-wide capital
adequacy ratio is around 16 percent and the liquidity ratio is around 33 percent, well above
statutory requirements. Although the Albanian banking system is dominated by foreign banks (with
a market share of 86 percent), it is mostly funded by domestic deposits, mitigating the effects of
deleveraging compared to regional peers. The level of bank intermediation remains low, with private
sector credit at around 35 percent of GDP, compared to 45 percent of GDP in the Western Balkans
region. Profitability has been low, but has been recovering since the crisis. Key vulnerabilities stem
from high euroization, large exposure to illiquid central government securities, and persistently high
NPLs.
31.
Credit growth to the private sector is subdued, as banks remain risk-averse given the
significant NPL overhang (Figure 5, and Tables 4a and 5). The 2.9 percent decline in private
sector credit in 2015 is explained by a 2015 regulation mandating write-offs of loans that have spent
more than three years in the “loss” category. However, even after removing the effects of NPL

foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers, would be more significant—a 30 percent depreciation of the lek
would lead to an increase in the NPL ratio of the banking system of over 5 percentage points.

write-offs, credit to the private sector grew by only 2.3 percent in 2015. While demand for credit is
weak, difficulties with contract enforcement and collateral execution in the court system also deter
new lending. NPLs have declined substantially from their peak of 25 percent in September 2014 but
still remain high at 18 percent of all loans in December 2015. Provisions cover 71 percent of gross
NPLs.
32.
The authorities are implementing a comprehensive strategy to reduce NPLs. The plan
integrates and sequences reforms in the areas of supervision, regulatory enforcement, debt
restructuring, and insolvency. The authorities have already submitted legal changes to Parliament to
better protect financial collateral and to strengthen property rights over real estate, amended
regulations to facilitate write-offs and collateral management, and formulated an action plan for
handling the 35 largest holders of NPLs (that account for around 50 percent of the NPLs). Going
forward, the NPL strategy envisions simplifying and clarifying the bankruptcy law, as well as
amending several other pieces of legislation such as the Civil Procedure Code and the Private
Bailiff’s Law in order to increase the efficiency of the NPL resolution process (SBs).
33.
The BoA has made significant strides in improving its supervisory vigilance. Although
Greek banks account for around 13 percent of total assets, the banking system weathered the
financial turmoil in Greece last summer with minimal spillovers. The authorities adopted the Basel II
framework in 2015 strengthening the banks’ risk management practices. With about 70 percent of
assets concentrated in the four largest banks, the authorities have been monitoring closely systemic
institutions. The crisis management framework has been improved, including by preparing a new
bank resolution law. The BoA also joined the European Banking Authority College in 2015, which will
enable better coordination with foreign supervisors.
34.
Nonbank supervision has been substantially strengthened. The non-banking sector in
Albania is relatively small at around 10 percent of GDP, but has seen rapid growth over the past few
years.5 Investment funds in particular have expanded rapidly, currently accounting for about half of
this sector. The low interest rate environment is leading to increased appetite for savings
instruments in the non-banking sector. In June 2015, the authorities approved new regulations on
liquidity requirements and asset valuation for investment funds. All vacancies on the executive board
of the Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA) have now been filled, after substantial delays.
The presence of only a single investment fund custodian, a small bank, is raising concerns about
systemic vulnerabilities, especially given plans to start new investment funds.

The non-banking sector consists of investment funds, insurance companies, savings and credit associations,
pension funds, and other non-bank financial institutions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy advice
35.
The key to reviving credit is to strengthen banks’ balance sheets and restore their
confidence by improving NPL resolution. Speedy and forceful implementation of the authorities’
comprehensive NPL strategy would be critical, in particular in simplifying the legal framework for
insolvency and facilitating collateral execution and out-of-court restructuring.
36.
The authorities need to continue efforts to strengthen financial supervision and
regulation. BoA’s microprudential tools should continue to focus on the fastest-growing and
systemically important segments of the banking system, and seek to reduce euroization and the
share of unhedged borrowers in foreign currency in the banking system. It should also maintain
consistency with international standards and ensure healthy capitalization levels in the banking
system by unwinding reduced risk weights designed to encourage moderate credit growth. The
central bank has also committed to gradually unwind the recently introduced lower risk weights on
Albanian government securities issued in foreign currency to contain euroization risks and align its
framework with Basel II.
37.
Given the growing presence of investment funds and non-bank financial institutions,
there is an urgent need to strengthen AFSA’s capacity and its ability to attract and retain
skilled staff. To protect financial stability, AFSA should assess carefully all license applications for
new investment funds, and should encourage more competition among investment fund custodians.

Authorities’ views
38.
The BoA is committed to maintaining its supervisory vigilance to preserve financial
stability (MEFP ¶22–23). The central bank will continue to monitor closely individual banks’
resilience to risks, as well as capital and liquidity positions, and will continue to target fast-growing
or systemically important banks. The authorities noted the adverse domestic impact of international
regulatory reform initiatives which have led to very tight credit standards. They agreed that the
changes to capital requirements designed to encourage moderate credit growth are temporary and
explained that they plan to repeal them by end-2016. Similarly, the central bank will gradually roll
back the lower risk weights on Albanian government securities issued in foreign currency by 2021.
39.
The authorities agree on the importance of a speedy implementation of their action
plan to reduce NPLs (MEFP ¶24–25). The BoA will continue to actively facilitate out-of-court
restructuring of NPLs. The authorities are also committed to strengthening AFSA’s capacity and its
ability to attract and retain skilled staff. AFSA will also conduct stress tests and a crisis preparedness
exercise for investment fund custodians.

D. Advancing Structural Reforms to Achieve Sustainable High Growth
Background
40.
Structural reforms to improve the business environment are critical for strengthening
Albania’s competitiveness (Figures 6–7).6 Albania’s rankings in the Doing Business survey are
lagging behind regional peers. As key challenges to competitiveness, cross-country surveys point to
(i) critical infrastructure gaps that constrain trade and raise the cost of business, (ii) widespread
informality that leads to low investment and productivity, (iii) complex tax procedures that increase
the burden on businesses, (iv) financial underdevelopment with extremely limited access to equity
financing constraining growth, and (v) an inefficient judiciary system that does not protect property
rights adequately and hampers the rule of law. More broadly, weak institutions and poor
governance are significant constraints to improving the investment climate.
41.
Despite relatively favorable demographics, skills shortages remain a key structural
challenge (Figure 8). Albania’s population is relatively young compared to European peers.
Furthermore, labor supply has been increasing with decelerating emigration, increased migration
from rural to urban areas, and a gradual increase in labor force participation rates. However, youth
unemployment has been climbing up reaching 33 percent at end-2014, with the difference between
the youth and the headline unemployment rate increasing from 6 percentage points in 2007 to
15 percentage points in 2014. This reflects gaps in the education system which have contributed to
shortages of skilled labor. The lack of skilled workers is more severe in the tradable
sectors―manufacturing and tourism― than in nontradable sectors, such as construction and retail
trade.
42.
Indicators of external competitiveness also suggest underlying weaknesses (Figure 9).
Flexible labor markets have helped maintain low unit labor costs. However, labor productivity gains
have virtually stalled as investment remains constrained by shortages of skilled labor and a weak
business environment. The export base remains very narrow and commodity exports (mostly oil) are
exposed to volatile global prices. The market share of non-oil exports has seen little growth. These
are concentrated in low value-added sectors (such as textiles and footwear), which are exposed to
competition from textile hubs in low-income countries with cheaper labor. The exchange rate is
estimated to be moderately overvalued, thus undermining competitiveness (¶25).
43.
Persistence with electricity sector reform has started to yield impressive results. These
include sustained increases in bill collections, reductions in distribution losses, and stronger finances
of the state-owned electricity companies. Arrears to the private sector by electricity SOEs have been
cleared. Despite these achievements, service interruptions are still a frequent occurrence.

Policy advice
44.
Further structural reforms to improve the business environment would be critical for
strengthening Albania’s competitiveness and catalyzing stronger growth. The focus needs to
be on reforms crucial for improving the business climate, including property rights and the judiciary.
Efforts to establish the legal cadastre for property registration should be expedited, in order to
strengthen property rights, a key impediment to investment. Progress in judicial reform should be
guided by the recommendations of the Venice Commission.7 Albania also needs to sustain the fight
against informality, simplify tax collection procedures, and improve governance. Finally,
diversification of exports beyond commodities and low value-added textiles will be important for
sustainable growth, and would require additional investment in education and infrastructure.
45.
Electricity sector reforms focusing on further deregulation and improved corporate
governance would improve energy supply and lower the cost of doing business. In advancing
reforms, the focus should be on further liberalizing the electricity market, investing prudently in
meters and grid infrastructure, and strengthening corporate governance in the sector, including
through greater financial transparency.

Authorities’ views
46.
While the authorities acknowledge the importance of further structural reforms, they
also pointed to the accomplishments of the past few years. Reforms in higher education and
vocational training have started tackling the education gap. The new Strategic Investment Law is
introducing fast-track procedures for businesses, including a one-stop shop to help attract FDI by
streamlining the entry process. VAT refunds have been simplified and accelerated, and the ongoing
campaign against tax evasion, non-compliance, and informality is trying to level the playing field for
law-abiding businesses.
47.
The authorities are determined to sustain the momentum of the electricity sector
reform (MEFP ¶27-28). The 2015 power sector law sets in place a schedule for moving all
medium-voltage customers out of the regulated tariff structure by end-2017, beginning with
35kV customers by July 2016 and 20 kV customers by end-2016 (SBs). On completion, the share of
deregulated consumption would increase from 13 to 33 percent of the total energy consumed. The
authorities are also developing a power exchange and pursuing integration with the electricity
markets of neighboring countries. The authorities will continue to prepare a quarterly survey of the
arrears of the electricity sector to the private sector (SB), and will monitor the SOEs’ operations on a
monthly basis to ensure financial discipline. Finally, they will target improvements in corporate
governance in the sector, including by moving forward with an advisory services contract for the
distribution company and by publishing quarterly financial statements for the generation,
transmission, and distribution SOEs (SB).

PROGRAM DESIGN AND RISKS
48.
The authorities request, and staff supports, a waiver of applicability for the end-April
PCs on the general government’s primary balance and primary expenditure. Data for assessing
these PCs are unavailable. Staff expects these PCs to be met. All PCs for end-December 2015 were
met.
49.
The authorities propose, and staff supports, the following modifications to program
conditionality (MEFP Tables 1 and 3b):


Adjust marginally the PCs and ITs for August and November 2016 in line with the updated
economic outlook. In particular, the lower world price of oil justifies a modest downward
revision in the NIR floors for August and November 2016.



Remove the indicative target on contracting non-energy guarantees. The amounts are now fully
captured in the authorities’ fiscal framework, including the program targets on the primary
deficit and primary expenditure.



To allow time to train users of the new treasury IT system (AGFIS), reschedule its roll-out to
15 budget institutions to end-May 2016.



Introduce new structural benchmarks aimed at improving public financial management and tax
administration.

50.
The program remains fully financed. In 2016, the World Bank is providing a development
policy loan of $175 million, and the EBRD is expected to provide a loan of €100 million to finance a
restructuring of electricity sector debt. In addition, the EU is providing €20 million annually over
2016-18, in the form of a grant for balance of payments support linked to the implementation of
Albania’s PFM reform strategy.
51.
Albania is expected to meet repayment obligations to the Fund (Table 7). By the end of
the Extended Arrangement, Fund credit outstanding is projected to be 3.2 percent of GDP, or
13.3 percent of gross reserves. Debt service to the Fund is expected to peak in 2022 at around
0.5 percent of GDP and less than 3 percent of international reserves. After peaking at 43.3 percent of
GDP in 2017, external debt will decline to 37.2 percent of GDP by 2021, with external public debt
falling from 35.0 to 28.6 percent of GDP. Risks to repayment capacity are mitigated by Albania’s
strong record of repaying the Fund and by the authorities’ robust performance during the first two
years of the program, including their willingness to move ahead with difficult structural reforms.
52.
Risks to the program remain elevated. With the next general election due by mid-2017,
political and social tensions could test the authorities’ perseverance with reforms and commitment
to fiscal adjustment and debt reduction. The revenue gains from the tax compliance efforts remain
uncertain in the near term. Revenue mobilization requires sustained political will and is vulnerable to
constraints on administrative and technical capacity. Despite an impressive start, electricity sector
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

reforms are subject to implementation and weather-related risks, and will require unbending
political commitment over the medium term. These risks are mitigated by the prospect for EU
accession, which provides a catalyst for reform. Extensive TA by the Fund and other donors will
continue to build up capacity to manage macroeconomic risks. Finally, border closures elsewhere in
the Balkans could lead to a surge of refugees transiting through Albania and could strain the
country’s infrastructure and public finances. Fiscal targets could be adjusted to accommodate such a
temporary shock.

STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
Albania’s economic recovery is slowly gathering pace, supported by prudent policies
and a gradual restoration of consumer confidence. The current account deficit is expected to
widen as import-intensive FDI picks up. Headline inflation is low and will likely remain so in the near
future, due to imported disinflation and domestic slack. The medium-term outlook remains
favorable, provided the reform momentum is maintained.
54.
Program ownership has been strong, with the authorities implementing some
ambitious and difficult reforms. Program targets were broadly met, with comfortable margins.
Fiscal consolidation is underway and public debt is projected to have peaked in 2015. Pension and
power sector reforms and arrears clearance are important milestones. However, other reforms
critical for improving the business environment—including those related to property rights, NPL
resolution, the judiciary, and governance—are lagging.
55.
Fiscal consolidation should continue to lower fiscal vulnerabilities and ensure debt
sustainability. The authorities need to persist with their target of lowering public debt below
60 percent of GDP by 2019, which requires measures of around 1 percent of GDP each year. To
anchor long-term expectations, the authorities should adopt a fiscal rule, particularly in view of the
EFF-supported program ending next year.
56.
Given the relatively low level of public spending, the fiscal adjustment will need to
focus mainly on the revenue side. The space for further tax rate increases is limited, so the
consolidation strategy should instead broaden the tax base and strengthen compliance and revenue
administration. The authorities should refrain from granting any further tax exemptions or
preferential tax treatments, and strive to remove existing ones. Steps to introduce a valuation-based
property tax should be expedited.
57.
Strengthening tax compliance to address the low and declining efficiency of the tax
system is a key priority. The refocusing of the authorities’ campaign against tax evasion,
non-compliance, and informality to target high-risk, high-value segments and harness modern
compliance risk management tools is welcome. The tax administration should focus on the timely
implementation of its corporate strategy. The tax and customs administrations should share
information and coordinate more closely on risk assessment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

ALBANIA

58.
Persistence with structural fiscal reforms is needed to reduce fiscal risks. Strengthening
public investment management and boosting the credibility of the authorities’ MTBF are crucial in
order to reduce the risk of unfunded commitments and arrears. The recent transfer of the public
investment portfolio from the Ministry of the Economy back to the Ministry of Finance is a
significant step in the right direction. All PPP proposals should be subject to a detailed feasibility
study and cost-benefit analysis, which should be evaluated by the Ministry of Finance before
approval. The impact of any new PPPs on the fiscal accounts should be reflected transparently and
in line with international norms.
59.
Progress with arrears clearance and prevention should be sustained. To prevent
recurrence of new arrears, multi-year commitment limits and the rollout of a new treasury IT system
should be implemented urgently. The emerging stock of legacy arrears at the local level should be
audited and swiftly addressed without introducing moral hazard risk. To mitigate fiscal risks from the
ongoing fiscal decentralization and improve reporting and monitoring, the review of the local public
finance law should be expedited.
60.
Continued progress on power sector reforms would also mitigate fiscal risks. The early
results from these reforms are impressive. To cement these gains, steadfast implementation of the
reform agenda would be critical. In advancing reforms, the focus should be on further liberalizing
the electricity market, investing prudently in meters and grid infrastructure, and strengthening
corporate governance in the sector.
61.
The authorities should persist with monetary easing. There remains space under the
conventional monetary policy framework for further easing. Greater exchange rate flexibility would
support the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, but should be weighed against financial
stability risks emanating from unhedged exposures. The BoA should take further steps to rebuild its
credibility, safeguard its independence, and improve its operations and governance.
62.
High risk aversion by banks due to difficulties in NPL resolution continues to thwart
credit recovery. Speedy implementation of the authorities’ comprehensive NPL strategy is critical,
in particular in clarifying and simplifying the legal framework for insolvency, as well as facilitating
collateral execution and out-of-court restructuring.
63.
The authorities continued efforts to strengthen financial supervision and regulation
are welcome. The banking system remains well-capitalized and liquid. BoA’s microprudential tools
should focus on the fastest-growing and systemically important segments of the banking system.
The BoA should seek to reduce euroization in the banking system, including by appropriate
macroprudential measures to reduce the share of unhedged borrowers in foreign currency. It should
also maintain consistency with international standards and ensure healthy capitalization levels in the
banking system. Given the growing presence of investment funds and non-bank financial
institutions, the authorities should urgently strengthen the non-bank financial regulator’s capacity
and its ability to attract and retain skilled staff.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

64.
Further structural reforms to improve the business environment would be critical for
strengthening Albania’s competitiveness. Policies should seek to address structural bottlenecks to
investment. Higher investments would potentially foster greater technology transfer and enable the
export base to diversify into higher value-added sectors. Faster growth in labor productivity would
require further reforms in higher education and vocational training. Additional improvement in the
country’s infrastructure could ease the cost of doing business. In order to bolster its
competitiveness, Albania also needs to sustain the fight against informality, simplify tax collection
procedures, and improve governance. Efforts to address corruption and organized crime could be
enhanced, in line with key priorities in the EU accession negotiations and recommendations by the
Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption, including by mobilizing the AML framework.
To strengthen property rights, efforts to establish the legal cadastre for property registration should
be expedited. Progress in judicial reform should be guided by the recommendations of the Venice
Commission.
65.
In light of the progress so far and the authorities’ policy commitments going forward,
staff supports the completion of the Seventh Review under the Extended Arrangement. Staff
also supports the authorities’ requests for waivers of applicability and modification of performance
criteria.
66.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Albania be held on the
24-month cycle, subject to Decision No. 14747, as amended.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Box 1. Implementation of the Recommendations from the 2014 Article IV Consultation
Advice: Implement sizable revenue-based fiscal adjustment in order to reduce public debt to about
60 percent of GDP over the medium term and to 40 percent of GDP over the longer term. Pass a fiscal rule
law and adopt a binding MTBF.
Status: The authorities have adopted three annual budgets with significant revenue measures. However, due
to revenue shortfalls, the ex post fiscal adjustment has had a significant expenditure component, particularly
in public investment. Public debt peaked at 72 percent of GDP in 2015, partly due to exogenous factors and
after incorporating subsidies to the electricity sector. The authorities have drafted a fiscal rule law that
targets a debt level of 45 percent of GDP over the longer term. Making the MTBF more credible and binding
continues to be a challenge.
Advice: Clear central government arrears in a comprehensive and transparent fashion and prevent the
accumulation of new arrears.
Status: The authorities have implemented a public strategy for clearance and prevention. The bulk of arrears
clearance is projected to have been completed at end-2015. Amounts cleared have been made public on a
regular basis. External auditors were employed to ensure the integrity of the process. However, measures to
prevent future arrears, such as introducing multi-year commitment limits and rolling out a new treasury IT
system, have been delayed. As a result, small amounts of new arrears have recurred.
Advice: Strengthen tax administration.
Status: GDT has adopted a new IT system and developed a corporate strategy to guide medium- and longterm reforms, including the adoption of modern compliance management principles. VAT refunds have been
streamlined and are now audited on a risk basis. However, staffing and capacity issues persist, and the tax
administration is distracted by multiple reform initiatives.
Advice: Implement pension reform. Reform the existing disability benefit system.
Status: A pension reform was passed in mid-2014. It gradually raises the retirement age, separates social
assistance from social insurance, aligns benefit and contribution ceilings, and indexes pensions to inflation.
The authorities are also reforming disability benefits, with help from the World Bank.
Advice: Implement a reform of local government to address fiscal risks and improve transparency and
accountability.
Status: The authorities are pursuing a fiscal decentralization strategy which involves devolution of certain
functions, transfer of related personnel, and new financing sources for local governments. Following local
elections in mid-2015, a large number of communes and municipalities have been consolidated into 61
units. The authorities are reviewing the legal framework on local public finance, with help from USAID and
the World Bank.
Advice: Improve public debt management.
Status: The authorities have lengthened the maturity structure of public debt, shifted greater weight toward
IFI funding, and successfully rolled over a maturing Eurobond in November 2015.
Advice: Gradually ease monetary policy, while considering risks from unhedged foreign currency exposures
and high NPLs. Remove exchange restrictions and accept the obligations of Article VIII.
Status: The BoA lowered its main policy rate by 175 basis points over 2014–16, to a historical low of
1.25 percent. The exchange rate with the euro has remained very stable. The authorities recently removed
two exchange restrictions and accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4. Albania
maintains an unapproved exchange restriction in the form of outstanding balances on inoperative bilateral
payment agreements. These were in place before Albania became a Fund member in 1991.
Advice: Implement FSAP recommendations to strengthen financial stability.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Box 1. Implementation of the Recommendations from the 2014 Article IV Consultation
(Concluded)
Status: The authorities intensified supervision of systemic banks and now require them to maintain
emergency recovery plans. They also expanded the collateral eligible for ELA to all government securities
and enhanced coordination with overseas supervisors. Banking supervision was strengthened with an
updated supervision manual introducing a new risk assessment system which prioritizes governance and risk
management. However, an asset quality review for the banking system has been delayed.
Advice: Tackle comprehensively and forcefully the large stock of NPLs.
Status: The authorities have adopted a comprehensive strategy which integrates and sequences reforms in
the areas of supervision, enforcement, debt restructuring, and insolvency. However, its implementation is in
its early stages. The NPL ratio has declined from a peak of 25 percent in September 2014 to 18 percent in
December 2015, mostly due to a new regulation requiring mandatory write-offs of loans that have spent
more than three years in the “loss” category.
Advice: Ensure that risks associated with euroization are internalized.
Status: The authorities have introduced higher liquidity requirements for foreign currency deposits. There is
room for further prudential measures as well as improvements in the definition of hedged borrowers.
Advice: Take steps to strengthen nonbank supervision.
Status: The authorities have introduced new regulations on liquidity requirements and asset valuation for
investment funds. Several laws have been amended to strengthen AFSA’s financial and operational
independence. However, the agency is still short of capacity and struggling to attract and retain skilled staff.
Advice: Improve the investment climate, with a particular focus on the legal framework and judicial
effectiveness related to land titling and property rights.
Status: Albania has not made substantial progress in the Doing Business rankings recently. The government
set up a National Investment Council to facilitate dialogue among government and business on how to
improve the business climate. The judicial system continues to lack independence and does not protect
property rights adequately.
Advice: Implement comprehensive electricity sector reform.
Status: The authorities have replaced subsidized prices to low-income consumers with targeted assistance.
They have aggressively lowered distribution losses, repaid arrears to the private sector, increased bill
collections, and strengthened the finances of the state-owned electricity companies. A new power sector law
passed in May 2015 will reform the market structure and will gradually remove commercial users from the
regulated tariff system. The authorities are restructuring the balance sheets of the SOEs in the sector. Further
reforms are needed to improve corporate governance.
Advice: Implement public administration reform.
Status: The authorities passed a new civil service law which provides for merit-based recruitment,
promotion, and dismissal. However, the new law does not cover certain institutions and positions. In
addition, recent amendments have made recruitment and dismissal decisions more vulnerable to
considerations other than merit. The quality of recruitment procedures needs to be significantly improved,
especially in independent institutions. Implementation of the new law at the local level remains a challenge.
Advice: Improve quality of statistics and strengthen INSTAT’s independence.
Status: INSTAT has improved the quality of national accounts and BOP statistics, with help from Fund TA.
However, amendments to the Law on Statistics and an MoU setting up an inter-government data-exchange
scheme have been delayed and are now expected in 2016. High-frequency and labor market indicators need
to be strengthened.

Impact if Realized
Medium
A further drop in oil prices could hurt
fiscal revenues from oil-related royalties
and VAT. The main domestic oil
producer is engaged in a tax dispute
with the government and might scale
back investment and production further.
On the upside, since Albania is a net oil
importer, low prices could boost
domestic consumption and investment.
Low
Gradual monetary tightening by the Fed
could lead to further appreciation of the
dollar against the euro. That could push
up Albania’s public-debt-to-GDP ratio.
Low
An abrupt and disorderly pull-out could
lead to stress in the domestic banking
system and a stagnant supply of credit
to the private sector.

Low
A surge of refugees transiting through
Albania could strain the country’s
infrastructure and public finances.
High

Policy Advice
Implement additional fiscal
measures, as needed, to meet the
end-year primary balance target
for 2016.

Target improvements in public
debt management which would
make the debt stock less sensitive
to fluctuations in the euro-dollar
exchange rate.
The authorities should continue
sharing information with parent
banks and their regulators. They
should also continue
strengthening contingency plans
and closely monitor capital and
liquidity positions. In the event of
a change of ownership, the
authorities should ensure that fitand-proper rules are enforced.
Fiscal targets could be adjusted to
accommodate such a temporary
shock.
Continue to diversify export
markets. Improve the domestic
policy environment to support
growth in domestic consumption
and investment.

Reforms improving the business
environment are key to mediumterm growth prospects, particularly
in regards to NPL resolution, the
judiciary, governance, anticorruption, and property rights.
Failure to advance in these areas
would undermine medium-term
debt sustainability. On the fiscal
front, the authorities should
reduce tax expenditures, improve
revenue administration, and

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Albania’s public debt is sustainable but vulnerabilities remain due to the high levels of debt and
rollover risks. Rollover needs remain sizable but the recent issuance of a five-year Eurobond and the
increase in donor financing have mitigated rollover risks in the near term. The fiscal adjustment
underway since 2014 has helped slow down the pace of debt accumulation, with the public debt-toGDP ratio projected to start declining in 2016. Over the medium term, continued fiscal consolidation
and steadfast implementation of reforms will be crucial to reduce the risks to debt sustainability and
achieve the target of lowering public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2019. The authorities broadly
agreed with this assessment.

A. Background
1.
Albania’s public debt stood at 71.9 percent of GDP at the end of 2015. Public debt,
defined as general government gross financial liabilities, includes public guarantees, both domestic
and external. At end-2015, public debt was mostly domestic (53 percent of the total stock),
medium-to-long term (76 percent), and

denominated in domestic currency
(2015, share of total excl. arrears and guarantees)
(51 percent). Public debt includes guaranteed

domestic arrears and unpaid bills, the share

of the outstanding stock of central

60%
(0.2 percent). Commercial banks hold most
domestic debt, although nonbanks have
quintupled their exposure since 2010 (text figure). The Bank of Albania also holds a substantial
share. Regarding external debt, the share of holdings by private creditors has decreased in 2015
(reaching about 26 percent at end-December), at the expense of a rising share held by multilateral
borrowers (55 percent), with official bilateral creditors maintaining a constant share in the portfolio
(20 percent).
2.
Following a period of rapid growth, the debt accumulation slowed considerably in
2015. High primary deficits and slowing macroeconomic growth led to a rapid increase in public
debt by around 9 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2012. The authorities subsequently abandoned
the debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP in 2012. In 2013, a widening fiscal deficit and the recognition
of a substantial stock of domestic arrears and unpaid bills (about 5 percent of GDP) led to an
increase of the debt-to-GDP ratio by another 8 percentage points. In 2014, the authorities embarked
on a fiscal adjustment strategy and an ambitious reform of the electricity sector, which included
incorporating public support to the sector into public debt statistics. As a result, the pace of debt
accumulation slowed down in 2014–15.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

3.
The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the DSA are in line with the updated
macroeconomic adjustment program. The medium term will see a gradual recovery of real growth
to about 4 percent, supported by a solid implementation of structural reforms, a rebound in
confidence, and higher private investment flows in key sectors (energy and road infrastructure).
Inflation expectations will remain anchored by the central bank’s 3 percent target. After achieving a
consolidation of about 2 percent of GDP in 2014–15,1 fiscal adjustment is expected to continue
under the program. The authorities are targeting a primary surplus beginning in 2016 and an annual
consolidation of around one percentage point of GDP per year over 2016–2019.
4.
The share of external financing is increasing, while average maturity is lengthening.
This reflects mainly efforts to shift from short-term domestic to long-term external sources,
including through increased financing from the IMF and the World Bank.2 Furthermore, the
authorities successfully issued a €450 million Eurobond in November 2015, which rolled over a
maturing €300 million Eurobond. Thus, average weighted maturity has increased slightly and is now
close to two years.

B. Public DSA Results
Baseline
5.
Under the baseline scenario, Albania’s public debt will decline gradually over the
medium term, albeit remaining at elevated levels. The authorities are committed to lowering the
public debt, with the aim of bringing it below 60 percent of GDP by end-2019.3 Even at this level,
debt would continue to pose significant risks because of high rollover needs and a vulnerability to
macroeconomic shocks arising from slow growth, low inflation, and volatility in interest rates and
the terms of trade. In addition, the heavy reliance on the domestic financial sector poses risks given
the systemic link between banks and the sovereign.
6.
Public debt under the baseline scenario is susceptible to a range of risks arising from
the composition of the financing profile. Although the authorities have started lengthening the
maturity profile by increasing long-term external public debt and undertaking debt buybacks,
rollover risks remain high as more than two fifths of central government domestic direct debt was
short-term at the end of 2015 and is expected to decline only gradually over time. Despite a
substantial decline from 2016 onwards, public gross financing needs are projected to remain above
the early warning levels associated with past debt crises. Interest rate risk is expected to increase
with the lengthening of maturities. However, the lack of a liquid secondary market limits somewhat
this effect on valuations. Another mitigating factor includes the increasing share of multilateral
1

As measured by the overall balance excluding arrear clearance. The headline deficit figure for 2014 includes
2.4 percent of GDP in arrears clearance, which is not a debt-creating flow.
2

The IMF program will continue to provide financing until 2017. The World Bank helped the authorities secure a
commercial bank loan of €250 million in August 2015 through a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG).

Under the proposed fiscal rule, the authorities aim for a medium-term debt target of 45 percent of GDP.

ALBANIA

donor financing which lowers the effective interest rate. Finally, exchange rate risk will rise with the
expansion of foreign currency debt, but Albania’s comfortable level of international reserves should
alleviate the risk of a large disorderly devaluation.
7.
The alternative scenarios underscore the risks to the baseline if reforms falter. Key risks
arise from a slower-than-projected fiscal adjustment and growth recovery. Indeed, by 2021, public
debt would still be close to 70 percent of GDP under the scenario based on historical performance
and 60 percent under the constant primary balance scenario.4 In both scenarios, gross financing
needs would exceed 20 percent of GDP in 2021, higher than current levels.
8.
The baseline scenario nevertheless remains realistic. It represents a central forecast
reflecting recent policy performance, the government’s commitments under the program, the
planned reintroduction of a fiscal rule, and realistic assumptions about the medium-term:


Limited validity of the historical and constant primary balance scenarios. The historical
performance of the past 10 years is not representative of the current policy environment. The
current government, which took office in 2013, has engineered a clear break with past policies.
In the past, high growth and easy financing conditions led to a procyclical fiscal stance, which in
turn fueled the accumulation of public debt and domestic arrears. Since 2014, the new
government has successfully embarked on fiscal consolidation and accompanying reforms,
including of fiscal institutions. Given significant risks for macroeconomic stability and uncertain
market access, the authorities remain committed to reducing the public debt (by improving the
primary balance over the medium term) and accelerating growth (by implementing further
structural reforms).



Relatively realistic assumptions. Forecasts for growth, the primary balance, and inflation do not
suffer from a large systematic bias, with forecast errors broadly within the inter-quartile range of
the forecast errors of other countries. The planned fiscal effort is somewhat bigger than what is
typical of other countries’ adjustment experiences, but this also reflects the substantial arrear
clearance, which worsens the overall fiscal balance in 2014–2015.5



GDP forecasts in line with the planned fiscal effort. Medium-term growth projections seem
realistic, given (i) Albania’s relatively low per capita income by regional standards and its
potential for convergence; (ii) high inflows of FDI throughout the period; (iii) the country’s status
as EU accession candidate, which fosters growth-friendly structural reforms; and (iv) the
authorities’ strong record of implementing difficult reforms. The fiscal multiplier assumption is

4

Under the historical scenario, real GDP growth, the primary balance, and real interest rates are set at their historical
average of the past 10 years while other variables are the same as in the baseline. Under the constant primary
balance scenario, the primary balance remains at the 2016 projected level (in percent of GDP), while all other
variables are the same as in the baseline.
5

Consequently, the adjustment of the cyclically adjusted primary balance over the forecasting period looks larger
than it really is.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

consistent with empirical estimates for CESEE countries. The fiscal adjustment is expected to be
largely revenue-based, and empirical estimates of revenue multipliers are typically low. Albania’s
trade openness and high levels of public debt are also consistent with lower fiscal multipliers.

Stress tests
9.
Macroeconomic and fiscal shocks can significantly increase public debt and gross
financing needs relative to the baseline throughout the projection period. Among all stress test
scenarios, Albania shows the highest vulnerability to a combined macro-fiscal shock.6 Under this
scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 74 percent in 2017–2018, before gradually declining to
around 64 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs would be permanently higher relative to the
baseline (by 5 percentage points of GDP in 2021). The second worst-case scenario would be a
growth shock. A negative shock in real GDP growth by one standard deviation in 2017–2018 would
delay reaching the 60 percent of GDP target for public debt by a year.
10.
Fan charts further illustrate the possible evolution of debt over the medium term,
through simulating a large number of shocks to macroeconomic variables.7 These simulations
suggest that under a symmetric distribution, an 80 percent confidence interval for the debt stock in
2021 ranges between 45 and 60 percent of GDP. However, under a restricted distribution (which
precludes a positive shock to the primary balance), debt could be above 60 percent of GDP by 2021
with a probability of more than 20 percent, relative to the baseline scenario of 52 percent of GDP.

C. External Debt Sustainability
11.
The bulk of external debt is public and held by multilateral creditors and development
agencies. External debt in 2015 is estimated to have reached around 40 percent of GDP, out of
which 34 percent of GDP was public debt. Multilateral institutions held slightly more than half of
public external debt, with around half of that being held by the World Bank. The remainder of public
debt is split among bilateral development agencies and governments (about 7 percent of GDP) and
private creditors (about 9 percent of GDP, including the recent Eurobond issuance of €450 million).
External debt service is estimated to have spiked to about 6 percent of GDP in 2015 due to the
amortization of the €300 million Eurobond that matured in November. External public debt is
primarily denominated in either Euros (60 percent) or SDRs (25 percent).
12.
External debt is projected to rise gradually over the medium term, as the public debt
composition shifts from short-term domestic to long-term external sources. External public
borrowing will drive total external debt to peak around 43 percent of GDP in 2017 (with 35 percent
6

Stress tests include shocks to macro variables (real interest rate, real GDP growth, real exchange rate), fiscal
variables (primary balance), and a combination of macro and fiscal variables which incorporates the largest effect of
individual shocks on all variables.

of GDP as public external debt) before gradually declining to 37 percent by 2021. During this period,
external private borrowing is expected to remain contained at 1½ percent of GDP, with the bulk of
private foreign financing coming through foreign direct investment, including for large projects such
as the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the Statkraft/Devoll hydropower project.
13.
Stress tests show that external debt dynamics can significantly worsen in the event of
shocks to the real exchange rate and the current account. Under a 30 percent depreciation
shock, external debt would peak at 63 percent of GDP in 2017 before declining to 54 percent by
2021. However, the real effective exchange rate has been relatively stable over the last several years
and ample reserve buffers mitigate the risk of a steep depreciation. Following a shock to the current
account of half a standard deviation (around 1.5 percent of GDP), external debt would peak at
45 percent of GDP by 2018 and remain near that level.

D. Conclusion
14.
Despite the significant fiscal adjustment since 2014, Albania’s debt remains high and
poses significant risks. As highlighted in red in the standardized heat map, shocks related to
growth, the primary balance, interest rates, and the exchange rate push Albania’s debt and gross
financing needs above relevant benchmarks, providing early warning signs of emerging risks.
Specifically, both under the baseline and various shock scenarios, Albania’s debt exceeds the
70 percent of GDP benchmark and its gross financing needs exceed the 15 percent of GDP
benchmark. The debt profile poses moderate risks (yellow in the heat map), with the exception of
external financing requirements, which raise more concerns (red in the heat map).8 The risks are
mitigated somewhat by the fact that donors hold a significant share of multilateral and bilateral
debt and that the bulk of foreign financing comes through foreign direct investment.
15.
Addressing the risks associated with high debt remains critical for Albania’s
macroeconomic stability. High debt is associated with lower growth and may thwart the weak
economic recovery. High debt also means higher vulnerability to shocks. Finally, high debt is
associated with high rollover requirements, and thus increased vulnerability to sudden shifts in
market perception. To address these risks, the authorities should continue to strengthen debt
management capacity and lengthen debt maturity. Furthermore, continued fiscal consolidation and
steadfast implementation of structural reforms will be crucial to ensure debt sustainability.

8

Following the issuance of the Eurobond, the government reduced short-term public debt in late 2015 by repaying
(rather than rolling over) maturing securities and buying back securities maturing in early 2016. This led to a net
reduction in the share of short-term debt and a green flag in the heat map.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees, defined as domestic and external guarantees for the energy and nonenergy sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over German Bonds, based on the 5-year eurobond issued in November 2015.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ The DSA includes unallocated measures in revenues and expenditures.
6/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
7/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 6 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
8/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 6 as ae(1+r).
9/ Includes guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). It includes also exchange rate changes during the projection period.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
11/ Credit ratings for short-term foreign and local currency sovereign is maintained at "B."

ALBANIA

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
Albania’s exchange rate regime is floating de jure, but the lek/euro rate has remained very stable over
the past 6 years despite limited interventions by the central bank. The external position is moderately
weaker than implied by fundamentals, with a real exchange rate overvaluation estimated at around
10 percent. Reserves are adequate based on metrics for floating regimes.

A. Background
1.
Albania receives large external inflows which have raised foreign liabilities and
reduced its net international investment position (NIIP). The inflows are mainly foreign direct
investment (FDI), remittances, and public external borrowing. These inflows have been persistent
over the last six years and have outpaced the growth in foreign assets. As a result, the NIIP has been
on a downward trajectory and is estimated to have reached -47 percent of GDP in 2015, with
109 percent of GDP in foreign liabilities and 62 percent of GDP in foreign assets, of which around
28 percent of GDP were gross reserves. Foreign liabilities are evenly divided between investment
liabilities and external debt, most of which is public.

Albania’s REER has appreciated marginally
over the last six years while the NEER has been very
stable. The small REER appreciation reflects the positive
inflation differential vis-à-vis trading partners, even
though domestic inflation remains low in Albania due to
weak import prices and the output gap.

The exchange rate against the euro has been very stable over the past six years despite
a wide array of external and domestic shocks. The exchange rate has remained mostly within a

have been constrained by concerns about
movements in the exchange rate, as the large exposure of unhedged borrowers in FX (around 30
percent of private sector credit) raises financial stability risks in the event of significant adjustment in
the exchange rate. Monetary policy has thus sought to maintain yield differentials with euro policy
rates.

5.
This assessment relies on three available tools to assess the exchange rate: i) an
EBA-Lite model that estimates the current account norm from a sample of emerging markets; ii) a
REER model that estimates the equilibrium real exchange rate based on the same sample; and iii) an
external sustainability approach that assess the deviation from the current account norm needed to
stabilize the NIIP.
6.
The analytical tools used here are adapted to Albania’s specifics. They take into account
large unrecorded inflows in the balance of payments and the sizable FDI inflows. Thus, they differ
from those used in the 2014 Article IV Consultation. In particular, in the EBA-Lite model, the
underlying current account is adjusted to include the rather sizable inflows from errors and
omissions. At around 2-3 percent of GDP, these inflows are associated mainly with unrecorded
remittances. The underlying current account also excludes imports financed by FDI inflows over and
above the sample average. Albania’s FDI inflows are around 8–9 percent of GDP, higher than the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

sample average of 4 percent.16 In addition, the CA is adjusted for the one-off positive impact in 2015
(0.5 percent of GDP) from strong rainfall leading to improvements in the electricity trade balance,
due to hydropower.17
7.
In the external sustainability approach, the underlying current account is adjusted for
errors and omissions only. The REER approach is the least adapted to Albania as none of the
adjustments above are feasible under that approach. As a result, the EBA-Lite model provides a
much better fit for changes in Albania’s current account balance over time than the REER model.

C. Results
8.
The analysis below, taken together with the assessment of reserve adequacy in section
D, point to the external position being moderately weaker than implied by fundamentals.

The REER approach points to the exchange rate being broadly in line with fundamentals,
but the model has weak predictive power for Albania. The estimate overvaluation is small at
about 3 percent. However, the model misses all historical turning points in the REER. Also, the
approach cannot be adapted to Albania-specific factors such as the significant and persistent
inflows associated with unrecorded remittances and the substantial FDI over and above the
sample average.

18

The REER-CA elasticity parameter assumption is suggested by IMF Occasional Paper 167 and is identical to the one
used for the External Sector Assessment in the 2014 Article IV Consultation.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
May 10, 2016

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The Extended Arrangement approved by the Executive Board of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in February 2014 remains the anchor of our economic policies. The attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial policies (MEFP) reviews progress in implementing the
program and outlines the policies that the government and the Bank of Albania (BoA) will pursue
over the next twelve months.
2.
Performance under the program has been strong. All end-December, available end-April,
and continuous performance criteria were met, as were most indicative targets. The indicative
targets on contracting non-energy guarantees and the accumulation of new arrears were missed by
small margins. The government is implementing remedial measures and most of the newly
accumulated arrears will be settled by mid-2016. We are currently awaiting data to assess two endApril performance criteria on general government primary modified cash balance and primary
expenditure, and we expect them to be met based on available data.
3.
Most structural benchmarks were implemented, though one was implemented with a delay
as a prior action, and one more is proposed to be rescheduled. Amendments to the Budget Law
incorporating multi-year commitment limits were submitted to Parliament in early May 2016, as a
prior action. The roll-out of the new treasury IT system (AGFIS) to 15 budget institutions was delayed
to end-May 2016, to allow time to train new users of the system. The adoption of an
implementation plan to restructure the tax agency’s headquarters was delayed to May, to allow
sufficient time for fine-tuning the plan.
4.
Our policy priorities over the next twelve months are to continue pursuing fiscal
consolidation, safeguard financial sector stability, revive credit growth, and implement growthenhancing reforms. In particular, we will persist with ambitious reforms in revenue administration,
public financial management, and the electricity sector.
5.
Implementation of our program will be monitored by the Fund through reviews, quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks, as described in the attached

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

ALBANIA

MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). While we are confident that the policies
described in the MEFP are adequate to achieve program objectives, we stand ready to take
additional measures that may be required for this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the
adoption of such measures, as well as in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in this
letter and the MEFP. The government of Albania will provide the IMF with such information as it may
request to monitor progress in economic and financial policy implementation.
6.
In view of the strong program performance to date and the strength of policy commitments
for the period ahead, we request that the Executive Board of the IMF complete the seventh review
under the Extended Arrangement. We further request the purchase of SDR 28.65 million. We request
a waiver of applicability for the two end-April performance criteria on general government primary
modified cash balance and primary expenditure, given the unavailability of data for assessing these.
We also request the modification of performance criteria, as described in Table 1 of the MEFP and in
the TMU.
7.
We wish to make this letter available to the public, along with the attached MEFP and TMU,
as well as the IMF staff report on the seventh review under the Extended Fund Facility. We therefore
authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive Board approval.
These documents will also be posted on the official websites of the Albanian government.
Sincerely,

/s/
Arben Ahmetaj
Minister of Finance

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
This Memorandum lays out the Government of Albania’s policy priorities for the period
ahead, supported by the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility. Our policies seek to generate higher living
standards and better employment opportunities for Albanians. Achieving these goals will require
sustained efforts to reduce debt-related vulnerabilities, revive credit growth, and unlock structural
constraints to medium-term growth.

Recent Economic Developments
2.
Economic growth picked up in 2015, despite significant headwinds. Weak demand in the
Euro Area as well as low international commodity prices reduced export growth, while economic
uncertainties arising from financial turmoil in Greece also weighed on domestic demand. The
resulting broad-based weakness in mining and services was, however, offset by strong hydropower
generation, a pickup in construction and manufacturing, continued arrears clearance, higher tourism
receipts, and stronger domestic and foreign private investment. As a result, real GDP growth
reached 2.6 percent in 2015. However, the economy continues to operate below its potential.
Domestic slack and declining international commodity prices have resulted in very low headline
inflation. CPI inflation fell to 0.3 percent in March 2016, due mostly to one-off supply shocks such as
decreases in food and fuel prices. The current account deficit is expected to have narrowed to
around 11 percent of GDP, given improvements in tourism receipts and higher net electricity exports
that offset the decline in commodity exports.

Outlook
3.
The economic recovery is expected to gather further momentum in 2016, driven by rising
domestic demand. GDP growth is projected to increase to 3.4 percent in 2016, benefiting from
continued strength in hydropower generation and FDI inflows, the lifting of the moratorium on
construction permits, improved consumer confidence, and continued low interest rates. These
effects are expected to offset the drop in domestic oil production and related investment, as well as
the fiscal drag from the end of the central government’s arrears clearance program. Given the
persistent negative output gap and the deflationary impulse from global commodity prices, average
headline inflation for 2016 has been revised downwards from 2.3 to 1.9 percent. However, mediumterm inflation expectations remain anchored by the BoA’s target of 3 percent.
4.
The current account deficit is likely to remain elevated throughout 2016–17. The current
account deficit is projected to widen to around 12½ percent of GDP this year. Imports are projected
to remain high on the back of large infrastructure projects (such as the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and
the Statkraft/Devoll hydropower plant), while low commodity prices are expected to continue
weighing down on exports. After several years of decline, remittances have picked up but are
expected to remain below their pre-crisis peak, given economic uncertainties in Greece and Italy, the
main source countries. The current account will continue to be financed largely by FDI. Over the
medium term, the current account deficit is expected to narrow because of improvements in export

capacity and falling import needs of the major FDI projects. Gross official reserves are expected to
cover around 5½ months of imports of goods and services in 2016–17.

Program Implementation
5.
All December, available end-April, and continuous performance criteria were met, as were
most indicative targets (Table 1). The ceilings on the government’s cash deficit and expenditure were
met with large margins, due to expenditure savings and a non-tax revenue windfall, both of which
offset broad-based weakness in tax revenues. The December ceiling on contracting non-energy
guarantees was missed by a very small margin (0.03 percent of GDP). Going forward, we are
proposing to remove this IT, as non-energy guarantees are now fully captured in our fiscal
framework. The zero ceiling on the accumulation of central government domestic arrears was also
not met. Results from the triannual survey of ten key ministries and the General Directorate of
Taxation (GDT) show a stock of 1.3 billion lek of new arrears at end-December 2015 (0.09 percent of
GDP). The bulk of new arrears was due to road construction projects and court decisions. All
accumulated arrears will be repaid by mid-2016, except for those on court decisions, which will be
settled in accordance with a special Council of Ministers decision. We will also seek rapid
implementation of multi-year commitment limits, and have expedited related amendments to the
Budget Law.
6.
Most structural benchmarks were implemented, though one was implemented with a delay
as a prior action, and one more is proposed to be rescheduled (Table 3a):


In the area of public financial management, the regular report on the accumulation of new
arrears was published on time. The roll-out of the new treasury IT system (AGFIS) to 15 budget
institutions is proposed to be rescheduled to end-May 2016, to allow time to train new users.
Amendments to the Budget Law incorporating multi-year commitment limits were submitted to
Parliament in early May 2016, as a prior action.



In the area of tax administration, the adoption of an implementation plan to restructure the
GDT’s headquarters was delayed to May, to allow sufficient time for fine-tuning the plan.



In the electricity sector, we prepared the regular quarterly survey of the consolidated arrears of
state-owned enterprises in the electricity sector to the private sector. We also published for the
first time the quarterly financial statements of KESh and OShEE, the state-owned generation and
distribution companies.

Economic Policies for 2016
A. Fiscal Policy
7.
We commit to continuing with fiscal consolidation in order to reduce debt-related
vulnerabilities which hamper growth and cause macroeconomic instability. We intend to pursue a
steady pace of fiscal consolidation based on a strategy of broadening the tax base and
strengthening tax administration and compliance, with the goal of lowering the public debt-to-GDP
68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

ratio below 60 percent by 2019, from around 72 percent at end-2015. This path will be consistent
with undertaking measures of at least 1 percent of GDP annually. The recent credit rating upgrade is
a vote of confidence for our fiscal consolidation strategy. To improve debt management, we will also
increase staffing levels and strengthen capacity at MoF’s debt management unit.
8.
We remain committed to achieving our target of a primary surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in
2016. The renewed slide in global oil prices is posing a risk to oil-related royalties, VAT, and customs
collections. To minimize the potential implications of this risk, we have committed to maintaining
strict budgetary discipline, ensuring savings in current expenditure, and strengthening the revenue
base and tax compliance. We commit to taking additional measures, if needed, to meet the 2016
target.
9.
To address the structural roots of revenue underperformance in 2015, we have undertaken
several additional reform measures:


In early September 2015, we launched a large-scale reform effort against tax evasion, noncompliance, and informality. Our reform effort has already yielded a large increase in the
number of registered small businesses and employees. We are refocusing our effort on high-risk
segments, in line with our compliance risk management strategy. We remain prudent in
projecting the revenue gains from our reform effort in 2016. Although we expect them to be
higher, we have limited them in our budget projections to 4 billion lek (0.3 percent of GDP),
from social contributions by newly registered workers. We have also frozen 4 billion lek in capital
expenditure and have made it contingent on additional revenues from our reform effort.



We are addressing weaknesses in revenue forecasting and monitoring. We are enhancing the
coordination among the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the General Directorates of Taxes and
Customs (GDT and GDC). In September 2015, a dedicated revenue unit was established and
commenced operations at MoF. The unit prepared its first survey of tax expenditures for the
2016 budget and will update this survey annually. With help from Fund TA, we will expand the
survey to incorporate exemptions administered by the GDT, and we will broaden the definition
of tax expenditures to include preferential tax rates. The survey will also include a rationale and,
eventually, an efficiency assessment for each tax expenditure.



We commit not to grant any further tax exemptions or preferential tax rates, without consulting
with the IMF. This complements the efforts aimed at broadening the tax base by closing tax
loopholes, simplifying tax administration, and creating a more level playing field.



We have planned sufficient buffers in the budget to cope with the outcome of pending tax
disputes, in order to protect the end-year primary balance target for 2016. In particular, large
unbudgeted windfalls due to disputed tax payments will be adjusted under the program until
the tax dispute is resolved.

10.
We are making good progress in reducing the heavy burden the electricity sector places on
public finances, while addressing the infrastructure gap. The financial gap in the sector reflected

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

mostly low collection levels and large network losses. We have implemented an ambitious set of
reforms in the sector (see ¶27) that have started to reduce the structural imbalances. Therefore, we
aim to limit public guarantees and policy net lending to the sector to 7 billion lek in 2016 and
6.5 billion lek in 2017, with the aim of completely eliminating power sector subsidies by 2020.
Subsidies to the electricity sector are transparently reflected in the fiscal accounts under the
program and in our budget. If government support to the electricity sector exceeds the annual
programmed amount, we commit to taking offsetting fiscal measures to meet the program’s fiscal
targets.
11.

We are addressing other emerging and potential risks to the baseline fiscal framework:



Local government reform: Following local elections in mid-2015, 61 local government units
replaced the previous 373 communes and municipalities. We are pursuing an ambitious fiscal
decentralization strategy, by devolving certain functions, transferring personnel, and providing
new financing sources for local governments. A recent survey commissioned by the Ministry of
State for Local Government took stock of the finances of the new consolidated units as of mid2015, and revealed a potentially significant stock of local government arrears. However, these
arrears remain to be audited. We will require that local governments promptly conduct audits
and prepare action plans by end-September 2015, which will provide for the clearance of the
legacy stock of arrears, out of their own resources, in a comprehensive and transparent way,
with external auditors ensuring the integrity of the process. The dedicated unit at MoF which
continuously monitors the finances of local governments is adequately staffed and will start
preparing quarterly surveys of local government arrears, starting with end-March 2016. With
help from USAID and the World Bank, we are reviewing the legal framework on local public
finance, in order to improve reporting requirements and tighten monitoring.



Capital expenditure: Outstanding unbudgeted investment projects continue to exceed the
government’s ability to absorb them in its Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF). We have
now made public the total cost and sunk cost of each outstanding project. The Ministry of
Economy (MoE) has published a list of all projects that the 2016 budget will support, including
an indicative budget for each project for all three years of the MTBF, in order to signal our
intention to implement only projects included in the list. Going forward, our National Investment
Committee will review all outstanding unbudgeted investment projects. Based on transparent
criteria, which we will prepare by end-May, we will compile a priority ranking for all such projects
and identify projects that will be cancelled by end-September, conditional on a legal review.



Arrears prevention: The process of clearing the pre-2014 stock of central government arrears is
now complete, and our focus is shifting toward prevention. The small amounts of outstanding
pre-2014 arrears will be paid directly by budgetary institutions out of their allocations. We are
reinforcing public financial management to prevent the accumulation of new arrears at all levels
of government. By end-May 2016, we will extend our new treasury IT system (AGFIS) to 15
budget institutions (accounting for 84 percent of the budget) and one local government. We are
also implementing revenue administration reforms and streamlining public investment
management to prevent the recurrence of new arrears (see ¶12 and ¶17).

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA



Public Private Partnerships (PPPs): We are in the process of amending the Budget Law to
strengthen MoF’s role in the ex ante assessment of PPP proposals and their subsequent
monitoring, to integrate PPPs into the budgetary process, and to limit the total stock of PPPs.
We also plan to review our PPP law to strengthen MoF oversight, integrate PPPs into the
broader public investment monitoring framework, and ensure consistency with the amendments
to the Budget Law. To limit fiscal risks from PPPs, we will ensure that they follow international
best practice and that their related fiscal costs and contingent liabilities are transparently
accounted for in the fiscal accounts and debt statistics. Toward that objective, we will empower
INSTAT to review PPP contracts in accordance with ESA and eventually IPSAS. By mid-2016, we
will launch a public register of all active PPP projects and will also publish summaries of all PPP
contracts as well as the contracts themselves (excluding confidential or protected information),
to ensure transparency for the commitments made by the government. All future PPPs will be
subject to a proper feasibility study and value-for-money analysis by the newly established fiscal
risks unit at the MoF. The unit will be fully staffed by end-June 2016. By end-2016, the unit will
start evaluating fiscal risks (including those stemming from all active PPPs and concession
contracts and from local government arrears), propose measures to mitigate them, and provide
risks assessments to be included in budget document submissions to Parliament. Technical
assistance from the Fund and other international partners will continue to help assess our
current legal and regulatory framework and suggest recommendations for improvement.

B. Medium-term Fiscal Structural Reforms
12.
Advancing tax administration reforms is a key policy priority that underpins our fiscal
consolidation strategy. We remain fully committed to implementing the GDT reforms laid out in its
corporate strategy. By end-June 2016, the Large Taxpayer Office will be restructured, with
specialization according to business sectors, and the Risk Management Unit will be fully staffed to
enable it to identify major compliance risks and develop mitigating strategies. The GDT has started
phasing in a modern compliance risk management approach for one major risk cluster, and will
commence another one by end-September 2016, with help from Fund TA. By end-2016, the GDT will
streamline its regional and local office structure, in order to match business needs. The taxpayer
service function will also be upgraded to deliver easy-to-understand and accessible guidance to
taxpayers based on their needs and compliance risks, using a variety of communication channels.
Finally, by end-2017, the GDT will conduct a comprehensive review of its audit function.
13.
We are moving forward with reforms in customs administration. The GDC is working on a
restructuring proposal, which benefited from the recommendations provided by the external
consultant on customs administration. The GDC will accelerate discussions with customs authorities
in neighboring countries to develop real-time intelligence sharing on smuggling risks. It will
upgrade the fiscal stamps system to conform to international “track and trace” standards set out in
the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control. The GDC will put in place more effective measures
to supervise and monitor fuel movements, including through the use of remote GPS-based
surveillance in high-risk areas. To reduce subjectivity in customs assessments, GDC will create a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

ALBANIA

national customs assessment online portal. Finally, GDC will introduce online monitoring of customs
warehouses.
14.
Closer cooperation and information sharing between the GDT and GDC will enhance
revenue administration reform efforts. In particular, the risk management units of the two revenue
agencies have started sharing data and performing joint risk analysis and monitoring. Nevertheless,
the merger of the two departments remains a medium-term objective which will be guided by Fund
TA. Any related decisions will be taken in consultation with IMF staff.
15.
We commit to accelerating the work on a fiscal cadastre, with the goal of introducing a
valuation-based property tax by end-2017. The reform will be undertaken in consultation with Fund
TA. As a first step, we plan to introduce a fiscal cadastre to assess tax for each property by end-2016.
In parallel, we will develop a valuation formula and methodology, and draft the related legislation by
end-September 2016.
16.
In consultation with IMF TA, we are taking steps to shore up the credibility of our MTBF. MoF
will continue to align its budget projections and macro framework with independent external
forecasts, such as those produced by the BoA and international financial institutions. Starting with
the 2016 budget, the MTBF now contains the total approved cost, the sunk cost so far, and
remaining cost beyond the three-year window of the MTBF for all projects. In 2016, MoF will
develop a methodology for distinguishing core allocations from new policy initiatives in the MTBF,
in order to focus attention on the costing of new policies and prevent them from squeezing existing
ones for resources. Starting with the 2017 budget, the MTBF will begin to make that distinction at
the sectoral and program level. We are also working on a fiscal responsibility law, which will provide
for a fiscal rule and a fiscal council.
17.
We are seeking to improve the process for evaluating, selecting, executing, and monitoring
public investment projects. Our top priority is to improve coordination among the various
government bodies sharing responsibility over public investment management. As a first step, we
recently transferred the public investment portfolio from the Ministry of the Economy back to MoF.
To strengthen coordination, we have been training experts in line ministries on the public
investment cycle. We have also compiled a manual that spells out the public investment process, in
order to provide a handy reference to the laws and regulations guiding the process. We will seek to
strengthen the process further, in line with the recommendations from the recent Public Investment
Management Assessment. In particular, we will integrate SOEs and Regional Development Fund
(RDF) projects into our MTBF, the budget cycle, and the public investment monitoring framework.
We will review and streamline project classification to reduce fragmentation. We will fully staff and
operationalize the public investment management unit in MoF, as well as strengthen the appraisal
process for major projects. Finally, we will establish a unique project pipeline for large projects,
based on clear criteria linked to national priorities.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
18.
The BoA remains committed to achieving an average annual CPI inflation of 3 percent over
the medium term under an inflation-targeting framework. Monetary policy will also strive to smooth
out the macroeconomic cycle and to avoid excessive volatility in the financial sector. Inflation
performance will continue to be monitored under the program through an Inflation Consultation
Clause.
19.
Monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future given weak
underlying inflationary pressures. Furthermore, the overall balance of risks is skewed to the
downside due to continued domestic slack and external disinflationary pressures. The monetary
policy transmission mechanism is hampered by high risk aversion in the banking system. We expect
inflation to gradually converge to 3 percent over the medium term, as improved bank balance
sheets and the crowding-in effect from lower domestic public debt strengthen credit flows to the
private sector. There is still space for conventional easing and any decisions on additional measures
will be taken in consultation with IMF staff.
20.
Exchange rate flexibility complements our price stability objective and supports our
operational framework for monetary policy. The exchange rate is determined entirely by market
forces, and the BoA undertakes only small pre-announced interventions in the foreign exchange
market. The BoA will aim to maintain adequate reserve coverage over the medium term. For the
duration of the program, we will not impose or intensify restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, nor impose or modify any multiple currency
practices, nor conclude any bilateral payments agreements that would violate our obligations under
Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Also, we will not impose or intensify import
restrictions for balance of payments reasons. Finally, we will continue with our efforts to resolve the
outstanding balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements.
21.
We will strengthen coordination and information sharing between the BoA and the MoF on
liquidity and debt management. MoF will discuss with BoA in advance any external or domestic debt
operations to ensure orderly market conditions and avoid excessive financial volatility.

D. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
22.
The BoA is maintaining its supervisory vigilance, with a focus on the fastest-growing and
systemically important segments of the banking system. Systemically important banks are now
required to develop and maintain recovery and resolution plans, which are currently being assessed
by the BoA with assistance from the World Bank. Measures adopted earlier to counteract the
slowdown in credit growth, including changes to capital requirements designed to encourage
moderate credit growth and discourage outflows to non-resident entities, have been extended
temporarily. To maintain consistency with international standards and ensure healthy capitalization
in the banking system, we will unwind these measures by the end of 2016, while retaining measures
discouraging bank outflows to non-resident entities, as appropriate. We will work with banks to
ensure a smooth transition during this process The BoA will raise capital requirements on systemic

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

ALBANIA

banks that expand into non-banking activities. The central bank will also strengthen its monitoring
of loans to unhedged borrowers, with the aim of reducing their share in total outstanding credit
from its current elevated levels. If necessary, the BoA will take appropriate macroprudential actions
to further constrain borrowing in foreign currency by unhedged borrowers.
23.
Given delays in external debt issuance caused by financial turmoil in Greece in 2015, the BoA
undertook temporary measures to avoid disruption in the government debt market. In particular,
the central bank reduced the risk weights on Albanian government securities issued in foreign
currency from 100 to 50 percent. The BoA will gradually roll back this measure by 2021 and ensure
that any additional investments by banks in such securities, compared to the levels in December
2015, will be risk-weighted at 100 percent.
24.
We are committed to implement further regulatory and legal reforms to reduce NPLs and
promote sound credit growth. Following the implementation of a regulatory requirement for
mandatory NPL write-offs, NPLs have declined to 18 percent at end-December 2015 from a peak of
25 percent in September 2014. The 2015 strategy to address the NPL issue is now coordinated by
the Ministry of Finance. The strategy integrates and sequences the following reforms in the areas of
supervision, enforcement, debt restructuring, and insolvency:


The BoA has revised the terminology on write-offs, changed the time limit for holding
repossessed collateral on banks’ books, and improved the regulatory framework for NPL sales.



We have prepared an action plan for handling the 35 largest holders of NPLs. In addition, we
submitted to Parliament amendments to the Law on the Registration of Immovable Properties
and we are working on amendments to the Law on Securing Charges, in order to better protect
financial collateral and to increase the legal certainty of security rights over real estate.



By end-June 2016, the BoA will adopt measures to accelerate the reduction of NPLs through the
use of out-of-court debt restructuring, and will also amend regulations to require banks to grant
loans based on companies’ fiscal declarations, starting in January 2018.



Also by end-June 2016, we will set up coordination mechanisms between BoA and GDT to
integrate the tax authority into the collateral execution process. To further facilitate this process,
the BoA will coordinate with the MoF to streamline the tax treatment of NPLs, NPL sales, and
collateral recovered in judicial procedures.



With technical assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, the Ministry of Justice will submit a
new bankruptcy law to Parliament by end-June 2016. It will incorporate best international
practices, simplify the existing framework, allow for expedited approval of reorganization plans,
and protect the economic and governance rights of secured and unsecured creditors.



By end-September 2016, we will submit to Parliament amendments to the Civil Procedure Code
and the Private Bailiffs Law to increase the efficiency of litigation, foreclosure procedures, and
debt collection.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA



Finally, by end-December 2016, we will upgrade the Credit Register (for example, by adding
ongoing legal cases).

25.
AFSA is strengthening its toolbox and capacity to monitor non-bank financial institutions.
The final vacancy on AFSA’s executive board was filled in January 2016 and the full board is now
operational. To build up capacity, AFSA will adopt policies and procedures which will allow it to
attract and retain skilled staff. AFSA is monitoring closely the transition of investment funds to the
new regulatory framework on asset valuation and liquidity adopted in mid-2015. AFSA will assess
carefully all license applications for new investment funds to protect financial stability. Finally, AFSA
will encourage competition among investment fund custodians, and will conduct stress tests and a
crisis preparedness exercise in this market segment.
26.
The BoA is making progress on implementing the recommendations of the 2015 safeguards
monitoring report. The Internal Audit Department will continue to update the Supervisory Council’s
Audit Committee on a semiannual basis on the implementation status of external and internal
auditors’ recommendations, including those related to improving controls over currency operations.
The BoA has prepared its 2015 financial statements in accordance with the IFRS. We have launched
the process of amending the BoA Law, taking into account recommendations from IMF staff, in
order to strengthen the central bank’s institutional and operational independence and improve its
governance and operations.

E. Structural Reforms
27.
We are encouraged by the early results from our efforts to reduce losses and improve
collections in the electricity sector. Distribution losses—unbilled power as a share of total power
entering the distribution system—fell from 45 percent in 2013 to 31 percent in 2015. We are
committed to reducing distribution losses to 14 percent by 2019. We will ensure that budgetary,
non-budgetary, and local government institutions make timely and full payments on their electricity
bills. Further reforms will focus on improving corporate governance, which is key for the
sustainability of the electricity sector. We are moving forward with contracting an advisory services
consultant for the distribution company, and expect the new team to be in place by end-2016. We
have started publishing quarterly financial statements for the generation and distribution
companies, KESh and OShEE, and we will start publishing these for the transmission company OST
as well. The Ministry of Energy and Industry and MoF will strictly monitor KESh and OShEE’s
investment plans and economic performance on a monthly basis to ensure financial discipline and
value for money. Finally, in order to reduce financial risks, we will restructure the overdraft
borrowing by electricity SOEs.

28.
The new power sector law was approved by Parliament in May 2015. It restructures the
relationship among the three public power companies responsible for generation, transmission, and
distribution (KESh, OST, and OShEE) and moves toward further market liberalization, in line with the
EU’s 2009 Electricity Directive. The law sets in place a schedule for moving all medium-voltage
customers out of the regulated tariff structure by end-2017, beginning with 35kV customers by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

ALBANIA

mid-2016 and 20kV customers by end-2016. On completion, the share of deregulated consumption
would increase from 13 to 33 percent of the total energy consumed. Furthermore, we plan to
undertake a review of our current tariff methodology in cooperation with the World Bank, in order
to make tariff adjustments more frequent and automatic. We are also developing a power exchange
and pursuing integration with the electricity markets of neighboring countries.

F. Statistics
29.
INSTAT will continue with its efforts to improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics. By
end-June 2016, we will submit a revised Law on Statistics to Parliament, in order to strengthen
INSTAT’s institutional independence and provide adequate legal support for more effective
cooperation and coordination among INSTAT, MoF, and BoA. By end-2016, the three institutions will
establish a Memorandum of Understanding detailing processes and responsibilities for data sharing,
source data collection, and statistical compilation.

Program Monitoring
30.
We anticipate that the eighth, ninth, and tenth program reviews will take place on or after
July 15, 2016, November 15, 2016, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Each review will require
observance of conditionality for the most recent test date.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the indicators used to monitor
the program, and reflects the understandings between the Albanian authorities and the IMF. The
TMU also defines the associated reporting requirements.
2.
The exchange rates for the purposes of the program are set at lek 140.25 = €1, lek 103.17
= $1, and lek 158.05 = SDR 1. The gold price is set at €920.18 = 1 oz. These were the rates shown on
the Bank of Albania’s website as of November 30, 2013.
3.
For the purpose of the program, the central government includes extra-budgetary funds.
The general government includes the central government, local governments, the Social Security
Institute (SSI), and the Health Insurance Institute (HII).
4.

The fiscal year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31.

Quantitative Performance Criteria
A. Floor on Net International Reserves of the BoA
Definition
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve liabilities of the
Bank of Albania (BoA). Reserve assets are readily available claims of the BoA on nonresidents
denominated in foreign convertible currencies, and held for the purpose of meeting balance of
payments financing needs, intervening in exchange markets, and other purposes. They include BoA
holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, Albania’s reserve position with the IMF, foreign currency cash,
securities, and deposits abroad. Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged,
collateralized, or otherwise encumbered; claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary
gold; assets in nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and
options).
6.
Reserve liabilities are defined as foreign exchange liabilities to residents and nonresidents of
the BoA, irrespective of their maturity. They include: foreign currency reserves of commercial banks
held at the BoA; foreign currency deposits of the government held at the BoA; all credit outstanding
from the IMF that is a liability of the BoA; commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from
derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or interest
payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or official export credit agencies. Reserve assets and
reserve liabilities will both be expressed in euros, at the program exchange rate.

Data will be provided by the BoA to the Fund with a lag of no more than 45 days after the
test date for December test dates. For all other test dates, data should be provided with a lag of no
more than 15 days after the test date.

B. Cumulative Floor on General Government Primary Modified Cash Balance
Definition
8.
The primary modified cash balance of the general government will be measured from the
financing side (below the line) at current exchange rates, based on the template below:
PRIMARY MODIFIED CASH BALANCE = (A) + (B) + (C)
Interest payments (A)
Domestic financing (B)
Privatization receipts (gross)
Domestic net borrowing (using residency criterion)
Central government net direct debt
Central government guarantees (drawings minus repayments)
Local government net direct debt

Variance accrual-cash
Float
Liability to SSI (receipts minus payments)
Others
Foreign financing (C)
Drawings
Long-term loans (all direct debt drawings included in Albania’s official
debt statistics, including loans for the energy sector, even if on-lent)
Budget support loans (drawings)
Guarantees (drawings)
Change of statistical account
Repayments (of direct and guaranteed debt)

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

9.

In determining the primary modified cash balance, the following considerations will apply:1



Domestic borrowing is reported on a net basis and using the residency criterion. It covers bank
loans, securities issued, overdraft accounts, and other debt instruments, less government
deposits.



Principal repayments include only principal paid by the government and not that by the actual
borrower. In case a borrower repays the Ministry of Finance (MoF) at a later point in time,
principal is recorded under “on-loan principal.”



Foreign borrowing is reported on a gross basis and using the residency criterion. It covers
disbursements by international financial institutions, bank loans, securities issued, overdraft
accounts, and other debt instruments.



“Change of statistical account” covers funds disbursed but not yet withdrawn and held by
nonresidents in financial institutions for project-related spending.



“Repayments” refers to all payments to nonresidents related to disbursements or guarantees by
international financial institutions, bank loans, securities, overdraft accounts, and other debt
instruments.

10.
The primary modified cash balance will also include all new issuances of general government
guarantees (excluding rollover) for the energy and non-energy sectors, as well as net policy lending.
11.
Excluded from the calculation of the primary modified cash balance of the general
government are any preliminary payments made to the Albanian Government by Bankers Petroleum
Ltd. in the context of the December 2015 agreement between the two sides regarding a $57 million
tax dispute. These payments will only be considered as revenue, in whole or in part, upon the
conclusion of the dispute resolution process and the domestic legal process.
12.
Included in the calculation of the primary modified cash balance of the general government
are the outstanding amounts on letters of credit and local governments’ savings and carryover.

Reporting
13.
Data will be provided to the Fund, using current exchange rates, with a lag of no more than
60 days after the test date for December test dates. For all other test dates, data should be provided
with a lag of no more than 30 days after the test date.

Adjustors
14.

C. Cumulative Ceiling on General Government Primary Expenditure
Definition
16.
General government primary expenditure covers spending on personnel, operations and
maintenance, subsidies, social insurance outlays, local government expenditures, other current
expenditures (social protection transfers), capital expenditure, reserve and contingency funds, and
net lending, as reported in the government’s monthly budget outturns. It is measured on a cash
basis and excludes interest payments.
17.
Included in the calculation of general government primary expenditure are the outstanding
amounts on letters of credit and local governments’ savings and carryover.

Reporting
18.
Data will be provided to the Fund, using current exchange rates, with a lag of no more than
60 days after the test date for December test dates. For all other test dates, data should be provided
with a lag of no more than 30 days after the test date.

Adjustors

20.

The ceiling on primary expenditure of the general government will be adjusted upward by:



50 percent of privatization receipts, up to total privatization receipts of lek 15 billion in a given
year.



the excess of total non-grant revenues (both tax and non-tax) over programmed amounts, up to
a maximum of lek 4 billion in 2016. Excluded from the calculation of total non-grant revenues
are any preliminary payments made to the Albanian Government by Bankers Petroleum Ltd. in
the context of the December 2015 agreement between the two sides regarding a $57 million tax
dispute. These payments will only be considered as revenue, in whole or in part, upon the
conclusion of the dispute resolution process and the domestic legal process.



the excess of project grants over the programmed amount.

D. Cumulative Ceiling on the Increase of Bank of Albania Credit to the
General Government
Definition
21.
Credit of the central bank to the general government is defined as outstanding claims of the
BoA on the general government, including overdrafts, direct credit, and holdings of government
securities (excluding repo operations), advance distribution of profits, and other technical
receivables. For the purpose of this target, government securities will be valued at their original
purchase price. The stock of central bank credit to the government amounted to lek 63.965 billion at
the end of December 2013. The cumulative ceiling will be computed relative to that amount.

Reporting
22.
Data will be provided by the BoA to the Fund on a monthly basis with a lag of no more than
fifteen days.

Continuous Performance Criteria
E. Accumulation of New External Payment Arrears by the General
Government
Definition
23.
External debt is determined according to the residency criterion. The term “debt”2 will be
understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time. These payments will discharge the principal and/or interest

2

As defined in point 8 of the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements, adopted by Decision
No. 15688.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

ALBANIA

liabilities incurred under the contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:


loans, defined as advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);



suppliers’ credits, defined as contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and



leases, defined as arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified periods of time that are usually shorter than the total expected
service life of the property. For the purpose of the program, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property.

24.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes
debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
25.
Under the definition of debt set out above, external payments arrears consist of arrears of
external debt obligations (principal and interest) falling due after the due date and grace period, as
specified in the contract, has passed. Arrears resulting from nonpayment of debt service for which a
clearance framework has been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded
from this definition.
26.
The external arrears of the general government will be calculated based on the schedule of
external payments obligations reported by the MoF. Data on external arrears will be reconciled with
the relevant creditors, and any necessary adjustments will be incorporated in these targets as they
occur.
27.
This performance criterion does not cover arrears on trade credits and will apply on a
continuous basis.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Reporting
28.
The MoF will provide the final data on the external arrears of the general government to the
Fund, with a lag of no more than two weeks after the end of each month.

Inflation Consultation

29.
The triannual consultation bands apply to the 12-month rate of inflation in consumer prices
as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the INSTAT. Should the
observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation (4-month average) fall outside the outer bands, the
authorities will complete a consultation with the IMF on their proposed policy response before
requesting further purchases under the program. In addition, the BoA will conduct discussions with
IMF staff should the observed year-on-year rate of CPI inflation (4-month average) fall outside the
inner bands specified for each trimester.

Indicative Targets
F. Ceiling on Subsidies to the Energy Sector
Definition
30.
Subsidies to the energy sector are defined as new guarantees issued by the general
government for the benefit of the electricity operators KESH, OST, and OSHEE, excluding rollover.

Reporting
31.
Data will be provided to the Fund by the MoF on a monthly basis with a lag of no more than
thirty days.

G. Ceiling on Average Distribution Losses by OSHEE
Definition
32.
Average distribution losses are defined as the difference between total electricity entering
the distribution system and the amount of electricity billed to consumers by OSHEE, the energy
distribution company, as a share of the total amount of electricity entering the distribution system.
These are measured on a cumulative basis for each calendar year.

Reporting
33.
Data will be provided to the Fund by the Ministry of Energy on a monthly basis with a lag of
no more than thirty days.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

ALBANIA

H. Ceiling on Accumulation of Central Government Domestic Arrears
Definition
34.
Central government domestic arrears consist of domestic expenditure arrears of the central
government and domestic tax refund arrears. Domestic expenditure arrears are defined as payments
to residents determined by contractual agreements that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date
specified by the contract, or, in the absence of a contractual definition, as determined by law.
35.
Domestic tax refund arrears are defined as obligations on any valid tax refund claims, in
accordance with tax legislation, that remain unpaid 60 days after the claim is submitted.
36.
For the purpose of this target, the accumulation of domestic arrears will be monitored
through MoF’s triannual survey on arrears accumulation (see paragraph 38 below). The recording of
invoices and tax refund claims should be cumulative, that is, the recording in each trimester should
include all invoices/refund claims that have not been paid from the previous trimesters, starting
from the beginning of 2014. MoF should verify that the invoices/refund claims reported in the
survey are not already included in the arrears clearance database under the Arrears Prevention and
Clearance Strategy (APCS).

Reporting
37.
MoF should send to the Fund the consolidated data from the survey with a lag of no more
than 75 days after each trimester.

Structural Benchmarks
38.

Safeguards Assessments. A safeguards assessment update of the Bank of Albania (BoA) was
completed in June 2014. It noted that while the bank had strengthened its external and internal
audit and financial reporting functions, the absence of an effective Audit Committee to oversee
these functions and exercise control posed risks. Such risks were further exacerbated following the
dismissal of the Governor and the Inspector General in the fall of 2014 for dereliction of duty in the
wake of a vault theft scandal. Since then, the BoA has taken measures to implement safeguards
recommendations, including establishing an Audit Committee governed by a charter aligned with
international best practice, as well as engaging an external expert to assist it. In addition, the internal
audit function resumed operations with the appointment of a new Inspector General, and the 2015
financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The authorities are also taking preliminary steps to align the BoA Law with modern central
banking legislation.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating
exchange rate system. The de jure exchange rate system is classified as free floating, but the de facto
exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the monetary authorities occasionally intervening in the
foreign exchange market in order to accumulate reserves and avoid excessive disruptions in the
functioning of the market. On February 21, 2015, the authorities removed two exchange restrictions
and accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4. Albania maintains an unapproved
exchange restriction in the form of outstanding debit balances on inoperative bilateral payment
agreements. These were in place before Albania became a Fund member in 1991, and relate
primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible currencies. The exchange rate stood
at lek 126.59 per U.S. dollar on February 29, 2016.
Article IV Consultation: The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded on February 28, 2014
(IMF Country Report No. 14/78).
FSAP Participation and ROSCs: The most recent FSAP was carried out in November 2013 (with a
Board date of February 28, 2014). A data module ROSC was published on the Fund’s website in
June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in June 2003. Albania participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), and a complete set of GDDS metadata for the external, financial,
fiscal, and real sectors, as well as for the socio-demographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment
using the Data Quality Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006. A ROSC for assessing
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and
Special Recommendations on Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) was conducted in
November 2010 and the report was published in July 2011.
Technical Assistance: The Fund, other multilateral organizations, and donors have provided
extensive technical assistance for institutional development in Albania. The Fund has sent multiple
technical assistance missions to Albania every year since 1991. The extent and focus of Fund TA
since FY 2011 is briefly summarized below.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
1.
The Republic of Albania has been a member of the World Bank Group (WBG) since
1991. Since then, the WBG has provided strong support to Albania, including 87 IDA, IBRD, and GEF
projects in different sectors totaling US$2.06 billion; IFC investments totaling US$406 million; and
MIGA guarantees totaling US$8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to
improve, with an increasing focus on long-term capacity development and implementation through
government structures.
2.
The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) for 2007-2013 outlined
the Government’s economic and social development program. The strategic goals of the NSDI
were: (i) integration into the European Union (EU); (ii) strengthening democratic institutions and the
rule of law; and (iii) achieving rapid and sustainable economic and social development. The
authorities have made progress towards their NSDI goals. First, Albania gained EU candidate status
in 2014. Second, Albania maintained GDP growth throughout the global financial crisis, while
poverty continued to decline. However, the business climate still faces important challenges:
Albania’s overall ranking in the World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business Indicators declined to the
97th position.
3.
The authorities are in the process of finalizing the National Strategy for Development
and Integration (NSDI) for 2014–2020. The current draft, which is undergoing a consultative
process, has three main pillars: (i) to prepare Albania to become a full member of the EU; (ii) to
foster strong and sustained economic growth; and (iii) to transform growth into improved
well-being for all citizens in a fair and cohesive society. These broad goals are to be advanced
through measures in four key areas: (i) governance, democracy, and the rule of law; (ii) fiscal
discipline and increased competitiveness; (iii) sustainable growth through efficient use of resources;
and (iv) investing in people and social cohesion.
4.
The current WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2015–19 supports the
Government’s National Strategy for Development and Integration by focusing on three main
areas: (i) restoring macroeconomic balance; (ii) creating conditions for accelerated private sector
growth; and (iii) strengthening public sector management and service delivery. The CPF activities
under each of the three focus areas will be underpinned by two cross cutting themes: gender equity
and the EU accession process as a long-term policy anchor. The CPF focuses on accelerating the
implementation of the ongoing program while selectively introducing new IBRD lending in strategic
areas, increasing IFC financing for the private sector to US$150–250 million, strengthening
partnerships with other IFIs and donors, and expanding its knowledge program through regional
and national activities. IBRD indicative financing up to US$1.2 billion is proposed in support of the
FY2015–FY2019 CPF program, with significant frontloading.
5.
The current portfolio of US$544 million includes nine projects. It is a young portfolio,
with six projects approved in the past two years. Implementation is affected by chronic public sector
weaknesses, including procurement issues. This has led to a slowdown in project implementation,

with a very low disbursement ratio of 9 percent in FY2015 and about 7 percent during FY2016. There
have been high-level portfolio reviews during FY2016; the last one took place at the end of
February 2016 and was chaired by the Prime Minister. An acceleration in project implementation is
anticipated given recent progress in completing procurement actions for large projects.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ALBANIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of February 29, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The main obstacles are
in real sector statistics.
National accounts: The weaknesses in national accounts are mainly due to poor source data. While technical
assistance has been provided on methodological procedures and basic data sources, source data still do not
provide sufficient information to compile reliable estimates. High dependence on administrative and tax data
undermines the estimates. The long lag in handling certain source data (e.g., the Structural Business Survey) also
hampers the timeliness of annual GDP publication, which currently takes place around 13 months after year-end.
National accounts have been harmonized with ESA 2010. An important enhancement has been the publication of
quarterly GDP―including on the demand side―since July 2015. Quarterly GDP is published with a lag of over
90 days, using the so-called indirect method based on selected indicators and statistical assumptions. Due to
differences in compilation methods, there are discrepancies between the aggregated quarterly estimates and the
annual ones. In addition, frequent methodological changes combined with limited backcasting constrain the
reliability of national account time series. Due to severe resource constraints at INSTAT, improvement in the
national accounts has been relatively slow.
Labor statistics: The Labor Force Survey (LFS) is of insufficient quality. Remote areas are undersurveyed, due to
resource constraints. The treatment of agricultural employment needs to improve, as currently all individuals that
own agricultural land are considered self-employed by the survey. Various short-comings in the LFS lead to
unreliable measures of employment and wages. Poverty data are available with a substantial lag compared to
other CESEE countries.
Price statistics: Compilation generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent within
the CPI was improved in 2003. In December 2015, INSTAT updated the CPI weights using the results of a new
national Household Budget Survey conducted during 2014. The PPI and construction price indexes are published
on a quarterly basis due to resource constraints.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal source data are adequate to allow a broad presentation of the Albanian
general government’s fiscal operations in line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001.
Transitioning to the GFSM 2001 fiscal presentation does not appear to substantially change the overall picture
(Table 1). However, the transition also requires further improvements in fiscal statistics. In particular, Albania would
need to: (i) provide greater details on some items (such as National Taxes, Income of Budgetary Institutions,
Property Compensation, and Compensation for Electricity); (ii) report transactions of Albania’s local governments
in a separate statement; (iii) break down Net Acquisition of Nonfinancial Assets (labeled as Capital Expenditure in
the local presentation) into the GFSM 2001 subcategories (i.e., fixed assets, inventories, valuables, and
nonproduced assets); and (iv) split the financing section into net acquisition of financial assets and net acquisition
of liabilities (and their respective instruments).

Monetary statistics: The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. The survey of depository corporations covers the Bank
of Albania (BoA) and all the other deposit-taking institutions (commercial banks and savings and loans
associations, or SLAs). The accounts of the SLAs, with the exception of loans, are produced on a cash basis, which
contrasts with the MFSM’s recommendation of accrual accounting. Another deviation from the MFSM’s
methodology is that the BoA’s and commercial banks’ holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded
at book value.
External sector statistics: Balance of Payments data are compiled by the BoA with a time lag of less than 90 days
and is methodologically sound, though some of the estimates (particularly for international transactions outside
the banking system) need to be refined. Problems remain in the areas of service transactions and remittances, and
in the monitoring of financial account transactions, private external debt, and foreign assistance (data on grants
from abroad not channeled through the central government are fragmented and require consolidation).
The estimation methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances, investment transactions
by nonresident Albanians, and travel exports and imports) require further improvement. These are considered the
primary drivers of persistently high errors and omissions.
The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external public debt (including commitments
of state-owned enterprises). The collection of data on external grants is not timely and only covers the central
government. Improving grant coverage requires closer collaboration between the Donor Coordination Unit in the
Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance, and the Bank of Albania.
The International Investment Position (IIP) data are compiled annually by the BoA and published nine months after
year-end.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Albania participates in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION, SEVENTH REVIEW UNDER THE
EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT, AND REQUEST FOR
WAIVER OF APPLICABILITY AND MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION
Prepared By

European Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on May 13, 2016. The information
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Recent macroeconomic data point to robust economic growth, consistent with
projections in the staff report. GDP growth in 2015 came in at 2.6 percent, as
expected, driven by a gradual improvement in domestic demand. High-frequency
indicators such as credit to private sector, non-oil imports, and tax revenues suggest
continued recovery in 2016:Q1. However, goods exports have been falling, dragged by
sluggish performance in the oil and mining sector as a consequence of weak global
commodity prices. The NPL ratio increased from 18.2 percent at end-2015 to
19.3 percent in 2016:Q1, due to one-off factors related to two large bankruptcies.
Average headline inflation for the first four months was 0.6 percent, below the
lower outer band of the Inflation Consultation Clause (1 percent). The unexpectedly
low inflation is the result primarily of supply shocks stemming from imported food and
fuel prices which are affecting domestic prices with a lag. Core inflation also declined,
reflecting predominantly the negative contribution of processed foods. The
disinflationary pressure appears to be at least partly transitory, as global commodity
prices have started to recover. Furthermore, the base effect due to floods that led to
high domestic food price inflation in 2015:Q1 is also expected to gradually dissipate in
the near future. In line with the Inflation Consultation Clause, the Bank of Albania has
provided a letter (attached) explaining the reasons behind the drop in inflation, the
corrective measures that the BoA is undertaking (two interest rate cuts of a cumulative
50 basis points in April and May), and their projected impact. The policy rate cuts aim to

ALBANIA

anchor inflation expectations, in order to preempt any second-round effects on prices,
while also supporting the recovery in domestic demand. An updated table is also
attached.
On the basis of the authorities’ letter and related policy discussions, staff supports
the completion of the inflation consultation and the Seventh Review under the
Extended Arrangement.

Inflation Consultation Letter
May 13, 2016

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Annual CPI inflation in Albania declined to an average rate of 0.6 percent during the
first four months of 2016. This decline brings our CPI inflation below the lower outer
band of the Inflation Consultation Clause which is part of the conditionality agreed to
monitor Albania’s performance under the IMF Extended Arrangement.
As the Governor of the Bank of Albania, I am writing to brief you about the reasons
behind the unexpected drop in inflation, the corrective measures that the Bank of
Albania is undertaking, as well as their expected impact over the short to medium
term.
1. Reasons behind the recent inflation performance
CPI inflation has been undershooting our 3 percent target for some time now. This
performance reflects prevailing slack in the economy and disinflationary pressures
from external markets. In order to deliver on its price stability mandate, the Bank of
Albania has been engaged in an aggressive course of monetary easing over the past
few years. This monetary stimulus is delivered through policy rate cuts, liquidity
injections, and conditional forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy.
Its effects are being gradually transmitted to the broader economy, though risk
aversion in the private sector remains high and the international environment
remains challenging.
The rapid drop in inflation during the first four months of 2016 appears to be driven
by supply-side shocks. The disinflationary pressure comes from the drop in global
food and oil prices, which are transmitted with a lag and account for more than ¾ of
the decline in inflation. The rest is explained by base effects, stemming from the high
domestic food price inflation prevailing over the same period of last year, on account
of flooding.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

By and large, the decline in food and oil prices in Albania appears to reflect
developments in international markets. Similar declines in inflation are taking place
both globally and regionally. Annual CPI inflation in the Euro Area was near zero
during the first quarter of 2016. Inflation in other Western Balkan countries averaged
0.1 percent (on an annual basis) during the same period.
We expect these supply-side shocks to be transitory and their impact on inflation in
Albania and the deviation below the lower outer band under the Inflation
Consultation Clause to be temporary. Both forecasts and market-based indicators
point to a gradual stabilization of both food and oil prices in international markets.
Therefore, the adverse effect on inflation is expected to be confined to early 2016.
2. Corrective measures taken by the Bank of Albania
The Bank of Albania reacted promptly to the emergence of these downside risks to
our price stability objective, via a further easing of the monetary policy stance. The
Supervisory Council lowered the policy rate by a combined 50 basis points during its
meetings in April and May. The policy rate now stands at a record low of
1.25 percent. We also signaled our strong commitment to price stability and
expressed our expansionary bias for monetary policy.
While the recent drop in inflation has left our medium-term projections largely
unchanged, the Bank of Albania reacted decisively to these downside risks to price
stability. By increasing monetary policy stimulus, we aim to create better financing
conditions in order to support domestic demand and aid economic recovery. A
stronger domestic environment will help counteract disinflationary pressures from
external markets. At the same time, our determined action aims to anchor
medium-term inflation expectations, thus preempting the emergence of secondround effects on wages and prices.
3. Expected impact and medium-term projections
The pass-through of the lower policy rates to government bond yields and to
banking rates has been effective. Our banking system remains profitable, well
capitalized, and highly liquid. Determined action to tackle high NPLs in the banking
system – undertaken as part of a joint project between the Bank of Albania and the
Albanian Government – is expected to yield further improvements in lending
standards. Overall, we expect financing conditions in the economy to improve
materially throughout the 2016-2018 period.
Based on our forecasts, we expect a pick-up in inflation in the second half of 2016
and a gradual convergence towards our 3 percent target by the second half of 2018.
Improved financing conditions, coupled with ongoing structural reforms and a higher

risk appetite among real and financial market agents, will contribute to a sustained
recovery in domestic demand. At the same time, we expect the external environment
to improve during the second half of the forecast horizon, while inflation
expectations will remain anchored to our target.
Overall, we remain confident the recent monetary policy stimulus will be sufficient to
reach the 3 percent inflation target over the medium term. However, we are aware
that risks to price stability remain skewed on the downside, given uncertainties
regarding the strength of the domestic recovery and persistent headwinds from the
Euro Area.
For these reasons, the Bank of Albania stands ready to act further with the policy
tools at its disposal, if needed, for the pursuit of its price stability objective.
Sincerely,

Statement by Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for Albania
and Paolo Di Lorenzo, Advisor to Executive Director
May 27, 2016

On behalf of our Albanian authorities, we wish to thank the mission team for the constructive
discussions and the valuable and tailored advice in the Report and Selected Issues Paper. As a
result of strong program ownership, all performance criteria were met and the structural reform
agenda remains on track. The authorities broadly concur with staff’s analysis and policy
recommendations and their views have been duly reported. Some specific comments are offered
for emphasis.
The Albanian economy is proving its resilience in a challenging context.
Economy growth has accelerated from 2 percent to 2.6 percent in 2015. Sustained
performance reflects high investment activity, including in the construction sector, as well as an
improved trade balance, outweighing the large drop in government consumption and the
consequences of low oil prices on exports. Leading indicators of domestic demand point to a
steady pace of recovery also in the first quarter of 2016. The authorities project economic growth
to reach 3.4 percent in 2016 and to accelerate gradually in subsequent years, supported by higher
domestic demand, an expected improvement of the external financial and economic
environment, and the impact of business-friendly structural reforms.
Regarding the composition of demand, private consumption is set to recover thanks to lower
precautionary saving by households, lower fuel prices, and a projected steady increase in
employment and wages. This said, unemployment remains high especially among the young and
women, contributing to depressing long term growth. Private investment is also rising, both in
absolute terms and as a share of GDP. On the external side, continued FDI inflows as well as
tapping of the international markets to finance the budget deficit resulted in a 27.4% annual
increase of the FX reserves of the Bank of Albania. As a result, the reserves cover over seven
months of imports, which is well above the minimum of four months of import floor requested
by the central bank.
In the fiscal area, tax collection gathered momentum in the first quarter of 2016.
Tax collection increased by over 13 percent in the first four months of the year compared
to the same period in 2015. As a result, and together with the effect of tight expenditure control
across all levels of government, the primary balance in cash terms turned positive, with an
improvement of around 1.3 percentage points of GDP. This trend is providing buffers large
enough to cope with any negative outcome of pending tax disputes. Regarding debt dynamics,
after rising by 16.5 percentage points of GDP from 2008 to 2014 (below average of the SEE

countries), in 2015 the debt-to-GDP ratio has basically stabilized. 2.2 billion (around 0.15
percent of GDP) of additional revenue generated by the recent privatization of the insurance
company INSIG will contribute to lowering public debt. Lowering the debt ratio below 60
percent is one of the government's key economic policy goals.
Remaining vulnerabilities require adequate action in line with program conditionality.
Sustained action in broadening tax basis and reducing informality in the economy is yielding
positive results in terms of business and employees registration, and the newly merged
tax/customs risk unit is working well. The organizational reform of the tax administration
(postponed to end-June in order to ensure an effective implementation) will be adopted along the
lines suggested by the Fund’s TA missions, including the restructuring of the Large Taxpayer
Office and the adoption of a modern risk management approach, paving the way to targeted
audits on high value firms and sectors with higher non compliance risks.
A strong fiscal framework is critical for sound fiscal accounts. Key steps have been
undertaken in strengthening the medium term budgetary framework. Amendments to the Budget
Law to incorporate multi-year commitment limits have been submitted to Parliament as required
by program conditionality. Building on the achievements in reducing liabilities from the energy
sector and in clearing central governments arrears, the focus is now on mitigating fiscal risks
stemming from PPPs or poor investment management. This should also benefit from a number of
TA missions from FAD. The authorities consider PPPs an important policy tool for specific
policy goals. However, several initiatives have been recently put in place with the aim of
monitoring and limiting PPP related fiscal risks; an evaluation unit at the MoF will be shortly
operational and entitled in evaluating new PPP proposals, recommending measures to mitigate
risks and to ensure the delivering of adequate value-for-money. Finally, the authorities are
committed to strengthen the information on the amount of local governments' arrears and to
address this issue in a comprehensive and transparent approach.
Monetary conditions are supporting the economic cycle.
The Bank of Albania is acting to fulfill its price stability mandate. The key interest rate has
been lowered by 50 basis points in 2016. Moreover, the rate corridor has been narrowed to 2
percentage points. These decisions will support the ongoing economic recovery and the
effectiveness of the transmission mechanisms. With the economy gradually returning to
equilibrium during 2017, CPI inflation is expected to reach its target around the end of 2018.
Bank of Albania has clearly communicated via its forward guidance that monetary conditions
will remain accommodative throughout 2016 and any future tightening in 2017 will be
conditional on the strength of the economic recovery. Lower government should also help
improve the pass-through of monetary policy.

Credit recovery should benefit from favorable financial conditions and forthcoming
legislative initiatives. Targeted macroprudential measures are facilitating a system-wide
reduction in NPLs. The provision rate is in line with regional peers. Despite a resilient banking
system, underpinned by adequate capitalization and ample liquidity, risk aversion has so far
prevented translating accommodative monetary conditions in steady credit growth. However,
excluding the effect of the loan write off from banks balance sheets, credit to the private sector
has given some signals of recovery in the first quarter, with a yearly growth of 2.6 percentage
points. The success of the road map agreed with the Fund for the reduction in non-performing
loans will contribute to lowering perceived credit risk. By end-June, the reform of the bankruptcy
law will be submitted to Parliament and measures to accelerate the reduction of NPLs through
out-of-court procedures of debt restructuring will be adopted.
Finally, the absence of financial contagion from last summer’s events shows to what extent the
supervision framework has strongly benefited from policies and practices deployed also in
response to the FSAP recommendations. This framework will be further strengthened by the rise
in capital requirements on systemic banks that expand into non-banking activities. The central
bank will also devote increasing efforts to monitoring loans to unhedged borrowers. Temporary
measures adopted earlier to counteract the slowdown in credit growth will be unwind by the end
of 2016.
Structural reforms aimed at building a competitive and modern economic system are
advancing well.
Despite recent successful reform efforts, structural vulnerabilities have slowed down
economic convergence. Well aware of this, the Albanian authorities will continue to concentrate
on all-encompassing structural reforms, consistently with the achievements of the fiscal targets.
Judicial reform, integration of the young and women into the labor market and a more efficient
and diversified energy sector are the key drivers of the country's economic and social
development.
The long awaited judicial reform is in the final stages of Parliamentary negotiation. The
authorities are boosting efforts to win resistances from vested interests and have approved by the
summer the constitutional amendments necessary for the reform. Once finalized, it will address
the request from international stakeholders (included the Fund and the EU) to grant
independence to the Courts, and ensure adequate property rights’ protection. A new law on
higher education and scientific research was adopted in 2015 and the accompanying
implementing laws are to follow in 2016. It establishes two agencies for scientific research and
higher education funding. Albania plans to address skills-mismatches and to improve the VET
system through the introduction of a dual education model.

The construction of the major gas pipeline TAP has just been launched some days ago. The
feasibility study for the project of gasification system connected with TAP is expected to be
presented by October. Fiscal risks linked to the energy sector have considerably declined. In
2015 the SOE energy producer KESH has been able to pay its current and outstanding tax
obligations and to cover energy imports with its own resources. Defaults hours have been
reduced by two thirds between 2013 and 2015; further improvements in efficiency in generation
are expected from self-financed investments amounting to 1.3 billion. The removal of 35kV
medium-voltage consumers from regulated tariff system is within reach and the collection rate
from budgetary institutions is close to 100 percent. Investments in the core transport network has
been prioritized by the creation of a Single Sector Project Pipeline which includes national
priority projects aimed at improving connectivity within the country and with neighboring
countries. The lifting of the moratorium on construction will eliminate the main factor explaining
the huge drop in 2015 World Bank Doing Business index. A National Business Centre has been
established to streamline business registration and licensing through a single stop shop.
Concluding remarks
The Albanian authorities confirm their commitment to sound macroeconomic policies in line
with their Fund-supported program which remains key to long-term sustainable growth and
reform agenda.
