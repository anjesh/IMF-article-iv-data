The 2005 Article IV Consultations and Sixth Review under the PRGF
arrangement were held in Praia on March 8–23, 2005. Staff representatives
were Mr. MacFarlan (head), Ms. Loukoianova, Ms. Karpowicz, Mr. Segura, and
Ms. Carvalho (all AFR). The mission met with Prime Minister José Maria Neves,
Minister of Finance and Planning João Serra, Bank of Cape Verde Governor
Carlos Augusto de Burgo, officials, parliamentarians, representatives of the
business and diplomatic communities, and trade unions.

•

In concluding the last Article IV consultations on December 6, 2002, Directors
commended the authorities for stabilizing the macroeconomic policy framework.
They noted in particular the substantial reduction of the fiscal deficit, increase in
international reserves, and maintenance of exchange rate stability and low
inflation. In addition to ensuring ongoing macroeconomic stability, Directors
encouraged the authorities to implement structural reforms that would help
diversify the economy, remove barriers to economic growth, and enhance the
competitiveness of exports.

•

Economic and policy performance over recent years has remained strong. In
2004, the fiscal deficit was smaller than expected and all end-year quantitative
performance criteria, including the accumulation of international reserves, were
met with a substantial margin.

•

Upon completion of the sixth review, the final disbursement of SDR 1.26 million
from the PRGF arrangement would become available. Directors approved this
arrangement on April 10, 2002, in the amount of SDR 8.64 million (90 percent of
quota). The fifth review was completed on January 31, 2005, at which time the
arrangement was extended to July 31, 2005.

-5EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance has been strong during the current
PRGF arrangement, helping the country correct the macroeconomic imbalances that
followed the 2000 elections. Growth appears robust, inflation is low, the exchange rate peg—
backed by a substantial level of international reserves—is credible, and the public debt
burden has declined.

•

Macroeconomic developments remained sound in 2004. The fiscal deficit was lower than
expected, and reserve accumulation exceeded the programmed level. All end-year
quantitative performance criteria under the PRGF-supported program were met with a
substantial margin, and most structural objectives were also met. A structural performance
criterion on finalizing a mechanism for adjusting electricity and water tariffs was missed,
however. The staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for nonobservance of this
criterion, in view of the corrective actions taken to prepare the mechanism.

•

The economic outlook for 2005 and beyond is promising. With continued sound
macroeconomic policies and further structural reforms, the growth rates of 6 to 7 percent
envisaged in the recently-completed PRSP appear achievable. Driving this outlook is
increasing private investment in the tourism sector and public investment in infrastructure.
Noting, however, the vulnerabilities posed by the country’s narrow export base, capacity
constraints, and exogenous shocks, the staff emphasized the need for ongoing
macroeconomic stability and reforms to support diversification of the economy. Settling the
long-standing dispute with Electra, the electricity and water company, remains a priority to
reduce fiscal risks and meet growing energy demands.

•

Cape Verde appears well-positioned to attract increasing external support, and there is also
scope to mobilize greater domestic resources. In this regard, improvements in tax
administration and rationalization of exemptions would enhance improvements to the revenue
base that have come about with the new VAT. Strengthening the prioritization of spending,
including through a medium-term expenditure framework, would allow the authorities to
address PRSP priorities while restraining overall recurrent spending.

•

The staff agreed with the authorities that the exchange rate peg has served the country
well, and that price stability and accumulation of international reserves should remain the
primary objectives of monetary policy. To support stability in and development of the
relatively shallow financial sector, the staff supported the authorities’ plans to strengthen
bank supervision and introduce new indirect monetary policy instruments to improve
liquidity management.

•

The staff shares the authorities’ assessment that results under the PRGF-supported program
have been substantially better than initially expected. The government has requested that
negotiations begin shortly on a new program under the PRGF; this would be a low-access
arrangement.

-6I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Cape Verde faced severe macroeconomic imbalances in the wake of the 2000
parliamentary elections. The fiscal deficit including grants reached 20 percent of GDP in
2000 (and 27 percent of GDP excluding grants); the government had accumulated external
and domestic arrears; international capital flows, including donor support, fell sharply; and
international reserves declined to about one month of import coverage. While the exchange
rate peg to the euro was maintained, despite this loss of reserves, the sustainability of the peg
and of economic performance more generally was at risk.
2.
After an initially inadequate response, macroeconomic policies have improved
significantly from 2001 to the present. In particular, the marked strengthening of the fiscal
position over this period has supported a buildup in international reserves together with
reductions in external and domestic debt as a share of GDP. Since 2002, the current PRGF
arrangement has added further support to the authorities’ efforts to pursue disciplined
economic policies. In particular, program ownership and policymaking capacity have
strengthened, as reflected in the timely and satisfactory completion of all program reviews so
far. The lynchpin of the economic strategy under the PRGF arrangement has been the
recognition that disorder of public finances and debt overhang fundamentally constrained
policies and required a multiyear fiscal consolidation.1 This has been achieved principally by
strengthening tax collection, including through the introduction of the VAT in 2004, and
streamlining the externally financed public investment program (PIP). Monetary policy has
focused on strengthening the sustainability of the exchange rate peg by building reserves and
ensuring that inflation remained low, hence helping to foster an environment conducive to
increased private investment, inflows of remittances, and accumulation of emigrant deposits.
3.
In key areas, economic outcomes have been better than envisaged when the
PRGF-supported program began. The discussion in subsequent sections covers the period
from 2002 to 2004, with particular attention given to the most recent developments as part of
this final review of the PRGF arrangement. In this regard, program performance remained
strong in 2004: all end-year quantitative performance criteria were met with a substantial
margin, as were most structural objectives (see Tables 9 and 10).
A. Growth and Inflation
4.
Real GDP has grown at a robust pace over recent years (see Table A), supported
by strong public and private investment. Reflecting this development and Cape Verde’s
overall move toward middle income status, economic activity is dominated by secondary and
tertiary activities. For example, the GDP shares of such sectors as energy, construction,
commerce, and transport and communication have grown substantially since 2002. The
primary sector, in contrast, accounts for only around 8 percent of GDP, although a much
higher share of employment. Growth of GDP per capita in Cape Verde, around 3 percent on
average over 1999–2002, is among the highest in the group of small island economies in
Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean shown in Table B. As discussed in the recently
1

See, for example, IMF Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 03/152).

-7released PRSP, this growth has supported poverty reduction and improvements in other
human development indicators. In this regard, Cape Verde’s development indicators are
generally comparable to and, in some cases, better than those of the other economies shown
in Table B, and substantially stronger than the average for sub-Saharan Africa.

5.
In 2004, growth remained strong at an estimated 4.5 percent, although this was
somewhat slower than in previous years. Activity was supported by the continuing
strength of the construction sector, including private investment in tourism facilities and
public investment in infrastructure. Agricultural production, however, was adversely affected
by lower than average precipitation and a locust infestation in some areas. In addition, the
implementation of public investment projects was somewhat lower than expected, a result in
part of changes in budget administration (see below).

6.
Consumer inflation has been consistently below 2 percent a year since 2002,
underpinned by the firm monetary policy and the exchange rate peg to the euro. Prices
fell 1.9 percent in the year to December 2004, with lower food, beverage, and clothing prices
helping to offset the impact of higher prices of oil imports. A key reason for the deflation in
2004 appears to have been the reductions in customs tariffs at the beginning of the year,
which have allowed importers to draw on cheaper and more diversified sources of supplies.
However, the current consumer price index (CPI), which uses a 1989 basket, may not
provide a fully accurate representation of actual inflation. This problem should be rectified
later this year with the expected release of the new CPI methodology, including an updated
basket. Current indications are that, while the revised methodology would not lead to a major
change in overall inflation trends, the extent of deflation in 2004 could be somewhat reduced
because of the lower weight on food (whose prices have been falling) in the new basket.
B. Fiscal Policy
7.
Substantial fiscal consolidation has been achieved over recent years. From a
fiscal deficit (including grants) of 20 percent of GDP in 2000, the deficit was reduced to
under 5 percent of GDP in 2001 and has averaged 2.5 percent of GDP over 2002–04.
Progress in strengthening fiscal institutions has supported this consolidation effort, with the
multiyear fiscal framework of the program under the PRGF arrangement helping to improve
tax administration and expenditure planning. Tax revenue performance has improved
significantly over this period, rising by over 2 percent of GDP since 2000 and backed by

-9comprehensive tax reform.2 The new VAT was successfully implemented in January 2004,
replacing a multiplicity of specific consumption taxes and thereby leading to a more efficient
and broader-based tax regime. Recent reforms have also streamlined and rationalized taxes
on imports, accompanied by a general reduction of customs duties and excises.
8.
Public expenditure policy has concentrated on containing total expenditures as a
share of GDP, along with improving the composition of spending. A key development
has been the substantial reduction in transfers and subsidies since 2001 (see the text figure),
notably subsidies to large public enterprises. This trend has allowed more resources to be
committed to education, health, and other priority areas identified in the government’s
poverty reduction strategy, as indicated by the rise in the public sector wage bill. Public
capital spending has been sustained at around 10 to 12 percent of GDP over recent years,
largely reflecting the availability of and drawings from foreign financing.
9.
In 2004, the fiscal deficit including grants fell to 1.5 percent of GDP, much
smaller than had been projected. There were two main reasons for the fall of expenditures
as a share of GDP. The wage bill grew less than expected, mainly because of difficulties in
hiring teachers in rural areas. The execution rate of public investment was also lower than
anticipated, in part due to teething problems in the application of new administrative
procedures to support the move of some donor assistance from project to budget support. In
addition, public sector wages were firmly contained, as were expenditures on goods and
services. As reflected in variations in the stock of arrears, the government has made progress,
first, in acknowledging domestic arrears incurred in earlier years, and then in clearing these
arrears. It also made a lump sum payment to Electra to cover outstanding obligations arising
from public sector consumption of electricity and water.

The 2005 budget maintains a prudent fiscal stance, with the primary recurrent
surplus expected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP. Domestic revenues (including domestic
capital participation and net lending) are expected to stabilize at about 21.7 percent of GDP,
with growth of VAT revenues reflecting efficiency gains in administration. Processing of
2

Technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank has supported these recent tax reforms.
A mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department in November 2004 has provided advice to the
authorities on priorities for consolidating fiscal reforms and modernizing tax administration.

- 10 VAT refunds is running behind schedule, however, mainly because of weaknesses in
administration and control systems. The staff has taken a cautious approach in its revenue
projections for 2005, partly due to uncertainties about how quickly revenues from the new
VAT will grow. The projections also allow for the fact that some other consumption tax
revenues collected in 2004 will not recur.3 Recurrent spending, notably the wage bill,
continues to be restrained, although the budget provides for a small increase in transfers to
those whose employment and incomes may be affected by the restructuring of public
enterprises. With total expenditures projected to remain stable at the 2004 level, the fiscal
deficit (including grants) would be around 2.8 percent of GDP. All external financing would
be on concessional terms and recourse to domestic bank financing would be limited, in
support of the monetary program targets and the accumulation of reserves.4 Furthermore, the
budget incorporates the clearance of arrears to oil companies and to the social security fund.
C. Monetary and External Developments
11.
Monetary policy has remained consistent with sustained low inflation and the
accumulation of international reserves throughout the PRGF arrangement. Broad
money and credit to the economy grew by around 11 to 12 percent on average over
2002–04, supporting the overall increase in economic activity. Responding to the strong
balance of payments position and low inflation rate, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) lowered
the required reserve ratio from 19 to 18 percent in December 2004, and reduced the standing
lending facility rate from 8.5 to 7.5 percent in February 2005. Following these developments,
and facing high levels of excess liquidity, commercial banks have reduced lending rates by
1 percent. Banks have also pushed ahead with efforts to differentiate lending rates across
clients to better reflect credit risks.
12.
The external current account deficit has narrowed substantially over recent
years, falling from over 11 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 6 percent of GDP in 2004.
While the latter outturn partly reflects the mild slowdown in growth in 2004, other factors—
including improving revenues from tourism, sustained remittance flows, and the more
diversified import sources noted earlier—have also supported the favorable external
performance of the economy. International reserve accumulation of the BCV exceeded the
program floor in 2004, with gross official reserves standing at Euro 102 million (2.6 months
of imports) at the end of the year. The appreciation of the euro (and hence Cape Verde
escudo) against the dollar does not appear to have damaged Cape Verde’s external
competitiveness, reflecting the country’s relatively strong links to Europe with respect to
trade, tourism, and remittance flows. The real effective exchange rate has been depreciating
since early 2003, mainly on account of low domestic inflation.5 As discussed below,
3

The VAT replaced other taxes on goods and services; however, some revenues from the
latter were still collected in 2004.
4

The government expects to receive US$30 million in grants and loans as budget support, of
which US$8 million will be used for project financing.
5

The anticipated CPI revisions noted earlier may change the degree of real exchange rate
depreciation over recent years, but the downward trend is expected to be maintained.

- 11 however, Cape Verde’s narrow export base continues to be a key source of vulnerability and,
in their discussions with the authorities, the staff emphasized the need for further structural
reforms to improve competitiveness and hence support export diversification.

D. Financial Sector Developments
13.
The highly concentrated banking sector continues to dominate financial
intermediation. Although there are four commercial banks, the two largest banks shared
89 percent of total assets and total deposits at end-2004, with the larger of these two (Banco
Comercial de Atlântico) having a share of over 65 percent of assets and deposits. One of the
small commercial banks (Banco Totta de Cabo Verde), which has had a high share of
nonperforming loans in total loans and a negative return on equity for a number of years, has
recently been acquired by a group of private domestic investors, becoming the first
domestically owned private bank.
14.
While financial markets remain shallow, financial soundness indicators suggest
that the banking system is strengthening. As discussed in the accompanying Selected
Issues Paper on the Cape Verde financial system, these improvements have been supported
by stronger banking regulation and supervision, and by the stable macroeconomic
environment. In aggregate, banks are highly profitable and liquid, with the ratio of
nonperforming loans to total loans (7.2 percent at end-2004) gradually decreasing.
Commercial banks fully comply with prudential regulations. However, potential concerns of
the BCV include the high concentration of credit, the duopolistic behavior of the two largest
banks in setting interest rates, and weak risk assessment capacity in the commercial banking
sector. As discussed below, the authorities have emphasized the need to develop alternative
sources of financing, including through leasing companies, and are considering policy
measures that could support such development.6

There is currently only one registered leasing company, which is not yet operating.

E. Structural Developments
15.
Important progress has been made with structural reforms in the course of the
PRGF arrangement (see Box 1). In addition to measures to strengthen the implementation
of fiscal and monetary policies, a major focus of structural reform has been to regularize the
public sector’s relationship with large state-owned and/or public service enterprises. Key
steps have included:
•

Eliminating direct budget subsidies to TACV (the national airline) and Electra.

•

Preparing the remaining enterprises on the government’s privatization agenda for sale, for
tender under concession contracts, or for liquidation (see Box 2). While there have been
delays in some areas, this program is moving ahead and is expected to be largely completed
over 2005–06.

•

Implementation of an automatic mechanism to adjust fuel prices in response to changes in
import prices of oil products, and development of a price adjustment mechanism for
electricity and water. The former is now operational, but an end-December 2004 performance
criterion for published the latter mechanism was missed. The authorities have requested a
waiver for noncompliance with this performance criterion (see Appendix II), which the staff
supports. In their request, the authorities note that the process of developing the mechanism is
well advanced: the underlying economic and financial model of Electra is now completed,
and a consultant is to translate this model into the desired price adjustment mechanism. The
economic regulatory agency expects to publish the mechanism by end-June, 2005.

16.
The long-standing difficulties between the government and Electra still appear
some way from settlement, however.7 In particular, Electra’s private shareholders and the
government still need to reach agreement on the amount of the so-called “tariff deficit” to the
company, which stems from the nonadjustment of electricity and water tariffs during
7

For details of this dispute, see Box 1 of the Staff Report for the Fifth Review of the PRGF
Arrangement (IMF Country Report No. 05/46).

- 13 2000–02. An encouraging step toward settlement is a recent agreement, reached with World
Bank support, to appoint an independent mediator to help resolve the wide differences
between the parties concerned. Resolving this dispute is vital to reduce fiscal risks arising in
this area, to support Electra’s recapitalization, and to enable the company to expand its
electricity and water capacities to meet growth of demand. Urgent action is required, as
electricity blackouts and water cutoffs are increasing in areas where supply capacities have
not kept pace with the growth of demand. A further concern is that some municipalities are
running significant arrears to Electra, a problem compounded by the fact that most
municipalities, while autonomous, do not appear to have budget resources to meet their
growing consumption. Also important is the implementation of the price adjustment
mechanism for electricity and water noted above, which would help prevent a recurrence of
the current difficulties and put Electra on a more sustainable financial footing.

Box 1. Overview of Structural Conditionality Under the PRGF
Structural conditionality set out when the PRGF arrangement was requested in March
2002 aimed at deepening fiscal consolidation, strengthening monetary policy, improving
the efficiency of the tax and tariff structures, building external debt-management
capacities, and implementing a pricing mechanism for oil products.
During the course of the arrangement, additional conditionality was introduced—mainly
aimed at improving the efficiency of the fiscal structure and the regulation of public
services. It included (i) setting up the regulatory framework and creation of associated
agencies; (ii) eliminating budgetary subsidies to the national airline (TACV) and water and
electricity company (Electra); (iii) approving an automatic and transparent mechanism for
adjusting electricity and water tariffs; (iv) calculating the government’s liabilities to Electra;
(v) assessing the cost of tax exemptions and incentives, with some reduction in these included
in the 2005 budget; and (vi) strengthening VAT collection.
Compliance with structural conditionality has been commendable, with only two waivers
requested throughout the arrangement. The first covered the pricing mechanism for oil
products, which was successfully introduced after the first review with only a few months
delay. The second waiver, requested in this review, involves the approval of an automatic and
transparent pricing mechanism for electricity and water. As the arrangement comes to an end,
only two structural benchmarks are yet to be concluded: the introduction of new rules for tax
collections through commercial banks, which is significantly advanced; and the conclusion of
an assessment of the government’s financial liabilities to Electra. As noted in the main text,
this issue is still some way from resolution although, with the support of the World Bank,
progress is expected through the appointment of an independent mediator.
Structural Areas covered by World Bank lending and conditionality
Other structural areas, notably including the privatization agenda and the completion of
a public expenditure review, have been mostly pursued as part of World Bank lending
facilities operating under successive Country Assistance Strategies (CAS). Assistance was
also provided in such areas as macroeconomic management and debt reduction, private sector
development, human resource development, and poverty reduction. Most projects have been
rated satisfactory or better; during 2004, however, projects in the areas of Privatization and
Regulatory Capacity Building, Energy and Water, and Social Sector Development were rated
unsatisfactory. Except for the Energy and Water Project, which was extended for two
additional years, the other areas demonstrated significant turnaround through the end of 2004,
and were expected to finally meet their goals. The current CAS, approved in February 2005, is
aligned with the PRSP and is based on three pillars: ensuring macroeconomic stability,
supporting private-sector-led growth, and alleviating poverty.

- 15 Box 2. The Privatization Agenda
A cornerstone of the authorities’ economic strategy to support private-sector-led growth and
diversification has been to improve efficiency in the provision of key services. This goal has
helped motivate the privatization program, which has seen large numbers of state-owned
enterprises either liquidated or sold since the early 1990s—driving the number down from
approximately 40 to just 6 by end-2004 (plus minority shareholdings in a few other
enterprises). Results have not always been as successful as had been hoped, largely due to
inadequate regulatory frameworks at the time of privatization. With a gradual strengthening
of the regulatory environment now under way, however, the government is pushing forward
with the remaining agenda. This covers the following companies.

•

•

Arca Verde, the interisland maritime transport company, is in the process of being
liquidated, with final decisions regarding disposal of remaining vessels, including
sales and leases, expected within 2005.

•

TACV, the freight and passenger air service, is to be restructured and then
privatized. This process is behind schedule, however. The appointment of new
management charged with restructuring the company has been held up due to
procurement issues raised by the World Bank in the awarding of the management
contract. Solving this problem could take up to a year, with privatization to take
place afterwards.

•

CABNAVE, the shipyard is technically bankrupt. Options are being explored to
avoid liquidation.

•

Interbase, the fishing storage company, is expected to be transferred to a
consortium of Spanish and Cape Verdean interests during the first semester of the
year. The contract would include investment undertakings to meet health standards
for exporting to the European Union.

•

ENAPOR, the port authority, would see concession contracts covering operations
of port facilities transferred to the private sector. A technical study on privatization
options is almost finished, and the privatization process is expected to be concluded
by early 2006.

•

EMPROFAC, in charge of imports and distribution of pharmaceuticals, has already
started the privatization process. The government will decide on the privatization
strategy when a technical report on transfer options is completed, and the process is
expected to conclude within 2005.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
17.
In addition to assessing recent economic developments as part of the final review
of the PRGF arrangement, the staff held discussions with the authorities on a range of
economic and policy issues in the context of the Article IV consultations. The focus was
on medium-term economic prospects, including potential vulnerabilities surrounding the
outlook, and the accompanying stance of fiscal, monetary, external, and structural policies to
reduce risks and support ongoing growth and development. Attention was also given to the
authorities’ views on the overall results of the PRGF arrangement which is about to end,
including lessons that could be applied to a successor arrangement. Finally, the staff assessed
the quality of statistics and prospects for improvements in this area.
A. Economic Outlook
18.
The staff shares the authorities’ view that the medium-term outlook for Cape
Verde is promising and that GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent over 2005–08, as envisaged
in the PRSP, appears achievable. Underpinning this baseline scenario would be continued
pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies—directed in particular at expenditure restraint,
debt reduction, and exchange rate stability—and ongoing implementation of structural
reforms. Growth is projected to be led by private investment in the tourism sector and, in
support of this development, public investment in infrastructure. While the former would
increase the capacity of the country to absorb the expected increase in tourist numbers, the
latter would allow for improved and cheaper communications by land, sea, and air. In
addition to supporting tourism growth, this public investment would also facilitate the
diversification of the economy and development of other export-oriented activities. For
example, the anticipated improvements in international air links and expansion of port
capacities, combined with the strategic geographic location of the islands, point to the
potential for Cape Verde to increase its service exports in the shipping and airline sectors.

19.
Supporting this favorable outlook for growth, Cape Verde’s relatively strong
policy record and high institutional quality have enabled it to continue attracting

- 17 substantial inflows of private investment and official grants and loans. Significant
support, starting in 2005, is expected from the Millennium Challenge Account, and
commitments from other bilateral donors, including the European Union and Portugal, have
also increased. As discussed in one of the Selected Issues papers, inflows of remittances and
deposits from the Cape Verde diaspora also appear robust.
20.
Notwithstanding this bright outlook, Cape Verde faces a number of challenges in
the way of sustaining a strong pace of economic growth over the longer term. As a small
island economy with a relatively narrow export base, Cape Verde is vulnerable to a range of
external and domestic shocks. For example, growth prospects appear to hinge on further
development of tourism services—a sector that is susceptible to changes in the global
security situation, to economic conditions in Europe, and to international oil prices. In
addition, this sector faces a relatively high cost structure compared with other tourism
destinations, reflecting in part Cape Verde’s high import requirements for food and energy,
and high internal and external transportation costs. Cape Verde also remains heavily
dependent on foreign support from loans, grants, and remittances to support domestic
investment and the balance of payments position.
21.
The staff noted that, while some sources of vulnerability would be unavoidable,
maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and pushing ahead with market-oriented
structural reforms would offer Cape Verde the best prospect for securing ongoing
growth and development. Economic and regulatory policies that supported improvements
in the flexibility and competitiveness of the economy would enhance its capacity to adjust to
shocks. The staff also pointed out that the authorities should maintain their efforts to attract
increased foreign private investment and improve the mobilization of domestic resources (see
below). In addition, external vulnerabilities would be reduced through ongoing efforts
directed at trade liberalization and export diversification. In this regard, the staff emphasized
to the authorities the importance of moving rapidly toward complying with the requirements
for WTO membership within Cape Verde’s current opportunity for accession as a lowincome country.
B. Fiscal Policy
22.
In assessing the medium-term fiscal outlook, the staff urged the authorities to
maintain the prudent policy stance that has been in place over recent years. The staff
noted in particular the substantial increase in commitments of external grants and debt
financing covering the next few years and, associated with that, the strong outlook for public
investment spending. In addition, implementation of the PRSP may lead to increased
pressures on current spending. The mission emphasized the need for expenditure growth to
remain consistent with macroeconomic stability and with debt sustainability. In this context,
the staff’s current medium-term fiscal framework maintains a clear surplus in the primary
recurrent domestic balance and a small deficit (around 1 percent of GDP or less) in the
overall primary balance including grants. With the support of measures to increase domestic
revenues (see below), the staff believes that this fiscal stance would allow a modest increase
in spending on PRSP priorities, while helping ensure that aggregate demand and public debt
remain at manageable levels. The debt sustainability analysis discussed below and in
Appendix I elaborates these points and also takes into account the possibility that

- 18 Cape Verde’s access to highly concessional financing may at some point diminish as the
country’s income level rises.
23.
The projected growth of real GDP should generate substantial increases in
direct and indirect tax revenues, and there is also scope for mobilizing domestic
resources by improving tax administration and reining in tax exemptions. Recent
technical assistance from the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) has recommended some
urgent measures to improve VAT administration, including in the checking and timeliness of
data entries, together with broader measures to strengthen the monitoring and collection of
tax payments. Furthermore, the mission strongly supported the objectives recently set out by
the Minister of Finance to rationalize tax exemptions through a number of constitutional and
legislative reforms (see Box 3).8
24.
On the expenditure side, the staff recognized that implementation of the PRSP
would continue to put upward pressure on some areas of personnel spending—including
increased hiring in education, health care, and security. To contain spending growth,
including on the public wage bill, and ensure that the recurrent domestic balance remained in
surplus, the staff urged the authorities to strengthen prioritization of PRSP-related spending
and to continue to restrain nonpriority spending.
25.
The staff’s assessment of public financing conditions and prospects has been
supported by a full debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on external and total public debt
(see Appendix I). The staff’s simulations suggest that under long-term economic scenarios
that are in line with or more cautious than recent historical averages, Cape Verde’s debt
would appear to be sustainable. Nevertheless, the staff emphasizes that, in view of its
vulnerabilities to shocks as noted above, Cape Verde should maintain a prudent approach to
borrowing together with consolidation of fiscal reforms to improve domestic resource
mobilization. The staff also supports the authorities’ request for technical assistance from the
Fund to improve the management of external public debt.

8

The Minister addressed these issues at a March 2005 seminar in Praia, in which FAD
presented its assessment of the incidence and costs of tax incentives and recommendations
for reform.

- 19 -

Box 3. Fiscal Incentives and Exemptions
While recent reforms has strengthened Cape Verde’s tax system, a key challenge ahead is to
revise the outdated system of incentives and exemptions.1/ Tax incentives in Cape Verde are
complex, pervasive, and generous. In particular:
•

they are covered by scattered and outdated legislation;

•

multiple agencies and departments are involved in their administration;

•

they have a high cost in terms of revenue loss. Revenue forgone from import duties
and income taxes alone is estimated at 27 percent of total tax revenue between 1997
and 2003 (see the table);

•

revenue losses are volatile and difficult to predict, given the absence of an upper limit
on the value of benefits.

The authorities are committed to rationalizing tax incentives, emphasizing the principles of
exceptionality, stability, predictability, and moderation. As a first step, they have indicated
their support for a single law on exemptions. Furthermore, with an amendment to the
constitution, granting incentives and exemptions would be brought under the same
legislative process as used to reform taxes, rather than taking effect through use of decrees.
They have also indicated their intention to rationalize exemptions to import duties,
eliminating exemptions on consumption goods and keeping only those on capital goods.

November 2004 to evaluate the fiscal cost of incentives and advise authorities on their
rationalization.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
Key support for macroeconomic stability has come from the maintenance of
sound monetary and exchange rate policies. The staff agreed with the authorities that, in
the context of the fixed exchange rate peg to the euro, monetary policy should continue to be
directed toward price stability and the accumulation of international reserves. With the latter,
the staff concurred that the benchmark of around 3 months of import cover would be an
appropriate medium-term objective, and noted that, given the country’s vulnerabilities,
increases beyond that level could be sought over the longer term. Furthermore, the staff
supported the authorities’ assessment that there was no compelling need to consider a change

- 20 the current exchange rate regime. The peg has served Cape Verde well, anchoring the overall
macroeconomic framework and contributing to a stable economic environment for inflows of
remittances and emigrant deposits. In view of the economic and policy progress that has been
made under the current exchange rate arrangement, moving to a more flexible regime would
not appear warranted. The alternative of hardening the peg—for example, though a currency
board or euroization—could well be kept under consideration as a longer-term policy option.
However, moving in this direction would require the financial and technical support of Cape
Verde’s international partners, and would best be considered in the context of broader growth
of economic integration with the euro area. The staff also noted that, to reduce risks arising
under the fixed exchange rate, attention would need to be paid to improving productivity and
competitiveness in the economy, including through real wage restraint.
27.
The staff observed that financial intermediation remained relatively shallow,
making it difficult for the BCV to manage banking system liquidity. With a view to
improving monetary management, the staff supported the authorities’ intentions to explore
means of deepening financial markets through introducing new indirect monetary policy
instruments and through the revival of secondary markets and the stock exchange. These
improvements would help to reduce the costs of financing, supporting further increases in
credit to the economy. The staff also agreed with the authorities that there is a growing need
to develop the nonbanking financial sector—such as credit institutions and leasing
companies—to promote competition in financial services, lower lending rates, and foster
credit growth to the private sector.
28.
The BCV has made progress in building its capacities for management and
supervision. In particular, the mission supported the BCV’s ongoing plans to improve
liquidity and reserve management,9 and to strengthen banking and financial sector
supervision. In addition, the mission welcomed the BCV’s commitment to adopt
international Financial Reporting Standards and supported its request for technical assistance
from the Fund for this reform.
D. External Sector Policies
29.
Cape Verde has a liberal trade regime, recently enhanced by the introduction of
simplified and lower customs tariffs in early 2004.10 Tariffs are still above international
standards, however, and the government has indicated it would consider further reforms over
the next few years. Cape Verde does not have substantial nontariff barriers to trade. Recent
trade policies have focused on diversification of exports to developed countries through
improving the quality of export-oriented production. This would allow Cape Verde to make
use of existing initiatives with the EU and the US (under AGOA). As noted earlier, however,
there have been some slippages in current negotiations for WTO membership, and the staff
emphasized the need for clear progress on this front. The authorities’ efforts to provide a
9

The BCV recently reached agreement with the central bank of Luxemburg to manage part
of the BCV’s foreign reserves.
10

There are now seven tariff bands ranging from 0 to 50 percent.

- 21 supportive climate for tourism growth and trade diversification should be boosted by the
plans to open international airports in at least three islands, which would decrease
transportation costs and ease capacity constraints in inter-island connections.
E. Structural Policies and PRSP Implementation
30.
Discussions on structural policies focused on measures to improve conditions for
private-sector-led growth and to reduce poverty. The staff supported the authorities’
efforts to complete their privatization agenda; as discussed earlier, this should see a number
of large and strategically important public enterprises, including the national airline and the
port operator, transferred to private ownership or management over the next two years. While
acknowledging the complexities of the Electra issue, the staff emphasized that a full and
equitable settlement of the dispute between the government and the majority shareholders
was essential to restore Electra to sustainable financial health and enable it to invest in
additional capacity to meet demand growth.
31.
As illustrated by the difficulties that have followed Electra’s privatization, such
reforms need to be backed by an adequate regulatory framework. The recent creation of
several new regulatory agencies should strengthen capacities in this regard. The main tasks
of the regulatory agencies are monitoring privatization contracts and the associated provision
of public services. The staff emphasized the need to ensure that the legal framework for these
agencies guarantees the regulators’ financial and legal autonomy. The staff also noted that
some remaining functional overlaps among these agencies’ responsibilities had to be
addressed, specialized human capital developed, and the overall regulatory culture
strengthened.
32.
Following approval of the PRSP in September 2004, the authorities have focused
on developing the institutions needed to implement, monitor, and evaluate the strategy.
In accordance with the institutional framework envisaged in the PRSP, the authorities have
drafted a bill to create the National Council for Poverty Reduction and the Technical
Secretariat. The bill is expected to be approved in the first half of 2005. The strong
mobilization of external resources projected for 2005 and subsequent years will also support
implementation of the strategy.
33.
A draft new labor code is in its final stages of preparation, following extensive
discussions at the level of government, employers, and employees. After some delays in
2004, a proposal is to be submitted to the National Assembly in the second quarter of 2005.
The code would unify and update the dispersed labor legislation currently in place and
provide a stronger framework for enforcing labor regulations. This would represent an
important step forward, especially given the apparently high degree of informality in labor
contracts at present, and reported tensions between some groups of workers on formal
contracts and some on informal contracts.
F. Perspectives on the Current PRGF Arrangement
and on a Successor Arrangement
34.
The Cape Verde authorities assessed positively the cooperation with the Fund
under the current PRGF arrangement. They emphasized that the country’s performance

- 22 under the program was substantially better than they anticipated in 2002. For example, GDP
growth, the reduction of external debt, and the buildup of international reserves have all been
much stronger than expected.11 They commented favorably on the following:
•

The authorities have found the policy dialogue with the Fund to be useful and productive. In
particular, close cooperation with the Fund has helped them to view macroeconomic policies
within a consistent framework and promoted associated discussions among key policymakers.

•

The Fund’s role in building policymaking and technical capacities has also been important,
including through technical assistance from FAD and other departments.

•

Program conditionality has provided an important discipline on policy direction and incentive
for reform efforts. For example, the program ceiling on nonconcessional debt has supported
the authorities’ efforts to prioritize capital spending.

35.
The authorities recognized that a challenging structural reform agenda remains
in front of them to support growth and development. Drawing on the positive results from
the first PRGF arrangement, the authorities have requested the staff to commence
negotiations on a successor program under the PRGF; it would be a low-access arrangement.
The staff agrees that such an arrangement would appear appropriate: while Cape Verde does
not face a large balance of payments need, as a small island economy it will continue to be
exposed to the range of vulnerabilities noted earlier. In this context, close engagement with
the Fund would provide guidance for policy implementation, help address potential risks, and
signal to donors and creditors the authorities’ intentions to maintain policies directed at
macroeconomic stability and structural reforms.
G. Statistical Issues
36.
Cape Verde’s statistical system remains weak, although significant
improvements are underway. The mission urged the National Statistics Institute (INE) to
push forward with revamping the national accounts statistics in order to implement the
1993 System of National Accounts (SNA), with technical assistance from AFRISTAT. The
Statistics Department is also supporting this reform, which would include a substantial
improvement in source data collection programs, and has scheduled technical assistance
[for 2005]. A significant commitment will be required of INE to coordinate this assistance
and implement the resulting recommendations. INE is expected to release final GDP
numbers for 2002–03 in May 2005. With assistance from the National Statistics Institute of
Portugal, INE is now completing a new consumer price index, based on an updated
commodity basket, and this is to become operational by end-2005. Fund technical assistance
is also scheduled on this matter. Finally, in collaboration with the Employment Institute,
labor market surveys would be undertaken twice a year, starting from the second half of

11

For example, external public debt at end-2004 stood at 53 percent of GDP, compared with
57 percent of GDP envisaged when the program began; and gross international reserves
reached 2.6 months of imports at end-2004, compared with the 2.2 months originally
projected.

- 23 2005. The staff recommended that INE receive the funding necessary to ensure that it
collects the relevant information and generates accurate and reliable data in a timely manner.
37.
These weaknesses and reform plans notwithstanding, there have been
improvements in the compilation and dissemination of statistics. The authorities are
committed to use the GDSS as a framework for the development of statistical system.
Furthermore, the BCV publishes a wide variety of monetary, external, real sector, and fiscal
data on the worldwide web, and has strengthened its balance of payments statistics with
technical assistance from the Fund.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance remains strong. Economic
growth has been robust over recent years, contributing to a decline in absolute poverty.
Moreover, with the backing of continued prudent macroeconomic policies and further
structural reforms, the medium-term economic outlook is positive. Key driving forces for
growth are coming from private investment in tourism facilities and public investment in
infrastructure, financed through increasing levels of external support. Inflation has recently
been negative, a result in part of tariff reforms in early 2004. With the support of the fixed
exchange rate peg, inflation is expected to remain low in the years ahead.
39.
Economic policymaking has strengthened under the current three-year PRGF
arrangement. As reflected in the decline in public debt, fiscal performance and debt
sustainability has improved substantially. Key reforms have occurred in the tax system,
notably the introduction of the VAT. To draw the full potential from these reforms, the
authorities need to maintain their efforts to strengthen tax administration and push forward
with plans to rationalize tax incentives. Pressures to grant additional exemptions, including
from import tariffs, should be resisted. Expenditure performance and administration have
strengthened, with recurrent spending contained and increasingly focused on social priorities
set out in the PRSP. These improvements will receive further backing from the planned
introduction of a full medium-term expenditure framework.
40.
A further key element behind Cape Verde’s macroeconomic stability has been
the firm monetary policy of the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV). In particular, the credibility
and robustness of the exchange rate peg has grown, both supported by and contributing to
sustained price stability and accumulation of international reserves. The fixed exchange rate
regime remains appropriate, providing a major anchor for macroeconomic policies and
contributing to a stable environment for inflows of remittances and emigrant deposits.
41.
Financial soundness indicators do not indicate any imminent banking sector
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the BCV must be prepared to act quickly should pressures
emerge. Important steps to help ward off such pressures include the further strengthening of
banking supervision, introduction of new indirect monetary policy instruments, and
improvements in the effectiveness of banking and other financial intermediation services.
42.
Helped by the tariff reforms in early 2004, Cape Verde has a liberal trade
regime. There have been some slippages, however, in the current negotiations for WTO

- 24 membership, and rapid progress is needed on this front within the current window of
opportunity for accession.
43.
The momentum of structural reforms needs to be maintained. A key goal for
2005–06 should be to complete the restructuring and privatization of the remaining
enterprises on the government’s reform agenda. These efforts need to be backed by the
ongoing development of a sound and efficient regulatory framework, including through the
authorities’ plans to create specialized regulatory agencies. Also essential is settlement of the
long-standing dispute between the government and the majority shareholders of Electra. In
addition to reducing fiscal risks, such a settlement is urgently required to restore Electra to
financial health and enable it to meet growing demands for electricity and water.
44.
While Cape Verde’s data quality has been generally adequate for program
monitoring, statistical systems remain weak. The staff urges the authorities to make full
use of the technical assistance that is underway or planned, in order to strengthen national
accounts data and implement the new methodology for measuring consumer prices.
45.
The staff agrees with the authorities that the results achieved under the current
PRGF arrangement, which ends in July, have exceeded initial expectations. Noting the
government’s interest in a successor arrangement with the Fund, the staff shares the
authorities’ assessment that the arrangement best suited to their needs would be a low-access
PRGF. A mission to negotiate a new program under this arrangement is scheduled for
June 2005.
46.
The staff recommends completion of the sixth review under the PRGF
arrangement. The staff also supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for nonobservance
of an end-December 2004 structural performance criterion relating to the publication of an
automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs. Preparation of this mechanism
has taken longer than the staff and the authorities originally envisaged, mainly as a result of
capacity constraints faced by the newly established economic regulatory agency. However,
the authorities have taken corrective actions to address these constraints—notably the
appointment of consultants to complete the underlying economic model and to translate this
into the tariff adjustment mechanism by the new target date of end-June, 2005. It is
recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Cape Verde be held in accordance
with the July 2002 decision on consultation cycles. The authorities have consented to publish
this Article IV staff report and related documents.

APPENDIX I

CAPE VERDE: EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS12
Background
1.
This note assesses the sustainability of Cape Verde’s external and total public debt. It
measures the sensitivity of debt dynamics under the staff’s baseline scenario when this
outlook is subjected to a number of standardized shocks in the low-income countries (LIC’s)
debt sustainability framework. The previous debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was carried
out during the third review of the PRGF (Appendix III of IMF Country Report No. 03/402,
12/03/03) based on the outstanding stock of external debt at end-2002 and projections for
2003. The analysis concluded that, under reasonable assumptions regarding new borrowing
and export growth, the external debt burden would continue to ease over time, including in
the face of moderate shocks.
2.
The analysis is undertaken using loan-by-loan data. Data on bilateral external debt at
end-2004 were provided by the authorities while multilateral debt data were obtained from
the creditors.13 The stock of Cape Verde’s external debt, public and publicly guaranteed,
amounted to US$493 million (53 percent of GDP) at end-2004. Of this debt, 76 percent was
owed to multilateral creditors, 23 percent to bilateral creditors and less than 1 percent to
commercial creditors. The World Bank was the largest multilateral creditor, followed by the
African Development Fund and BADEA. Portugal, Russia and Germany accounted for
60 percent of the bilateral debt.
3.
Cape Verde remains current on its external debt service obligations and has cleared
all arrears with multilateral creditors. Discussions are currently under way with Brazil,
Russia and China on loans contracted with these countries.
4.
Central government domestic debt amounted to 24 million Cape Verde escudos
(CVEsc) in 2004 (29 percent of GDP), of which 30 percent was short term debt. 70 percent
of domestic debt was held by banks, while the largest share of nonbank debt was held by the
public pension fund INPS.

12
13

This DSA has been conducted in coordination with the World Bank.

Cape Verde’s external debt is public and publicly guaranteed debt to nonresidents. The
analysis excludes private sector debt, which is believed to be negligible.

The assumptions underlying the DSA are based on the staff’s medium-term
macroeconomic framework until 2010 and the March 2005 World Economic Outlook
forecast (Table 2). Beyond 2010, the baseline scenario projects constant GDP growth of
5 percent, inflation of 2 percent, export growth around 9 percent, and fiscal revenues
remaining close to 26 percent of GDP. The medium and long-term assumptions imply stable
current account and fiscal deficits. The baseline accounts for future disbursements under
existing loans and disbursements under loans not yet contracted. Projected domestic
borrowing is limited and external borrowing reflects the graduation of Cape Verde to middle
income status and thus decreasing reliance on grants and nonconcessional borrowing.14

receiving concessional IDA resources for the present decade and much of the next.

APPENDIX I

6.
The DSA has three components: (1) the medium term baseline scenario described
above, (2) an historical scenario, in which key variables in 2006–25 are at their historical
averages (based on 1995–2004), and (3) a set of stress tests that explore the robustness of
debt sustainability to alternative macroeconomic assumptions. The stress tests assume that
key macroeconomic variables are at their recent historical averages or below them by a factor
reflecting their historical volatility.
External Sustainability
7.
In both the baseline and the historical scenarios, debt sustainability indicators remain
comfortably below the indicative policy-dependent thresholds for a strong policy performing
country (see Figure 1 and Table 3). The NPV of debt to exports is 100 percent at the
beginning and end of the projection period, with the ratio peaking at around 125 percent
under the baseline scenario. The NPV of debt to GDP increases from 32 to 39 percent of
GDP over 2005–25, peaking at 47 percent in 2018 before declining. The ratio of debt service
to exports remains at around 9 to 11 percent over the projection period. While the latter
implies a growing commitment of domestic resources to servicing external debt, the
simulations indicates that, under prudent assumptions on export growth and the terms of new
borrowing in the next twenty years, the overall external debt position of Cape Verde would
not deteriorate significantly.

8.
External debt sustainability remains sensitive to exogenous shocks, however. As
shown in Figure 1, which includes results from the most extreme stress tests, a one time
30 percent nominal devaluation relative to the baseline pushes the NPV of debt to GDP
above 45 percent in 2005 compared to 30 percent in the baseline, and keeps it permanently at
a higher level—above the sustainability threshold. In addition to exchange rate fluctuations,
the external debt outlook is vulnerable to declining exports and a worsening of lending terms.
A decline in exports in 2005–06 by one standard deviation from historical levels results in
the debt service to exports ratio reaching nearly 13 percent in the early 2020s. The debt
outlook deteriorates, albeit less sharply, as a result of a worsening of the balance of payments
financing pattern throughout the projection period, with the NPV of debt to exports ratio
increasing by almost 50 percent. While the baseline scenario already builds in some
deterioration in lending terms, this result highlights the need for continued vigilance
regarding external financing conditions.

APPENDIX I

Fiscal sustainability
9.
Under a scenario with the primary balance held at the 2004 level, all indicators of
public debt sustainability (external and domestic) show a decline of the debt service and debt
burden in the projection period (Figure 2). The NPV of debt to GDP ratio declines to
15 percent by 2025, compared with 50 percent in the baseline.15 The baseline scenario points
to stable levels of the ratios of NPV of debt to GDP and NPV of debt service to revenue, and
an increasing but low ratio of debt service to revenue.
10.
The need for a prudent approach to borrowing is highlighted by the results of the
stress test on public debt. In particular, in the most extreme test in which the primary balance
is at historical averages minus one standard deviation in 2006–07, the NPV of public debt in
percent of GDP and in percent of revenues increases sharply and stays permanently at a
higher level, declining only after 2017.16 Debt service to revenues would increase to nearly
30 percent after 2017.
11.
In conclusion, the sensitivity analysis suggests that, under long-term economic
scenarios which are in line with or more cautious than recent historical averages,
Cape Verde’s public debt would appear to be sustainable. Nevertheless, as a small island
economy with a narrow export base, Cape Verde will remain vulnerable to shocks. In this
light, a prudent approach to borrowing, consolidation of fiscal reforms to improve domestic
resource mobilization, and strengthened debt management remain crucial. Such efforts are
also warranted given Cape Verde’s prospective graduation to middle income status and the
possibility that, over time, it may be less able to borrow on highly concessional terms.

15

As the primary balance was much higher than expected in 2004, the baseline reflects a
more conservative assumption on this balance over the projection period.

16

It should be noted, however, that the historical scenario includes two episodes of fiscal
expansion associated with pre-election periods.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

REQUEST FOR WAIVER
Praia, March 12, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato,
As the recent mission from the African Department of the Fund concluded, Cape Verde has
maintained its sound economic and policy performance during 2004 and into 2005. All
end-2004 quantitative performance criteria under the PRGF arrangement were met, as were
two out of three structural performance criteria.
The government requests a waiver for nonobservance of one structural performance criterion,
which concerns the approval by the Board of ARE (the independent economic regulatory
agency) of an automatic and transparent mechanism for adjusting electricity and water tariffs
on the basis of costs, and publication of such mechanism in the official gazette. Important
progress has been made toward meeting this objective. After some delays earlier in 2004,
reflecting in part capacity constraints faced by the newly established regulatory agency, an
economic and financial model of the electricity and water sector has recently been completed
with the help of the World Bank. Drawing on further Bank support, ARE has agreed to the
appointment of a consultant to translate this model into the desired tariff adjustment
mechanism. As a result, the government expects that ARE will be able to finalize and publish
the mechanism by the end of June 2005.
The government looks forward to maintaining the excellent spirit of cooperation that has
prevailed between the IMF and Cape Verde over the past three years during implementation
of the PRGF arrangement.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
João Serra
Minister of Finance and Planning

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) is subject
to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on April 10, 2002. A
safeguards assessment of the BCV was completed on December 9, 2002. The assessment
identified certain vulnerabilities in the reporting, internal control, and audit areas, and
made appropriate recommendations, as reported in IMF Country Report No. 03/152

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

(06/23/03). The BCV has implemented all but one of the safeguard assessment
recommendations. The one outstanding recommendation, regarding clear separation of
front and back office functions in the Operations Division, is expected to be implemented
in 2005.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Cape Verde, the Cape Verde escudo, has been pegged to the euro at a
rate of CVEsc 110.3 per EUR 1 since January 4, 1999. Cape Verde accepted the
obligations under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement effective July 1, 2004.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Discussions of the 2002 Article IV consultation and the first review under the PRGF
arrangement were held in Praia during October 13-27, 2002. The Executive Board
concluded the discussions of the Article IV consultations and completed the first review
under the PRGF on December 16, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 03/152 (06/23/03); and
www.imf.org. It is expected that the next Article IV consultations with Cape Verde will
be held on the 24-month cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation
cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
X.

Technical Assistance:

Since 1985, the Fund has provided technical assistance to the Bank of Cape Verde, the
Ministry of Finance, and, more recently, the National Institute of Statistics in several
areas: (i) The Bank of Cape Verde has received technical assistance from MFD in
organization and methods, management of external debt, monetary and banking statistics,
accounting, credit, and foreign exchange operations, management of public debt, and the
separation of the functions of the Bank of Cape Verde, as well as on the choice of
exchange rate regime. It has also received technical assistance from STA in monetary and
balance of payments statistics. (ii) The Ministry of Finance has received technical
assistance from FAD in organization and budgetary procedures, budgeting, tax policy,
and tax administration; and (iii) the National Institute of Statistics has received technical
assistance in national accounts and is now starting to receive assistance in price statistics.
Cape Verde is a participant in STA’s GDDS Regional Project for Lusophone Africa, and
has recently posted its metadata on the web. It is receiving technical assistance to
implement the GDDS plan for improvement in the context of this project.
Most recently, technical assistance has been provided in the following areas:
•

An FAD follow-up visit in June 2004 was the most recent mission to help the
authorities move to a VAT, including the rationalization of the import tariff and
the overhaul of the domestic indirect tax system. Many visits and a two-year
resident advisor have gone into this effort.

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

• In October 2004, two FAD missions visited Cape Verde—one to review tax
administration, including VAT implementation, the other to assist the assessment
of tax exemptions and incentives.

XI.

•

STA missions have recently taken place on national accounts (November 2003),
balance of payments statistics (February 2004), government finance statistics
(March 2004), and price statistics (June 2004).

•

In July 2003, an MFD expert visited the Bank of Cape Verde to advise on
safeguards issues. In April 2004, MFD provided technical assistance on
accounting for the BCV. In May 2004, MFD experts visited the BCV to advise
on financial systems regulations and on monetary operations and liquidity
management.
Resident Representative: None.

APPENDIX IV

CAPE VERDE: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(April 15, 2005)
Partnership in Cape Verde’s development strategy
1. The Joint staff advisory note (JSAN) of the Government’s full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) was discussed in the Board in January 2005. Cape Verde’s strategy
focuses on five key pillars for public intervention: (i) promoting good governance;
(ii) improving competitiveness and private-sector-led growth; (iii) fostering human capital
development; (iv) strengthening social security and solidarity; and (v) improving
infrastructure and land use management. The main development challenges for the country
revolve around: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability given external vulnerabilities and
uncertainties surrounding resources flows; (ii) achieving further improvements in
governance, especially in a decentralized context; (iii) reforming social expenditure
programs to reflect the changing nature of demand; and (iv) promoting stronger growth and
poverty reduction through improvements in the business climate.
World Bank Group strategy
2. The Bank’s FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in
February 2005. It is fully aligned with the PRSP, and supports efforts in the areas of
(i) macroeconomic stability and sound finance and budget systems; (ii) private-led growth
through an enhanced investment climate and increased competitiveness through publicprivate partnerships in infrastructure; and (iii) social programs aimed at alleviating poverty
and inequity.
World Bank Group activities and assessment of country policies
IDA portfolio
3. The Bank’s strategy aims at supporting the implementation of the Government’s
poverty reduction strategy by focusing in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage.
The CAS calls for a significant shift towards programmatic lending, complemented by a
multi-sectoral investment operation, to the extent possible every two years. Contributing to
the harmonization agenda, Bank group support aims to catalyze other donors and build
partnerships.
4. With regard to programmatic lending, a first Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-1, US$15 million equivalent) was approved by the Board in February 2005. It focuses
on three main objectives: (i) promote good governance, reinforcing effectiveness and
guaranteeing equity; (ii) develop and upgrade human resources; (iii) improve the
effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system. PRSC-1 is a one-tranche
operation and will be the first in a series o f three annual operations (PRSC-2 currently
planned for FY06).

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

5. With regard to investment lending, the current World Bank investment portfolio gives a
priority to stabilizing the macroeconomic framework, strengthening competitiveness
(infrastructure and private sector) and building capacity in the social sector (HIV/AIDS).
6. IDA’s assistance in terms of strengthening the country’s physical infrastructure and
competitiveness, is covered as follows:
The Energy/Water Project aims to improve the supply of power, water, and sanitation
systems, to increase operational and end-use efficiency in the power and water,
sectors, to lower the barriers to the development of renewable energy sources, and to
foster the sound management of water resources.
The Growth and Competitiveness Project aims to broaden the base of private
participation in Cape Verde's economic growth, enhance private sector
competitiveness and further develop its financial sector. This would be achieved
through a series of actions supported by the project, notably: (a) financial sector
reform, including pension reform; (b) investment climate reform, which includes, but
is not limited to: (i) tax reform, (ii) alleviation of administrative barriers,
(iii) improved supply chains, and (iv) legal reform; (c) post privatization and
divestiture reforms; and (d) private sector and institutional capacity building. The
project thus helps to sustain the Government's poverty alleviation efforts by
generating increased employment opportunities through improved international
competitiveness.
The Road Sector Support Project (currently under preparation) would aim to support
critical road transport infrastructure needs through all, or a combination of the
following approaches: (i) improving access roads linking villages and rural areas to
main roads; (ii) filling critical gaps to establish a minimum continuous network
within an island with the construction of a short section of new road (8–10 km. on
St. Nicolau Island); and (iii) filling a major gap in an island network, through the
construction of bridges or providing access to a chronically poor access zone.
7. In the social sectors, an HIV/AIDS Project supports (i) mitigation of the health
and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household, and community
levels, thus sustaining an economically productive population, and (ii) establishment of
a strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the epidemic.
8. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA will continue to coordinate their respective roles to
support development activities in Cape Verde.
Assessment of country policies
9. The authorities of Cape Verde and development partners, including the Bank, have
undertaken a substantial body of analytic work to assess key social, structural, and sectoral
development policies and identify policy and institutional reform priorities for poverty
reduction. It allowed inter alia the adoption in April 2003 of a Statement of development
policies for private sector development, which was one of the basic framework to the
preparation of the Growth and competitiveness project.

10. In FY05 and beyond, advisory services are expected to be in large part related to
infrastructure, fisheries and economic management (public service reform). Proposed
economic and sector work (ESW) includes core diagnostics, annual public expenditures
reviews (PER) updates, and general economic work to sustain macroeconomic and sectoral
dialogue. The following studies are planned: Infrastructure regulation and competitiveness
diagnostic report (FY05), investment climate assessment (ICA and pension study (FY06),
Review of human development (FY07), Rural development assessment (FY07), Integrated
CFAA/CPAR (FY07).
11. As of April 11th, 2005, IDA had extended 22 credits to Cape Verde, amounting to about
US$213 million equivalent, of which about US$178 million has been disbursed. 18 credits
have closed. The current portfolio includes four credits, with associated credit amounts of
about US$53 million equivalent and an undisbursed balance of about US$35 million. The
involvement of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Cape Verde remains limited.
World Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
12. The Fund and the Bank continue to collaborate in many areas, including fiscal
operations and tax reform; public enterprise reform and privatization; utility regulation and
private sector development; and the strengthening of human resource development and the
poverty reduction strategy. In close collaboration with the World Bank, the Fund staff has
discussed and reached understandings on a structural reform program with the government of
Cape Verde in the context of the PRGF arrangement. The Fund and the Bank have
collaborated in the areas of the privatization program, utility regulation, public expenditure
management, and civil service and pension system reform.

APPENDIX V

CAPE VERDE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The data compilation and reporting system in Cape Verde has improved significantly
in recent years, although the development of the country’s statistical system still suffers from
a shortage of financial and human resources. The authorities decided to participate in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and during 2003–04, benefited from the
technical assistance provided by STA under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa. The
GDDS metadata for Cape Verde are posted on the IMF Data Standards Dissemination Board.
2.
Under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa, technical assistance was provided in
national accounts statistics (two missions), consumer price, government finance, and balance
of payments statistics (one mission each).
Real sector
3.
Some improvements have been made for a more timely presentation of national
accounts statistics. The National Statistical Institute (INE) plans to release the final GDP
numbers for 2002–03, with 1980 as base year, in May 2005. The INE intends to use the
results of the 2001–02 household income and expenditure survey in updating the national
accounts benchmark and base year estimates from 1980 to 2002. The final objective is to
adopt the 1993 SNA, for which technical assistance from AFRISTAT and the Fund has been
requested. STA conducted two technical assistance missions in 2003, which provided INE
with extensive and detailed recommendations. A follow-up mission has been scheduled for
mid-2005 in order to assist INE in designing the strategy for implementing the 1993 SNA,
including substantial improvement in the source data collections programs. This will require
a significant commitment from INE to implement STA’s previous recommendations while
coordinating this assistance with that provided by AFRISTAT. In addition, labor market
surveys will be undertaken twice a year, starting from the second half of 2005, in
collaboration with the Employment Institute.
4.
The official consumer price index (CPI) is obsolete, as the weights date back to 1989,
four years before the liberalization of imports that considerably changed the composition of
consumption. The introduction of a re-weighted CPI, after some delay, is now planned before
the end of 2005, with the assistance from the National Statistics Institute of Portugal which
provided the new CPI software installed at INE. The new CPI index will use an updated
commodity basket, based on the 2001–02 household budget survey, with geographical
coverage being re-examined. A STA technical assistance mission is tentatively scheduled for
2005, to follow up on a previous mission during the first half of 2004.
Government finance
5.
The management of government expenditures has been improved with the
consolidation of most accounts previously held with commercial banks at the central bank
level. In addition, government agencies’ reporting, as well as the coordination among the
treasury, the budget directorates, and the central bank, has also been improved, with the
Ministry of Finance and Planning being the single point of commitment, execution, and
monitoring of public expenditure. As noted in the appendix on Fund Relations, the Ministry
of Finance and Planning has received technical assistance from FAD in organization and

- 61 -

APPENDIX V

budgetary procedures, budgeting, tax policy, and tax administration during the course of the
successive Fund programs.
6.
The government finance statistics (GFS) compilation system is being substantially
improved as part of the ongoing reforms of the government’s management and information
systems. The main recommendations of the STA technical assistance mission that took place
in March 2004 were to assign the responsibility for compiling GFS within the Ministry of
Finance, and to revise the budget classifiers to ensure full consistency with the
recommendations of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The mission prepared
derivation tables to compile GFS from the existing budget execution data more aligned with
these recommendations.
7.
The 2004 mission recommended that the derivation table prepared be used to start
reporting government finance statistics to STA for publication. However, no government
finance data are yet reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) or
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbooks. A GFS mission by STA in March 2004
reviewed the current status of compilation of fiscal statistics and provided the authorities
with recommendations to further improve the usefulness of the data. Further improvements
of the institutional coverage of general government and the classification of transactions
were recommended. Reviewing the chart of accounts and developing bridge tables to the
GFSM 2001 assisted the authorities with their plans to work towards disseminating GFS in
accordance with the framework of GFSM 2001.
Money and banking
8.
The central bank (BCV) compiles and reports monthly monetary statistics to STA on
a timely basis. Balance sheet data for the central bank and other depository corporations are
provided with a lag of approximately four weeks. Significant progress has been made in the
area of monetary and financial statistics, both in terms of the accuracy and timeliness of the
data.
9.
As a result of extensive “hands-on” training and courses provided by STA to the
BCV staff the institutional capacity of the BCV to compile monetary statistics has improved
considerably. However, there is still a need to improve the timeliness of the monetary data
reported to the Fund, particularly the consolidated analytical accounts for the commercial
banks. As noted in the Fund Relations appendix, the BCV has received technical assistance
from MFD in monetary and banking statistics and a range of other areas.
Balance of payments
10.
With technical assistance from STA, the accuracy, periodicity and timeliness of
balance of payments statistics compiled by BCV have continued to improve. A greater use of
surveys, combined with the international transactions reporting system (ITRS) implemented
by BCV, has permitted a significant expansion of data sources and statistical coverage,
which, to a large extent, follow the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5).

- 62 -

APPENDIX V

11.
The STA balance of payments mission that visited Cape Verde in 2004 provided
advice to improve data sharing and coordination among data-producing agencies, namely the
customs administration for the international merchandise trade statistics and Ministry of
Finance with regard to external debt data, and to further improve the data collection program,
including revisions to the quarterly surveys to increase the coverage of the transactions
reported. The mission also provided recommendations for the BCV to start compiling Cape
Verde’s international investments position.
12.
The timeliness of reporting BOP quarterly statistics to STA needs to be improved.
The latest quarterly data published in IFS refers to December 2003. However, quarterly BOP
statistics for 2004 are already disseminated in the BCV website. Reporting of annual data to
STA is timely, and the latest annual data published in the 2004 edition of the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) is 2003. The Cape Verdean authorities also provided
STA with technical notes describing the methodologies and compilation procedures used for
balance of payments statistics.
External debt
13.
An adequate database on debt appears to be in place, although further improvements
would facilitate the preparation of regular and reliable debt sustainability analyses. The
treasury department of the Ministry of Finance and Planning is able to provide a breakdown
by creditors for debt, including debts currently under negotiation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Cape Verde
On May 25, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cape Verde together with the sixth review of Cape Verde’s
arrangement with the IMF under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) (see Press
Release No. 05/124).17
Background
Macroeconomic policies in Cape Verde have strengthened significantly over recent years,
enabling the country to correct the severe macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in 2000 in
the run-up to parliamentary and presidential elections. In particular, the fiscal position is now
markedly stronger than in 2000; external and domestic public debt have declined as a share of
GDP; and international reserves have been built up, supporting the credibility of the exchange
rate peg to the euro. Important progress has also been made on a range of structural reforms to
increase efficiency, improve the business climate, and support investment. Underpinned by this
sound policy environment, GDP growth has been robust—averaging nearly 6 percent since
2000—and inflation has remained low.

17

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

- 65 Following a Fund staff-monitored program in the second half of 2001, the authorities’ economic
program has been supported by an arrangement with the IMF under the PRGF.
This arrangement was approved in April 2002 and ended in July 2005. The government’s
medium-term development strategy is set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
which focuses on combating poverty and promoting private-sector-led growth by strengthening
education, training, and health care, developing economic infrastructure, and improving
governance. The PRSP was discussed by the Boards of the IMF and World Bank in January
2005.
Considering recent developments, GDP growth is estimated to have been 4.5 percent in 2004,
held down in part by short-term difficulties in the agricultural sector, and is projected to reach
around 6 percent in 2005. The construction sector continues to provide key support to economic
activity, notably through private investment in tourism facilities and public investment in
infrastructure. These trends have been backed by increasing foreign direct investment and
concessional assistance from Cape Verde’s bilateral and multilateral partners.
The fiscal deficit (including grants) fell to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2004, a stronger performance
than expected. Revenues from the new value-added tax—introduced in January 2004—
exceeded expectations and, within effective restraints on overall public spending, more
resources were directed toward education, health, and other priority areas. The fiscal deficit in
2005 is projected to be 2.8 percent of GDP, fully financed through higher external assistance.
International reserves increased at a faster pace than anticipated in 2004, reaching 2.6 months
of imports of goods and services at the end of the year—up from 1.9 months at end-2003.
Further accumulation of reserves is expected in 2005. In view of continuing low inflation, the
strong balance of payments position, and stable money and credit growth, the Bank of Cape
Verde was able to lower the required reserve ratio in December 2004 and the standing lending
facility rate in February 2005. These moves have been followed by a reduction in commercial
banks’ lending rates.
The remaining enterprises on the government’s privatization agenda are being prepared for
sale, tender under concession contracts, or liquidation. While progress in some areas is behind
schedule, the program is expected to be largely completed over 2005-06. With the help of an
independent mediator, negotiations are underway between the government and the majority
shareholders of Electra, the electricity and water company, to reach agreement on the amount of
the “tariff deficit” owed to this company. This deficit stems from the non-adjustment of electricity
and water tariffs during 2000-02. Following some delays, the authorities are finalizing an
automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs in response to changes in import
prices of oil products.
Executive Board Assessment
They commended the Cape Verde authorities’ strong record in implementing their economic
program, particularly the progress that has been made with fiscal consolidation, strengthening
the credibility of the exchange rate peg, and structural reform. This has contributed to strong

- 66 economic performance in recent years. The macroeconomic imbalances that emerged during
the pre-election period in 2000 have disappeared. Real GDP growth has been robust, supported
by private and public investment in tourism and infrastructure; inflation has been consistently
low; international reserves have increased; and the external debt is relatively small. These
achievements have supported poverty reduction and paved the way for Cape Verde’s
graduation to middle-income status in the near future.
While the public debt profile of Cape Verde at end-2004 appears sustainable under long term
scenarios, Directors observed that the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, due to
the heavy dependence on external concessional financing and the narrow export base. Directors
therefore urged the authorities to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies and a cautious
approach to borrowing, and to sustain the reform momentum. Domestic resource mobilization, to
reduce the reliance on external financing, and export diversification should remain high priorities.
Directors welcomed the decline in the fiscal deficit in 2004, which reflected the strong
performance of the new value added tax and restraint on overall public spending, but also
delayed wage and capital expenditures. They stressed the importance of continuing a prudent
fiscal policy, especially in the run-up to elections in early 2006. They saw scope for further
improvement in revenue performance, including through measures to strengthen tax
administration and rationalize tax exemptions. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
keep expenditures within budgeted levels, and underscored the importance of prioritizing
spending according to the objectives set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.
Directors noted the key role monetary policy has played in supporting overall macroeconomic
stability and growth, particularly by ensuring sustained low inflation and the credibility of the
exchange rate peg. They supported the recent easing of the monetary policy stance, which has
led to a much-needed reduction in commercial banks’ lending rates. Directors considered that
the current exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Cape Verde. They welcomed the
further sizeable accumulation of international reserves in 2004, and noted the important role that
remittances have played in strengthening the balance of payments.
Directors considered that the banking system is generally sound, but highly concentrated.
They urged the authorities to push ahead with reforms to improve competition and efficiency in
financial services, including through the introduction of new indirect monetary policy instruments
to promote financial deepening. It was also noted that continued improvements in financial
sector supervision will contribute to macroeconomic stability and private sector development.
Directors welcomed the intention to adopt international financial reporting standards with
technical assistance from the Fund.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with structural reforms focused on improving
the conditions for private-sector-led growth. They welcomed the commitment to complete the
restructuring and privatization of the remaining companies on the reform agenda during 2005
and 2006, but stressed the importance of parallel measures to strengthen the underlying
regulatory framework. They considered that implementation of the automatic mechanism to
adjust electricity and water tariffs in response to changes in input costs is important to reduce
fiscal risks, restore the electricity and water company to financial health, and ensure a more

- 67 efficient supply of utility services. Directors welcomed Cape Verde’s move toward a more liberal
trade regime, and called for faster progress in WTO membership negotiations. They encouraged
efforts to enhance labour market flexibility and improve the business environment.
Directors welcomed the efforts being made to tackle poverty and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. They supported the creation of the National Council for Poverty Reduction,
and commended the authorities for approving a PRSP after consultation with key stakeholders.
Directors observed that, while Cape Verde’s statistical systems are generally adequate for
program monitoring, there is substantial scope for improvement in this area. They urged the
authorities to make full use of available technical assistance to strengthen national accounts
data, implement the improved methodology for measuring consumer prices, and undertake
labour market surveys.

Press Release No. 05/124
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 26, 2005

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth and Final Review Under Cape Verde's PRGF
Arrangement and Approves US$1.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the sixth and
final review of Cape Verde's economic performance under an SDR 8.64 million (about
US$12.8 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press
Release No. 02/18). The completion of this review makes available the final disbursement of
SDR 1.26 million (about US$1.9 million).
The Executive Board also granted Cape Verde's request for a waiver for nonobservance of an
end-December 2004 structural performance criterion related to the publication of an
automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs, as the authorities have taken
corrective actions to address this.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Cape Verde, on May 25, 2005,
Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Cape Verde’s economic performance under the PRGF-supported program has been
commendable. Real GDP growth has been strong, supported by private and public
investment in tourism and infrastructure, and inflation has been consistently low. The
authorities have appropriately focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability,
consolidating the fiscal position, and strengthening the credibility of the exchange rate peg to
the euro.
“The fiscal deficit in 2004 was substantially smaller than expected, reflecting the positive
performance of the new value added tax and effective restraint of overall public spending.
The authorities will need to ensure that expenditure is kept within budgeted levels in 2005,
especially in the lead-up to elections in early 2006. Looking ahead, effective prioritization of
public spending according to the objectives set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
and improved revenue performance through measures to strengthen tax administration and
rationalize tax exemptions, will further strengthen the macroeconomic framework.

- 70 “The authorities have achieved substantial progress with structural reforms in recent years. It
is important that this momentum be maintained, including through the restructuring and
privatization of the remaining companies on the reform agenda and through accompanying
measures to strengthen the underlying regulatory framework. The implementation of an
automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs in response to changes in input
costs will help reduce fiscal risks, restore the electricity and water company to financial
health, and ensure a more efficient supply of utility services. Other key reforms being
pursued by the authorities include development of the financial sector to increase
competition and efficiency; implementation of a more liberal trade regime; and measures to
improve the functioning of the labor market and the business environment.
“The authorities are taking important steps to tackle poverty and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. To this end, a National Council for Poverty Reduction will be created,
and a poverty reduction strategy paper has been approved after consultation with key
stakeholders,” Mr. Carstens said.

- 71 Statement by Mr. Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Cape Verde
May 25, 2005

I would like to thank Management and staff for their continuous support to my Cape Verdean
authorities’ efforts under the three-year PRGF arrangement and for the constructive policy
advice that has accompanied their macroeconomic policies and structural reforms throughout
the program implementation. My authorities are appreciative of this assistance which has
proved instrumental in maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and reforms, putting the
economy on the path of sustainable growth and development. In the recent years, the growth
rate of the Cape Verdean economy has been robust. The country’s per capita GNP is
improving, and progress has been made in reducing poverty. Amid positive prospects, my
authorities are cognizant of the risks and challenges the country’s economy faces for the
period ahead. These challenges make it all the more necessary to stay the course as regards
the reform efforts, and the authorities would like the support of the Fund in these efforts.
Thus, the authorities of Cape Verde are requesting the opening of discussions towards a
successor PRGF program which is best suited to sustain the country’s current efforts and
momentum.
Cape Verde has continued to perform well under the current PRGF arrangement. The
pursuance of sound macroeconomic policies, which are based on a prudent fiscal policy
stance, the enhancement of revenue collection efforts through fiscal and tax administration
reforms, restrained current expenditures, prudent monetary policy geared towards price
stability and reserves accumulation, have helped stabilize the economic environment and
make it conducive to external budgetary support, increased private investment and sustained
robust real GDP growth. The latter has averaged more than 5.4% in the last three years and is
expected to increase further in the years ahead. Skillful monetary management, supported by
an exchange rate regime that has served the Cape Verdean economy well, has helped to
maintain inflation at or below the 2% mark. The authorities expect the inflation rate to stay
around that figure for the foreseeable future. While the external current account continues to
register deficits, owing to the continued high imports of capital goods, the overall balance of
payments is in surplus and is expected to remain so in the period ahead, thanks to the
significant capital inflows from emigrant remittances. These have provided a sizeable source
of foreign exchange to the economy of Cape Verde and have been instrumental in supporting
the fixed exchange rate policy.
As regards the current review of the medium-term program, all quantitative performance
criteria at end-2004 were met with a substantial margin, and most structural objectives were
observed. For the structural performance criterion that was missed, that is the finalization of
the mechanism for adjusting electricity and water tariffs, for which discussions are underway
with relevant partners, my authorities are requesting a waiver, on the ground of corrective
actions taken to prepare the mechanism. Indeed, the authorities have completed the financial
model of the electricity and water company, Electra; the translation of the model into the
price adjustment mechanism is to be made by a consultant; and the publication of the
mechanism is now expected by end-June 2005.

As noted above, my authorities are fully aware of the many challenges the country faces in
the road to sustained robust economic growth and development over the longer term. These
include the relatively narrow export base and the resulting vulnerability to exogenous shocks,
especially the tourism sector which is susceptible to global security developments, economic
conditions in Europe and world oil prices. The high transportation costs, in particular
among the 9 islands of the archipelago add to the risks. To address these issues, my
authorities share the view that improving the flexibility and competitiveness of the economy
including through reduced transportation costs, attracting more foreign private investment,
continuing to improve the mobilization of domestic resources, and pursuing trade
liberalization and diversification are appropriate responses. The promotion of the tourism
sector remains a cornerstone of the development strategy, in light of the geographic
specificities of the archipelago. In this regard, recent public investment projects include the
new international airport in the capital city, Praia, and in the island of Boa Vista; and major
private investment comprises hotels in the islands of Sal and Boa Vista. The authorities
intend to pursue and enhance this long-term development strategy centered on the tourism
sector, while seeking economic diversification.
In a shorter time horizon, prospects for 2005 and for the medium term continue to be bright,
in light of the solid foundations already put in place by the authorities. The latter are
committed to maintaining prudent and sound macroeconomic policies and pursuing structural
reforms to: (i) boost the competitiveness of the Cape Verdean economy, especially in the
tourism sector through reduction of transportation costs; (ii) ensure economic diversification;
and (iii) maintain the current pace of economic growth. They fully share the view of a
private sector-led growth, putting private capital inflows and the privatization of state-owned
enterprises at the center of their policy and reform agenda. The companies still to be
transferred to the private sector include strategically important enterprises such as the freight
and passenger air service, TACV; the fishing storage company, INTERBASE, which will be
acquired by a consortium of Spanish and Cape Verdean investors; the operations of port
facilities, which are expected to be transferred from the port authority, ENAPOR, to the
private sector; and EMPROFAC, the enterprise in charge of imports and distribution of
pharmaceuticals, which privatization process has already started. However, my authorities
are strongly convinced that such private sector-led growth cannot be sustained without
development of reliable infrastructure. Accordingly, they have designated public investment
as a cornerstone of their economic strategy to support the development of a diversified
private sector.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities would like to point out the significant fiscal consolidation achieved by Cape
Verde over recent years, resulting in a reduction of fiscal deficit (including grants) to
1.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and to 2.5 percent on average over 2002-04, from 20 percent in
2000. A broad range of measures have contributed to this impressive outcome. They include
the strengthening of fiscal institutions and the introduction of a multiyear fiscal framework in
the context of the PRGF program, geared at improving tax administration and expenditure
planning. The quest for a broader-based and more efficient revenue mobilization, the new
VAT, reforms to streamline and rationalize taxes on imports, and reduction of customs duties

- 73 and excises have allowed to strengthen revenues. On the expenditure side, policy has focused
on restraining total expenditures as a share of GDP, including a reduction of transfers and
subsidies to large public enterprises, and on improving the composition of spending, shifting
the balance towards more resources committed to education, health and other priority sectors
identified in the PRSP. The stock of domestic arrears has been acknowledged and is being
cleared, including the payment of obligations due to the electricity and water company,
ELECTRA.
For 2005 and beyond, my authorities intend to maintain a prudent fiscal stance. This year, the
primary recurrent surplus is expected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP and the fiscal deficit
(including grants) will be kept below the 3 percent mark. Recurrent spending, notably the
wage bill, continues to be contained, albeit increments for the PRSP implementation and for
mitigating the adverse social impact of public enterprise restructuring. The needed capital
expenditures mentioned earlier will come from external concessional financing. To improve
the management of external public debt and help maintain the current debt sustainability, my
authorities are requesting technical assistance from the Fund in this area.
Monetary and External Sector Policies
My authorities intend to pursue a monetary policy that is consistent with sustained low
inflation and the accumulation of international reserves. In efforts to build and improve its
capacities for management and supervision, the BCV has reached an agreement with the
central bank of Luxembourg to manage part of its foreign reserves. Furthermore, the BCV is
elaborating plans to improve liquidity management and is committed to adopting the
International Financial Reporting Standards. For the latter, my authorities request the
technical assistance of the Fund. As stated above, the exchange rate regime has served the
economy well. The strong links of the Cape Verdean economy to Europe in terms of trade,
tourism and remittance flows have prevented an adverse effect of the euro appreciation on
the country’s external competitiveness. However, the vulnerability embodied in Cape
Verde’s narrow export base is a source of concern, and my authorities stand ready to improve
competitiveness through the reduction of production and transportation costs, and agree on
the need to advance export diversification.
On the financial sector, my authorities recognize the potential concerns stemming from the
high credit concentration, the duopolistic behavior of the two dominant banks, and the still
relatively weak capacity of commercial banks in risk assessment. They have stressed the
need to develop alternative sources of financing, comprising the registration of credit
institutions and leasing companies, in order to deepen financial intermediation. They are
currently considering policy measures in this direction. It is also their intention to explore
ways of deepening financial markets through the introduction of new indirect monetary
policy instruments and the revival of secondary markets and the stock exchange.
On trade issues, Cape Verde will consider further reforms over the next few years to bring
down tariffs. The country intends to take full advantage of the existing initiatives of the EU
and US under AGOA by continuing to improve the quality of export-oriented production,
and, my authorities remain committed to successful negotiations for WTO membership.

- 74 Structural Reforms
I would like to stress that significant achievements have been obtained by Cape Verde with
structural reforms in the fiscal, monetary, domestic resource mobilization, external debt
management capacities, and public enterprise restructuring areas during the current PRGF
arrangement. The issue of the government disagreements with ELECTRA is a complex one
deriving from the non-adjustment of energy tariffs to international oil prices and the
unobserved investment in new power capacities by the privatized electricity company. My
authorities recognize the need to settle the long-standing dispute promptly, so as to reduce
fiscal risks to the budget and allow the company to restore its financial health, meet the
growing demands for electricity and water and thus, help the country meet its developmental
goals. As stated above, the government has already cleared its arrears to ELECTRA on its
consumption of water and electricity. A recent agreement, reached with World Bank support,
will lead to the appointment of an independent mediator to help resolve these issues.
Some results in the structural front have been more mixed, especially as regards to the
implementation of the privatization agenda, mostly due to inadequate regulatory frameworks.
My authorities are taking corrective actions to strengthen the regulatory environment, with
the recent creation of several regulatory agencies.
PRSP Implementation
The implementation of the PRSP, which was approved in September 2004, will require
increased personnel spending in the areas of education, health and security, among others.
Since the approval, the authorities have focused on putting in place the institutions that are
needed to implement, monitor and assess the poverty reduction strategy, including the
creation, in the first half of this year, of the National Council for Poverty Reduction and the
Technical Secretariat.
Conclusion
My authorities intend to request a successor PRGF arrangement following the completion of
the current program at end-July 2005. This request is warranted by the continued economic
and social needs of the country and the remaining challenging reform agenda. The Fund and
other multilateral and bilateral partners have been instrumental in the economic and social
achievements of Cape Verde. My authorities are very appreciative of this support and would
like to see the continuation of this important assistance. They are also requesting technical
assistance in areas of weak capacities highlighted above. They also hope that the
international community will continue to provide them with much needed financial
assistance. My authorities are determined to continue to work closely with the Fund to help
the country sustain the achievements made thus far and meet the challenges in the period
ahead.
