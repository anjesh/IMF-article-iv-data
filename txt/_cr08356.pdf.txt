KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2008 Consultation with the Kingdom of Swaziland
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Anthony R. Boote
October 1, 2008
Date: July 23–August 5, 2008.
Team: Ms. Soonthornsima (head), Messrs. Torrez, Fontaine, Davoodi (all AFR), and
Bartholomew (MCM), Ms. Gesami (OED), and Mr. Van Houtte (World Bank) also
participated.
Staff met with senior government officials including Prime Minister Dlamini, the
Cabinet, Finance Minister Sithole and Central Bank Governor Dlamini. Staff also
conducted an outreach seminar for public officials, representatives of the private sector,
labor unions, media and donors.
Swaziland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2–4; it maintains two
exchange restrictions arising from limits on the provision of foreign exchange for
advance payments for imports: (i) an overall limit of E 250,000, and (ii) a 33.33 percent
limit for the import of certain capital goods. The Swazi lilangeni is pegged at par with
the South African rand, which is also legal tender.
Statistical quality is adequate for surveillance, but there is scope for improvement
especially in national accounts and balance of payments data.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

High rates of economic growth remain elusive and downside risks have increased.
Growth recovered moderately in 2007, but inflation escalated into double digits, initially
owing to high food and fuel prices. High Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
revenue contributed to the second consecutive budget surplus, an improved current
account, and a build-up of international reserves. The authorities anticipate higher
growth rates than the staff but agreed that the growth was still too low. The global
economic slowdown and the high food and fuel prices increase downside risks.

•

Growth could be bolstered by fiscal and structural reforms to improve the
investment climate, address financial sector vulnerabilities, and control the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. The authorities generally agreed with the reforms recommended but noted that
capacity constraints limit the pace of their implementation.

•

Fiscal adjustment is needed to mitigate the risks of high dependence on SACU
revenue, given their likely eventual decline, and to safeguard macroeconomic
stability. High SACU revenues currently provide an opportunity for orderly fiscal and
structural reforms that could increase fiscal savings and GDP growth. Staff
recommended efforts toward an improvement in the quality of expenditure, domestic
revenue measures, streamlining expenditures, and public finance management. The
authorities indicated that enormous social needs and political constraints, including the
program of the government elected in September, could limit fiscal consolidation.

•

The level of the exchange rate seems broadly adequate, but competitiveness
remains a concern. Efforts should focus on structural reforms, such as enhancing the
investment climate and governance. As a member of the Common Monetary Area
(CMA), the authorities have limited independence in monetary policy and should keep
the policy interest rate as close as possible to South Africa’s to help control inflation
while mitigating capital outflows.

•

To alleviate the impact of high food and fuel prices while being fiscally responsible,
the authorities should focus assistance on the most vulnerable within the population
and use the existing distribution channels to deliver such assistance. Staff
recommended liberalization of food imports, prompt pass-through of exogenous price
increases, and better coordination among stakeholders.

•

To safeguard financial stability, prompt actions are required to tighten supervision
of saving and credit cooperatives and address pyramid schemes. Beginning with the
privatization of the government-owned bank is a welcome step. The requirement that
insurance and retirement funds invest domestically should be reconsidered, with a view
to gradual phase-out, because it could reduce returns and undermine deepening of the
financial sector. Several financial bills should be enacted as soon as possible.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
High and sustained economic growth remains elusive. Real GDP growth is lower
than the 5 percent government target for effectively reducing poverty. Growth prospects are
clouded by low investments, slow pace of economic reforms, and deterioration of preferential

The first parliamentary election under the new constitution took place on
September 19 using the traditional tinkhundla system—a grass roots system of local
government and chiefdoms (Swaziland is a constitutional monarchy). A new Cabinet is
expected to be sworn in during October 2008.

The 2007 census showed the population had increased to 1,018 million from 980 million in 1997.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
As Swaziland recovered from the 2006 drought, real GDP growth in 2007 rose to
3.5 percent, and inflation escalated. Growth was also driven by increases in output in
services and manufacturing. Inflation reached 9.8 percent at the end of 2007 as food and fuel
prices rose. By the end of July 2008, inflation was at 13.4 percent. The authorities have
responded to the recent surges of food, fuel and transportation prices mainly through a
delayed pass-through of price increases.2 In 2008 average inflation is expected to be about
13 percent based on second-round effects from double-digit wage settlements, and despite
recent declines in global fuel prices. Interest rates generally have risen in line with those of
South Africa but the authorities decided in June 2008 not to match a 50 basis point increase
by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB).

In 2007/08 high SACU transfers contributed to the second consecutive budget
surplus (6.4 percent of GDP), an improved current account, and an accumulation of
international reserves. The recent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate along with the
South African rand, to which it is pegged, is possibly having a positive impact on the export
sector. External debt in 2007 declined to 16.7 percent of GDP, and international reserves
reached the equivalent of 3.5 months of imports.

2

Between June 2007 and June 2008 the price of maize increased by 38 percent, bread by 58 percent, milk by
11 percent, and rice by 100 percent. Bus fares increased by 60 percent in August. Despite relying mainly on
imports from South Africa, electricity prices have been increased only with delays and at a more gradual pace
than in South Africa. Swazi electricity prices increased in July, after the South African price increase announced
in April.

Since the last consultation the authorities have consolidated international
reserves at the central bank (CBS) and enhanced supervision of the financial sector, but
have done little to tighten expenditures and reform the civil service. The 2008/09 budget
forecasts increased expenditure by 7 percent of GDP to 40.3 percent and the wage bill to rise
to 16.7 percent of GDP. Under the 2007 Revenue Authority (RA) Act, the authorities have
established the RA and are recruiting staff. With insurance sector liberalization, four new
companies started up in 2008. The authorities have begun the process of privatizing the
government owned Swazi Bank and of supervising saving and credit cooperatives (SCCOs.)
7.
With current policies, medium-term prospects are not encouraging and subject
to substantial risks that could undermine macroeconomic stability. Growth could be
further hampered by uncertainties about the viability and timing of investment projects, low
competitiveness scores, an investment climate that keeps the cost of doing business high, and
the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Staff therefore expects a growth slowdown to less than
3 percent annually, although the authorities, anticipating investment projects, expect growth
rates of at least 3 percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen as tariff protection
in the SACU market is eliminated, and preferential prices for sugar in the EU market are
reduced.3 Furthermore, recent global financial market developments may have an adverse
impact on the country’s financial sector should South African banks, which dominate the
sector, suffer significant losses. The outlook is further clouded by a fiscal stance that is
overly dependent on SACU revenue, high inflation, and a vulnerable financial sector.

3

Sugar prices to the EU will fall by 17.3 percent in 2008 and by a further 19 percent in 2009.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Box 1. Summary of the 2007 Consultation Discussions
Directors expressed concern about the slow pace of economic growth that lags behind most of
other lower middle income countries, emphasized the need to ensure fiscal sustainability and
safeguard priority spending to address urgent social needs (HIV/AIDS and unemployment).
The Fund encouraged the authorities to use the buoyant SACU revenues to accelerate fiscal
and structural reforms aimed at securing macroeconomic stability and addressing impediments
to higher growth and poverty reduction. It commended the authorities’ efforts in rebuilding
international reserves, strengthening banking supervision, and the passage of key financial
legislation. Finally, directors recommended the timely implementation of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy and Action Program and in line with the medium-term fiscal expenditure
framework.

A. Fiscal Sustainability and Reforms
8.
Swaziland’s fiscal stance is highly dependent on SACU revenues but these are
not likely to be sustained, based on: (i) a call by South Africa to revisit the revenue-sharing
formula; (ii) a slowdown in South Africa’s economic growth; (iii) a reduction in common
external tariff rates due to trade liberalization; and (iv) possible transformation of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) into a customs union, which would
imply lower shares for SACU members.

10.
To help put in context recent fiscal surpluses owing to temporary surges of
SACU revenue, the non-SACU fiscal balance is used to estimate the deficit and level of
adjustment needed for fiscal sustainability. 4 Based on “normal” SACU revenue of
13 percent of GDP (the average for 1996/97–2004/05), staff targeted a sustainable nonSACU deficit of 16.8 percent of GDP. However, the authorities project a non-SACU deficit
of 26.8 percent of GDP in the 2008/09 budget. Staff estimates that without reform, the fiscal
imbalance would worsen, with non-SACU deficits of about 22 percent over the medium
term.
11.
To achieve sustainable fiscal balances, staff proposed a phased implementation
of revenue and expenditure reforms while providing for more spending on high-priority
sectors. Measures to immediately improve tax administration and introduce the VAT in the
next few years should increase revenue by about 2 percent of GDP by 2013/14.5 Civil service
reform could bring the wage bill back to 12 percent of GDP, about the level in 2004/05—
though the sub-Saharan African average is 7.3 percent to GDP. Expenditure reform should
therefore combine consolidation, reorientation, and quality improvements to reduce spending
by about 2 percent of GDP and allow fiscal space to facilitate economic growth and reduce
poverty. On civil service reform, the performance management system, developed with the
Botswana National Productivity Board, needs to be implemented promptly; it should involve
redeployment toward prioritized sectors such as health care while promoting increased
productivity, transparency, and accountability.6 Though they concurred with the staff
4

The non-SACU fiscal balance is defined as the overall fiscal balance excluding SACU revenues (see the 2007
Selected Issues Paper). A sustainable non-SACU fiscal balance allows for maintaining international reserves at
about three months of imports, sufficient to support confidence in the currency peg and a low debt burden.

5
6

In 2007 the revenue administration consultant estimated that only 20 percent of collectible tax is collected.

Human resource allocations should better reflect priority sectors. For example, in 2007/08, only 7 percent of
the wage bill was for the health sector; education received 37 percent and protection services 27 percent.

10
analysis, the authorities admitted that social pressures and a cumbersome bureaucracy had
delayed implementation.

Improvement in public expenditure management and assurance that spending is
of high quality is crucial to successful fiscal adjustment. Poor coordination of budget
execution across government agencies has resulted in under-spending for some, arrears for
others, and frequent supplementary budgets. To better manage public expenditure, the
authorities highlighted continuing improvement of the procurement system and reform of the
Public Finance Management Act. Staff underscored the need to assess expenditure and
budget allocation on the basis of the social rate of return and government priorities in health,
education, and agriculture, consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action
Program (PRSAP).
13.
Staff proposed an alternative scenario based on fiscal and structural reforms,
preferably starting in 2008/09, that could generate GDP growth of about 4 percent over
the medium term. With reforms, the saving-investment balance should improve and foreign
investment and donor financing be attracted, thus helping to raise GDP growth. Improved
fiscal surpluses will help sustain reserves at more than 3.5 months of imports of goods and

11
services7 while reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 8 percent by 2012. While agreeing
with staff on the risk to SACU revenues and the need for fiscal adjustments, the authorities
identified political constraints and enormous social needs as formidable challenges to fiscal
consolidation. Nonetheless, the authorities plan to save this year’s unbudgeted SACU

fiscal and current account surpluses.

B. External Stability and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
Sufficient international reserves are critical to safeguard external stability and
confidence in the currency peg with South Africa, which has served the country well. Staff
supported the authorities’ policy to have reserves of at least three months of import cover.
The authorities believe that this level is appropriate in relation to the domestic monetary base
(reflecting the free circulation of the rand) and external debt, while preserving confidence in
the peg and serving as a cushion against adverse external shocks.

7

Neighboring countries have higher import coverage: Botswana, more than 26 months; Lesotho, about seven
months; and South Africa 3.7 months. Only Namibia has lower import coverage at 2.8 months.

15.
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Swaziland has very low debt
Tables 7 and 8). Since 2002 despite the most recent depreciation, total public sector debt has
declined, reflecting in part limited new borrowing and an exchange rate appreciation between
2003 and 2006. As a lower-medium-income country, Swaziland has limited access to
concessionary loans; any large increases in external debt would carry high interest costs.
16.
The level of the exchange rate seems broadly adequate and the exchange rate
regime is appropriate. The assessment of the exchange rate level is based on two
methodologies. The purchasing power parity methodology, adjusted for productivity
differentials, indicates no misalignment as of 2008. The external sustainability approach
indicates that stabilizing the current account at the net foreign asset (NFA) position as of
2007 would imply a somewhat stronger current account than projected, which could imply
some overvaluation of the real exchange rate. Yet there are no other clear signs of an
overvaluation and the depreciation of the real exchange rate since 2006 has boosted
Swaziland’s exports. As to the exchange rate regime, staff and the authorities agreed that the
currency peg under the CMA should be maintained because it facilitates capital and current
transactions with the country’s most important economic partner, South Africa.

fiscal policy—
competitiveness should be pursued through structural reforms that improve the investment
climate and compensate for eroding trade preferences. Staff acknowledged that—despite the
depreciation in 2008 of the rand—Swaziland’s lackluster export performance was, to a large
part, due to lower preferential prices for sugar exports to the EU. Loss of preferences in the
textiles sector is aggravated by escalating wage and other operational costs, labor strikes, and
prospects for that sector do not look encouraging.

The financial sector faces some vulnerabilities from weaknesses in one bank and
emerging vulnerabilities from the fast growth of insufficiently regulated SCCOs and the
emergence of pyramid schemes. In 2008 the number of nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs) has grown significantly as they attempt to take advantage of the liquidity surge from
the requirement that all insurance and retirement funds must increase their holdings of
domestic assets from 10 to 30 percent of total assets through 2009. The emergence of
pyramid schemes, offering inordinately high rates of return, could also pose significant risks
to the financial sector if left unchecked because they face constant rollover risks and are very
likely to fail. Staff reiterated the urgency of prompt enactment and full implementation of the
Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), Security, Payment System and Clearance
bills to under gird the soundness of the financial sector, prevent regulatory arbitrage, and
facilitate deepening of the sector. The authorities welcomed the financial sector strategy note
prepared by staff emphasizing the need for deepening.

21.
The authorities have approved privatization of Swazi Bank and are monitoring
bank lending to the sugar industry. On Swazi Bank, an advisory committee concurred with
the staff view that any privatization strategy should be preceded by separation of its
development and commercial activities. As prospects for the sugar sector weaken, staff urged
the authorities to closely monitor loans to the industry and further scrutinize the risk
management practices of banks. It is imperative that revised loan provisioning requirements
be issued and enforced.
22.
To better supervise and regulate SCCOs, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives (MACO) and the CBS have begun a technical collaboration plan. The plan
sets prudential standards for SCCOs and provides for training of MACO staff to better
monitor financial soundness, enforce compliance, and compile information relevant to
monitoring SCCOs. MACO should move quickly to preserve the assets of some insolvent
SCCOs to ensure public confidence in that sector.
23.
The recent emergence of pyramid schemes has increased the threat they pose to
the stability of the financial system. These entities as yet are relatively small. The
authorities have warned the public of the risks and have taken legal action against some

2007

15
operators. Staff urges further efforts, such as formalizing coordinated efforts among financial
sector regulators, improving internal processes for dealing with fraudulent financial
operations, and passing legislation prohibiting such operations.
24.
Concerning the insurance and retirement sector, a recently announced domestic
investment requirement should be reconsidered. Staff noted that, in the absence of deep
markets, the requirement—at least 10 percent by 2007 and 30 percent by 2009 of investable
funds will need to be held in Swazi assets—could lead to severe distortions, discourage
investment flows to Swaziland and undermine efforts to develop the financial sector in the
country. It argued that implementation experience to date showed that some insurance and
retirement funds are merely displacing commercial bank lending and some are rerouted offshore without financing new capital formation in Swaziland. Hence, staff recommended that
the requirement should be gradually phased out.
D. Response to the Fuel and Food Price Increases
25.
The recent surges of food and fuel prices have significantly affected the poor and
created special challenges for the authorities. Staff discussed policy options for dealing
with surging prices, focusing on fiscal viability, minimization of market distortions, and
effective and timely delivery to target groups. Staff recommended liberalization of food
imports (e.g., maize) and providing assistance through already extensive food distribution
programs. The policy of delaying the price pass-through should be abolished to depoliticize
price adjustments and eliminate market distortion. Because Swaziland faces frequent food
shortages, the authorities need to implement long-term solutions that are consistent with their
sectoral policy while remaining fiscally sustainable. The National Disaster Management
Agency needs to improve coordination of stakeholders on the food security issue. The
authorities agreed that targeted assistance to the most vulnerable groups is appropriate, but
are concerned about increasing public outcry for more interventionist programs, mostly
general subsidies for commodities, and for agricultural inputs and finance.
26.
In September, in response to the surges of food and fuel prices, the “food price
crisis” committee proposed several measures to the Cabinet, but it remains unclear
when implementation will take place. These measures are consistent with the
Comprehensive Agricultural Strategy and the National Program for Food Security. Shortterm measures include improvements to the food distribution provided by the World Food
Program and other donors, provision of cash transfers, and removal of levies on dairy and
wheat products. Other recommendations included subsidies to boost maize production and
implementation of the agricultural strategy.

economic growth are major risks to

Swaziland. Growth prospects are
seriously constrained by a low
investment-to-GDP ratio, a poor
investment climate, recurrent droughts,
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the high
cost of doing business. Failure to
implement other structural and land reforms further reduces growth prospects. The PRSAP
approved last year could be the basis for strategies and policies to reduce poverty, but it
needs a clearer implementation strategy and measures of tangible progress.

needs to channel domestic resources to

PPPs should be cautious given the country’s limited institutional capacity, inadequate legal
framework, and the need to mitigate fiscal risks. Deepening the financial sector should help
improve resource allocation.

Private-sector-led growth is severely constrained by concerns about Swaziland’s
competitiveness and governance issues (Figure 1). To address these issues, staff
recommended that the authorities implement the recommendations of the Swaziland Investor
Roadmap Study (2005) and the Investment Climate Assessment (2008) prepared by the
World Bank. The authorities welcomed the World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note to help them
address competitiveness, governance, and HIV/AIDS issues. They also noted that enactment
of the Companies and Competition Bills in 2008 provides a legal framework for businesses
to flourish, and expected the one-stop shop at the Swaziland Investment Promotion Agency
to help reduce the cost of doing business. An anticorruption commissioner was appointed in
2008 and work has started on bringing corruption cases before the court. However, serious
constraints within the court system could hinder the work.

Swaziland continues to promote regional economic integration and negotiate
trade agreements in order to increase market access for its exports. Discussions continue
within SADC to initiate a free trade area and eventually a SADC customs union. In
2007Swaziland and four other SADC members initialed an Interim Economic Partnership
Agreement with the EU for duty- and quota-free access to the EU market. Negotiations have
also been concluded on a SACU-EFTA (European Free Trade Association) free trade
agreement. SACU is negotiating with the US on a Trade Investment Development and
Cooperation Agreement (TIDCA) and with the Latin American trading block MERCOSUR
on a preferential trade agreement.
31.
The authorities are taking steps to mitigate the adverse effects of HIV/AIDS
(Box 2). A plan will be provided to the Global Fund that details the use of $81 million that
was awarded in 2007. The authorities are currently considering a multiyear plan to: (i) scale
up investment in education of young children and orphans left behind by HIV/AIDS,
providing them with free meals and reducing drop-out rates; (ii) provide short-term child
support grants with assistance from the World Bank and IFC; and (iii) scale up use of
antiretroviral therapy.

Box 2. Macroeconomic Impact of HIV/AIDS in Swaziland
HIV/AIDS presents formidable longer-term challenges for Swaziland. Cross-country studies of
the impact of HIV/AIDS on growth range from insignificant or very modest to losses of more than 2
percentage points a year. HIV/AIDS affects growth negatively by, among other things, lowering life
expectancy, reducing incentives for human and physical capital formation, and limiting productivity
growth.
Staff estimates based on two studies1 suggest
that if life expectancy (a measure of health and
human capital) had stayed at 57 years— the
level in mid-1990s before HIV/AIDS
accelerated and growth decelerated—instead of
the current estimate of 41 years, Swaziland’s
per capita GDP growth would have been higher
on average by 1.3 percentage points a year.

Using a different methodology, the
International Labor Organization (2004)
estimates that HIV/AIDS reduced per capita GDP growth in Swaziland on average by 1.8 percentage
points each year from 1992 through 2002.
Source: World Bank's World Development Indicators.

The adverse impact on education could be sizable, increasing the burden on future
generations. According to the ILO (2004), in Swaziland the cost of hiring and training teachers to
replace those lost to HIV/AIDS is projected to reach US$233 million (8 percent of 2007 GDP) by
2016.
The toll on Swaziland’s agriculture, a major source of earnings for a large segment of the
population, could be heavy. HIV/AIDS can lower the agricultural labor supply, reduce the
productivity of affected farmers, as well as the income needed for purchasing farm inputs. These
effects have resulted in an estimated 54 percent reduction in production of maize and 34 percent
reduction in land cultivation (UNAIDS, 2002).
The impact on Swaziland’s businesses is significantly larger than in comparator countries that
also suffer from HIV/AIDS. According to the 2007 World bank investment climate assessment
survey, over 50 percent of company managers reported much higher worker absenteeism due to
sickness than other countries in Southern Africa. Among the workers surveyed, 25 percent reported
being sick in the previous 30 days compared with less that 20 percent in Botswana and Namibia.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Achieving government’s target growth over the medium term remains elusive,
without prompt structural reforms. Risks stem from the eventual decline of SACU
revenues and emerging financial vulnerabilities. The short-term outlook is further clouded by
a global economic slowdown and the adverse impact of high food and fuel prices. Timely
economic and structural reforms, increasing investment, and aggressively tackling the
HIV/AIDS epidemic are necessary to stimulate growth and reduce poverty.
33.
Because SACU revenues are expected to stay high in the next few years, they
offer an opportunity for Swaziland to generate fiscal savings to help smooth out
expenditure later when SACU revenues decline and to safeguard economic stability, address
structural reforms, and improve the effectiveness of public policy. The authorities should
take immediate steps to reduce the level of expenditures in 2008/09 and make further
adjustments in the 2009/10 budget and the medium-term fiscal policy framework.
Operationalizing the Revenue Authority and introducing the VAT could increase domestic
revenue significantly. Much-needed spending reform requires improving the quality of
expenditure, tangible civil service reform, and better assessment of investments. Expenditure
must be reoriented toward priority sectors to reduce widespread poverty.
34.
The monetary regime under the CMA, including the exchange rate peg to the
rand have served the country well given Swaziland’s economic integration with South
Africa. Fiscal and structural adjustment is required to support confidence in the peg and
ensure external stability. With comfortable reserve levels, the exchange rate does not appear
to be misaligned. Monetary policy should stay tight to limit the effects from surges of food
and fuel prices, and the CBS should keep its policy rate as close as possible to the SARB’s.
35.
Improvement of the financial position of the Swazi Bank through privatization,
tighter supervision of SCCOs, and addressing pyramid schemes are priorities for
preserving financial stability. Prompt enactment of financial sector bills will help safeguard
financial stability. Addressing pyramid schemes implies better coordination among domestic
and regional financial regulators, improving internal processes for dealing with fraudulent
operations, and passing laws prohibiting pyramid operations. For the insurance and
retirement funds, the domestic investment requirement should be reconsidered, with a view
to gradual phase-out because it could create a nonmarket risk premium and make it harder to
deepen the financial sector if the market perceives it to be a move toward capital control.
36.
Responses to food and fuel price surges should focus on the most vulnerable
population, using existing distribution channels for food delivery and liberalizing food
imports. General subsidies and delayed pass-through of price adjustment should be
discouraged.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Swaziland be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

SACU: Southern African Customs Union. SACU transfers in the current account does not reflect the true level of SACU revenue because of the particular
treatment of those transfers in the accounts where the authorities make an estimate based on the level of imports and adjust in 'other investment' to reflect
the total SACU revenues.

For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

6

The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and

Projections
2009
2010
2011

For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

8

The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

2

Gross debt of the general government.
Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3
The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4
The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Lilangeni (plural: Emalangeni) continues to be pegged at parity to the South African
rand, which—alongside with the Lilangeni—is also legal tender. The intervention currency is
the U.S. dollar; exchange rates for the U.S. dollar are based on the floating middle rate of the
South African rand against the U.S. dollar. The rate on August 31, 2008 was
E1 = US$0.1301185
Swaziland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2–4; it maintains two
exchange restrictions arising from limits on the provision of foreign exchange for advance
payments for imports: (i) an overall limit of E 250,000, and (ii) a 33.33 percent limit for the
import of certain capital goods. The Swazi lilangeni is pegged at par with the South African
rand, which is also legal tender.

III. SWAZILAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff’s
analysis was affected by shortcomings in certain areas, including the national accounts and
the external sector. The authorities provide available data to the Fund with a lag of one to two
months, except for the national accounts and international trade data, which are reported
irregularly.
GDDS metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
February 11, 2003. The metadata for all sectors—except the financial sector—were updated
in October 2005, subsequently the financial sector metadata were updated in October 2007.
Swaziland has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the development of its
national statistical system and participates in the GDDS Project for Anglophone African
Countries. Under this project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development
(DFID)), the country participates in the national accounts and the monetary and financial
statistics modules with the Fund, and in the labor statistics and agricultural statistics with the
World Bank. Swaziland’s Central Statistical Office has a webpage
(http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=75) that needs updating.
Real sector statistics
STA GDDS missions have resulted in significant improvements in the national accounts.
Current and constant price (base=2000) GDP estimates are now available from both the
production and expenditure approaches. These new estimates have not yet been published, as
there are still some shortcomings concerning the treatment of Southern African Customs
Union revenue. For national accounts data, AFR missions rely on estimates provided by the
Central Statistical Office (CSO). The authorities are planning the first labor force survey with
support from the World Bank/GDDS project.
Price statistics
The consumer price index was significantly revised in May 2007 with technical assistance
provided in the context of the GDDS initiative. The dissemination of the new consumer price
index is a significant milestone for the CSO. Four new geographical indices, as well as a
national index, with updated market basket weights, are now available. These new consumer
price indices incorporate improvements in compilation methodology, market basket
coverage, flexibility for introducing new pricing outlets and new varieties of products, and
enhanced processing capabilities. Monthly consumer price data are published by the CSO
with a one-month lag. For International Financial Statistics (IFS) purposes, the consumer
price index is reported at the national level for the all-income group.
Government finance statistics
Fiscal data are provided to AFR staff only during missions and/or following budget
announcements. The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) reports fiscal data on central
government operations to STA for publication in IFS and the GFS Yearbook on an irregular
basis and with significant lags–the latest data are for 2003. Data on transactions in financial
assets and liabilities are not reported. A June 2003 mission reviewed government finance

8
statistics (GFS) compilation and introduced the GFSM 2001 framework. An October 2003
mission made recommendations to improve the coverage, classification and consistency of
fiscal statistics. A June GFS 2004 mission further developed the bridge tables and derivation
tables used to compile GFS, assisted in the reconciliation of the fiscal and monetary
accounts, and made recommendations concerning these topics, as well as the extra budgetary
accounts, the Ministry of Finance Economic Classification Spreadsheet, budget
classification, and data dissemination. A mission in July 2008 found that resources assigned
to GFS are extremely limited and that differences in institutional coverage largely explain the
large discrepancies between operations and financing data. The mission recommended the
elaboration of standardized GFS reports directly from the accounting system.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBS uses the standardized forms to report monthly monetary and financial statistics to
STA, and data are reported on a timely basis. The 2006 MFS mission noted that substantial
improvements were achieved, particularly in the data for the CBS. The mission found that,
some progress had been made in the reporting of data on the other depository corporations
(ODCs), but quality problems remained. The majority of the ODCs reported various degrees
of difficulty in providing accurate data to the CBS. The mission recommended that the CBS
arrange regular meetings with the ODCs to promote improved classification and
sectorization. The CBS started to include the Swaziland Building Society into the monetary
data backdated to December 2006. However, the credit and savings cooperatives,
representing about 8 percent of the deposits of the commercial banks, are still outside the
deposit corporations’ survey. A recent MFS mission discussed the proper treatment of
pension funds and insurance companies in the financial survey.
Balance of payments statistics
The CSO publishes data on foreign trade on a quarterly basis, but the lack of sufficient
computer resources results in long lags in the production of trade data, especially regarding
imports. AFR missions use trade data provided by the CBS. The CBS publishes balance of
payments statistics on a semiannual and annual basis. It now adheres to a methodology
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Shortcomings in the
timeliness and availability of data need to be addressed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Kingdom of Swaziland
On October 17, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Swaziland.1
Background
Growth recovered moderately in 2007 to 3.5 percent, but inflation escalated into double digits—
initially owing to high food and fuel prices. Sustained high rates of economic growth remain
elusive, clouded by low investment climate, the slow pace of economic reforms, deterioration of
preferential treatment of Swaziland’s main exports, and arising financial sector vulnerabilities.
The years of persistently low growth have led to high unemployment and rising poverty; a
situation made worse by the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS that suppresses productivity.
High Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenue contributed to the second consecutive
budget surplus −-despite expanded public expenditure, an improved current account and a
build-up of international reserves to a comfortable level. The recent depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate along with the South African rand, to which it is pegged, impacted positively on
the export sector.
Swaziland’s inflation rate increased from 9.8 percent at end 2007 to 13.4 percent end-July
2008, reflecting rising food and fuel prices. To mitigate the surge on commodity prices, the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
government uses a delayed-pass-through policy for some items. Interest rates generally have
risen in line with developments in South Africa but the authorities decided in June 2008 not to
match the latest 50 basis point increase by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
The outlook is subject to several risks: high dependence on SACU revenues, which is unlikely
to be sustained; uncertainties about the viability and timing of investment projects; low
competitiveness sores; an investment climate that keeps the cost of doing business high; the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS; the external environment and emerging financial sector vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strengthening of Swaziland’s current account balance and
external reserve position in 2007. At the same time, Directors noted that Swaziland’s economic
growth is low by regional standards, and that poverty and social indicators remain weak. Fuel
and food price shocks have also increased inflationary pressures. Directors cautioned that the
global financial turmoil could add to the downside risks and the challenges posed by an
HIV/AIDS epidemic and the erosion of trade preferences. Therefore, they recommended
continued pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and determined implementation of structural
reforms to stimulate private sector development.
Directors commended the government’s achievement of budget surpluses in 2006 and 2007.
They urged continued fiscal restraint in 2008 and beyond to ensure medium-term fiscal
sustainability in light of the projected decline in revenue from the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU), on which the budget is heavily dependent. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to save windfall SACU revenues in 2008. Directors encouraged the authorities to press
ahead with revenue and expenditure reforms to achieve a sustainable non-SACU fiscal position.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax
administration, in particular through the introduction of a value added tax and the establishment
of a Revenue Authority. They stressed the importance of strengthening public expenditure
management and re-orienting public spending toward infrastructure and priority social sectors.
The on-going enhancements to the procurement system and the forthcoming reform of the
Public Finance Management Act were also viewed as crucial. Directors emphasized the need
for civil service reform to lower the relatively high government wage bill and achieve better
service delivery.
Directors agreed that Swaziland’s membership in the Common Monetary Area and the currency
peg to the South African rand continue to serve the country well. They supported the build-up of
international reserves to maintain confidence in the peg. They noted the staff’s assessment that
the real effective exchange rate is broadly adequate at present. To improve growth prospects
and compensate for eroding trade preferences, Directors encouraged the authorities to
accelerate structural reforms.
Directors observed that, notwithstanding limited monetary independence and historical practice,
the Central Bank of Swaziland decided in June 2008 not to increase its policy rate to match the

3
increase in the repo rate of the South African Reserve Bank. They encouraged the Central Bank
of Swaziland to monitor closely developments in inflation and capital flows, and to stand ready
to adjust its policy rate as needed with a view to keeping it as close as possible to the repo rate
of the South African Reserve Bank.
Directors observed that the banking sector remains well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with
low non-performing loans. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to privatize the governmentowned bank. However, Directors considered the recent growth of non-bank financial institutions,
with inadequate regulation and supervision, to be a cause for concern. They stressed that
tighter supervision of savings and credit cooperatives is a priority for preserving financial
stability. In this connection, they urged timely passage of pending financial legislation and early
implementation of the Financial Service and Regulatory Authority. The emergence of pyramid
schemes calls for swift and decisive actions, as such schemes pose additional risks to financial
stability. Directors also encouraged increased cross-border collaboration among regional
supervisory agencies. Most Directors encouraged the authorities to reconsider the requirement
that insurance and pension funds invest a portion of their assets locally, noting that it could
reduce return on these funds.
Directors believed that the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Plan approved last year
provides a sound basis for reducing poverty, and advised that its implementation and monitoring
strategies be clarified. They welcomed the recently-adopted measures to improve the
investment climate and to minimize the impact of the erosion of trade preferences, particularly
those to reduce corruption and improve governance, and encouraged further progress.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ response to food and fuel price shocks. They recommended
that measures to alleviate the impact of high food and fuel prices focus on the most vulnerable
population and effectively utilize existing distribution channels to deliver assistance. Prompt and
automatic pass-through of international price increases would also help depoliticize price
adjustments.
A few Directors supported a review of Swaziland’s classification as a lower middle-income
country, in light of the country’s weak social indicators.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Alternate Executive Director for the Kingdom of Swaziland
and Rachel Kemunto Gesami, Advisor to Executive Director
October 17, 2008
1.
My authorities wish to acknowledge the Fund’s engagement, support, and productive
dialogue. They thank the staff for the well-balanced set of reports, which clearly identifies
the challenges for their country’s development process, as well as the various policy options
for medium to long term. We are in broad agreement with the thrust of the analyses,
conclusions, and recommendations in the reports.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
Swaziland's economic performance has been positive in several areas since the
recovery from the 2006 drought, but overall performance has remained below the levels
attained in other lower middle-income countries. The modest rebound in GDP growth of 3.5
percent in 2007 has been difficult to sustain because of several external shocks, including the
rise of food and fuel prices, and the restrictions on export outlets for sugar and textiles
following the end of the Multi-Fibre Agreement. Inflation, estimated to have increased to an
annual average of 8.3 percent in 2007 because of rising food and oil prices, has accelerated.
However, the budget recorded a second consecutive surplus (6.4 percent of GDP) and
international reserves rose to the equivalent of 3.5 months of imports in 2007 on the strength
of higher SACU receipts. The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) has tightened its monetary
policy stance by increasing its discount rate and the issuance of securities. Although the
banking sector has been adequately supervised, supervision of the savings and credit
cooperative sector has had to be enhanced by the monetary authority. Further, the authorities
have begun the process of privatizing the government owned commercial bank. They are also
working towards deepening the financial sector and strengthening its institutional and legal
structure to enhance resource allocation and provide a safeguard for its operation.
3.
Swaziland has been facing uncertainties and difficulties in attracting foreign direct
investments. Low competitiveness scores, an investment climate that keeps the cost of doing
business high, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other social challenges remain daunting for
the authorities. These adverse factors, together with the current surges in food and fuel
prices, have aggravated the unemployment situation and poverty. The classification of
Swaziland as a lower middle-income country has added another dimension that has
contributed to denying the country concessional resources to fight HIV/AIDS and reduce
poverty.
4.
These challenges notwithstanding, the authorities have embarked on a number of
economic and structural reforms aimed at enhancing economic growth to levels comparable
to those achieved by other countries in the region. They are fully aware that the process of
reform implementation requires them to be resolute.

2
Fiscal Developments
5.
The authorities recognize the importance of pursuing a prudent fiscal policy as the
main instrument to restoring macroeconomic stability and engendering satisfactory economic
growth. Increased pro-poor fiscal outlays in 2008/2009 have been made to address the
problems of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, worsening social indicators, and deepening poverty.
The authorities have, however, taken steps to reduce other expenditures in 2008/09, with
further adjustments to come in 2009/2010. In order to better manage public expenditures, the
government is highlighting improvement of the procurement system, reform of Public
Finance Management Act, and support for the reform of public enterprises. They also plan to
assess expenditure and budget allocation based on social rate of return and government
priorities in social services consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action
Program (PRSAP).
6.
The authorities plan to focus on reducing the fiscal deficit, excluding SACU
revenues, and increasing domestic revenues over the medium term. This approach would
help the adjustment needed to ensure fiscal sustainability and smooth expenditure over the
medium term. Operationalizing the Revenue Authority Act will introduce the requisite
institutional framework and facilitate improvements in revenue collection. In addition, the
authorities intend to strengthen revenue administration with the introduction of VAT.
7.
The authorities are committed to implement civil service reforms, including reduction
in the wage bill and implementation of performance contracts. They, however, are aware of
the difficulties involved, including the predicament of right-sizing the civil service in a
relatively weak economic environment and high unemployment. Of particular challenge is
developing the appropriate safety nets to mitigate the adverse effects of the envisaged civil
service right-sizing.
8.
The authorities intend to continue with reorienting expenditure toward priority sectors
in order to enhance economic growth and reduce widespread poverty. In this regard, further
efforts are needed to ensure that the framework for macroeconomic stability is consistent
with the PRSAP. They recognize the increasing challenges, especially in the medium to long
term, of meeting the health and education needs of its youthful population. In an effort to
revitalize the health sector, they have embarked on a comprehensive review to begin a
process of zero-based budgeting for the sector.
Response to the Food and Fuel Price Increases
9.
The authorities are committed to dealing with the high food and fuel prices, focusing
on fiscal viability, minimization of market distortions, and effective delivery of essential
services and support to the most vulnerable groups. They plan to discourage general
subsidies and undue delay in passing through of price increases. The National Disaster
Management Agency will be working on improving coordination among all stakeholders.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Developments and Financial Sector Reform
10.
The Swazi authorities consider the regime of the Common Monetary Authority
(CMA), including the peg to the rand, as having served the country well and remaining
appropriate. Going forward, the authorities plan to maintain a tight monetary stance in order
to address the second round effects of food and fuel price increases. They are also committed
to strengthening the financial sector. In this regard, the central bank is pressing for a timely
compliance of all banks with prudential regulations, further improvement of the supervision
of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCOs), comprehensive address of pyramid schemes
through better coordination among domestic and regional financial regulators, improved
internal processes for dealing with fraudulent operations, and laws prohibiting pyramid
operations. Also, the authorities are seeking an early passage of the Financial Services and
Regulatory Authority Bill. In addition, the authorities are further reviewing its legal structure
and modernizing its operations with Fund support in a number of areas, including
strengthening reserve management, dealing with anti-money laundering and strengthening
banking supervision.
11.
Banking soundness indicators are positive with well-capitalized, liquid, profitable and
low nonperforming loans. However, the government-owned Swazi Bank continues to have
relatively high nonperforming loans and faces difficulties meeting compliance requirements.
A few major SCCOs also face severe financial difficulties. Notable progress has been made
in establishing a framework for regulation and supervision of banks as well as insurance and
pension funds. New regulations have been introduced that require all insurance and pension
funds to increase their holdings of domestic assets from 10 to 30 percent of total assets in the
next three years. The authorities continue to foster cooperation and monetary integration at
the regional level, and remain fully committed to the ideals of the CMA as a means to anchor
inflation and promote economic growth. They recognize the need to strengthen their
obligation to the exchange rate peg through steady accumulation of international reserves.
The central bank, supported by the government, has continued to focus on promoting
financial sector soundness and exchange rate stability by increasing the country's
international reserve position.
Structural Issues
12.
The authorities acknowledge the need and are committed to significantly improve the
investment climate and enhance competitiveness through the acceleration of structural
reforms and reduction of the cost of doing business. Other measures receiving attention
include strengthening the anti-corruption commission; reducing labor market rigidities;
simplifying business licensing requirements and procedures; and carrying out land reform
that would help increase agricultural productivity. In addition, the authorities believe that the
continued harmonious industrial climate, the country's good infrastructure and proximity to
markets, and a relatively well-educated labor force augur well for future investment inflows.

4
13.
The authorities are keenly aware that the process of transforming the economy will
depend on implementing a number of structural reforms, perseverance with sound
macroeconomic management, improvement of competitiveness, and development and
implementation of a new set of investment incentives that are budget neutral. Foreign
investors would bolster this effort as an indigenous entrepreneurial class of small and
medium sized entrepreneurs (SMEs) is developed. The government, together with its SACU
partners, will continue to pursue an aggressive bilateral trade negotiations agenda to achieve
this goal.
Conclusion
14. The Swazi authorities face difficult challenges and have embarked on a strong reform
agenda to revive economic growth. They count on the international community and their
cooperating partners to assist them in dealing with the multiplicity of problems that could
undermine the achievement of the MDGs. The continued classification of the country as
lower middle-income, based only on GDP per capita and ignoring the poor social indicators
facing the majority of the population, has hampered the authorities’ efforts to secure
concessional resources to finance social reforms. The country has all the social indicators of
a poor developing country, with more than two thirds of the population living below the
poverty line. HIV/AIDS continues to ravage the country and this, together with the
worsening incidence of poverty, is causing untold harm. Therefore, we believe that there is
need to review the methodology used to classify countries and address appropriately the
serious concerns that have been expressed by Swaziland and other countries.
