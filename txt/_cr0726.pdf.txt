Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Greece
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Adrienne Cheasty
December 18, 2006
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Real GDP grew an estimated 4.1 percent in 2006 and is projected to slow only slightly in 2007. The fiscal
deficit has fallen sharply, to under 3 percent of GDP in 2006. However, vulnerabilities have developed in the
form of very high credit growth, persistent inflationary pressures, eroding competitiveness, and an unsustainably
large current account deficit.
Significant fiscal consolidation was put in place in 2005–06, but further deficit cuts are needed, notably to
prepare for the costs of population aging. Staff recommends achieving budget balance in 2010 and a surplus
after that (balance or better by 2012 on the authorities’ plans), focusing on current primary spending restraint.
The 2007 budget targets only a small further deficit cut, as the authorities favor easing the pace following the
front-loaded cuts of 2005–06. Reforms to expenditure management and tax administration, needed to bolster
consolidation, are underway.
Pension reform will be needed to safeguard the long-term public finances. While no reform will be
undertaken in this parliament, work is underway to better estimate the long-term costs and formulate possible
policy options. While the authorities viewed the process as on schedule, staff sees a need to step up preparations
for early action in the next parliament.
The banking sector appears to be sound, but continued very high credit growth and high NPLs warrant close
prudential supervision. The Bank of Greece has taken an appropriately proactive stance, but continued vigilance
is needed.
Recent product market reforms include further privatization and implementation of reforms to state-owned
enterprises. The corporate income tax is being cut further and the government has announced personal income
tax reform. Further cuts to red tape, improved performance of state-owned enterprises, and further liberalization
of network industries are priorities looking ahead. Labor market reform has been more modest; employment
protection legislation should be eased and centralized bargaining agreements made more flexible.
Data are adequate for surveillance, but improvements are needed. In particular, the authorities concur that
national accounts revisions should be more timely, and, to bolster its reputation, that the statistical service
should be made independent.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Economic growth has been strong for several years, but vulnerabilities emerged.
Real GDP grew by 3¾ percent a year on average during 1995–2005 (Table 1, Figure 1).1
Financial-sector liberalization and the sharp drop in interest rates with euro adoption resulted
in very large increases in private sector credit, which has underpinned strong domestic
demand growth. Fiscal policy was expansionary in the first part of this decade, including to
fund the 2004 Olympic games. On the supply side, capital formation and productivity growth
have been strong, and substantial immigration, mainly from the Balkans, has swelled the
workforce. This period of strong growth narrowed the gap in real incomes between Greece
and the EU15 but, notwithstanding significant reforms in recent years (see the text table on
Fund Policy Recommendations), vulnerabilities also developed:
•

The fiscal deficit widened. In 2004, the general government deficit peaked at
6.2 percent of GDP (Table 2), due principally to rapid growth in primary spending,
which averaged 8.3 percent a year in 2001–04. As a result, little progress was made in
cutting the debt-GDP ratio, which stood at 85.3 percent in 2005 (107.5 percent on the
old national accounts estimates). In the wake of large upward revisions to historical
deficit estimates, the EC launched an excessive deficit procedure (EDP) in 2004,
requiring a deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2006. In response, the authorities cut
the deficit sharply in 2005 and again in the 2006 budget.

The national accounts were recently revised significantly, raising the level of output in 2000-05 by about
26 percent, although real GDP growth rates were little affected; see Section II.E and Box 4. The authorities
explained that the new estimates are now official and national accounts will no longer be prepared under the old
methodology. Eurostat has yet to verify the revised estimates and, in the meantime, the authorities have chosen
to present the 2007 budget using the old estimates to emphasize that the 2006 fiscal deficit fell below 3 percent
of GDP regardless of the revisions. This report uses the revised estimates throughout, unless otherwise
indicated.

4
•

Private-sector borrowing expanded rapidly. Although the FSAP, conducted in
2005, found no systemic threats to the banking sector, it highlighted risks arising
from lending to new and untested client classes, expansion into new activities, and
rising exposures of some banks in the Balkans. To some extent, this credit expansion
reflects greater financial intermediation in the wake of liberalization, a process that
relatively low debt-income ratios suggest is still incomplete.

•

The external current account deficit widened. Strong domestic demand, supported
by credit growth, has led to inflationary pressures, while a centralized wage
bargaining system has delivered higher unit labor cost growth than elsewhere in the
euro area. The cumulative wage increase of over 11 percent in the 2006–07 two-year
private sector wage settlement continued this trend. As a result, the real exchange rate
has appreciated steadily, opening up a growing competitiveness gap vis-à-vis tradingpartner countries, and the current account deficit widened to an estimated 7½ percent
of GDP in 2006 (balance of payments basis) (Box 1). 2 Membership in the monetary
union keeps long-term interest rate premia low (about 30 basis points against
Germany), but a substantially smaller current account deficit would be needed to
stabilize the net foreign asset position.3

2.
Structural reforms have been put in place, but impediments to higher
productivity remain. A decade of strong growth has narrowed the gap in real per capita
income with the EU-15 average. Nevertheless, businesses face unduly high start-up costs and
labor restrictions (Table 3), and chronically weak FDI inflows suggest a poor investment
climate. Labor markets perform very poorly by international comparison (Figure 2).

2

The discussion of competitiveness and the current account, both here and below, draws on Chapter 1 of the
Selected Issues Paper.

3

As an illustration, a current account deficit of 3½ percent of GDP would be needed to stabilize the 2005 ratio
of net external liabilities to GDP of 65 percent.

5
Box 1. External Competitiveness
Indicators suggest a significant erosion of cost and price competitiveness since
EMU accession. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 20–30 percent on
a ULC basis and by 10 percent on a CPI basis, and the export deflator rose by
10 percent, the highest among euro-area countries. Staff estimates based on the
macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches, though subject to high
margins of error, imply a real overvaluation of 12–22 percent. In addition to cost
measures, Greece scores low relative to other euro-area members on international
competitiveness rankings.
The erosion of competitiveness is reflected in weak export performance,
notwithstanding a recent pickup. Greece has lost export market share, and export
growth in the past five years has been the second weakest among euro area countries.

Implementation
Deficit was reduced by 4 percent of GDP in 2005-06. The
adjustment was mainly on spending, but shifted to revenue in 2006.
Authorities’ medium-term objective is budget balance or better by
2012. Tax and expenditure reforms have begun.

Cost estimates are being produced, though somewhat slowly, and a
commission set up to analyze the issue. Reform measures will await
the next parliament.

The supervisor has tightened prudential measures, including to
encourage improved risk management.

Substantial progress on product market reform in a number of areas,
but less has been done on labor markets.

Staff Recommendation in Previous Article IV Consultations

Substantial deficit reduction in 2005-06; budget balance by 2010 and
surplus after that. Adjustment should be in current primary spending. Tax
administration and expenditure management need reform.

Reform urgently needed. Immediately, new estimates of costs should be
produced and social dialog intensified.

Strengthen risk management to guard against vulnerabilities posed by
very high credit growth and moves into new, untested markets.

Both product and labor market reforms needed to improve
competitiveness and sustain growth.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The short-term economic outlook is strong, but challenges to sustained medium-term growth
are posed by a weakening international competitive position, a large current account deficit,
and sustained high private-sector credit growth. Against this backdrop, the discussions
focused on how to foster a soft landing in the medium term. The mission discussed the pace
and nature of medium-term fiscal adjustment, reform of tax administration and expenditure
management, the pension reform process, financial sector vulnerabilities, the need for
further structural reform in product and labor markets, and the national accounts revisions.
A. The Outlook
3.
Growth is set to remain strong in the short term in a context of global expansion,
and in particular a revival of activity in the EU. Staff projects real GDP will rise by
4.1 percent in 2006, slightly above the staff estimate of potential (3.9 percent). 4 Indicators
from the first half of the year suggest continued strength in private domestic demand
(Figure 3). The external sector remains a drag on growth, but, benefiting from the pickup in
world growth, goods exports have recently shown surprising resilience in the face of eroding
cost competitiveness. For 2007, while the key factors contributing to recent strength seem
likely to continue, staff projects growth to ease to 3¾ percent, reflecting a mild slowing of
consumption and investment from the rebound in 2006. Inflation is projected to ease
somewhat as oil prices stabilize at levels lower than were seen earlier this year, while the
current account deficit is projected to remain at about 7½ percent of GDP. Projection
uncertainties for 2007 include the robustness of both consumption and investment and, on the
external side, the effects of an appreciation of the euro and a slowdown in the United States.
4.
For the medium term, staff projects a gradual slowing of growth, but continuing
economic imbalances pose downside risks. The staff baseline projection assumes growth
will fall somewhat below potential (about 3 percent) as consumers’ taste for increased debt
begins to wane and lost competitiveness weighs on the traded goods sector and weakens
investment. As a result, inflationary pressures ease and the current account deficit narrows,
although adjustment is incomplete over the projection horizon as competitiveness and export
market share deteriorate somewhat further (Tables 4 and 5). However, persistent real
exchange rate appreciation and unsustainable current account deficits raise the prospect of a
sharper slowdown. The experience of other euro area countries suggests that such a
slowdown could be triggered by lower consumption growth as households adjust to rapidly
rising debt burdens, the cumulative effects of deteriorating competitiveness, or the end of
asset (house) price increases (Box 2). In Greece, a very pronounced slowdown—growth of
about ¾ percent a year for two years in Figure 4—while unlikely, would result in a higher
fiscal deficit and a rise in the debt-GDP ratio.

4

The November Consensus Forecast is 3.7 percent in 2006 and 3.3 percent in 2007. See “Growth in Greece: Can
Better Performance be Sustained?” in last year’s Selected Issues Paper (Country Report No. 06/05) for an
analysis of potential output.

8
Box 2. The Greek Cycle in a Euro-area Context
This box compares Greek economic developments in the last 10 years with those of four other highgrowth euro-area countries. Two of them, the Netherlands and Portugal, suffered sharp economic
downturns in the first half of this decade (Figure 5), while Ireland and Spain continued to grow strongly
(Figure 6), as has Greece. As all countries except the Netherlands began the 1990s with per capita
incomes well below the euro-area average, their high growth could be viewed as catch-up.
Indications of demand pressures are evident during large parts of the 10-year period in all five countries.
Credit grew strongly and rose substantially in relation to GDP. House prices also increased strongly in
the Netherlands, Ireland, and Spain, although less so in Portugal and Greece. All countries experienced
sustained inflation rate differentials, declining competitiveness, and deteriorating current accounts,
although Ireland began from a strong surplus position. A key policy development in all countries except
Greece and Portugal was the correction during the 1990s of substantial fiscal deficits.
The Netherlands experienced a sharp slowdown in the early 2000s, as eroding competitiveness hurt
exports, and slowing house price increases and higher pension contributions sapped domestic demand.
However, many of the imbalances that had built up were reversed: inflation differentials were closed,
competitiveness erosion stopped, and the current account recovered.
The Portuguese economy fell into recession in 2003, as households curtailed demand in response to high
debt levels, while investment collapsed amid low business confidence and weak economic prospects. The
resulting adjustment of imbalances has been far from complete, although the inflation differential with
the euro area closed.
Greece (like Ireland and Spain) has escaped such a slowdown, but vulnerabilities remain. The fiscal
position has improved, although it is not as strong as it was in the Netherlands, which benefited from an
established medium-term budget framework. Also, credit growth remains very high. However, Greece
does not have the high levels of indebtedness that characterized both the Netherlands and Portugal, nor
the rapid house price increases of the Netherlands, prior to their slowdowns. These factors suggest that
imbalances may unwind gradually, in line with staff’s central projection.

5.
The authorities shared concerns about competitiveness and the current account,
but were optimistic about medium-term growth prospects. They pointed to the room for
productivity catch-up, a resurgence in tourism, and promising Greek commercial prospects in
southeastern Europe. They expected aggregate supply to be augmented by robust investment,
supported by EU funds, and structural reforms. They noted that export growth picked up in
2005, and expected another strong result in 2006; they felt that improved efforts to market
Greek products abroad had bolstered exports. The mission agreed that the Greek economy
has consistently surprised on the upside in recent years, and that the staff projection that
potential will slow by nearly one percentage point in the next 5 years may not materialize,
but argued that sustaining this performance would require further structural reform.
Moreover, the substantial erosion of competitiveness will take time to reverse, requiring
strong productivity growth and considerable wage moderation (Box 3).

9
Box 3. Restoring External Competitiveness
Restoring competitiveness will require cutting unit labor cost growth below the corresponding
growth rate in other euro area countries, either by moderating wage growth or further raising
productivity growth. To illustrate the difficulty involved, on the staff’s baseline productivity
assumptions it would take 5 years to eliminate the estimated competitiveness gap if nominal
wages were frozen, and twice as long if nominal wages grew at 2 percent a year.
Structural reforms could contribute significantly to the process by boosting labor productivity
and, by strengthening competition, holding down prices. For example, a 1 percentage point
increase in productivity growth and a 0.3 percentage point decline in inflation (a temporary
effect lasting only while competition intensified) would shorten the time needed to close the
competitiveness gap by 1½ years.
The elimination of the competitiveness gap could, all else equal, reduce the current account
deficit by about 3 percent of GDP. Completing the adjustment in 5 years through exports alone,
however, would require nominal export growth of about 12 percent a year for 5 years, some 4¼
percentage points higher than in the staff baseline scenario. Notwithstanding the rebound in
exports in 2005–06, this is ambitious, and suggests that some of the adjustment will have to
come from lower demand.

B. Fiscal Policy
6.
The authorities began cutting the deficit sharply in 2005. The deficit fell to
4.2 percent of GDP in 2005, and the 2006 budget targets 2.1 percent of GDP (2.6 percent on
the old national accounts basis). For the two years 2005–06, 2.4 percentage points of the
cumulative estimated deficit decline of 4 percent of GDP was primary spending restraint
(including 1.3 percentage points attributable to the end of the Olympics); 0.9 percentage
point was accounted for by revenue increases. However, in contrast to 2005, the focus
in 2006 shifted to revenue increases, reflecting progress in combating tax fraud, a 1
percentage point increase in the VAT, and the introduction in mid-2006 of higher excise
taxes on tobacco and mobile phones.
7.
It was agreed that, notwithstanding the adjustment to date, further deficit cuts
will be needed in the years ahead. The authorities have announced their intention of
achieving budget balance or surplus by 2012, although since they have not articulated
medium-term policies to achieve this outcome the deficit reductions in the staff baseline
scenario are much smaller. This goal is somewhat less ambitious than the staff’s
recommendation of a cyclically adjusted balance by 2010 and a surplus after that (Table 6).
The mission argued that further declines in the deficit would be appropriately countercyclical
in the short term, provide greater room for a fiscal cushion should the economy slow, and
foster a rapid reduction of the public debt before the costs of population aging begin to
mount around the middle of the next decade.

10
8.
The mission emphasized the need for high-quality consolidation that would leave
room for needed investment and tax cuts. International experience strongly suggests that a
focus on restraint of current primary spending promotes sustained fiscal adjustment.5 By
comparison with other countries, the Greek public-sector wage bill, defense, and, to a lesser
extent, social transfers are relatively high, suggesting restraint in these areas might be
warranted. The authorities agreed on the need to control spending, especially in view of their
intention to continue with tax reform (see below).
9.
The 2007 budget targets little deficit reduction. As a fraction of GDP, the general
government deficit falls by only 0.2 percent of GDP, reflecting lower interest payments,
while both revenues and primary spending are little changed. The authorities stressed that,
having front-loaded deficit cuts in 2005–06, it is appropriate for the pace of consolidation to
ease. Moreover, they noted

purposes and as a step toward the medium-term objective of budget balance.
10.
The authorities are introducing tax reforms which may entail some fiscal cost.
The corporate tax rate is scheduled to fall to 25 percent (20 percent for smaller firms) in
2007. The government is also reforming the personal income tax to increase the basic
exemption and reduce marginal tax rates (except the top 40 percent rate for incomes over
€75,000). Because the reform is phased in, the authorities judged the revenue implications
for 2007 to be very small. The mission underscored that revenue losses should be minimized
by reducing distortionary exemptions—especially since a simplification of the tax code
would help to improve tax administration—or compensated by further spending
compression.
11.
Crucial reforms of tax administration and public expenditure management are
beginning to be put in place. In 2005, FAD provided advice on these issues, as well as a
fiscal transparency ROSC.

•

On the tax side, the authorities noted the formation of a compliance improvement
committee, reform of auditing services, strengthening of VAT operations, stronger
enforcement of arrears collection, and improvements in the penalties and appeals
process. Nevertheless, a number of measures—including regional tax directorates,
risk-based enforcement and auditing, simplification of VAT returns, and adjustment
of penalties to improve compliance—are under consideration but not yet
implemented, and the larger problem of widespread tax evasion persists.

•

On the expenditure side, a new audit directorate is to be established in the Ministry of
Economics and Finance (MoEF). The mission emphasized that its audits would have
to go well beyond the current practice of focusing on proper paperwork, and instead
examine whether programs meet objectives and spending is efficient, a point the
authorities agreed with. Initial steps have been taken on program-based budgeting
(PBB), with the current administratively based spending system being translated into
nine broad program categories. The mission argued that this approach would have to
be developed further to ensure that the categories are detailed enough to match policy
objectives and that budgeting start with PBB and then be translated into specific
spending items. The authorities had no immediate plans to introduce a medium-term
budget framework, which the mission argued would help in setting fiscal priorities.

12.
Pension and health-care costs will begin to rise early in the coming decade and
deep reforms will be needed to avoid jeopardizing the public finances. Estimates dating
from 2000 imply that these costs will rise by some 10½ percent of GDP by 2050, among the
largest increases in the EU. The mission urged that the reform process be stepped up, noting
that the preparation of new cost estimates seemed to be taking longer than expected, in part
because the National Actuarial Authority (NAA), which is charged with the task, is still
understaffed. These estimates are to be used by a high-level commission (the “Analytis
Commission”) to inform the political debate and by the ILO to provide a pension model. The
mission also expressed concern that the social dialog needed to prepare the ground for reform
had not advanced far. The authorities planned no reforms before the next election, in
accordance with a previous election pledge, but did intend to step up enforcement of certain
past reforms and had intensified efforts to reduce contribution evasion. They also felt that the
process of formulating policies was on schedule, and agreed that discussion among the social
partners and the public would be key. Regarding health care, the authorities are introducing
better controls, especially over procurement (a source of overruns and arrears in the past).
The mission agreed that these measures would prove useful, but cautioned that international
experience illustrated the difficulties of containing costs while providing high quality
medical services.
C. The Financial Sector
13.
The banking sector appears generally sound. Solvency and liquidity are
satisfactory and recent stress tests conducted by the Bank of Greece (BoG, the banking
supervisor) indicate that capital adequacy ratios would remain well above regulatory

12
thresholds even if credit risks materialized.6 Profits are robust, driven by rising lending
volumes in Greece and southeastern Europe, wide margins (themselves, however, potentially
a sign of insufficient competition), and some cost cutting (Tables 7, 8, and 9).
14.
However, vulnerabilities identified in the FSAP remain, suggesting a need to
continue close supervision. The rapid rise in credit (Figure 7) may result in households
becoming overextended (although credit-GDP ratios are still low by international standards)
and mask weaknesses in banks’ loan portfolio. Persistently high NPLs in the face of rapid
loan growth suggest that banks continue to lend to poor risks. And, with loan outstripping
deposit growth, banks increasingly turn to higher-cost market funding, although the level of
the deposit-loan ratio is still relatively high. Vulnerabilities could be exacerbated in the event
of a marked economic downturn, the impact of which is uncertain since the liberalized
banking system has yet to experience a full cycle. Also, staff analysis shows that, in contrast
to other euro area countries, the increase in Greek banks’ vulnerability since the late 1990s
has coincided with the pickup in credit growth.7 Moreover, Greek banks with higher credit
growth seem to be more vulnerable to economic slowdowns. The mission argued that these
considerations call for heightened prudential measures, including sharpening banks’
incentives to manage risk by further increasing provisioning and write-offs of NPLs, for
intensified monitoring of risks by the BoG, and for urging banks to continue to improve their
risk management tools and practices.

The authorities have responded to such risks in a number of ways. The BoG has
intensified its monitoring of credit developments, including by studying the characteristics of

The BoG examined retail credit risk, and tested for sensitivity by raising the probability of default by 30
percent.

which indicates the probability of a loss exceeding equity capital.

13
debtors to assess risks better. It has also introduced prudential measures to limit credit to
highly indebted households and increase provisioning and write-offs of NPLs. Commercial
banking representatives argued that sophisticated risk-management tools and strategies were
in place and, like the BoG, saw no pertinent systemic risks. Regarding the expansion of
Greek commercial banks into southeastern Europe—recently, the National Bank of Greece
acquired a Turkish and a Serbian bank—the authorities reported that they had strong and
open relationships with other supervisors in the region, and that they monitor the risk
management systems Greek banks use in countries in the region.
16.
The other parts of the financial sector have not benefited from liberalization
nearly as much as banks have. The capital market, second pillar pension, and insurance
sectors remain very small, and the last is in weak financial condition. While supervision of
the first two seems adequate, insurance supervision has in the past been weak. Legislation for
a new, independent insurance supervisor was passed in early 2004, and the authorities
reported that, after several postponements, the new body would be fully operational in
early 2007. The mission urged that the transition to the new body be rapid, but also as
smooth as possible to avoid either disruption in the industry or gaps in supervision.
Meanwhile, both the authorities and industry representatives reported that the existing
supervisor, part of the Ministry of Development, has stepped up its activity, including by
conducting more on-site inspections and closing some insurers.
D. Structural Reform and Medium-Term Growth
17.
An overarching goal of the authorities’ economic policies is to enhance
productivity and improve the business climate. The staff supported these objectives,
noting that key policy requirements are further reform of product and labor markets to
improve the business climate, and continued infrastructure investment.
18.
In product markets, a number of important reforms have been implemented,
but the process is still incomplete. Simplified procedures for manufacturing business
startups and “one-stop shops” are in place, overtime regulations have been eased somewhat,
network industries (telecoms, electricity, and gas) are being liberalized, and state-owned
enterprises (SOE) are being reformed by changing work rules to those in the private sector
(for newly hired employees) and increasing oversight of their business plans. The authorities
were considering extending the simplified startup procedures to the much larger commercial
sector, and the overhaul of antiquated bankruptcy legislation appears to be nearing fruition.
The authorities are also drawing up plans to improve the currently very low returns on public
properties, and are continuing privatization, most recently by selling stakes in three banks
and planning a further offering of the telephone operator OTE.
19.
The authorities stressed the importance of dealing with the unrecorded economy
and fighting corruption. This issue has an important fiscal dimension, and the national
accounts revisions have thrown the size of the untaxed economy into relief: Greece’s
statutory tax rates are similar to those in other European countries, but the ratio of revenue to

14
GDP, at about 34½ percent, is relatively low, indicating the extent to which the tax base has
been eroded by avoidance and evasion.8 The authorities reformed the tax inspectorate
in 2005, and have begun to press on social security contribution evasion. However, they
noted that the culture of evasion appears to be deeply rooted.
20.
Rather less progress has been made on labor markets. The authorities planned no
further reforms in this area until after the elections, although they agreed that measures to
increase participation rates and lower unemployment rates would be key to sustaining growth
and relieving wage pressures, thereby improving international competitiveness. Noting that
centralized collective bargaining agreements (including minimum wages) resulted in
somewhat high (relative to productivity) minimum wages and a compressed wage scale
(Figure 8), the mission argued a more decentralized system would be beneficial. Banks have
been attempting to decentralize bargaining in their sector, but face stiff union resistance. The
mission also argued for easing employment protection legislation to encourage hiring.
21.
There was agreement on the importance of infrastructure investment for
medium-term growth. The 2005 public-private partnership (PPP) law, meant to increase the
efficiency of infrastructure investments, has gone into operation, with a number of projects in
the bidding or planning stage. The authorities stressed that PPPs have to pass cost-benefit
considerations and will be subject to full cost accounting and transparency. Only smaller
projects (less than €200 million) fall under the law, a situation that is likely to remain
unchanged. However, even larger projects are to be examined by the same MoEF staff that
analyzes the smaller ones before approval. EU funds have been an important source of
infrastructure financing in Greece, and the authorities reported that they planned to continue
efforts to step up absorption under CSF3. The authorities have developed plans to streamline
absorption under CSF4, and they noted that the national accounts revisions, which raised
Greek per capita GDP and therefore would in the future reduce eligibility for EU funds, are
expected to have very little effect under CSF4.
E. Data Issues
22.
The authorities announced, at end-September 2006, large revisions to the
national accounts (Box 4). GDP has been revised up by some 26 percent for 2000–05,
sharply reducing many fiscal ratios as well as the current account deficit as a ratio to GDP.
The authorities explained that the new estimates were official and that, beginning in 2006,
national accounts are no longer being produced using the old methodology. Nevertheless, the
figures for 2002–05 are still provisional, because information from new surveys has not been
fully incorporated. The initial reception in the press and among some analysts was one of
some skepticism, given the size of the revision and the pressure on Greece to bring its deficit
below 3 percent of GDP this year. The authorities, noting that the 2006 deficit was set to fall
below that mark even on the old output estimates, emphasized the technical nature of the
8

underground economy.

15
revisions and the independence of the statistical service (NSSG). Nevertheless, the incident
suggested to staff that the public credibility of the NSSG should be strengthened, especially
as it had been called into question in 2004 when the fiscal numbers were significantly
restated. The mission therefore encouraged the authorities to make the NSSG independent of
the MoEF, and the authorities concurred. The authorities also agreed that revisions should be
more timely, perhaps at five-year intervals, to avoid such large changes in the future.
Box 4. National Accounts Revisions
At end-September, 2006 the Greek authorities announced large revisions to the national accounts for
2000–05. The level of GDP was revised up by about 26 percent, although real growth rates were
little changed. Since the nominal values of the general government deficit and public debt were not
affected, their ratios as percentage of GDP became markedly smaller. This was the first major
revision since the application of ESA79 to the base year of 1988, which resulted in a 20 percent
revision of GDP.
The authorities emphasized that the revisions are meant to bring Greece national accounts into
conformity with ESA95 and resolve a number of reservations raised by Eurostat regarding earlier
estimates. Indeed, the bulk of the revision (20.9 percentage points of the 25.7 percent revision in
2000, the new base year) are accounted for by this latter factor. The estimates for 2002−05 are still
provisional because the results of the new surveys have yet to be incorporated.
The revision incorporates the 2001 general census, new surveys on retail and wholesale commerce,
transport, hotels, and dwellings, better use of administrative databases, and new estimates of rents,
the capital stock, and capital consumption. For 2000, the census raised estimates of total
employment of persons by 10.4 percent. More than half the output revision is concentrated in four
branches: wholesale trade (16.4 percent), hotels and restaurants (15.4 percent), construction
(11.1 percent), and other business activities (10 percent).

Data have improved substantially in many areas and are adequate for
surveillance. Following the large fiscal revisions, noncentral government fiscal data,
especially on pension funds, have improved considerably with the institution of a quarterly
census of the relevant bodies. Nonetheless, apparently undetected arrears built up in the
hospital sector, causing another (relatively small) fiscal restatement in 2005, and the general
government deficit was revised up by ¼ to ¾ percent of GDP for 2002−05, reflecting the
new census on pension funds. The mission encouraged the authorities to publish financingside fiscal data and properly seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts data. Regarding
the latter, the authorities reported that the project to improve the quarterly data is near
completion and new series are due for publication in 2007.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The economic boom of the past several years continued in 2006, and growth is
likely to be strong in 2007 as well. Domestic demand is supported by low interest rates,
rapid credit expansion, and rising employment. Two years of sharp fiscal consolidation are
over, corporate tax cuts and structural reforms have begun to underpin activity, world oil
prices have moderated, and Greece’s prospects in southeastern European markets seem
favorable. The external sector remains a drag on growth, but despite several years of eroding
cost competitiveness goods exports have shown resilience, reflecting in part the pickup in
export markets. There are nevertheless risks, including the effects of euro appreciation and
the possibility that the U.S. and world economies may slow more sharply than now expected.
25.
Medium-term growth will probably slow gradually as imbalances that have built
up during the boom unwind, but there is a risk of a sharper correction. The large current
account reflects strong domestic demand, and persistent wage and price inflation differentials
with the euro area which have eroded competitiveness. The very high rates of credit growth
observed in recent years, while in part a desirable and natural consequence of financial
market liberalization, are unsustainable in the medium term. Indeed, the persistence of these
imbalances would pose a medium-term threat of a sharper output adjustment. An orderly
transition to a sustainable path will involve less domestic demand growth, more moderate
wage increases—less than Greek productivity growth plus the euro-area inflation rate to
reverse past competitive losses—and further reform of product and labor markets to raise
potential growth and reduce the need for slower domestic demand growth.
26.
Fiscal consolidation has been the most urgent policy priority for the past three
years, and the substantial deficit reductions in 2005–06 are commendable. This effort
was appropriately concentrated on expenditure, and appears to have imposed little cost in
terms of output or employment losses. On currently available information, the 2006 budget
deficit target seems likely to have been attained. However, adjustment shifted toward
reliance on revenues, including through some one-off measures and increases in some
indirect taxes.
27.
A steady and cumulatively significant strengthening of the public finances is still
needed in the years ahead, with the objective of achieving a cyclically adjusted budget
balance in 2010 and a surplus after that. Further deficit cuts would help restrain domestic

17
demand and ease cost pressures, cushion the public finances in the event of an economic
downturn, and promote a rapid reduction of the public debt to help deal with the looming
costs of population aging. A focus on controlling current primary spending would preserve
room for needed infrastructure investments and further tax cuts, and maximize the
probability that fiscal adjustment will prove durable.
28.
The 2007 budget offers little further consolidation, although the buoyant
economy provides an opportunity to take bolder action. As a fraction of GDP, the general
government deficit falls only slightly, reflecting mainly lower interest payments, and both
revenues and primary spending are little changed. Any opportunity to cut the deficit more in
the course of 2007 should be seized. The decision to end the recourse to the temporary
measures of 2006 is a welcome improvement to the quality of fiscal adjustment; looking
forward, only durable measures should be used to meet deficit-reduction goals.
29.
Further tax reforms are welcome, but should not be allowed to jeopardize
needed fiscal consolidation. The reduction of the corporate tax rate will improve the
business climate. Regarding personal income tax reform, the most significant benefits would
flow from broadening the tax base by phasing out the long list of distortionary exemptions,
which would improve economic efficiency, reduce the burden on taxpayers, and foster
improvements in tax administration.
30.
Substantial reforms to tax administration and expenditure management are
welcome, and need to be pressed further. They will be critical to sustaining fiscal
consolidation, strengthening the operations of the state, and improving the business climate.
The full benefits of program-based budgeting will be reaped only when this approach is fully
integrated into budget preparation and execution. The new directorate of fiscal audit should
focus on evaluating programs against objectives and ensuring value for money. A mediumterm budget framework should also be developed, as it would help to guide fiscal strategy
and prioritize policy objectives, including during the further consolidation needed in the
years ahead. Tax evasion remains a particular problem, undermining revenues and imposing
a high burden on those in the formal economy. The authorities’ initiatives to tackle this
problem, which appear to have borne fruit in 2006, should therefore be redoubled.
31.
Unless the social security system is fundamentally reformed, the long-term costs
of population aging will threaten the sustainability of the public finances. The necessary
task of estimating aging costs has proceeded slowly, and therefore the National Actuarial
Authority should quickly be brought up to full strength and data provision by social security
funds speeded up. It will be crucial for an early adoption of concrete measures that all social
partners step up efforts to build momentum for reform. Welcome reforms are underway in
the health-care sector, but the key challenge remains providing quality medical services
while containing costs.
32.
The banking system appears to be sound, but persistently high loan expansion
and nonperforming loans raise vulnerabilities. Households may become overextended and
asset quality degraded as credit continues to grow at very high rates, and the persistence of
high NPL ratios indicates that banks may need to refine their risk management practices

18
further. The proactive approach of the Bank of Greece is commendable. Looking forward, it
will be important to continue to carefully supervise banks’ risk management practices,
intensify monitoring of risks, and strengthen banks’ incentives to contain risks, including by
ensuring sufficient provisioning and further writeoffs of NPLs. With the increasing presence
of Greek banks in southeastern Europe, the BoG needs to maintain close relations with other
supervisors in the region. Regarding the insurance sector, the new supervisor should be made
fully operational and care taken to ensure a smooth transition as it takes up its duties.
33.
Strengthening international competitiveness will require further reforms to
product and labor markets, and public administration. Greece still lags on many
indicators of competitiveness. The program of product market reform should be extended,
including by extending simplified business licensing procedures to all sectors, hastening
liberalization of network industries, and redoubling efforts to combat corruption and
widespread tax evasion. Further initiatives in the labor market, which has seen less reform,
include relaxation of strong employment protection legislation and decentralization of the
bargaining system.
34.
Recent moves to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are
welcome. However, as a group these enterprises remain relatively inefficient and, by
registering commercial losses, are a cost to the budget. Therefore, their management should
be strengthened further and held accountable for performance, and the newly submitted
business plans followed up carefully. Further privatizations, most recently the sale of stakes
in the telephone operator OTE and three banks, are also welcome, and should be continued,
including by privatizing those SOEs that have been put on a commercial footing.
35.
The new public-private partnership (PPP) law provides a framework for this
increasingly important method of financing infrastructure investment. Although
projects are just beginning to be put in place under the new law, the intention to subject
projects considered for PPP financing to cost-benefit tests and to integrate them into the
wider public investment strategy is welcome. A full accounting for the costs, including future
budgetary obligations, should be presented in a transparent way alongside the budget.
36.
Economic statistics have improved in recent years, but need to be strengthened
appreciably further. Improvements to the quarterly national accounts, which are in train,
and the publication of full financing-side fiscal data are two urgent priorities. The recently
announced revision to the national accounts points to desirability of a policy of timely
updates, and the initial skeptical reaction in many quarters to the announcement of the
revisions suggests the need to strengthen the credibility of the national statistical office,
particularly by granting it independent status.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the normal 12month cycle.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data.Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks exept for the
interest rate and growth shocks. The growth shock assumes that real GDP growth drops to 0.7 percent in 2007 and it recovers
gradually to 2.8 percent by 2011. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the
baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2007, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

APPENDIX II. GREECE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic data are adequate for surveillance, but should be strengthened. Substantial
progress has been made in statistical methodologies and practices to fulfill responsibilities as
a member of the European Union and the euro area. Greece subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on November 8, 2002. A data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was published in 2003, and it was updated in
2004 and 2005 in the context of the Article IV staff report.
National accounts produced by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) have
recently been revised substantially, in part to achieve compliance with the European System
of Accounts (ESA95). The new benchmark year is 2000. Data for 2002–2005 are still
provisional since the NSSG has yet to incorporate the results of new statistical surveys for
these years, and the NSGG has yet to produce estimates on the new basis for 1995–1999.
The seasonal adjustment of quarterly national accounts estimates relies on indicator series
rather than standard techniques. The resulting series retain strong seasonal patterns which
render them inadequate for assessing short-term economic developments. The NSGG plans
to introduce properly seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts in 2007.
Balance of payments data present some departures from the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5), but progress has been made implementing the recommendations
of the 2003 data ROSC. Significant differences remain in comparison to national-accountsbased current account data, although the recent revisions to the national accounts are meant
to ameliorate this situation.
The NSSG compiles data on general government revenue, expenditure, and deficit on an
accrual basis in the context of the 1995 ESA Transmission Program and the Excessive Deficit
Procedure. The absence of financing data impedes checks on data consistency, including
reconciliation between the government deficit and debt, and between government statistics
and other macroeconomic datasets.
The interpretation of labor market developments continues to be hampered by difficulties in
covering immigrants, which constitute, compared with other EU countries, a relatively large
fraction of the Greek labor market, and by the large size of the unrecorded economy, which
the recent national accounts revisions may not have fully captured.
Under the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness Indicators conducted
by the Fund, the authorities recently produced a set of indicators broadly consistent with the
Fund's FSI Compilation Guide.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Greece
On January 22, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Greece.1
Background
Economic growth has been very strong for several years, underpinned by a rapid increase in
private sector credit, following the liberalization of the financial sector and the sharp drop in
interest rates due to euro adoption, and an expansionary fiscal stance. In 2006, real GDP rose
by an estimated 4.1 percent, driven by private domestic demand and a pick up in goods
exports.2 After peaking in 2004, the fiscal deficit has fallen sharply to under 3 percent of GDP
in 2006. Private sector credit has risen very rapidly and inflationary pressures have continued,
resulting in a gradual but steady erosion of competitiveness and a large current account deficit.
Despite the long economic expansion, labor markets continue to perform poorly by
international standards, although unemployment rates have been falling recently.
In 2006, the authorities continued the fiscal consolidation started a year earlier, reducing the
budget deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP and the debt-GDP ratio to 83.3 percent of GDP
(2.8 percent and 104.9 percent on the old national account estimates) on staff estimates. In
contrast to 2005, however, the adjustment shifted toward reliance on revenue increases,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The national accounts were recently revised significantly, raising the level of output in 2000–05 by
about 26 percent.

2
including some one-off measures and increases in some indirect taxes. The 2007 budget
targets a small deficit reduction of 0.2 percent of GDP, reflecting lower interest payments,
while both revenues and primary spending are little changed.
Economic growth in 2007 and beyond is projected by staff to slow gradually, as the erosion of
international competitiveness and past rapid rises in households’ indebtedness imply a
softening of foreign and domestic demand. Although growth is expected to remain comfortably
above the euro-area average, the further real rate exchange rate appreciation and the
persistence of large current account deficits pose risks of a sharper slowdown.
The banking sector appears sound, with high profitability and strong capital and liquidity
positions. However, continued strong credit expansion raises concerns that households may
become overextended and asset quality degraded, and persistently high non-performing loans
ratios suggest that banks continue to lend to poor risks. The Bank of Greece has responded to
these risks by stepping up its monitoring of banks’ lending standards, strengthening
provisioning requirements, and introducing prudential measures to limit credit to highly
indebted households.
The authorities have introduced a number of significant structural measures to improve
product markets. These include simplified business licensing procedures for industrial firms,
more flexible overtime, liberalization of network industries, and reforms to state-owned
enterprises. More initiatives are in the works, including the overhaul of bankruptcy legislation
and further privatization. Labor market reform has been more limited.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the extended period of robust economic growth, which had
significantly narrowed the gap in living standards between Greece and the rest of the European
Union. They agreed that economic prospects are strong in the near term, but noted that very
high credit growth, persistent inflationary pressures, eroding competitiveness, and a large
current account deficit pose downside risks in the medium term.
Directors commended the authorities for the substantial reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2005–06
as a substantive step towards restoring the health of the public finances. Regarding 2007,
Directors urged the authorities to look for opportunities that emerge to achieve a larger deficit
cut than currently budgeted to maintain an appropriately countercyclical fiscal stance and to
make further progress toward a medium-term budget surplus. They welcomed reforms to
corporate and personal income taxes, while urging that any budgetary costs be offset by
savings elsewhere in the budget.
While several Directors considered that balancing the budget by 2012 and moving to a surplus
after that was appropriate, several others recommended balancing the budget by 2010, given
the need to achieve fiscal consolidation. Directors considered that medium-term consolidation,
which should focus on primary spending, is necessary to cushion public finances in the event of

3
an economic downturn and to help prepare for the costs of population-aging. Directors pointed
out that further reforms to tax administration and expenditure management would be key to
balancing the budget. Priorities in this respect include combating tax evasion, integrating
program-based budgeting into budget preparation and execution, using fiscal audits to evaluate
programs against objectives and to ensure value for money, and developing a medium-term
budget framework to guide fiscal strategy and prioritize policy objectives.
Directors noted that the costs of population aging pose a threat to the long-term sustainability of
the public finances. They called on the authorities to accelerate preparation of the pension
reform, including by speeding up data provision by social security funds and completing revised
estimates of aging costs, and to ensure an early implementation of the reform. In this respect,
Directors considered that constructive involvement of all social partners will be crucial for an
early adoption of concrete measures. Reforms to the health-care sector should aim to provide
quality medical services while containing costs.
Directors noted that the banking system appears sound, but cautioned that persistent rapid loan
expansion and high levels of nonperforming loans (NPLs) can raise vulnerabilities. While
commending the proactive approach of the Bank of Greece, they called for the continued
supervision of banks’ risk management practices, close monitoring of banks’ assets and NPLs,
and strengthened incentives for banks to contain risks, including through sufficient provisioning
and write-offs of NPLs. With the increasing presence of Greek banks in southeastern Europe,
close cooperation with other supervisors in the region would also be essential. Directors urged
the authorities to ensure a smooth and rapid establishment of a fully operational independent
insurance supervisor.
Directors pointed out that further reforms to product and labor markets would be required to
sustain medium-term growth and strengthen international competitiveness. They commended
the authorities for progress already made in product market reform, and encouraged them to
implement further measures, including extending simplified business licensing procedures to all
sectors, accelerating the liberalization of network industries, and redoubling efforts to combat
corruption and widespread tax evasion. They also urged further initiatives in the labor market,
including relaxation of strong employment protection legislation and decentralization of the
bargaining system.
Directors welcomed the proposed reforms to state-owned enterprises and the new framework
law for public-private partnerships. They stressed that better governance of
state-owned enterprises would help to improve efficiency, reduce losses, and pave the way for
further privatization. Directors were of the view that public-private partnerships could help foster
needed infrastructure investment, but cautioned that a full and transparent cost accounting is
essential.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening economic statistics. They called
on the authorities to improve the quarterly national accounts and publish full financing-side fiscal

4
data. Directors also considered that more timely updates of the national accounts will also be
important, and encouraged the authorities to grant formal independence to the national
statistical office to strengthen its credibility.

Statement by Miranda Xafa, Alternate Executive Director for Greece
January 22, 2007

I would like to express my authorities’ appreciation to staff for the fruitful discussions they
held during the 2006 Article IV consultation and for their excellent report. The authorities
broadly agree with staff’s analysis and recommendations, including on the challenges in the
years ahead.
Key issues
As staff notes, the strong growth of the Greek economy in recent years is partly due to a
favorable external environment and to exceptional factors, including joining the Euro-area
and hosting of the 2004 Olympic Games. However, growth has become more sustainable in
the last two years through a marked shift away from demand management based on
debt-financed expansionary fiscal policy toward supply-side reforms aimed at increasing
productivity and potential growth. These policies succeeded in sustaining the growth
momentum post-Olympics despite substantial fiscal consolidation in 2005-6.
The authorities are more optimistic than staff on the growth outlook, based on their
expectation that consumption will remain strong as the oil bubble continues to deflate while
investment and exports are boosted by supply-side reforms. The December 2006 update of
Greece’s Stability Program projects that GDP growth will be sustained around 4.0 percent in
2007-09, while staff projects that growth will gradually decline to 3.0 percent in 2009. We
would note that staff’s projections have been unduly pessimistic in the past: The 2004 and
2005 Article IV reports projected 2006 GDP growth at 3.0 and 3.3 percent respectively,
compared with an estimated outcome of 4.0 percent.
Strong domestic demand, partly fueled by credit growth, contributed to a widening of the
current account deficit to 10.8 percent of GDP in 2006 (based on unrevised GDP data).
Export growth, on the other hand, remains buoyant despite a persistent inflation differential
with the Euro area. Though aware of the risks to competitiveness and the need for wage
moderation, the authorities prefer to address the growing external deficit by expanding
supply through structural reforms. After substantial spending restraint in 2005-06, further
fiscal consolidation should be carried out at a pace that does not jeopardize economic growth.
GDP revision
A long-overdue comprehensive revision of the national accounts was carried out in 2006
using the ESA95 methodology, which permits better measurement of services and thus
resulted in a significant upward revision of GDP. The main changes relate to the
re-benchmarking of data using 2000 as the base year, better estimation of activity in the
construction and services sectors, as well as the use of the 2001 census data and surveys that
were conducted for the first time. As staff notes, the bulk of the revision address deficiencies

2
in past national accounts estimates that Eurostat had long identified. New primary sources of
information have been established to avoid heavy reliance on projections and extrapolations.
Moreover, existing sources of information have been utilized for the first time, including
VAT returns and shipping activity going through the Greek banking system. The new GDP
data are consequently more in line with Bank of Greece balance of payments data. In future,
GDP re-benchmarking will be undertaken on a regular basis to avoid large revisions.
Fiscal policy
As discussed in the latest Stability Program, a front-loaded adjustment effort brought the
deficit below the 3 percent of GDP threshold within two years, in compliance with the EU
Council notice of February 2005 under the Excessive Deficit Procedure – a cumulative
adjustment of 5.2 percent of GDP in 2005-06. The bulk of the adjustment was achieved by
expenditure restraint, while improvements in tax administration and indirect tax increases
resulted in higher revenues even as corporate tax rates were cut. On the basis of preliminary
data, the general government deficit reached a 10-year low of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2006
(based on the unrevised GDP figures), and is budgeted to fall further to 2.4 percent of GDP
in 2007. Even though the 2007 fiscal effort appears small, the quality of fiscal adjustment is
set to improve as one-off measures amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2006 are replaced by
permanent measures in the 2007 budget. In cyclically adjusted terms, the primary balance
shifted from a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of 1.2 percent in 2006,
estimated to rise to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007.
Notwithstanding the progress achieved, the authorities agree that the debt burden remains
high while the improvement in recent years partly reflects a low interest rate environment.
They thus remain committed to continuing the fiscal consolidation effort to achieve balance
or better by 2012. A multi-year fiscal strategy and reforms to budgeting, expenditure
management, and tax administration already launched will be important elements in
entrenching fiscal discipline. Pension and health care reforms will also be critical to address
the challenges of population aging. The stock-flow discrepancy in the Greek fiscal accounts
is being gradually reduced by hardening the budget constraints on public enterprises and
entities. PPP projects approved under the recent law are subject to strict evaluation and
monitoring standards, and will be transparently recorded in the fiscal accounts.
Tax reform
Following the gradual reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent over the
3-year period 2004-06, Parliament approved a personal income tax reform law in December
2006. The personal exemption was raised from €11,000 to €12,000 (it was € 10,000 in 2004)
with effect from 2007, while personal income tax rates are set to decline gradually over the
period 2007-09 from 30 to 25 percent for low incomes (€12,000-30,000) and from 40 to
35 percent for middle incomes (€30,000-75,000). Thus, the top marginal tax rate of
40 percent will only apply to incomes above €75,000 (compared to the current €30,000).
Several tax exemptions were simultaneously abolished, thus broadening the tax base.

3
Public enterprise reform
An important law on public enterprise reform was approved by Parliament in November
2005. The law aims at increasing the commercial orientation of public enterprises and
streamlining their operations to reduce their reliance on debt guarantees and budget transfers.
Public enterprises have to submit annual business plans and longer-term strategic plans for
approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and draw up charters of “obligations to
the consumer” defining their obligations regarding the services they deliver. To facilitate
fulfillment of these goals, the law provides for greater flexibility in personnel management
by ending the civil service status of newly-hired employees, who will no longer have life
tenure. It also provides for the adoption of international accounting standards and best
practices of corporate governance.
Pension reform
The authorities are fully aware that aging-related issues pose a threat to long-term fiscal
sustainability. They are also keenly aware of the need to build broad consensus before
embarking on pension reform. Much preparatory work also needs to be done to collect
comparable data from Greece’s highly fragmented pension system, consisting of more than
seventy pension funds, pending the creation of a national register. To this effect, a high-level
committee was given the mandate to make a technical assessment of the situation of the
pension system and to prepare actuarial projections with the assistance of the ILO. The
committee is due to present its findings for public debate in the fall of 2007. Efforts are also
underway in order to control the finances of the health care system – partly funded by the
pension funds – mainly by centralizing and reforming their procurement practices. The
accumulation of arrears to suppliers in the past were eventually taken over by the government
and added to the public debt.
Other structural reforms
Greece has made strides in closing the gap in living standards with the euro area, but has still
some way to go. Despite the sharp drop in the inflation rate compared to the pre-EMU era,
there is a persistent inflation differential relative to the euro area, pointing to the need to
improve productivity and competitiveness. To this end, important steps have been taken to
make the product and labor markets more flexible, promote competition, and improve the
business climate by reducing administrative barriers and costs along with the tax burden.
Network industries are being gradually liberalized, and a strategic ally is being sought by the
government in the incumbent telecom company. The authorities recognize that further
progress is needed in deregulation and privatization if Greece is to become a more attractive
destination for foreign direct investment and reap the benefits of rapid advances in
technology.
Financial stability
The banking sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the financial sector, appears
generally sound. Profitability, solvency and liquidity are satisfactory and recent stress tests

4
conducted by the Bank of Greece show that capital adequacy ratios would remain well above
regulatory thresholds even if credit risks materialized under severe conditions. The BoG has
taken an appropriately proactive stance, building on FSAP and previous Article IV
consultation recommendations. Greece’s AML/CFT system has been fully adjusted to a
risk-based approach, and so has the framework for banks’ internal controls, compliance and
risk management functions. BoG introduced compulsory liquidity ratios in order to address
the increasing reliance on non-retail funding, while country risk monitoring has been
requested for internationally active Greek banking groups.
Continued rapid credit growth and persistently high NPLs warrant continued vigilance. As
the risk management systems are in a transitional period between Basel I and II, the BoG has
been gradually exploiting the new methodologies and the enhanced availability of data. By
requiring increased write-offs and improved risk monitoring by banks, the BoG expects a
material reduction in the NPL ratio by the end of 2007. In particular, the BoG has asked risk
managers to set their risk appetite at an NPL ratio of 3-4 percent, well below the current level
of 5.5 percent of total loans. To limit credit to highly indebted households, the BoG has
introduced prudential measures that have already been incorporated in the credit and scoring
systems of banks.
