Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Malaysia
Approved by Mahmood Pradhan and David Marston
July 16, 2010


Discussions: During May 21˗June 2, 2010 with Mr. Husni (Minister of Finance II),
Messrs. Yakcop and Jala (both Ministers in the Prime Minister’s Department),
Mr. Mustapha (Minister for International Trade and Industry), Mr. Wan Aziz (Secretary
General of the Treasury), Governor Zeti and the then Deputy Governor Ooi of Bank
Negara Malaysia, other senior officials, and private sector representatives.
Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Toh (OED) attended the policy meetings.



Team: Messrs. Zanello, Dodzin, Abdel˗Rahman, Nabar, and Balakrishnan (all APD).



Context of past surveillance: There has been broad agreement between the authorities
and the Fund on desirable policies—a prudent fiscal stance, reforms of
government˗linked companies, measures to improve the investment climate, flexibility
in monetary and exchange rate management, and further steps to strengthen Malaysia’s
financial system. Views have differed, however, on the pace of reform. The authorities
have favored a more gradual approach, perhaps better attuned to political realities and
implementation constraints. For the issues discussed in the 2009 Article IV
consultation, see http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=23189.0.



Exchange arrangement: Malaysia has accepted obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. Its exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement
is classified as ―other managed‖ and remains appropriate.



FSAP: Malaysia has formally requested to participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program next year.



Data: Broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts are necessary to
improve statistics for the consolidated public sector.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Malaysia has emerged from the world recession with strong forward
momentum. Forceful counter˗cyclical policies, sound balance sheets, and intra˗regional trade
have primed the recovery. Prospects for the near term are good. The global downturn has led
to a rethinking of the development model, though. The government has formulated a
multi˗pillar strategy to double per capita income by the next decade.
Focus of the discussions. The Article IV discussions focused on the policy requirements to
support the recovery and the priorities for structural reforms over the medium term. The
authorities and the staff were in broad agreement on key issues.
Fiscal policy. The 2010 budget marks a return to consolidation. The deficit target, which
seemed ambitious when the budget was unveiled, now looks within reach thanks to
stronger˗than˗anticipated growth and oil revenues. The staff argued that budgetary gains
would prove transitory, however, if the broader agenda of fiscal reforms remains unfinished.
In particular, subsidy reform and the introduction of the goods and service tax should not be
delayed. The authorities confirmed that both were high priorities but that a broad consensus
on implementation modalities was still being forged.
Monetary policy. Policy normalization is underway. Bank Negara Malaysia has raised the
policy rate in three quarter˗point steps but the stance remains supportive. There was
agreement that the gradual monetary exit was consistent with the improved outlook, absence
of price pressures, and concerns about side˗effects of abnormally low interest rates.
Financial sector policies. Malaysia’s financial sector has withstood the global recession
well. There was agreement that some Basel III requirements may be onerous for local banks.
A new Central Bank of Malaysia Act further strengthens the underpinnings of the financial
system. The Malaysian authorities have requested to participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program.
Structural reforms. Malaysia’s New Economic Model addresses supply-side impediments
that have kept the country ensnared in a middle-income trap. The Tenth Malaysia Plan makes
operational the economic strategy through 2015. The authorities shared the view that a
meaningful uplift in trend growth requires structural reforms on a broad front. Like the staff,
they saw signs of a renewed political commitment to push the agenda but cautioned that
molding the necessary social consensus would require time.
Exchange rate. The authorities and the staff also shared the view that a stronger ringgit in
real effective terms could facilitate over time the implementation of the economic
transformation program by contributing to higher real incomes for households, greater capital
deepening, faster productivity gains, and demand shifts in favor of services. The staff noted
that the ringgit in real effective terms appears to be weaker than its estimated equilibrium
level. The authorities disagree with this assessment.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Malaysia has come out strongly from the world recession. Forceful
counter˗cyclical policies, sound balance sheets, and intra˗regional trade have primed the
recovery. With rebounding domestic and global demand, output losses have by now been
largely reversed. Prospects for the near term are good, provided that the external environment
does not deteriorate.
2.
The cyclical momentum has re-energized the policy debate. The global downturn
has led to a rethinking of the development strategy. The emerging view is that Malaysia is at
a crossroads. The economic model that produced significant advances over three decades has
lost the ability to drive the country forward. Old polices are under review and the political
leadership is making the case for a national transformation to free Malaysia from the
middle˗income trap where it is now stuck.
3.
A multi˗pillar strategy has taken shape. It spans a vision to increase social
cohesion while preserving Malaysia’s cultural diversity (―1Malaysia‖), a plan to improve
governance and the delivery of public goods (the Government Transformation Program), a
framework for far˗reaching structural reforms (the Economic Transformation Program built
on the New Economic Model, NEM) and a blueprint for economic change over the next five
years (the Tenth Malaysia Plan, 10MP). Development policies have been dressed in rhetoric
before but the sense of urgency seems higher now than in the past.
4.
Against this background, the 2010 Article IV discussions tackled both
short˗term and longer-term questions. Exchanges of views focused on the policy
requirements to support the expansion and the priorities for structural reforms. There was
broad agreement on the key issues.
5.
Malaysia has requested to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). This is an important outcome of the 2010 Article IV discussions.

Labor markets are also tightening
after showing resilience throughout
the downturn. The unemployment
rate for 2009 peaked at about
3¾ percent, better than anticipated at
the time of the 2009 Article IV
consultations. Job vacancies in
manufacturing are now larger than
before the crisis, but slack in other
sectors remains.

Monthly Inflation: Headline and Core
10

Jan-08



As the output gap widened and
global energy and food prices
collapsed, headline inflation fell to
below 1 percent (y/y) last year, after
a stretch of monthly deflation. The
momentum has shifted with the
upswing. On a monthly basis,
inflation has been positive since last
December, with the latest reading in
May at 1.6 percent.

Domestic financial conditions have improved with the turn of the cycle.



Supported by policy, credit growth remained positive even as output shrunk. It is now
gaining steam on its own benefitting from strong demand for consumer loans and
mortgages. The recovery in business lending has also been robust. Base lending rates,
which bottomed out at 5½ percent, have been trending up since March 2010.



Equity prices have risen about
50 percent since the lows of
March 2009, and about 5 percent so
far this year. The rally has not been
as strong as in other regional
markets, reflecting Malaysia’s
weaker capital inflows and shallower
correction in the sell-off.

Malaysia’s external position continues to be strong.



The current account surplus fell modestly to 16½ percent of GDP in 2009. Imports of
intermediate goods shadowed the decline of manufacturing exports and demand for
commodities (mainly hydrocarbons, rubber, timber, and palm oil) held up better than
expected. Despite a boost to the service account from tourism, the income balance
remained in deficit, reflecting profit repatriation by multinationals and continued
excess of payments over receipts in the investment account.



Malaysia experienced net outflows throughout the year (Box 1). Portfolio inflows
picked up in the second half of 2009, but outward FDI and ―other investments‖
swamped the uptick. Both flows have been negative in net terms for years reflecting
underlying trends—the expansion abroad of Malaysian businesses, trade financing
flows, and the recycling of current account surpluses.



The buildup of official reserves during the commodity up˗cycle before the crisis
helped accommodate large capital movements through 2009 in the global sell˗off of
emerging market assets. Reserves

Box 1. Malaysia: Recent Trends in Capital Flows
Malaysia has experienced net capital
outflows on the financial account since the
late 1990s. These have been the reflection of
current account surpluses after the Asia crisis as
well as structural factors favoring investment
abroad by residents. In particular, over the last
few years net FDI outflows have grown, as a
result of limited opportunities for domestic
investment by foreigners (for example following
the IT bubble crash), greater competition from
China, Singapore, and Hong Kong SAR, as well
as growing investment abroad by Malaysian
companies seeking economies of scale, a
regional exposure (e.g., in telecom), or supplies
of natural resources (oil and gas field or land for
plantations).
Over the last four quarters, capital flows on
the financial account have rebounded
somewhat but continue to be negative (charts
at bottom of the Box).




Net capital flows to the general government
have bounced from crisis-lows into positive
territory, reflecting increased appetite of
foreign investors for government securities
and related portfolio inflows.

Net flows related to sectors other than the general government were negative and more than offset the
government-related inflows. The main drivers were sustained current account surpluses, a revival of
trade credit from exporters to importers overseas, and an increased willingness of the private sector to
place funds abroad. In particular, net outflows related to loans and other non-portfolio investments have
picked up for both banks and nonbanks, while net portfolio flows to nongovernment sectors, which
spiked in the second quarter of 2009 mostly due to debt inflows, have since trailed off and turned into
outflows.

Outlook and Risks
9.

Malaysia’s near˗term prospects are favorable.



Near˗term outlook: GDP is projected to expand by around 7 percent in 2010,
narrowing, but not closing, the output gap. As favorable base effects play out and
policy support is reeled in, growth should moderate in 2011. Both external and
private domestic demand will propel activity in the near term. Net exports should
continue to benefit from the electronics cycle, commodity demand, and the regional
upswing, while household consumption should be supported by higher rural incomes
and improving labor markets. A pronounced bounce˗back of private investment does
not seem in the cards, given still unused capacity, but capital expenditure at public
enterprises is expected to pick up. CPI inflation should continue to remain low at
about 2 percent for the year while slack is being taken up, although it could spike if
key administered prices are adjusted.



Risks: The risks to the outlook are balanced. On the downside, withdrawal of policy
support in advanced economies or adverse developments in Europe may undermine
global demand and commodity trade, sapping domestic activity. Volatility in
international markets could also spill onto local ones, although direct contagion from
Europe through financial channels seems unlikely.1 On the upside, confidence at
home and abroad could improve further, intra˗regional trade may get a boost from the
ASEAN˗China free trade agreement in force since January 2010, and revenues from
commodity exports could keep trending up.

10.
The outlook for the medium term depends on the scope and speed of the
government’s own economic transformation program.


impediments to investment and high precautionary savings, which current policies
address only partially.


Reform scenario. With stepped-up reforms on a broad front, GDP growth could reach
7 percent by the end of projection period, meeting the goal under the 10th Malaysia
Plan. The growth-dividend materializes in the outer years, contingent on the
implementation of a critical mass of initiatives. The pace of activity is set by private

11.
The authorities broadly concurred with these assessments. The latest official
projection is for 2010 growth between 4½ percent and 5½ percent but it predates the
first˗quarter GDP outturn. The range will likely be revised up in the next forecasting round.
There was also agreement at the BNM that inflation probably will remain in check and will
not be a policy concern for the period ahead. Regarding the medium term, the authorities
shared the view that a meaningful uplift in trend growth requires structural reforms on a
broad front. Like the staff, they saw encouraging signs of a renewed political commitment to
push the agenda but cautioned that grass-root support was still being harnessed.
III. FROM THE RECESSION TO A HIGH-GROWTH PATH
A. Monetary Policy
Background
12.
Policy normalization is underway.2 After aggressive loosening in 2009, the BNM
started policy normalization in March 2010. It has since raised the policy rate to 2.75 percent
in three quarter˗point steps. The firming up of the recovery and the danger of excessive risk

The BNM cut the overnight policy rate by 150 basis points between November 2008 and March 2009. It also
slashed the statutory reserve requirements by 300 basis points.

10
taking in an environment of very low interest rates set the stage for the monetary exit. Robust
activity in the second quarter motivated the latest rate increase on July 8, notwithstanding
mixed signals from abroad. A flattening of the yield curve suggests a likely pause in the
tightening cycle for the rest of the year.
Staff’s Views
13.
The measured pace of monetary tightening so far has been on the mark. It is in
line with Taylor˗rule calculations and sends a signal against investors’ complacency in the
pricing of risks after a year and a half of loose monetary conditions. With real rates still
below their long˗term average, the policy stance is nonetheless still supportive. In the staff’s
view, this is warranted for two reasons. First, the global recovery remains fragile; and
second, fiscal risks suggest giving precedence to budgetary consolidation in sequencing the
exits from policy support. In fact, using fiscal policy rather than interest rates to contain
demand pressures in the period ahead may discourage speculative inflows.
14.
Moving forward, further withdrawal of monetary support should continue to be
contingent on the evolving risks to growth and the need for policy insurance. The latest
hike (after the Article IV discussions) may have put the BNM slightly ―ahead of the curve‖
and the case for staying the course is now even stronger than a month ago. Factors that need
to inform monetary decisions in the period ahead include the vigor of the global recovery,
second˗round effects of possible subsidy reforms, and the spillovers on asset markets from
volatile capital movements across borders.
Authorities’ Views and Plans
15.
Bank Negara noted that a gradual monetary exit was consistent with the
improved outlook, absence of price pressures, and concerns about side˗effects of
abnormally low interest rates. In particular, financial imbalances arising from underpricing of risk, excessive leverage, and financial disintermediation in the search for higher
yields could not be ruled out in an environment of very low interest rates. The increase in the
policy rate has shored up the return on bank deposits and reduced the risk of vulnerabilities
on the asset side of households’ balance sheets. From this angle, the latest rate hike has been
part of a continued normalization process.
16.
There was agreement that the return to a neutral stance needs to be informed by
external as well as internal considerations. Policy will need to adapt flexibly over the next
few quarters. A pragmatic approach had already been reflected in the decision not to reverse
the November 2008 cut in reserve requirements which had lost relevance as a policy tool and
undercut intermediation. Flexibility had also been shown earlier with the adoption of
schemes to maintain the flow of credit to consumers and SMEs. Similar facilities could be
re˗activated if the conjuncture deteriorated. Finally, the BNM thought that the depth and
sophistication of Malaysia’s financial sector could spread the impact of sudden capital

11
movements across a wider set of markets and thus curb the risks posed by volatile flows.
However, judicious exchange rate policies are still required to lessen their impact on the real
economy.3
B. Fiscal Policy
Background
17.
The 2010 budget marks a return to consolidation. The policy response to the
global recession led to rising deficits in 2008 and 2009. While the stimulus was timely,
diversified, and appropriate, it has exacerbated fiscal risks. The 2010 budget addresses this
situation by targeting a reduction in the

Other fiscal initiatives are being considered. The roll out of the long˗delayed goods
and service tax (GST) has been announced but legislative details are still in the works. The
GST is intended to broaden—and stabilize—the tax base by replacing two existing taxes in a
revenue˗neutral fashion. Tax incentives to foreign and domestic companies are also under
review as the mandate of the Malaysia Investment Development Agency is being revamped.
According to a 2006 World Bank study, tax holidays represent a very large drain on the
budget, estimated at about half of total tax revenues. On the expenditure side, the authorities
are considering overhauling Malaysia’s fragmented and ill˗targeted social safety nets—a task
which will gain prominence if a big push for reforms gets underway and programs to
mitigate their transitional costs are developed. Finally, subsidy reform has taken center stage
in the public discussions—and has become the poster-child of the costs and benefits of
structural adjustment. Excluding those for education and health, subsidies account for
some 20 percent of government spending or about 5 percent of GDP, with the bulk going to
reducing the cost of fuel to consumers and industry.

Staff’s Views
19.
Fiscal risks in Malaysia have grown over the years. Policy has been procyclical in
good times, setting the stage for unprecedented deficits when budget support was necessary
during the crisis. Increased dependence on oil revenue further undermines the public
finances.4 Against this backdrop, the authorities are right in their commitment to strengthen
the fiscal position.
20.
Consolidation is needed to reconstitute room for maneuver and forestall market
concerns. The 2010 budget marks a welcome step in this direction. The deficit target, which
seemed ambitious when the budget was unveiled, now looks within reach thanks to
stronger˗than˗anticipated growth and oil revenues. Budgetary gains will prove transitory,
however, if the broader agenda of fiscal reforms remains unfinished.
21.
Savings can be achieved by rationalizing subsidies and tax structures. Political
realities suggest that subsidy reform needs to be gradual but sustained. The sooner it starts the
better. The broad approach under consideration—centered on periodic reductions of key
subsidies with compensatory cash transfers to the most vulnerable groups—seems broadly
appropriate, provided that reform fatigue does not set in. Fuel subsidies are particularly
ill˗targeted and should be prime candidates for reform, unlocking efficiency gains across the
economy. The roll out of the GST should also not be held back, although some delays on
technical grounds may be unavoidable even after the relevant legislation is enacted. More
focused outreach and clearer communication may be necessary to galvanize the public debate
and mold a consensus. An overhaul of tax incentives could also mobilize savings and should
be considered in the context of a future reform of corporate taxation.
22.
Malaysia should also strengthen its budget framework along three dimensions.
First, an indicative consolidation path along which the deficit is brought back to more
manageable levels should inform fiscal plans. This approach could cast budget decisions in a
starker multi-year perspective and provide discipline. Second, budget documents could
include a statement of fiscal risks to assess vulnerabilities surrounding budget outcomes.
Publication of the statement could improve transparency (as recommended in the NEM
report) and market perceptions. Third, budget decisions could emphasize the evolution of the
non˗oil balance and be benchmarked against a framework that links spending to an equitable
drawdown of oil wealth.5 This approach would lessen the impact of oil price volatility on
fiscal planning.
4

Oil revenues, including the dividend paid to the budget by Petronas, are some 40 percent of total revenues—
10 percentage points more than a decade ago.
5

Malaysia’s proven reserves of hydrocarbons amount to 5½ billion barrels of oil and 88 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas. Oil is expected to be depleted in about 22 years at the current extraction rate of about 650,000
barrels per day, gas in about 35 years.

Officials at the Ministry of Finance shared the staff’s views on the desirable
direction of fiscal policy. They noted that,

24.
There was also agreement about possible enhancements to Malaysia’s fiscal
frameworks. For example, the authorities noted that the 10MP includes an indicative
consolidation path for the deficit over the next five years, as recommended in earlier
consultations. Fiscal risks are also routinely assessed in the context of the budget process.
Nonetheless, the suggestion to flesh out a more formal statement for possible inclusion in the
budget documentation is worth considering.
25.
Reforming subsidies, social programs, and tax structures remains a top priority
but the timing for action needs to be chosen carefully. These reforms require spending
political capital and need to be sequenced with care. Welfare schemes are under review and
the general thrust of past recommendations from the IMF will be reflected in the policy
design. Technical assistance from the IMF on tax incentives to corporates is also being
sought ahead of the next budget cycle. Subsidy reform holds out the promise of significant
budgetary savings in the short term. However, it must be gradual (to give households and
firms time to adjust) and it must be complemented by targeted relief measures (to avoid a
backlash). Savings from greater efficiency in public service delivery under the Government
Transformation Program will also contribute to consolidation. Finally, the authorities agreed
that, while the roll out of the GST is on track, a better outreach to the general public and
SMEs will increase the buy˗in. In the same vein, an anti˗profiteering bill has been tabled in
parliament to allay concerns that the introduction of the GST may provide a pretext for price
gouging.

C. Financial Sector Issues
Background
26.
Malaysia’s financial sector has withstood the global recession well. Thanks to the
BNM’s proactive supervision, measures to ensure uninterrupted access to financing, and
prudent lending practices, loan books did not deteriorate as much as feared and started
improving in the second half of 2009. Banks

agency. Household debt has been rising,
though, partly as a result of official initiatives to promote home ownership. Nonetheless,
there are no signs of strains in servicing debt. There are also no signs of systemic froth in
property markets.
27.
Islamic finance has performed as well as conventional finance in the downturn.
Although sukuk issuance was lower than in previous years, Malaysia strengthened its
position as an Islamic finance hub by introducing last year the world’s first
Shariah˗compliant commodity trading platform using palm oil as the underlying commodity.
28.
An international working group is coordinating the modalities of exit from
blanket deposit guarantees. The decisions of the group, which brings together officials
from the BNM, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, will also pave the way for the adoption of enhanced deposit insurance schemes
in 2011. In the case of Malaysia, deposit insurance will provide coverage for virtually all
depositors including businesses and around 40 percent of deposits. The insurance premium
will continue to be risk˗based.7
29.
A new Central Bank of Malaysia Act was passed in 2009. The act provides more
clarity on the mandate of the BNM and vests with it the necessary powers. Overall, it
strengthens the ability of the BNM to undertake surveillance and to avert risks to financial
stability. The act also lays out a more robust and transparent governance framework.8

6

The aggregate debt˗to˗equity ratio remains below 50 percent and the interest coverage ratio is about 5 percent.

7

A compensation scheme for holders of insurance and takaful products is also in the works.

15
Staff’s Views
30.
The authorities’ sustained efforts to develop capital markets, broaden
intermediation, and strengthen risk management have paid off in the global downturn.
Built˗in cushions softened the blows from market turbulence and collapsing activity. The
Central Bank of Malaysia Act further reinforces the underpinnings of the financial system,
among other things by expanding the BNM’s ability to resolve financial institutions.
31.
Notwithstanding strong balance sheets, stricter regulations on capital, liquidity
and leverage under discussion in international fora could be burdensome for local
institutions. For example, the proposed treatment of subsidiaries may put pressure on the
capital adequacy of bank holding companies and the proposed treatment of wholesale
deposits could erode liquidity buffers at banks. The impact of other reforms in the works
(e.g., levies, surcharges on systemically important institutions, ―through˗the˗cycle‖
provisioning) remains more speculative, given lack of specificity so far on the design of the
reform package. As the prudential framework adapts, the BNM’s commitment to a hands˗on
proactive approach will continue to serve Malaysia well. From this angle, there may be a
case for a formal broadening of the regulatory perimeter to encompass financial holding
companies—a step that would institutionalize current practices.
32.
Plans to unwind by year˗end the blanket deposit guarantee and move to an
insurance system with higher deposit coverage are welcome. They ensure international
consistency among economies with strong financial linkages and, in all likelihood, make the
removal of support a non-event. More broadly, as the regulatory landscape evolves, efforts to
upgrade contingency planning and coordinate with supervisors in other jurisdictions will
continue to be helpful.

The ratio of financial assets to household debt is about 2.5, and the ratio of liquid financial assets to household
debt is about 1.5. The fact that this debt is for the most part mortgages also limits risks to banks. Households’
NPLs remain low at 3.1 percent at end 2009, down from 4.1 in 2008.

16
34.
There was also agreement that, despite ample Tier I capital at local institutions,
the adoption of some Basel III norms could create pressures in the financial system.
Tighter requirements on liquidity and funding may place onerous demands on some banks, if
the sizeable (and stable) deposits of the Employee Provident Fund are treated as wholesale
funding for which liquid assets need to be set aside.10 More broadly, the BNM noted that the
international consultative process needs to become more inclusive and some discretion in
implementation should be left to the national authorities who can best assess local conditions
without compromising the outcome of the regulations.
35.
In the BNM’s view, the global crisis has cast a sharp light on Islamic finance. In
the Islamic finance business model, financing can only be extended to real sector activities
that have economic value. This principle establishes a close link between financial
transactions and productive flows. Exposure to excessive leverage and risk taking is thus
curtailed, giving the system added resilience when shocks originate in the financial sector.
Accordingly, the appeal of Islamic banking as ―ethical banking‖ has grown—and Malaysia, a
hub of Islamic financial services, is well placed to capitalize on the trend. As recognized by
the Task Force on Islamic Finance and Global Stability (chaired by Governor Zeti),
additional development of Shariah-compliant liquidity management and hedging instruments
would further underpin the soundness of the system.
36.
The Malaysian authorities have requested to participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program. Malaysia has undertaken more than a decade of capacity building and
financial reforms under an ambitious Financial Sector Master Plan now in its final phase of
implementation. As a result, the efficiency and stability of the financial system have been
fundamentally strengthened. There was agreement that participation in the FSAP would
reinforce the strong fundamentals already in place and facilitate the identification of areas for
further enhancements. The BNM suggests that the FSAP take place next year at the earliest.
D. Priorities for Structural Reforms and Exchange Rate Assessment
Background
37.
Malaysia is stuck in a middle˗income trap. A low˗income country at birth in 1957,
Malaysia climbed the ladder to attain upper middle˗income status in the early 1990.11
Sectoral shifts (from the primary sector to advanced manufacturing) fuelled growth. Strong
foreign investment, a proactive government, and high saving rates facilitated the transition.
10

The Employee Provident Fund administers a mandatory defined-contributions pension scheme for all non
government employees and the self-employed in the formal economy. It covers some 6 million workers, about
half of the labor force.
11

The World Bank classifies countries as upper middle-income if GNI per capita is in the range
$4,000−$12,000. Malaysia’s per capita income is about $7,000.

17
However, the momentum stalled in the run up to the Asia crisis and has never been
recovered. Unlike some countries with comparable initial trajectories, Malaysia has so far
been unable to breach the high˗income threshold.12
38.
Growth underperformance in a small open economy suggests supply˗side
problems. These are what the NEM tries to address by rolling back affirmative action,
improving human capital, and spurring productivity growth—steps necessary to revive the
business climate and double Malaysia’s per capita income by 2020 (Box 2).
Box 2. The New Economic Model and the Tenth Malaysia Plan1/
The New Economic Model (NEM), prepared by the National Economic Advisory
Council and unveiled by the government in March, is a program to transform Malaysia
into an innovative, knowledge-intensive, and high-income economy by 2020. The overall
framework of the NEM identifies strategic reform areas that include enhancing private sector
participation in the economy, improving workforce skills, supporting innovation, developing
new sources of growth, and strengthening public sector management.
The Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011−2015), released in June, provides the policy framework
for implementing many of the NEM’s strategic suggestions. Its main macroeconomic
objectives are to sustain annual GDP growth at 6 percent on average and to bring gradually
down the budget deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP by 2015. Microeconomic objectives
include a competition law, further liberalization of services, divestment of some public
enterprises, market prices for subsidized commodities, an innovation-friendly environment,
and reduced dependence of on foreign labor.

39.
The Tenth Malaysia Plan (10MP) makes operational the economic strategy
through 2015. The 10MP provides a broad framework for budgetary allocations. It is to be
revised after about two years, in light of progress toward its macroeconomic and social
goal˗posts. These include raising the shares in GDP of private consumption and investment,
promoting high value˗added services over low˗value added manufacturing, and improving
the well˗being of the most disadvantaged. The National Economic Advisory Council will
refine implementation details later this year.

12

More successful peers include Korea, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.

18
Staff’s Views
40.
The NEM report suggests a sea-change in the attitude toward comprehensive
structural reforms. It sets up a stark choice for Malaysians and their political leadership, a
choice between muddling through in a business-as-usual mode and going for a historical
transformation of the economy. The report takes on many of the recommendations raised in
previous Article IV discussions—reform of government-linked companies, further product
and labor market liberalization (including a review of employment protection), improved
education and vocational training, and better targeted social safety nets and tax incentives.
The agenda is daunting and will require difficult trade-offs, given the tight fiscal envelope.
41.
Implementation needs to be pragmatic but steady. Acting at a measured pace on a
broad front is probably the best way to exploit policy complementarities and harness the
benefits of reform. Future elaborations of the roadmap could usefully develop ―What if?‖
scenario analysis to take into account that unforeseen contingencies may force detours from
the envisaged transformation plan.
42.
A stronger ringgit over the medium term will help achieve the objectives of the
NEM and the 10MP. An appreciated ringgit in real effective terms will over time facilitate
the implementation of the authorities’ economic transformation program and contribute to
higher real incomes for households, greater capital deepening, faster productivity gains, and
demand shifts in favor of services. Subject to the usual wide margin of uncertainty, modelbased estimates suggest that the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the ringgit is
currently weaker than the level implied by its estimated medium-term determinants
(Appendix I). This assessment needs, however, to be seen in a context of structural rigidities
that have generated a persistent excess of national savings over investment and significant
share of commodities in exports. Moreover, there is no feasible reorientation of the policy
mix in the near term (toward a more expansionary fiscal stance and a more restrictive
monetary policy) that could speed up the external adjustment without compromising
domestic stability—or potentially triggering speculative inflows. In fact, under established
exchange rate policies (captured by the appreciation of the ringgit in effective terms since the
beginning of the year) the undervaluation could be eliminated over the medium term, thus
limiting concerns about Malaysia’s external stability (Figure 2).
Authorities’ Views and Plans
43.
There was agreement that the reform program needs to be calibrated to political
realities. The authorities’ stressed that consensus is still being forged and there are limits to
what may realistically be expected in the short run. Nonetheless, the leadership’s

19
commitment to reform is strong and implementation questions are more a matter of ―when‖
or ―how‖ than ―if.‖ In their view, it is encouraging that measurable progress had already been
made on a variety of fronts, for example in liberalizing services and rolling back social
policies that had proved ineffective in addressing income inequality and lack of opportunity.
44.
The authorities share the staff’s view that the ringgit will strengthen with the
economy over the medium term but disagree strongly with the assessment of the
current level of the exchange rate. They stressed again that Malaysia’s exchange rate
policies: (i) do not target a particular exchange rate; (ii) have been informed by the need to
prevent overshooting in both directions, as evidenced by the massive draw-down of reserves
last year; and (iii) are consistent with a gradual appreciation of the currency, as shown by the
recent gains of the ringgit REER. The BNM further argues that it is naïve to think that
monetary policy can control the real exchange rate and that pre-committing to an
appreciation path could at present invite disorderly capital inflows. Moreover, in the BNM’s
view, the machinery for the assessment is opaque as to the policy implications or the
appropriate pace for balance of payments adjustment.13
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Malaysia has emerged from the global recession with strong forward
momentum. Countercyclical policies and sound fundamentals have paved the way for the
broad-based recovery underway. Smooth exits from extraordinary interventions are in train
and policy is returning to more normal settings. The authorities should be commended for
skillful macroeconomic management.
46.
The cyclical upswing has galvanized the policy debate. The realization that
strategies used to achieve the current state of development are now inadequate to move
further up the income ladder has motivated an ambitious agenda for social change. The
reform program at the heart of Malaysia’s New Economic Model could bring about a farreaching transformation of the economy and achieve the authorities’ goal of doubling per
capita income by the next decade.
47.
The authorities have already taken first steps to bolster the public finances.
The 2010 budget marks a commendable return to consolidation. Sustained fiscal adjustment
will be necessary to reconstitute policy space and put the debt ratio on a firmly declining
path. The indicative consolidation path in the Tenth Malaysia Plan provides a useful
benchmark for future budget decisions.
48.
Budgetary gains will prove transitory, however, if a broader agenda of fiscal
reforms remains unfinished. In particular, poorly targeted and distortionary fuel subsidies
should be phased out sooner rather than later, and the introduction of a goods and service tax
13

Appendix I describes the CGER-methodologies used as well as the authorities’ views.

20
should not be unduly delayed. Malaysia should also enhance its budget framework by
articulating as part of the budget documents a statement of fiscal risks and by benchmarking
budget decisions against a framework that links spending to an equitable drawdown of oil
wealth.
49.
Monetary policy has been appropriately recalibrated to sustain non-inflationary
growth. Bank Negara Malaysia’s measured pace of monetary tightening so far has been on
the mark. With real rates below their long-term average, the policy stance is still supportive.
This is warranted both because the global recovery remains fragile and because fiscal risks
suggest giving precedence to budgetary consolidation in sequencing the exits from policy
support. With subdued inflation in the forecast and the pace of activity likely to moderate
going forward, a wait-and-see approach is appropriate for the period ahead.
50.
Malaysia’s financial sector has shown resilience in the global downturn. The
authorities’ sustained efforts to develop capital markets, broaden intermediation, and
strengthen risk management have paid dividend during challenging times. The Central Bank
of Malaysia Act of 2009 further reinforces the underpinnings of the financial system. As the
regulatory framework adapts, Bank Negara’s commitment to a hands-on proactive approach
will continue to serve Malaysia well. Plans to unwind by year˗end the blanket deposit
guarantee and move to an insurance system with higher deposit coverage are welcome.
51.
The authorities have laid out a comprehensive vision for a national
transformation over the longer term. The structural reform agenda is daunting and will
require difficult trade-offs, given the tight fiscal envelope. Yet, hard choices seem
unavoidable to lift productivity growth and living standards. Accordingly, implementation
will need to be calibrated to political realities. Acting at a measured pace on a broad front is
probably the best way to exploit policy complementarities and harness the benefits of reform.
However, careful communication will be needed to sustain the adjustment and pre-empt
reform fatigue.
52.
A strengthening over time of the ringgit in real effective terms will facilitate the
implementation of the authorities’ economic transformation program. Model-based
estimates suggest that the real effective ringgit is below its equilibrium level. The currency is
likely to continue to strengthen as structural reforms advance. This appreciation should
facilitate the achievement of the authorities’ goal of rebalancing the sources of growth
toward domestic demand.
53.
Malaysia’s request to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) is welcome. A decade of capacity building and financial reforms has greatly
strengthened the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Participation in the FSAP
should reinforce the strong foundations already in place and facilitate the identification of
areas for further enhancements.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: MALAYSIA—EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Staff’s Assessment
The IMF Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) applies three approaches to
assess the level of the real effective ringgit in relation to the level implied by
medium˗term fundamentals. According to the CGER, the ringgit is weaker than its
estimated equilibrium level. For example, according to the macroeconomic balance
approach, the current account norm is significantly below the projected current account
(based on unchanged real exchange rate), implying a relatively large undervaluation.
A number of qualitative indicators suggest, however, that the undervaluation is not extreme:
core inflation has been low, there have been no asset price bubbles, and intervention has been
two˗sided. Nonetheless, Malaysia’s current account surplus has been large and protracted,
although a sizeable portion of its increase since 2001 can be traced to the commodity boom.
Risks to external stability are mitigated by two considerations: (i) established exchange rate
policies (as captured by the trend appreciation of the REER so far this year) would probably
eliminate the bulk of the undervaluation over the medium term; and (ii) reforms in the works
should reduce the savings˗investment balance over time. In fact, under the Reform Scenario
in paragraph 10 of the main report, the implied undervaluation under the macroeconomic
balance approach would be modest.
Authorities’ Views
The authorities disagreed with the assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
weaker than the value implied by medium-term fundamentals. In the course of this and
the previous Article IV discussions, they noted that:


Malaysia’s current account surplus has reflected to a large extent a temporary
commodity boom rather than durable gains in competitiveness. Exports of raw
materials make up about two-thirds of the current account balance and have
accounted for nearly half of the 8½ percentage point increase in the current account
as a share of GDP since 2001.



The current account surplus also has a large structural component. It reflects high
private saving because of demographics and underdeveloped social safety nets, and
relatively weak investment demand in a context of market imperfections and
structural shifts. (Tellingly, Malaysia’s investment abroad exceeds inward foreign
investment.) Reforms to strengthen the social security system and address rigidities in
product and labor markets will take time to bear fruit.

32


Official intervention has been two˗sided and in response to volatile capital flows. The
objective has been to smooth volatility and avoid overshooting in a market that
remains relatively shallow. Development of a ringgit bond market has exposed
Malaysia to potentially volatile capital flows. Exchange rate policies thus need to
shield the economy from related instability and dislocations. Sterilized intervention
has provided a buffer against past surges in capital inflows—and the war˗chest to
cope with their reversal in 2009.

Model˗based estimates are too imprecise to be useful for policymaking. In addition,
they are marred by methodological shortcomings, such as the difficulty in accounting
for country˗specific factors and structural changes. In fact, the Fund should be more
cautious in the application of these models—and more evenhanded in its exchange
rate assessments.

Data on market operations are not publicly available, but the size and direction of intervention can be inferred
from the reported change in official foreign exchange reserves.

33


Regardless of its merit, public divulgation of the current staff assessment could
trigger unwelcome capital inflows. These would greatly complicate macroeconomic
management. Even assuming for a moment that it is correct, the assessment provides
no clue as to a desirable or feasible timeframe to manage external adjustment



Finally, the BNM argued that over-emphasis on the exchange rate to do the heavylifting for adjustment is too simplistic. The ringgit appreciation should be seen as the
complement of structural change not the main driver. The focus of policy is to ensure
that the exchange rate does not inhibit the transformation.

ANNEX I: MALAYSIA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The public debt is projected to increase relative to GDP over the medium term.
Under the baseline scenario, the public debt would increase to about 59 percent of GDP
by 2015. Bound tests indicate that the public debt ratio would increase more in case of
shocks. The most severe shock—a decline in real GDP growth of about 1½ percentage point
relative to the baseline—would take public debt to GDP ratio to about 70 percent in 2015.
Several factors mitigate fiscal risks. First, ample domestic savings allow the government to
meet its borrowing requirements with ease and without foreign borrowing. Second, the 2010
budget has marked the return to fiscal consolidation. Other enhancements in fiscal structures
discussed in this report will also strengthen the sustainability of the public finances.
2.
The external debt is expected to decline relative to GDP to about 20 percent
by 2015 in the baseline projection. These dynamics reflects for the most part projected
current account surpluses and a reduction in private and public indebtedness due to steppedup repayments. Bound tests indicate the external debt would remain manageable under all
shocks considered, including a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the ringgit, which would
leave the external debt to GDP ratio at about 30 percent in 2015.

VII. Exchange Arrangement:
On July 21, 2005, the Bank Negara Malaysia announced the adoption of a managed float
with the exchange rate of the ringgit to be monitored against an undisclosed trade˗weighted
basket of currencies. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto
exchange rate regime is classified as ―other managed.‖
Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 23 countries. The authorities have
indicated that these arrangements do not have restrictive features.
Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 and in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis
have mostly been lifted, except for the internationalization of the ringgit. In particular, since
May 2001, nonresident portfolio investors are freely allowed to repatriate their principal
sums and profits out of the country at any time. Malaysia further liberalized exchange control
regulations during 2002−10. The main measures were a relaxation of regulations on
investment abroad by domestic institutions, an easing of regulations on domestic credit
facilities extended to nonresidents, abolition of overnight limits on all foreign currency
accounts maintained by residents and of the net open position limit imposed on a licensed
onshore bank, allowing residents to open and maintain foreign currency accounts for any
purpose, easing requirements on foreign currency and ringgit credit facilities from
nonresidents, relaxation of rules on the provision of financial guarantees, abolition of several
reporting requirements, and a relaxation of the conditions on residents and nonresidents

6
to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge capital account transactions with
licensed onshore banks. In 2008, further measures were undertaken, including easing of rules
on residents’ borrowing in foreign currency, and borrowing in ringgit by residents from
nonresidents as well as lending in ringgit by residents to nonresidents for use in Malaysia.
The Malaysian authorities view remaining exchange control regulations as prudential in
nature and necessary to ensure the availability of adequate information on the settlement of
payments and receipts as part of the monitoring mechanism on capital flows. These controls
do not contravene Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII.
Malaysia, in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions, maintains restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions with respect to some designated
individuals and entities. These measures are maintained for the reasons of national and
international security and have been notified to the Fund pursuant to the IMF Executive
Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Malaysia also restricts current international transactions
between Malaysian residents and Israeli companies and individuals; however, since these
restrictions affect the underlying transactions themselves, they are not subject to Fund
jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(b).
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Malaysia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2009 Article IV
consultation took place during November 9-20, 2007, September 9-16, 2008, and

ANNEX IV: MALAYSIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 17, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics for the
consolidated public sector are necessary.
National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) compiles and publishes annual
and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant prices, and annual
estimates for gross disposable income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on the 1968 SNA. The
quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter. In addition, DOSM has developed
experimental institutional sector accounts in accordance with the 1993 SNA. There are significant differences in
the estimates for key aggregates, particularly for GDP, final consumption expenditures (government, household,
NPISH, and gross capital formation) common to both the 1968 SNA-based GDP compilation system and
the 1993 SNA-based institutional sector accounts system.
Price statistics: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A revised CPI was
introduced in January 2006; it covers all 14 states and features a more disaggregated measure of the
consumption basket and updated expenditure weights based on a 2004/05 comprehensive household income
and expenditure survey.
Government finance statistics: There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability of data on
NFPEs and the state and local governments. Dissemination of more detailed data on nonlisted NFPEs’ assets
and liabilities and domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be desirable;
efforts in this direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), the
Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are reported on a timely and regular basis and
are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional coverage of the
financial corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and valuation of financial
instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. In addition, due to
the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and other financial intermediaries in Malaysia,
coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The MFS missions of January 2004 and 2005
developed an integrated monetary database to be used for publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA,
and APD. The Bank Negara Malaysia reports data in STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which provide
more detailed classification of certain items, fuller sectoral and instrument breakdown, and currency aggregation.
MFS based on the SRFs are published in the quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments: Department of Statistics Malaysia compiles and publishes quarterly balance of payments
estimates in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and the SDDS. The quarterly
data are released three months after the reference quarter. No data are shown for the capital transfers or
acquisition/sale of nonproduced nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are computed as
differences in amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international investment position
data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported only in an aggregate form.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility option
for general government operations (within six-quarter lags after the end of reference year).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Malaysia
July 30, 2010
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic developments. High-frequency data suggest that Malaysia’s expansion remains on
track. Consumption indicators are strong, suggesting continued household confidence, while
industrial production experienced in May the third consecutive month of double˗digit
year˗on˗year growth. Declining momentum for exports and industrial output suggest,
however, a slower pace of activity in the quarters ahead. Inflation is not a concern at present.
The June CPI was 1.7 percent higher than a year earlier and in line with the staff’s
projections.
Policy developments. On July 16, 2010, the government reduced subsidies for some key
commodities. The price of sugar has been raised by 15 percent; low˗octane gasoline and
diesel prices have been increased by some 3 percent, and the price of liquefied petroleum gas
has gone up by about 6 percent. High˗octane gasoline is no longer subsidized. Although these
measures fall short of earlier official proposals, they mark the beginning of the subsidy
reform program highlighted in the New Economic Model and advocated by the Fund in past
consultations.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Malaysia
On July 30, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Malaysia.1
Background
Malaysia has come out strongly from the world recession. Forceful counter˗cyclical policies,
sound balance sheets, and intra˗regional trade have primed the recovery. With rebounding
domestic and global demand, output losses have by now been reversed. With strong
momentum in late 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, seasonally-adjusted GDP is now close to
pre˗crisis levels, reversing a nearly 6½ percent peak˗to˗trough loss. Labor markets are also
tightening after showing resilience throughout the downturn. The unemployment rate for 2009
peaked at about 3¾ percent, better than anticipated at the time of the 2009 Article IV
consultations. Vacancies in manufacturing are now close to their pre˗crisis peak but slack in
other sectors remains. Malaysia’s external position remains strong.
Malaysia’s financial sector has withstood the global recession well. Thanks to the Bank Negara
Malaysia’s proactive supervision, measures to ensure uninterrupted access to financing, and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

prudent lending practices, loan book did not deteriorate as much as feared and started
improving in the second half of 2009. Banks and insurance companies remain well capitalized
and liquid. Corporate balance sheets are sound. Supported by policy, credit growth remained
positive even as output shrunk. It is now gaining steam on its own benefitting from strong
demand for consumer loans and mortgages. The recovery in business lending is also robust.
With countercyclical support delivered and the recovery on firmer ground, policy normalization is
underway. The monetary tightening so far has been broadly appropriate and the stance remains
accommodative. The 2010 budget marks a welcome return to consolidation. The global
downturn has energized a rethinking of the development strategy, and medium- and longer-term
development issues top the policy agenda.
Malaysia’s near˗term prospects are favorable. GDP is projected to expand by around 7 percent
in 2010. As positive base effects play out and policy support is reeled in, growth should
moderate in 2011. Both external and private domestic demand will propel activity in the near
term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound fundamentals and forceful
countercyclical policies, which helped Malaysia emerge from the global downturn with a strong
forward momentum. A broad-based recovery is underway and policies are returning to more
normal settings. The challenge now is to make progress toward the authorities’ target of
economic growth and structural transformation.
Directors welcomed the consolidation effort in the 2010 budget. They stressed that a sound and
sustained fiscal adjustment is necessary to put the public debt ratio on a downward path and
encouraged the authorities to follow the indicative deficit path proposed in the Tenth Malaysia
Plan. Directors commended the authorities for their decision to reduce subsidies and
encouraged them to persevere with reforms in this area while being mindful of the impact on the
poor. They welcomed the intention to introduce a goods and service tax, which would broaden
the tax base and lessen the dependence on volatile oil revenues, and encouraged its timely
implementation. In addition, the budget framework could be further enhanced by benchmarking
budget decisions against a framework that links spending to an intergenerationally equitable
drawdown of oil wealth.
Directors considered that monetary policy has been appropriately recalibrated to sustain noninflationary growth. The measured pace of monetary normalization adopted by Bank Negara
Malaysia will help prevent financial imbalances in an environment of low interest rates while still
supporting aggregate demand and limiting the drag on growth from needed fiscal consolidation.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the ringgit appears to be weaker than its
equilibrium level in real effective terms. They generally agreed with the authorities’ view that a

3
stronger ringgit could boost over time the role of domestic demand as a growth driver and
promote a shift toward higher-value added industries.
Directors recognized that continued efforts by the authorities to develop capital markets,
broaden intermediation, and strengthen risk management have paid dividend during challenging
times. They welcomed the new Central Bank Act, which reinforces the underpinnings of the
financial system. Directors also commended the authorities’ decision to participate in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ ambitious vision for a far-reaching economic
transformation over the longer term. They agreed that the comprehensive structural reform
agenda, at the heart of the New Economic Model, holds out promise of faster and inclusive
growth. Directors looked forward to a decisive effort and sustained momentum in implementing
this agenda. An effective communication strategy could help forge broad public support for
these efforts. Further gradual liberalization of product and labor markets will help exploit policy
complementarities, encourage private investment and harness the benefits of reform.

Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Malaysia
and Seng Guan Toh, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 30, 2010
Introduction
1.
The authorities of Malaysia would like to thank the IMF team, led by Mr. Alessandro
Zanello, for the 2010 Article IV Consultations. The discussions, which were cordial yet
candid, have provided helpful views on the far-reaching reform plans that are now underway
in Malaysia as it emerges from the impact of the global recession.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Since experiencing the full brunt of the global recession in the first quarter of 2009,
the Malaysian economy has established a clear recovery. Private consumption had already
turned positive in Q2 2009, and combined with the upswing in external demand resulted in
the resumption of solid positive growth by the fourth quarter. Consequently, a decline of only
1.7% was recorded for 2009 as a whole, significantly better than the contraction of 4-5%
earlier envisaged. The growth momentum accelerated further to reach +10.1% (y-o-y) in the
first quarter of 2010, reflecting a broad-based recovery. Growth is being driven by continued
expansion in domestic demand due mainly to higher private consumption, a modest recovery
in private investment and sustained support from public sector spending. Higher regional
demand also provided further impetus to growth through positive spillover effects on
production, employment and overall sentiments. On the supply side, both the manufacturing
and services sectors are showing robust growth, while the contribution from Malaysia’s
agricultural and mining base remains substantial amidst favorable commodity prices.
3.
The measures introduced by the Malaysian Government in response to the global
crisis reinvigorated domestic demand, preventing the economy from slipping into a
fundamental economic recession. The measures centered around three broad areas, namely,
fiscal policy (two stimulus packages amounting to 9.9% of GDP), monetary easing (the
Overnight Policy Rate was reduced by a total of 150 basis points to 2.0%), and
comprehensive measures to ensure continued access to finance. Meanwhile, the stability in
the domestic financial system allowed financial intermediation to continue smoothly and
reinforced the expansionary fiscal and monetary influences on domestic demand. On external
demand, the stabilization and subsequent gradual recovery in the global economy since mid2009 provided support to Malaysia as a highly open economy. In particular, the strong
recovery in the Asian regional economies benefited Malaysia. The recovery in exports
became more broad-based towards end-2009 as exports to several advanced economies also
began to recover.
4.
For the rest of 2010, economic growth is expected to remain strong, supported by
continued expansion in both domestic and external demand. While the pace of growth may
taper off a little in the second half as base effects diminish, indicators of economic activity
for April and May have continued to show strength. Going forward, growth would be
increasingly driven by private sector activity as the fiscal stimulus starts to wind down going

2
into 2011. Private consumption would be supported by strengthened consumer confidence
and improvements in already favorable employment conditions, which have not only
recouped most of the crisis-related job losses but have also seen a recovery in wages. Private
investment has also started to turnaround, in line with the strengthening of global trade and
increasing domestic demand, reinforced by improved business confidence and supportive
financing conditions. For external demand, while downside risks remain in the advanced
economies, emerging economies in general, and Asia in particular, have shown a higher
degree of resilience and better prospects for sustained recovery. In 2009, Malaysia’s exports
to Asia (excluding Japan) accounted for 56% of total exports. Moving forward, regional
demand will become an increasingly important part of Malaysia’s external demand profile as
domestic demand across Asia strengthens further, spurred on by the region’s better
employment conditions and uninterrupted credit flows combined with planned investment in
infrastructure and robust growth in intra-regional trade. In view of the foregoing trends, the
authorities have projected that real GDP could expand by 6% in 2010 compared with 4.5 –
5.5% projected earlier.
5.
Headline inflation, as measured by the annual percentage change in the Consumer
Price Index (CPI), averaged 0.6% in 2009 (2008: 5.4%). Disinflationary pressures from the
significant drop in global commodity prices, especially for crude oil, and the increasing slack
in the economy over the course of the downturn drove the marked decline in headline
inflation. Headline inflation would remain modest in 2010. In the first half of 2010, inflation
averaged 1.4%. Inflation is expected to rise slightly in the second half of the year reflecting
the improving economic conditions and adjustments to administered prices and subsidy
reforms by the Government. In the absence of further price revisions and price-related
external developments, inflation in Malaysia will remain contained.
6.
The external position of Malaysia remained strong despite the weaker external
environment in 2009. The trade surplus declined but remained sizeable as a sharp contraction
in exports offset in part the decline in intermediate imports, while tourist arrivals from the
Asian region were robust. As at end-March 2010, external debt declined further to the
equivalent of 30% of GDP (less than a third of which is short-term), reflecting net
repayments and the appreciation of the ringgit. After declining from a peak of almost
US$126 billion due to the global crisis-related deleveraging of late 2008, the level of
international reserves has remained relatively stable for over a year now and was equivalent
to US$94.8 billion as at July 15, 2010.
7.
On capital flows, while Malaysia has been a longstanding recipient of sizeable inward
FDI, a recent development is a large increase in investment abroad (outward FDI) by
Malaysian companies, as staff have also noted. These flows amounted to as much as 6.8% of
GDP in 2008, and continued to a lesser extent in 2009 due to the effects of the global crisis.
This reflects in part the strategy of a number of established Malaysian companies to ―go
regional‖ within Asia. Given the relatively small domestic market, regional and global
expansions allow Malaysian companies to achieve greater economies of scale by tapping into
new and larger markets. Generally, Malaysian companies that invested abroad have also
enhanced their domestic operations by moving up the production value chain in order to
establish an integrated supply chain with their overseas subsidiaries. These trends, over the

3
medium term, will benefit the economy by developing more competitive and globalized
Malaysian companies, expanding job opportunities for Malaysians, and sustaining higher
inflows from profit repatriation. On portfolio investment flows, while the magnitude of the
reversals in late 2008 were larger than the net outflows recorded at the height of the Asian
crisis, the impact on the domestic economy was limited. The continued development of the
debt market over the years, together with strong and sound banking system, have allowed for
the diversification of the composition of portfolio flows into Malaysia, spreading out the
impact across markets and minimizing disruptions. The availability of foreign reserves has
also enabled Bank Negara Malaysia to accommodate these outflows and minimize the
volatility of the ringgit exchange rate.
Policy Discussions
Monetary Policy
8.
With clear signs of an economic recovery, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has taken
steps to normalize interest rates since March 2010. The extraordinary conditions under which
the interest rates were reduced no longer prevail. The concern was that maintaining an
extremely low interest rate environment for an extended period could encourage excessive
risk taking behavior, and the unhealthy build up of leverage. At the same time, it could lead
to financial disintermediation. Such developments could lead to financial imbalances that
would undermine the recovery process, while reducing the longer term growth potential of
the economy. Notwithstanding the move to normalize interest rates, and given lingering
uncertainties surrounding the future path of the global economy, the overall stance of
monetary policy will continue to remain accommodative to provide support to domestic
economic activity. Price pressures are expected to be modest going forward. On the demand
side, output is still recovering from low levels, while on the supply side, the impact of the
Government’s subsidy reforms on consumer prices is assessed to be transitory and
manageable. Thus, monetary policy in 2010 will focus on promoting the sustainability of
economic recovery and ensuring that financing continues to be available to the private sector
at reasonable cost.
Fiscal Policy
9.
Fiscal policy is in the process of exiting from the large, well-timed stimulus provided
in the past year. The process of fiscal consolidation which began in 2002 was interrupted by
the 2008 global financial crisis. However, the Government remains steadfast in its
commitment to pursue fiscal discipline and will resume fiscal consolidation in 2010. From a
peak of 7.0% of GDP in 2009, the fiscal deficit is expected to decline markedly to 5.6% of
GDP in 2010. The better-than-expected growth outturn in the last two quarters and improved
oil revenues this year are expected to strengthen Government finances.
10.
Measures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Government expenditure and
revenue collection continue to be given utmost priority. The policy intent has been articulated
in the 10th Malaysia Plan. Initiatives include, among others, cutting back on non essential
spending, achieving greater value for money in Government procurement, optimizing the use

4
of Government assets, adopting outcome based budgeting, rationalizing existing government
organizations and structures, intensifying public-private partnership programs as well as
rationalizing subsidies. Fiscal sustainability will also be enhanced through specific targets set
for deficit and debt reduction by 2015. The deficit is anticipated to be less than 3% of GDP
while debt to GDP ratio, less than 50% by 2015. More importantly, the role of the
Government over the medium term has been clearly spelt out – that of an enabler and
facilitator for private sector activities. In this regard, to provide a more level playing field and
business opportunities for the private sector, the Government will systematically reduce its
holdings and divest non-core businesses of government-linked companies as well as
undertake privatization of MOF Inc. companies.
11.
In addition, concurrent efforts to broaden the non-oil revenue as well as the narrow
tax base are being addressed comprehensively. The first reading of the bill on Goods and
Services Tax (GST) was tabled in Parliament in December 2009. The Government is
undertaking further outreach activities to educate the public and the business sectors as well
as putting in place administrative measures to ensure smooth implementation of the GST.
Changes to the tax assessment system for upstream petroleum-related activities in
Budget 2010 have also assisted in eliminating lags in assessment, thereby facilitating budget
planning.
12.
The Government recently undertook a bold move to reduce subsidies for fuel (petrol,
diesel, liquefied petroleum gas) and sugar. The rationalizing of selected subsidies, which
were undertaken after wide public consultation, will yield savings of RM750 million in 2010.
The health and education sectors will be the beneficiaries of the savings. Fuel subsidy
remains the single largest expenditure item while reducing the subsidy on sugar will improve
health outcomes. The subsidy rationalization program is part of the broader reform agenda to
remove distortions in the economy, improve competitiveness and market efficiency as well
as ensure a more optimal use of scarce resources. The politically courageous move by the
Government exemplifies its determination for reform, not only to put the fiscal position on a
long term sustainable footing, but also enhance efficiencies in the economy. In tandem with
these measures, the Government is putting in place additional mechanisms to provide
offsetting support to the poor. The existing social safety net is also being reviewed to achieve
better targeting and effectiveness, and the authorities credited the Fund’s TA mission last
year for bringing the issue into the central policy debate. No less important than fiscal
savings is the relevance and quality of governance of the Government’s public delivery
system. In this regard, the Government Transformation Program (GTP) launched late last
year has shown good results, seen in new assistance reaching more than a quarter of the
hardcore poor, declining crime indices, online publication of government contracts, and
enhancements being put in place for pre-school and primary education.
Financial Sector
13.
The Malaysian financial system displayed resilience despite the challenging
conditions in 2009. Banking institutions and insurance companies remain well-capitalized
and liquid. Prompt measures taken by banks as early as 2008 to shore up capital served to
avoid a constriction in lending during the economic downturn. Loan growth expanded by

5
7%. Precautionary measures instituted to widen guarantees on deposits and expand access to
BNM’s liquidity facilities helped sustain a high level of confidence in the system and
continued access to funding throughout the crisis period. None of these facilities have in fact
been drawn upon. Banks were proactive in restructuring facilities with viable borrowers.
Credit flows to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were sustained, supported further by
guarantee schemes that were put in place. Meanwhile, Islamic finance in Malaysia continued
to progress on a path of sustained growth despite the global financial crisis. As an
increasingly important component of the global financial system, there has been greater
recognition of the significant prospects for Islamic finance to contribute towards global
growth and financial stability. Over the past year, Malaysia reinforced its role as an
international center for the issuance of sukuk while introducing innovations such as a
Shariah-compliant commodity trading platform.
14.
BNM in the recent period has further enhanced its prudential framework, supervisory
arrangements and processes, and surveillance frameworks. The focus of work has spanned
further refinements in stress testing approaches, improved supervisory cooperation across
agencies and borders, enhancements to risk and information capture, liquidity support and
resolution, and a further strengthening of the financial safety net. New approaches to analyze
risks were explored, including through workshops conducted with Fund assistance. The
coming into force of the new Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 (CBA) further strengthened
BNM’s mandate and powers for financial stability. In addition to formalizing governance
frameworks, it significantly expands capabilities to deal with systemic risk. For example, the
CBA allows resolution powers even for institutions beyond BNM’s regulatory purview
where such institutions present a risk to financial stability. With the implementation of the
ten-year Financial Sector Master Plan almost completed, a new blueprint is being prepared to
chart the transformation of the Malaysian financial sector over the next decade
beginning 2011. The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise that the
authorities have agreed to would reinforce the strong fundamentals achieved, and at the same
time, contribute to identifying areas for further improvements.
Exchange Rate Developments
15.
For a small and highly open economy like Malaysia, the exchange rate policy has
served the economy well in balancing between stability and flexibility. The focus has been to
maintain orderly foreign exchange market conditions in the short term while ensuring that the
ringgit is not misaligned against the country’s fundamentals over the medium to longer term.
It is important to note that under the managed float regime, the ringgit’s exchange rate is
determined by market forces and Malaysia has no particular target for the exchange rate
level. Intervention operations have been limited to ensure orderly market conditions and to
prevent extreme volatility in the currency.
16.
On balance, since the adoption of the managed float regime in July 2005, the ringgit
has been broadly on a path of appreciation, reaching a high of RM3.1315 in April 2008 (an
appreciation of 21.3%), before subsequently depreciating as the global financial crisis began
to exert downward pressure on regional currencies. Intervention by the authorities had been
conducted in both directions to facilitate orderly adjustments in the ringgit during these

6
periods. The appreciating trend resumed from mid-2009 as the global recovery gathered
momentum, and up to July 2010, the ringgit has been the fastest appreciating currency in the
region for the year. This shows that the authorities are not averse to an appreciation of the
ringgit. Going forward, the authorities agreed with the staff assessment that given the strong
fundamentals in the economy, and further reinforced by the reform initiatives, the ringgit
could appreciate further over the medium to long term.
17.
The authorities remain unconvinced by the model-based estimates as they do not
adequately incorporate salient country-specific features of the economic structure, including
the significant role of non-renewable commodities such as oil. The staff assessment on the
potential undervaluation of the ringgit is not corroborated with qualitative evidence, given
the fact that core inflation remains low and there has been no evidence of asset price bubbles
in the economy. In addition to what is already being put in place, the prescription of policies
to force external adjustment is unclear. Staff themselves observed that at this juncture there is
no feasible re-orientation of the policy mix that could more quickly reduce external surpluses
without damage to macroeconomic stability. The authorities do not disagree that further
exchange rate appreciation over time could complement the structural transformation agenda
now underway, but point out that the extent of any changes in the exchange rate would
remain fundamentally determined by market conditions and economic developments.
Structural Reforms
18.
The progress that has been achieved by Malaysia over the past half-century has
propelled it to become an upper middle-income economy. The old growth model provided
three decades of strong performance, permitting Malaysia to provide for the health and
education of her people, build a world class infrastructure and become a major trading nation
globally. Nonetheless, growth has slowed in the past decade, and in the absence of deeprooted changes, the Government’s candid assessment is that Malaysia is caught in a ―middleincome trap.‖ In terms of restructuring the economy, the focus has been on both the public
and private sectors. The Government concentrated on improving governance and the delivery
of public goods under the GTP. At the same time, Malaysia’s New Economic Model (NEM),
to be achieved through the Economic Transformation Program (ETP), constitutes a pivotal
set of economic structural reforms for Malaysia to double its per capita income by 2020 and
achieve an advanced economy status.
19.

The NEM comprises eight strategic reform initiatives to be translated into policies:
Reenergizing the private sector, including by creating an entrepreneurship ecosystem,
removing barriers and costs to doing business, and encouraging competition.
Developing a quality workforce and reducing dependency on unskilled foreign labor.
Creating a competitive domestic economy, including removing price controls and
subsidies that distort market behavior.
Strengthening the public sector, by creating a leaner, customer-focused government
while widening the tax base and streamlining public finance management.
Implementing transparent and market-friendly affirmative action, which will
transition from ethnic considerations to emphasize the lower income 40% of
households.
