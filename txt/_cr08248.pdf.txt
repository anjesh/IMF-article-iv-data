Mission

Praia, March 5–19, 2008. The mission met Minister Duarte, Governor
Burgo, the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, government
officials, and representatives of civil society, donors, and businesses.
The IMF team comprised Messrs. Leigh (head), Castro, Ronci, and
Shanghavi (all AFR).

Recommendation The report recommends a waiver for the nonobservance of a
continuous structural assessment criterion based on corrective actions
taken, and completion of the 4th PSI review. All end-December 2007
quantitative assessment criteria were met.
Discussion topics

The Article IV discussions focused on policies needed to preserve
external and domestic stability:
• Keep debt on an appropriate path by anchoring fiscal policy in a
medium-term perspective.
• Safeguard financial stability by reducing reliance on non-resident
deposits.
• Enhance resilience to shocks by deepening structural reforms to
diversify the economy and increase price flexibility.

Fund relations

The Executive Board concluded the 3rd PSI review on December 21,
2007. The previous Article IV consultation for Cape Verde, which is
on a 24-month cycle, was concluded in July 2006. Cape Verde has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the IMF Articles of
Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The de facto and de jure exchange rate arrangement of
Cape Verde is a conventional fixed peg to the euro.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the last several years, Cape Verde has achieved a major economic transformation
that is a tribute to its sound homegrown economic reform program. Real per capita GDP
has increased on average by over 7 percent a year since 2001, faster than most small island
economies and the average for sub-Saharan Africa. In 2006 real GDP growth reached double
digits, boosted by tourism, telecommunications, and construction. Staff estimate that GDP
grew by about 7 percent in 2007, and factoring in the effects from the global economic
slowdown, growth is expected to moderate only slightly in 2008 as tourism and construction
continue to expand. Twelve month inflation averaged about 3½ percent for December 2007–
April 2008, broadly in line with inflation in the euro area.
Policy implementation under the PSI is strong. All PSI quantitative assessment criteria for
end-December 2007 were met with wide margins. There was a 9 percentage points of GDP
reduction in domestic public debt as revenues are ahead of the authorities’ targets and
expenditures are as budgeted. Official reserves are also building rapidly. Thus, domestic
policies are strengthening the credibility of the exchange rate peg. Progress on structural
reforms is steady, especially reforms related to public financial management, the tax system,
the financial sector, and energy sector regulation. However, technical difficulties prevented
implementation of the continuous assessment criterion on full application of the mechanism
for setting and adjusting fuel prices. On the basis of remedial measures taken by the
authorities, staff recommends granting a waiver for the missed continuous structural
assessment criterion.
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions and the 4th review of the PSI focused on
policies for consolidating gains on macroeconomic stability and deepening structural
reforms to sustain high growth over the medium term. The mission and the authorities
reached broad understandings on measures for responding to the challenges Cape Verde
faces and minimizing vulnerabilities to preserve external stability:
•
A medium-term fiscal framework which accommodates the authorities’ desire to
increase investment in infrastructure and the energy sector while keeping debt on an
appropriate path;
•
Financial sector reforms to broaden the funding base of banks and reduce reliance on
nonresident deposits, while laying the foundation for the authorities’ plans for further
liberalization of the capital account; and
•
Structural reforms to foster private sector development, diversify the economy, and
improve price flexibility in both goods (energy) and factor (labor) markets to support the
exchange rate peg.

I. A SUCCESS STORY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Over the last several years, Cape Verde has achieved a major economic
transformation. Real per capita GDP has increased on average by over 7 percent a year,

sub-Saharan Africa after Botswana and the first graduation in more than a decade).

However, at just under 20 percent, the unemployment rate is still high, mainly because of structural factors
(notably the skills mismatch in the labor market, difficulties in interisland mobility that have resulted in a
segmented labor market, and possibly a high reservation wage due to remittance flows).

2

Cape Verde’s nominal debt to IDA, the IMF-PRGF Trust, and the AfDF at the end of 2005 was approximately
US$346 million (34 percent of GDP).

6
3.
Cape Verde’s progress owes much to a homegrown reform program that has
produced good policy outcomes:
•
Lower domestic debt: Tax reforms, notably the introduction of the value-added tax
(VAT) in 2004, which improved revenue buoyancy, and tight restraint on recurrent spending,
helped by civil service reform, have reduced domestic debt considerably.
•
A stronger external position: Good policies catalyzed high inflows of tourismrelated foreign direct investment (FDI), which are breaking past dependence on aid and
remittances. Thus, international reserves were rebuilt, which enhanced the credibility of the
exchange rate peg.
40

•
Greater private sector participation:
Structural reforms were undertaken to foster
competition and enhance private sector’s role in the
economy. Several state-owned enterprises were
privatized; the government selected new management to
prepare the national airline (TACV) for privatization;
and the process of privatizing the ports operator
(ENAPOR) is underway. Ahead of WTO accession,
external tariffs were lowered. The Cape Verde Stock
Exchange has been revitalized; its market capitalization
is now 25 percent of GDP (from zero in 2005).

These economic achievements were facilitated by Cape Verde’s political stability and
enhanced governance.
4.
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions and 4th PSI review focused on
policies to consolidate these gains on macroeconomic stability and deepen structural
reforms to sustain growth over the medium term. Discussions centered on anchoring
fiscal policy in a medium-term perspective, preserving financial stability, and enhancing the
economy’s resilience to shocks.
II. RECENT PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK
A. What Is Happening in the Economy Now
5.
Economic growth is strong with moderate inflation: The real GDP growth rate
peaked at 10.8 percent in 2006, boosted by tourism, telecommunications, and construction.
Based on information from the National Statistical Institute (INE), staff estimate that GDP
grew about 7 percent in 2007 and, factoring in the effects of the global economic slowdown,
growth should moderate only slightly to 6 ½ percent in 2008 as tourism and construction
continue to expand. With the peg to the euro and the high openness allowing rapid import
price pass-through, twelve-month inflation averaged about 3½ percent for December 2007–

2007

7
April 2008, broadly in line with inflation in the euro area. 3 While food and energy prices
have risen, this has not led to generalized inflation partly due to lack of a strong wage
indexation.

6.
Fiscal policy continues to support the peg. Staff estimate that the prudent 2008
budget will ensure that domestic debt will be further reduced to 16 percent of GDP by end2008. Tax revenues are exceeding budget forecasts, reflecting not just economic growth but
also improvements in tax administration; also, asset sales have surpassed expectations. These
factors, together with continued expenditure restraint, have reduced the domestic debt-toGDP ratio. 4 The authorities’ target for domestic debt, 20 percent of GDP, was reached in
2007, two years ahead of schedule (Figure 1).
7.
The Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) continues to conduct monetary management
appropriately. Given the peg and a largely open capital account, passive monetary
management by the BCV has been setting the official policy rate consistent with its
endogenous equilibrium level, which smoothes and sterilizes short-term capital flows.
Reserves continue to accumulate, and while FDI-related imports have led to and financed a
higher current account deficit, there are no signs of a more general increase in imports that
would jeopardize the targeted increase in reserves (Figure 2). Excess liquidity has been
contained by sterilization, by the new investment opportunities on the Stock Exchange
following rapid development of the domestic equity market, and by growth in private sector
3

A new inflation methodology was introduced in February 2008 and the time-series was recalculated from
January 2005.

4

Many other factors explain the strong fiscal performance including the ongoing hiring freeze. The PFM
innovations in the wake of the weaknesses in data reporting for 2006 were also successful. Most notably,
decentralizing the budget execution and introducing the deadline of November 30 to grant new spending
commitments prevented the carryover of accounts payable from 2007 into 2008.

8
credit (Figure 3). The buildup of government deposits at the BCV is also helping to sterilize
external inflows. Thus, monetary management and fiscal prudence are both supporting the
exchange rate peg and promoting external stability.

B. Policy Implementation Under the PSI
8.
All PSI quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2007 were met with
wide margins. The ceiling on net domestic borrowing was observed by a margin of 1.8
percent of GDP reflecting a much improved public financial management system, which also
prevented the accumulation of arrears. International reserves exceeded the PSI floor by about
0.2 months of imports despite some moderation in the last quarter of 2007 as FDI slowed.
9.
Despite capacity constraints, steady progress was made on implementing the
structural assessment criteria: 5
•
The authorities reported that the base utility tariffs mechanism was finalized and
approved by the Economic Regulatory Agency (ARE) on March 27, 2008 and posted on
ARE’s website on the following day (LOI, ¶ 5). The goal of this structural assessment
criterion in the program is to achieve full cost recovery to stop the accumulation of tariff
deficits, a contingent liability. The adjustment of the final electricity price for consumers
based on the new base tariffs will take into account the impact of the global food and oil
price inflation on the poor and vulnerable segments of the population. 6
•
On the fuel pricing side, however, the complex cost structures of the two oil
companies, Shell and Enacol, posed technical difficulties that prevented implementation of
the continuous assessment criterion on full application of the mechanism for setting and
adjusting fuel prices. 7 To solve this problem, the Economic Regulatory Agency (ARE) took
two main corrective actions: First, it adjusted fuel prices on March 25, 2008, clearing implicit
subsidies owed to the oil suppliers that had accrued since the previous adjustment in October
2007. 8 Second, after some delay due to lack of funding, ARE hired a consultant to develop a
new fuel pricing formula (a structural benchmark for March), which is expected to be
finalized and published by end June 2008. The new simplified and more transparent formula,
based on a unified cost structure of the upcoming joint venture between the oil companies,
will ensure regular fuel price adjustments, stop accrual of fiscal liabilities, and encourage
much-needed investment in the energy sector. On the basis of these remedial measures taken
by the authorities, the staff recommends granting a waiver for the missed structural
assessment criterion.
5

Going forward, in line with the IMF-World Bank JMAP (Informational Annex), the Fund is expected to play a
subsidiary role to the Bank on both energy and labor market issues.
6

The measures being considered by the government include increasing the social transfers to CVE 3,500,
expanding the eligible group, and to a lesser extent exempting grains from import duties and VAT. The
estimated fiscal impact is negligible as most food items are already exempt and the increase in cash transfers
will be small (around € 3 per recipient).

7

The assessment criterion called for application of the regulation according to which fuel prices should be
adjusted every time the price of an incoming shipment of fuel imports changes by ±2 percent.

8

Prices of gasoil and heavy fuel were raised by 12 percent, butane by 7 percent, and gasoline by 2.3 percent.

C. Outlook, Risks and Challenges
11.
The near-term outlook is broadly favorable but risks are tilted to the downside
reflecting the continued high oil prices and more generally the global slowdown.
Because the Cape Verde economy is predominantly service-based and depreciation of the US
dollar is containing oil prices in escudos, the oil price impact is likely to be manageable. 9
Cape Verde also remains relatively unexposed to international capital markets as nonemigrant cross-border flows are relatively small. However, the global slowdown could have
knock-on effects on Cape Verde’s external demand (including tourism) or FDI flows.
Specifically, while none of Portugal’s banks that have dominant shares in Cape Verde banks
have experienced difficulties so far, Cape Verde could be somewhat affected as the turmoil
appears to have had some impact in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain which are
important sources of FDI, remittances and tourism flows.
9

Staff simulations suggest that if oil prices were to stay just above $100/ barrel for the remainder of 2008,
growth will be ¼–½ percentage point lower.

13
12.
Staff expect strong economic performance over the medium term. Growth is
projected to average about 6¾ percent through 2013, underpinned by tourism, FDI, and
public investment. Cape Verde is expected to consolidate its position among the highlytourism based economies (Box 1). The current account deficit will likely widen and be
financed increasingly by the strong FDI flows (non-debt creating) unlike a decade ago, when
debt and remittances financed the balance of payments. Emigrant remittances are expected to
taper off as income in Cape Verde grows faster than in the countries where its emigrants
reside and emigration declines. Staff’s empirical analysis also suggests that remittances are
becoming more procyclical and thus less reliable as a shock absorber (Box 2). On
concessional financing, in preparing for the transition from LDC status, the authorities
reached out extensively, and most donors confirmed that graduation will not lead to an abrupt
end to concessional aid. Continued fiscal restraint is envisaged over the medium term and the
revenue losses of WTO accession and EU- economic partnership agreement will be limited
and gradual. 10

This said, Cape Verde faces old vulnerabilities and emerging challenges:

•
Infrastructure bottlenecks still constrain growth. Continued growth in the tourism
sector will require large-scale investments in transportation and energy infrastructure.
Making use of the fiscal space to increase capital expenditures, while maintaining debt
sustainability, poses a challenge.
•
The financial sector still relies on nonresident deposits. These deposits constitute
about 40 percent of total bank deposits making the banking system’s funding base
significantly reliant on them. The annual growth rate of the stock of non-resident deposits
(NRD), although still respectable at about 6 ¼ percent, has slowed in recent years. However,
there are doubts about how interest-sensitive these deposits are. While banks have been

pressured to launch new savings products to continue to attract NRDs in a context of
declining rates, 11 the home bias and historical resilience of these remittance-based inflows
significantly minimize the risks of a reversal. Thus, it remains unclear the extent to which the
NRDs are a potential capital account-based source of vulnerability and hence warrant close
monitoring.
•
Cape Verde’s export base is narrow. The economy is vulnerable to a weakening of
international demand for tourism, especially given

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUSTAINING THE STRONG PERFORMANCE
14.
The discussions focused on the policies needed to maintain Cape Verde’s
impressive macroeconomic performance and stability in the face of changing balance of
payments flows.
•
Guided by external stability, the mission discussed a package of measures to respond
to these challenges and minimize vulnerabilities to preserve macroeconomic stability. These
include the use of a medium-term fiscal framework to accommodate the authorities’ plans to
increase infrastructure and energy sector investment while keeping debt on an appropriate
path; financial sector reforms to broaden the funding base of banks and reduce reliance on
non-resident deposits, while further liberalizing the capital account; and structural reforms to
diversify the economy and increase price flexibility in both goods and factor markets to
enhance resilience to shocks.

11

While banks are competing to attract NRDs by raising rates on these deposits at the margin, average interest
rates across all maturities continue to decline.
12

Capital deepening has been the key driver to growth in Cape Verde while the contribution from total factor
productivity (TFP) (structural reform driven) has been historically small. The growth accounting here assumes a

•
The authorities concurred, in particular on the changing balance of payments, and
welcomed the mission’s work on Cape Verde through cross-country analysis of highlytourism-based economies. Nevertheless, they emphasized that in some areas capacity
constraints may hamper policy implementation and in this context reiterated that they will
continue to need technical assistance from the Fund in a range of areas. In the attached Letter
of Intent (Appendix), the government affirms its commitment to the policy goals described in
its recent Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) (IMF Country Report
08/37) and updates its plans to meet those goals.
Box 1. The Tourism Boom1
Cape Verde is the fastest-growing tourism market among the highly-tourism-based economies
(HTBEs). It was recently discovered as a new frontier for European tourism. Travel exports have
grown by more than 30 percent annually on average for more than a decade, far outpacing other
HTBEs. The development of the tourism sector has been a success for Cape Verde with obvious
growth benefits and poverty

However, specialization in tourism and increasing openness will bring high volatility.
Dependence on a single export means that shocks to demand for that export will propagate throughout
the entire economy. The tourism sector in Cape Verde is not an enclave and is becoming a conduit for
external shocks and the business cycle is becoming synchronized with tourism originator countries.
Cross country analysis shows that output volatility tends to increase as economies become more

A. Maintaining Fiscal Prudence
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to articulate a medium-term fiscal strategy.
This would provide room for the authorities’ planned increase in infrastructure spending
to sustain the tourism boom and ensure that the upcoming tax reforms are broadly
revenue-neutral.
15.
The mission and the authorities agreed on the need to orient fiscal policy in a
medium-term perspective.
•
Staff noted that the reserves target should anchor medium term fiscal policy. By
constraining domestic demand to build up foreign reserves, fiscal policy contributes directly
to the credibility of the peg. The use of the reserves target to anchor medium-term fiscal
policy is also consistent with keeping public debt along an appropriate path. The recent

average and inflation lower,
2/ Permanent imports equal imports minus one-half of FDI and of tourism exports.
Cape Verde’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is one of the highest among highly-tourism-based
economies, and its reserves are below average (Figure 4). Thus, Cape Verde needs larger
buffers in the form of higher international reserves and fiscal space (Box 1), especially in the
context of declining reliability of remittances to smooth consumption and hedge against
macroeconomic shocks (Box 2).
•
The authorities concurred and stated that their objective is to increase reserves by
about 0.1 month of prospective imports annually reaching over 4 months by 2013. This is
appropriate as it is equivalent to about 6 months expunging FDI-related imports, and 172
percent of short-term debt, supported by continued fiscal restraint.

17
16.
Staff and the authorities reached understandings on the operational aspects of
medium-term fiscal policy. Thus, the authorities agreed to include a new structural measure
in the PSI program on submitting a simplified medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) to the
Council of Ministers along with the 2009 budget proposal and publishing it on the Ministry
of Finance website (LOI, ¶8). 13 Implementing this MTFF would require accelerating public
financial management (PFM) reforms to enhance implementation capacity and thereby
improve the quality of public investment. Given the fiscal space created by the larger-thanexpected reduction in domestic debt in 2007, the envisaged medium-term baseline scenario
projects that the fiscal deficit will average about 5 percent of GDP through 2013, bringing the
total nominal debt-to-GDP ratio from 67 percent at the end of 2007 to 49 percent by 2013. 14
This scenario assumes that, since the authorities have already reached their domestic debt
target of 20 percent of GDP, they will keep the ratio below that over the medium term to buy
“policy insurance” against shocks and to support the peg. To provide room for the
authorities’ planned increases in infrastructure expenditures to sustain the tourism boom and
reduce poverty, an alternative scenario was developed in which capital expenditures on
infrastructure increase by further 2 percent of GDP annually for five years. The results show
that even under this scenario, the risk of debt distress remains low (Figure 5). 15 Furthermore,
the authorities’ envisaged reserve buildup is preserved (¶ 15). 16 Moreover, recent steps taken
by the authorities to improve the energy pricing mechanism coupled with their broader
energy sector reform plan (LOI, ¶ 12), will also help reduce fiscal risks over the medium
term and potentially contribute fiscal space toward infrastructure development. The MTFF
will also be a tool to ensure that the upcoming tax reforms and the rationalization of tax
exemptions are implemented in a broadly revenue neutral fashion. The authorities also noted
that operationalizing the MTFF will enhance the implementation of the new Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP-2), which was finalized in May 2008.

13

A simplified MTFF indicates total annual revenues, expenditures, domestic financing, and external financing
for the next three years.
14

The domestic debt reduction path in this report is more ambitious than envisaged in the last staff report
(Country Report 08/37).
15

The PSI program’s US$35 million ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing and government guarantees
gives the authorities room to finance growth-enhancing energy and infrastructure projects. This ceiling remains
unused owing partly to capacity constraints on debt management (LOI, ¶ 9) and partly to the continued
availability of concessional financing, including from IDA and Portugal.

Box 2. Remittances: A Less Reliable Hedge against Macroeconomic Shocks 1
The changing financing structure of the balance of payments calls for a closer look at the
volatility of worker remittances and their role as a shock absorber. Historically, remittances
from the Cape Verdean diaspora have constituted a large share of external financing. Staff’s
previous analysis (WP/06/132) found that remittances from Europe were largely driven by
altruistic motives and thus acted countercyclically
400
in smoothing consumption, while flows from the

300

Indeed, remittances have been less volatile than
foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports, and
only slightly more volatile than official
development assistance (ODA). Compared to
other inflows, remittances remain an important
source of foreign currency even as they decline in
importance: remittances as a share of total foreign
financing fell from 46 percent in 1995 to 18 percent
in 2007.

Selected Issues, Chapter 2.

21
B. Preserving Financial Stability
Staff and the authorities agreed on the challenges posed by the continued deceleration of
the growth of nonresidents deposits in the banking system. The slowdown poses both
liquidity risk for banks and a potential capital account based source of vulnerability.
17.
The mission called for enhanced monitoring
of nonresident deposits in the banking system and
more generally the funding base for banks. Banks
noted that the slowdown in non-resident deposit flows
into the banking system was due to new investment
opportunities in the Cape Verde Stock Exchange. Some
nonresidents are reportedly diversifying their portfolios
away from bank deposits in a search for higher yields in
equities. Better monitoring of the sources and direction
of these deposits is important for promptly detecting
potentially destabilizing capital flows to gauge the
appropriateness of the official policy interest rate. The
slowdown of these deposits can be better managed on
two fronts:
•
Continue BCV’s cautious approach of
conducting monetary management consistent with
the peg. The mission noted that the BCV should
continue to carefully set its short-run official policy
interest rate consistent with its endogenous equilibrium
level—the level that smoothes inflows or outflows of
short-term capital. 17
•
Strengthen the banking system. Strong
oversight of banking system soundness would help
attract more diverse sources of financing as a way to
grow out of dependence on nonresident deposits. Recent
measures taken to strengthen the financial system (LOI
¶ 5) will go toward meeting this goal. The BCV should

Staff’s analytic work shows that BCV’s policy rate (based on the 14 day BCV paper), is in the long run in
line with the exogenous Euro interest rate and the exchange rate peg (the convergence is relatively fast), while
in the short term the BCV adjusts its policy rate taking into account the interest differential between the
domestic banks' deposit and Euro deposit rates to smooth out foreign flows.

22
also follow up on the recommendations of the recent MCM technical assistance for an
enhanced macro-prudential surveillance framework to be built around an expanded set of
financial soundness indicators.
18.
The authorities stated that the financial system is broadly sound and banks have
ample liquid assets. The BCV noted that they view the continued decline in the growth of
nonresident deposits from the perspective of a changing balance of payments rather than the
impact on bank liquidity, as resident deposits are gradually becoming a dominant source of
funding for banks. 18 To better measure how interest-sensitive non-resident deposits are, the
BCV will closely monitor external flows (including these nonresident flows), an action that
will be supported under the PSI as a structural benchmark (LOI, ¶ 11). They also noted that
their plans to liberalize financial flows will also support the diversification of the financial
system. The authorities noted, and staff concurred, that removing bureaucratic burdens on
certain types of financial flows should not pose any near-term risk; it would largely validate
the current de facto situation, remove formal restrictions hampering resident participation in
tourism projects, and further develop Cape Verde as an international financial center. 19
19.
The mission recommended strengthening the framework for analyzing the realfinancial sector linkages. While the current macro-prudential surveillance framework,
which is focused mostly on banks, shows a sector that seems to be generally sound, available
financial soundness indicators (FSIs) are limited in scope and coverage. 20
•
Cape Verde’s FSIs compare well with international benchmarks and are better than
the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Banks generally comply with the prudential
requirements, thanks to BCV enforcement efforts. New regulations for both on- and off-shore
banks on capital ratios, provisioning and loan classification, credit risk assessment, and credit
concentration were published in November 2007.
•
However, the lack of a broader macro-prudential surveillance leaves considerable
uncertainty about current and emerging macro-critical risks and vulnerabilities. Better
understanding the links between the tourism boom and the real estate market, and the
financial system is urgent. Anecdotal evidence suggests a significant price rise in the luxury
end of the real estate market boosted by non-residents’ demand for second homes. Although
18

The evidence on the interest sensitivity of these non-resident deposits is mixed based on extensive
econometric analysis by staff; see (WP/06/132—“Determinants of Emigrants Deposits in Cape Verde”). More
recent data analysis did not radically alter that paper’s conclusions.
19

Portfolio investments and forward foreign exchange transactions are liberalized. FDI, external borrowing, and
capital transfers abroad are formally subject to BCV authorization.
20

The capital adequacy ratios of all banks are above 10 percent. The NPL ratio for the four onshore banks,
which averaged about 4 percent in 2006, increased in 2007 as stricter loan classification criteria were
implemented.

23
banks exposure to the residential real estate is mainly with residents and largely backed by
collateral (with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent), some banks are now also venturing into
large real estate projects to non-residents without a comprehensive credit risk assessment—at
commercial banks themselves, and at the macro-prudential level at the BCV. While nonresidents purchasing second homes are more loyal to sustain tourist arrivals, shocks to
tourism could propagate to the real estate market and may affect banks. Furthermore,
continued slowdown of non-resident deposits may subject the banking system to liquidity
risk. The forthcoming FSAP should help to strengthen the authorities’ hands on these issues.
C. Maintaining Competitiveness and Fostering Private Sector Development
Both staff and authorities view the exchange rate as broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals, and the peg remains appropriate and supported by domestic policies. The
authorities agreed with staff on the need for broader export diversification, and increased
price flexibility consistent with the peg, and to foster private sector development.
20.
The mission called on the authorities to use the window of opportunity provided
by the tourism boom to diversify the economy and improve price flexibility to enhance
resilience to shocks. Structural reforms to make the economy more flexible will be key to
competitiveness and to sustaining high growth in the long term. The authorities’ efforts to
address both infrastructure gaps and labor market rigidities bode well for enhancing growth,
as do Cape Verde’s recent accession to the WTO and its commitment to liberalize trade.
Sustained productivity growth is essential to maintain competitiveness.

21.
Cape Verde’s balance of payments position is consistent with external stability
and the tourism boom does not raise undue concerns. Staff and the authorities agreed that
the recent increase in the current account deficit is no reason for concern because it is largely
linked to FDI-related imports, and there is an automatic stabilizer (imports will decelerate if
tourism and FDI flows decelerate). Although tourism inflows also affect the determination of
the real effective exchange rate (REER), the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals
(Box 3). While the rate generally appreciated during 2005-07 reversing the depreciation of
2003–04, the REER has fluctuated around a constant for the last several years in response to

24
supply-side-driven inflation differentials. This said, the staff noted the significant
appreciation of the euro against the US dollar warrants close monitoring.
22.
With both monetary management and fiscal policy promoting external
stability, staff and the authorities agreed that exchange rate peg has served Cape Verde
well as an anchor for financial stability and remains the appropriate regime. The peg
has also helped to achieve lower inflation at little apparent cost in terms of lost growth. 21 The
existence of a large dominant trading partner—the European Union—whose business cycles
are highly synchronized with Cape Verde, provides an obvious standard of reference for the
peg. This said, staff and authorities agreed that there would be no discernible gains from
hardening the peg given entrenched fiscal discipline, much enhanced policy credibility, and
greater investor confidence. On the contrary, alternatives for hardening the peg would
necessarily entail additional fiscal costs and the monetary and reserve management could be
complicated during the transition to such arrangements.

This is consistent with cross-country evidence showing that for developing countries with little exposure to
international capital movements, pegged exchange rates work well (Rogoff et al., 2004).

Box 3. Assessment of External Stability
The current account and fundamental misalignment: Directly estimating Cape Verde’s current account norm
through the macroeconomic balance approach of the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates is complicated by data
limitations and frequent structural breaks resulting from rapid structural changes. The exchange rate will thus be
assessed by (i) analyzing the reduced-form relationship between the real effective exchange rate (REER) and certain
macroeconomic fundamentals; (ii) assessing the exchange rate regime; and (iii) assessing the sustainability of
domestic policies.
• The current and equilibrium REER: Cape Verde’s

there is no strong evidence of fundamental exchange rate

unemployment rate of about 20 percent, any B-S effect on the
nontradable sector is likely to be moot. In addition, there is no
strong wage indexation in Cape Verde. Assessment: The current exchange rate is broadly in line with
Cape Verde: Indicators of Competitiveness
macroeconomic fundamentals.
• Exchange rate regime: The exchange rate peg is supported
by domestic policies, has contributed to external stability, and
has not pushed the REER out of line with fundamentals.
Overall, the exchange rate regime has served Cape Verde well
as an anchor for financial stability (see ¶ 22 and Figure 6).
Assessment: The peg has promoted external stability and
remains appropriate.

under alternative stress scenarios (Country Report 08/37).
Continued fiscal consolidation has significantly reduced domestic debt and helped to create fiscal space for a modest
increase in capital expenditure to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Monetary management is appropriately adjusting
the interest differential with the euro area and has avoided destabilizing short-term capital flows. Assessment: Fiscal
and monetary policies are consistent with domestic stability and internal balance.
• The capital and financial accounts and external stability: Private capital flows are related primarily to nondebt creating FDI flows in the tourism sector. Cape Verde remains largely unexposed to movements in international
capital markets and cross-border non-emigrant flows. The BCV is closely monitoring vulnerability from the recent
slowdown in emigrant deposits. Assessment: The capital and financial account does not pose major concerns for
external instability.

26
23.
The mission urged the authorities to facilitate the diversification of the export
base and enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks. Actions to improve conditions for
the private-sector-led development could be implemented in two areas:
•
Promote economic diversification to ensure that growth is sustainable for the
long term: The mission urged the authorities to implement an export diversification strategy
that could draw on the conclusions of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) being
conducted through the Integrated Framework agency consortium. 22
•
Improve wage and price
flexibility: Given the peg, greater
flexibility in both labor market and energy
prices is needed to facilitate adjustment to
shocks. The mission welcomed the recent
opening of the Citizen House, which will
strengthen the business environment by,
for instance, reducing the time to start a
business from 52 days to 1 (something not
yet reflected in the 2008 investment
climate indicators); facilitate
entrepreneurship; and ensure sustainable
growth. However, staff emphasized that
the authorities should address other issues
related to the cost of doing business.
While Cape Verde ranks above average on
some indicators, it fares poorly on such
labor market indicators as cost of hiring
and firing.

A smaller index means an improvement in the rank.

24.
The authorities noted that they are moving ahead with their strategy for
diversifying exports and making prices more flexible:
•
They are developing several sectors: offshore financial center, which will be
enhanced by the new prudential regulation and the new AML/CFT law; the fishing and fishprocessing industry, marine and transshipment services; and information technology (IT)
which has already begun with a recent agreement between NOSi and Microsoft to facilitate
government e-commerce and data processing across Cape Verde. They also pointed out that
even within tourism there is room for diversification.

22

The DTIS will examine, among other issues, how Cape Verde can enter into the enormous and expanding
offshore services, information technology, and business process outsourcing market.

27
•
The authorities recognize the need to make the labor market more flexible and agreed
that the recent new labor code will not do much to accomplish that. They plan to upgrade
human capital, retrain labor, attract skilled workers, and improve the mechanism for
addressing arbitration and labor disputes. With recent steps taken on energy pricing, a rapid
pass-through of energy prices will facilitate faster adjustment to terms of trade swings.
IV. STATISTICS ISSUES
25.
The macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. The mission welcomed recent improvements in data release. INE recently
released a new CPI index and a new web portal, both of which go toward strengthening data
collection and improving disclosure. The authorities also now publish most of their data on
the Internet. 23 In line with STA’s recommendation, the mission stressed the increased
importance of unambiguously indicating data links in the official websites and regularly
updating the metadata for General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS).
26.
However, capacity constraints are severe, and further improvements in data are
needed. Specifically:
•
GDP/national accounts: The lack of reliable demand-side GDP data constrains
policy formulation, although the BCV does project demand-side GDP.
•
Labor market statistics: Data on unemployment are compiled with long delays, and
wage data are nonexistent.
•
Tourism statistics: Better data on tourism arrivals and prices would allow the
authorities to gauge the economy’s competitiveness, given the specialization in tourism. INE
noted that it plans to compile Tourism Satellite Account statistics.
•

Fiscal data: The new chart of public accounts (PNCP) will not be ready until 2009.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

27.
Cape Verde’s impressive economic performance in recent years is a tribute to its
sound homegrown economic reform program. The authorities are to be commended for
their prudent macroeconomic management. Good policies have catalyzed investments and
export growth, especially in tourism, breaking past dependence on aid and remittances.
Economic growth is strong, inflation is moderate, and the unemployment and poverty rates
have been gradually falling.
28.
Staff view the exchange rate as broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals, and the peg remains appropriate. Fiscal policy and monetary management
23

28
are promoting external stability. The peg has served Cape Verde well and helped to achieve
low inflation. Staff sees no discernible gains from hardening the peg given entrenched fiscal
discipline, much enhanced policy credibility, and greater investor confidence.
29.
Sustaining this strong performance requires tackling three challenges. First,
building tourism will require investments in transportation and energy. The challenge will be
to use the fiscal space to increase capital expenditures while keeping debt sustainable.
Second, the financial sector still relies on nonresident deposits, and their decelerating growth
rate should be monitored as it is a potential capital account-based source of vulnerability.
Moreover, Cape Verde’s export base is narrow with increasing specialization in tourism. The
challenge here is to limit the vulnerability associated with this specialization, diversify
sources of growth, and increase the economy’s flexibility to enhance resilience to shocks.
30.
Continuing prudence in fiscal policy is essential. This is needed to buy policy
insurance against shocks and support the peg. A medium-term fiscal strategy is needed to
anchor the authorities’ expenditure and tax reform plans. Given the larger-than-expected
domestic debt reduction in 2007, even with current plans to increase capital spending to ease
infrastructure bottlenecks, the risk of debt distress remains low and the envisaged reserve
buildup is preserved. These plans would also need to be implemented within the medium
term fiscal framework (MTFF) and take into account implementation capacity. Staff urges
the authorities to move ahead with their plans toward publishing the MTFF as part of the
2009 budget cycle. The authorities should also pursue their plans to enhance the capacity of
their debt management office including through seeking technical assistance.
31.
Strengthening the financial system further is important. Staff welcomes the
recently published regulation that broadly aligned prudential requirements for both on- and
offshore banks, which should help preserve Cape Verde’s good reputation. Nonetheless,
there is a need to broaden the source of funds for banks so they will continue to grow out of
dependence on non-resident deposits. Staff recommends improving the monitoring of these
nonresident deposits to gauge better the appropriateness of BCV’s policy interest rate by
promptly detecting potentially destabilizing capital flows. Banks exposure to the real estate
market also warrants close monitoring. Staff welcomes the BCV plans to establish an
enhanced financial sector macro-prudential surveillance; this will provide a good basis for
comprehensive assessment of credit risk. The forthcoming FSAP should help to strengthen
the authorities’ hands on these issues, including on the real-financial sector linkages.
32.
Structural reforms are necessary to maintain external competitiveness and
sustain high growth over the long term. Staff calls on the authorities to implement their
strategy for export diversification. Given the peg, greater flexibility in labor markets and
energy prices is also needed to facilitate adjustment to shocks. To remove labor market
rigidities, the authorities should address the high cost of hiring and firing. The authorities’
plans to upgrade human capital, retrain labor, and attract skilled workers are important. On
energy prices, regular application of the new utilities base tariffs and fuel pricing formula is

29
essential for fast adjustment to terms of trade changes. Staff urges the authorities to
accelerate the implementation of their broader energy sector reforms to further reduce fiscal
risk and unleash Cape Verde’s growth and poverty reduction potential.
33.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth review of the PSI program. Based on
the strength of the authorities’ policies and the corrective measures taken, the staff supports
granting a waiver for the missed structural assessment criterion.
34.
The next Article IV Consultation will be held in accordance with the decision on
consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

APPENDIX. LETTER OF INTENT
June 9, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street N.W.
Washington DC 20431, USA
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Discussions for the fourth review of the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) were
held in Praia during March 5–19, 2008. This letter of intent (LOI) reviews implementation
to date of the Cape Verde government’s reform program under the country’s PSI which was
approved by the IMF Executive Board in July 2006. It affirms our commitment to the policy
priorities that were laid out in detail in our Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) of November 2007, and describes policy developments since the third review of the
PSI and prospects for the remainder of 2008 and early 2009.
2.
The government believes that the PSI program provides firm support to enforce
its policies for macroeconomic stability and the exchange rate peg and promote growth.
By fostering a disciplined fiscal framework which has yielded significant fiscal consolidation
in recent years, the program has achieved a large reduction in domestic debt (9 percentage
points of GDP in 2007) and created the fiscal room needed to increase infrastructure
spending to ease bottlenecks to growth. At the same time, the program has enabled
significant buildup of official reserves, which together with the debt reduction, will enable
Cape Verde to prepare for possible declines in concessional external financing following the
country’s graduation from Least-Developed-Country status in January 2008.
Recent economic developments and outlook
3.
Economic activity was strong in 2006/07 and we expect good growth in 2008/09
underpinned by further growth in tourism investment and other services, and by public
infrastructure investment. Real GDP growth rate peaked at 10.8 percent in 2006 boosted by
tourism, telecommunications, and construction sectors, and is estimated at about 7 percent in
2007. Real GDP growth for 2008 and 2009 is forecast to average about 6 ½ percent which
takes into account the global economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation (annual average)
in 2007 declined to 4.4 percent from 5.4 in 2006, despite poor rainfall and should moderate
even further to trend value of 2 ½ -3 ½ percent in 2008 and 2009 in line with those of our
major trading partners.
Program performance
4.
Performance on quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2007 has
exceeded expectations (Table 1). In particular, the program ceiling on net domestic
borrowing was observed by a wide margin reflecting continued expenditure restraint and
buoyant tax revenue collections thanks to strong economic growth, improvements in tax
administration, and higher-than-expected asset sales. Also, the program’s international

42
reserves target was met by a large margin even though reserve accumulation slowed down
somewhat in the final quarter of 2007 driven by slowdown in FDI inflows.
5.
The government is proceeding with the implementation of the structural
measures in the program (Table 2).
•
Implementation of the structural benchmarks on the General Tax Code and Judicial
Process Code was met with a five-month delay from end-December 2007 due both to longerthan-expected public consultation process to forge a consensus before submission to
Parliament, as well as unanticipated technical problems that arose during the final stages of
the legislative drafting. Subsequently, the government with further technical assistance from
the IMF’s Legal Department finalized and submitted the drafts to the Council of Ministers in
May and submitted them to Parliament in June 2008. The income tax code (personal and
corporate) will be aligned with the government’s planned legislation on rationalizing tax
incentives as part of a larger package to reduce economic distortions and make the income
tax system more business friendly. Specifically, the government will examine existing tax
holidays, and introduce loss and carry forward provisions and accelerated depreciation as
part of rationalization of tax incentives and submit the new income tax codes to Parliament in
October as part of the 2009 budget.
•
On energy sector reform, the economic regulatory agency (ARE) finalized and posted
on ARE’s website the mechanism for setting the base utility tariffs for electricity and water
(an assessment criterion under the PSI) by end-March 2008. The new tariffs were determined
after a lengthy analysis of Electra’s costs and efficiency gains targets. Specifically, by March
28 2008, (i) the technical specifications for the base utility tariffs was agreed upon between
Electra and ARE; (ii) the details of the base tariff setting mechanism were posted on ARE’s
website and (iii) base tariff levels were brought in line with the agreed mechanism. However,
the current fuel pricing formula is complex and not very transparent and this complicates its
continuous application especially given the different cost structure of the two oil companies
(Shell and Enacol). As a result, the government is working on a new fuel formula and will
finalize and publish it in June 2008 (a structural benchmark for March). The delay in
implementing the latter measure reflects lack of funding for a energy consultant to set up and
calibrate the new pricing model and the financing only got secured in early March 2008.
•
The BCV has also made progress on the structural benchmarks on financial sector
reform. The PSI benchmark for June 2007 on the implementation of the recommendations of
the financial-sector task force was met late 2007 with the publication of a new risk-oriented
regulation, which broadly aligned the regulatory requirements for onshore and offshore
banks. The benchmark for March 2008 on the establishment of the financial intelligence unit
was met in January 2008, and the legislative drafting of the AML/CFT was concluded at endMarch 2008.

43
Economic policies for the remainder of 2008 and for 2009
6.
The government will continue to focus on enhancing macroeconomic stability
and implementing structural reforms to improve productivity growth and encourage
private-sector led development. Fiscal and monetary policies are consistent with program
goals and supportive of the peg. In particular, public debt will continue to come down as a
share of GDP and international reserves are expected to buildup further. The 2008 program
aims at promoting structural reforms especially in fiscal accounting, budget execution and
control, and arrears prevention, as well as strengthening of the financial sector and improving
energy sector regulation.
Fiscal and Public Financial Management issues
7.
Continued fiscal consolidation remains crucial to our macroeconomic program
and the 2008 budget aims at a further sizable reduction of the domestic debt-to-GDP
ratio.
•
The budget projections for revenues and expenditures are prudent, with tax revenues
and the wage bill planned to grow by less than nominal GDP relative to the 2007 budget. As
the 2008 budget does not plan additional net domestic borrowing in 2008, the net domestic
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue to decline below 20 percent by end-2008, with the
original target reached two years ahead of schedule. Going forward, we are committed to
continue to reduce public debt as a share of GDP and to keep it on an appropriate path
consistent with the medium term baseline debt path agreed with the IMF. Using our mediumterm fiscal framework, we are considering increasing capital expenditure modestly to ease
infrastructure bottlenecks for both transportation and the energy sector. Consistent with the
government’s overall investment program, our planned increases in capital spending, which
also recognizes the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the energy sector, will be in line
with the strengthening of our public financial management (PFM) and debt management.
•
The rationalization of tax incentives is also a high priority to the government since it
will improve procedures to grant exemptions and repeal some of the current exemptions.
Reforming the corporate income tax rate will help to muster public support for rationalizing
tax exemptions. To this end, we reiterate our request for technical assistance to the IMF to
help us with a framework which will underpin the economic criteria for rationalizing tax
incentives.
8.
The government remains fully committed to moving ahead with its program of
strengthening public sector financial management as outlined in our MEFP for the
third review of the PSI. Thus, we agreed to include a new structural measure in the program
which will submit a simplified medium-term fiscal framework to the Council of Ministers in
the 2009 budget preparation cycle and publish it on the Ministry of Finance website in
November 2008 to help to anchor fiscal policy on a medium-term perspective. This measure
will help the government to build capacity for formulation of a medium-term fiscal policy,
lay the basis for implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), program
budgeting and a medium-term investment program (MTIP) in line with the forthcoming
PRSP-II for 2008-11.

44
9.
Strengthening our debt management capacity is also a high priority. At present
our debt management office has a number of resource constraints. A strengthened debt
management strategy will underpin the government’s borrowing program and the country’s
overall medium-term fiscal framework. In this context, the government reiterates its need for
technical assistance from the IMF to strengthen debt management, which could include
assistance to enhance our asset-liability management. On concessional financing, the
government has extensively reached out through its various donor partners, including through
several high level conferences to shore up concessional financing over the medium term.
Most donors have responded positively by confirming that graduation from the UN’s Least
Developed Country status will not lead to an abrupt end to concessional aid. Thus, we will
continue to look for concessional money to finance our planned increases in infrastructure
spending. In line with our plans to strengthen our debt management office and strategy, the
government will review thoroughly with the IMF the borrowing necessary to finance vital
projects to ease infrastructure constraints on growth and help to decisively move ahead with
the much needed reform of the energy sector.
Monetary and financial sector issues
10.
Monetary management remains consistent with the program goal of building up
foreign exchange reserves to support the peg to the Euro. Consistent with the exchange
rate peg, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) will continue to adjust domestic interest rates in the
short run to smooth out capital flows. The BCV’s official policy rate will remain the interest
rate offered on the 14-day bill. The government’s objective is to increase reserves by about
0.1 month of prospective imports annually reaching over 4 months by 2013.
11.

The BCV is strengthening the regulation and supervision of the financial sector.

•
All four onshore banks are fully compliant with the new strengthened prudential
requirements. New bank regulations on capital ratios, provisioning and loan classification,
credit risk assessment, and credit concentration were published in November 2007 and BCV
has given banks a 5 year transitional period to meet the new requirement on provisions on
non-performing loans. To further financial sector stability, the BCV agrees to a new
structural benchmark to be included in the program which will establish a system to enhance
the monitoring of external flows including non-resident deposits. Better monitoring of
deposits is necessary to promptly detect potentially destabilizing capital flows and adjust
interest rates as necessary to smooth out these capital flows. We will continue to study to
what extent these deposits (or subsamples of these deposits) are interest sensitive.
•
A new insurance sector regulation is being modernized to cover both life and non-life
aspects of the insurance industry. Although the basic infrastructure on capital markets is in
place, the operational and legal aspects are not yet fully developed and modernized including
the Securities Code and the Company’s Act. As a result, the capital market needs to be better
oriented toward supporting economic development in Cape Verde. The government
recognizes that the development of capital markets will enable domestic companies access
funds from emigrants seeking investment opportunities other than emigrant deposits and is
consistent with turning Cape Verde into an international financial centre. Thus, the
government is working on these aspects, and will take further measures to minimize risks to
the financial system before moving further with liberalization of financial flows.

45
Energy sector reform
12.
Despite the resource constraints that have caused delays in implementing the
government’s comprehensive plans to reform the energy sector, the reforms are steadily
moving in the right direction. Following the approval of the new base utility tariff
mechanism, there will be regular adjustment of these tariffs, which will ease Electra’s cash
flow problems, clear its arrears with suppliers, help the implementation of its investment
plan, and stop the accrual of tariff deficits, a government contingent liability. Thus,
consistent with the government’s commitment in the MEFP for the 3rd review of the PSI not
to allow subsidies for energy products in the 2008 budget, ARE adjusted fuel prices by endMarch 2008. A new simplified and more transparent fuel pricing formula is also being
prepared to be finalized and published in June 2008. One consideration is to base the new
fuel formula on international benchmark prices, which will stop the accrual of fuel price
deficits owed to the oil companies, and will be in line with the joint venture for the two oil
suppliers into a joint logistics company to handle importation, storage and inter-island
distribution of oil products by July 2008. As part of early deliverables on Electra’s reform,
Electra will also strengthen its revenue collection system, including putting in place prepaid
meters. To provide financial assistance to Electra, with the help of donor assistance, the
government will build five power plants and lend them on to Electra. The government is also
considering management contracts with the private sector to improve Electra’s management.
We also recognize the potential role of public private partnerships (PPP) to boost investments
in the energy sector; and will therefore strengthen the regulation for PPPs to ensure that the
risk-sharing arrangement in these PPP prevents any contingent liability for the government in
the future.
Program monitoring and reporting
13.
Under the PSI, the government will keep the IMF regularly updated on
economic and policy developments and will provide the data needed for adequate
monitoring of the program. This extended LOI provides updates to our MEFP of
November 2007 as follows: Program’s quantitative targets for the end-June 2008 were
reviewed and affirmed and targets were set for end-December 2008 (Table 1), and two new
structural measures on public financial management and the financial sector in the program
were included (Table 2). The fifth and sixth reviews of the PSI are scheduled to be completed
by end-October 2008 and end-April 2009, respectively. During the period of the PSI, Cape
Verde will consult with the IMF on the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate at
the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such
a consultation.
14.
We authorize the IMF to publish this letter, and the related staff report and selected
issues papers.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Cristina Duarte
Minister of Finance and Public Administration.

ATTACHMENT. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 1
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Cape Verdean authorities
and the IMF staff regarding the definition of assessment criteria and indicative targets and
reporting requirements for the fifth and sixth reviews under the Policy Support Instrument.
I. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Net Domestic Borrowing Excluding for Clearance of Arrears and Net Late Payments
2.
Net domestic borrowing excluding for clearance of arrears and net late
payments is defined as the cumulative change since the start of the calendar year of the net
credit to the central government from the banking and nonbanking sectors less (1) the
cumulative clearance during the calendar year of the stock of arrears as of the end of the
previous year and (2) the cumulative payments during the first three months of the calendar
year of expenses authorized by the previous year’s budget, and plus the expenses accrued
during the current year that will be paid during the first three months of the next calendar
year as provisioned for in the budget law (late payments or atrasados). The ceiling will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in external
debt service and upward (downward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in
nonproject external financial assistance and land sales relative to program assumptions.
3.
Net credit to the central government from the banking and nonbanking system is
defined as the overall position of the main central government institutions vis-à-vis the
banking and nonbanking system—that is, the stock of all outstanding claims on the central
government (loans, advances), and all other government debt instruments, such as long-term
government securities) held by the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank institutions,
less all deposits held by the central government with the central bank and with commercial
banks. The INPS is not included in central government accounts. Net credit to the central
government excludes claims on the Trust Fund (TCMFs).
4.
Reporting requirements. Data on the implementation of the budget compiled by the
Ministry of Finance and Public Administration will be provided on a quarterly basis, to be
submitted not later than five weeks after the end of each quarter, including (i) government
domestic revenue by category; (ii) external budget support grants; (iii) government
expenditure, including primary current expenditure, domestic and external interest payments,
and capital expenditure, including domestically and budget support financed capital
expenditure and estimates of externally project financed capital expenditure; (iv) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic accounts payable (atrasados); (v) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic payments arrears; (vi) external loan receipts
1

Updated from the Country Report No. 08/37. Changes to paragraphs 2, 18, and 19.

50
and principal payments; (vii) external arrears payments and accumulation; (viii) bank and
nonbank financing; (ix) privatization and land sale receipts; and (x) any other revenue,
expenditure, or financing not included above.
5.
For the purposes of this memorandum, privatization and land proceeds will be
understood to mean all monies received by the government from the sale or concessioning of
a public company, organization, or facility to a private company or companies,
organization(s), or individual(s), as well as any proceeds generated from the sale of
government land and the liquidation of a public company, less restructuring costs.
B. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank
6.
The ceiling on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2006, in
net domestic assets of the BCV constitutes an assessment criterion. Net domestic assets
(NDA) of the BCV are defined as reserve money minus net foreign assets of the BCV,
evaluated at the current end-of-period exchange rates. The program ceilings for NDA will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in external
debt service and upward (downward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in
nonproject external financial assistance relative to program assumptions. For purposes of
calculating the adjusters, these flows will be valued at current exchange rates. Reserve
money comprises bank reserves and deposits of the monetary institutions and private sector
with the central bank, as well as cash in circulation.
7.
Reporting requirements. The preliminary monthly balance sheets of the BCV and
the consolidated commercial banks will be transmitted on a monthly basis, with a maximum
delay of five weeks. The definitive version of the monthly balance sheet of the BCV will be
provided as soon as available.
C. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Central
Government
8.
Under the program, ceilings on medium- and long-term, as well as on short-term,
nonconcessional external debt constitute assessment criteria. The ceiling on medium- and
long-term nonconcessional external debt is on a quarterly basis while the one on short-term
nonconcessional external debt is on a continuous basis. Nonconcessional external debt is
defined as debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government with a grant element of
less than 35 percent, calculated using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs) published by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Debt rescheduling and debt
reorganization are excluded from the limits on nonconcessional external debt. The limits on
new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government
(excluding borrowing from the Fund) are specified in Table 1 of the Letter of Intent. The
definition of short-term nonconcessional external debt excludes normal short-term (less than
one year) import-related financing. The Portuguese government’s precautionary credit line in

51
support of the exchange rate peg is also excluded from the definition of nonconcessional
external debt. The assessment criterion on medium- and long-term nonconcessional external
indebtedness applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), 8/24/00)
but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
With respect to the assessment criterion on short-term nonconcessional external
indebtedness, the term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), 8/24/00).
9.
Reporting requirements. The government of Cape Verde will consult with Fund
staff before assuming any liabilities in circumstances where they are uncertain whether the
instrument in question falls under the assessment criterion. Details of all new external debt
(including government guarantees), indicating terms of debt and creditors, will be provided
on a quarterly basis within five weeks of the end of each quarter.
D. Net International Reserves of the Central Bank
10.
The floor on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2006, in net
international reserves (NIR) of the BCV constitutes a assessment criterion under the
program. The NIR of the BCV are defined as gross international reserves of the BCV net of
its external reserve liabilities, calculated at the current exchange rates. Gross reserves of the
BCV are those that are readily available (i.e., liquid and marketable and free of any pledges
or encumbrances), controlled by the BCV and held for the purposes of meeting balance of
payments needs and intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include gold, holdings of
SDRs, the reserve position at the IMF, holdings of foreign exchange and traveler’s checks,
demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks abroad, fixed-term deposits abroad that can
be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of investment-grade securities. External
liabilities of the BCV comprise liabilities to nonresidents contracted by the BCV with an
original maturity of less than a year, any net off-balance-sheet position of the BCV (futures,
forwards, swaps, or options) with either resident and nonresidents, any arrears on principal
and interest to external creditors and suppliers, and purchases from the IMF. The program
floors for the NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative downward
(upward) deviations in external debt service and downward (upward) by the cumulative
downward (upward) deviations in nonproject external financial assistance relative to program
assumptions. For purposes of calculating the adjusters, these flows will be valued at current
exchange rates.
11.
Reporting requirements. A table on the NIR prepared by the BCV will be
transmitted on weekly basis, with a maximum delay of two weeks.
E. Nonaccumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears
12.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new domestic
payments arrears. This will be monitored through the monthly execution of the cash-flow

52
plan and the corresponding release of budget appropriations. For programming purposes, a
domestic payment obligation to suppliers is deemed to be in arrears if it has not been paid
within the normal grace period of 60 days (30 days for government salaries and debt service)
or such other period either specified by the budget law or contractually agreed with the
supplier after the verified delivery of the concerned goods and services, unless the amount or
the timing of the payment is subject to good faith negotiations between the government and
the creditor.
13.
Reporting requirements. The Ministry of Finance and Public Administration,
through the D.G.T., will submit on a quarterly basis a detailed table of the stock of domestic
payments arrears, including the accumulation, payment, rescheduling and write-off of
domestic payments arrears during the quarter. The data are to be provided within four weeks
after the end of the quarter.
F. Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears
14.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new external
payments arrears on a continuous basis. This will be monitored through the monthly
execution of the cash-flow plan and the corresponding release of budget appropriations.
15.
External arrears are defined as total external debt-service obligations of the
government that have not been paid by the time they are due, except where agreements
between the government and creditors explicitly provide for a grace period after such
obligations falling due. External arrears exclude arrears on external debt, pending the
conclusion of debt-rescheduling agreements.
16.
Reporting requirements. Data on (i) debt-service payments; and (ii) external arrears
accumulation and payments will be transmitted on a quarterly basis by the Ministry of
Finance and Public Administration, within five weeks of the end of each quarter. In addition,
the government will inform the Fund staff immediately of any accumulation of external
arrears.
II. STRUCTURAL ASSESSMENT CRITERIA 2
A. Finalize and publish the mechanism for setting base utility tariffs
17.
The condition for finalizing and publishing the mechanism for setting base electricity
and water tariffs will be deemed complete when (i) the technical specifications have been
agreed upon between Electra and the autonomous Economic Regulatory Authority (ARE);
(ii) the details of the base tariff setting mechanism have been published; and (iii) base tariff
levels are brought in line with the agreed mechanism.
2

See Table 2 of the Letter of Intent of June 2008.

53
B. Continuous application of the mechanisms for setting and adjusting electricity,
water, and fuel prices
18.
The condition will be deemed met when (i) base utility tariffs are set, and reset with
the periodicity, as specified in the agreed base tariff setting mechanism; (ii) between resetting
of base tariffs, utility tariffs are adjusted whenever input costs since the last adjustment have
changed cumulatively by more than three percent as specified in the published utility tariff
adjustment mechanism; and (iii) within one month of each import shipment of petroleum
products, retail petroleum product prices are adjusted and brought in line with the
specifications in the retail petroleum price adjustment mechanism. This structural assessment
criterion applies continuously only through end-May 2008, after which the new base utility
tariffs and fuel price mechanisms will come into effect.
C. Complete a formal mid-year review of revenue and expenditure that allows for
taking corrective measures if necessary
19.
This condition will be deemed met when (i) revenue, expenditure, and financing
during January–June are assessed and compared with budget forecasts; and (ii) the necessary
corrective actions, if any, are identified.
III. OTHER DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAM-MONITORING PURPOSES
20.
Data on exports and imports, including volume and prices and compiled by the
Director of Customs and the BCV, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within five weeks
after the end of each quarter. A preliminary quarterly balance of payments, compiled by the
BCV, will be forwarded within five weeks after the end of each quarter.

IX. Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) is subject to
a voluntary assessment with respect to the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) approved on July
31, 2006. The necessary documentation has been received from the authorities and the
assessment is underway.

56
The previous BCV safeguards assessment was completed in December 2002 for the PRGF
arrangement approved on April 10, 2002. The assessment concluded that substantial risks
may have existed at the time in the bank’s financial reporting framework, internal audit
mechanism, and system of internal controls. While all recommendations but one have been
confirmed as implemented by the BCV authorities, the audit opinion of external auditors on
the 2005 and 2006 financial statements and the 2004 management letter indicates that further
steps need to be taken.
X. Exchange Arrangements
The de facto and de jure exchange rate arrangement of Cape Verde is a conventional fixed
peg. The escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of CVE 110.3 per €1 since January 4,
1999. Cape Verde accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement
effective July 1, 2004. It maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI. Previous Article IV Consultation and PSI Reviews
Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and on a medium-term economic program
that could be supported by a three-year PSI were held in Praia April 28–May 16, 2006. The
Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation and approved the request for a PSI on
July 31, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/334); the first PSI review on January 19, 2007
(Country Report No. 07/44); the second PSI review on May 7, 2007 (Country Report No.
07/223); and the third PSI review on December 21, 2007 (Country Report 08/37) (see
www.imf.org).
XII. Technical Assistance
Since 1985 the Fund has provided technical assistance to the BCV, the Ministry of Finance,
and more recently the National Institute of Statistics in several areas: (i) MCM provided
technical assistance to the BCV on organization and methods, management of external debt,
monetary and banking statistics, accounting, credit, foreign exchange operations,
management of public debt, and the separation of the functions of the Bank, as well as on the
choice of exchange rate regime. BCV has also received technical assistance from STA on
monetary and balance of payments statistics. (ii) The Ministry of Finance has received
technical assistance from FAD on organization and budgetary procedures, budgeting, tax
policy, and tax administration; from STA on fiscal accounting; and from LEG on tax
legislation. (iii) The National Institute of Statistics has received technical assistance in
national accounts and price statistics. Cape Verde is a participant in STA’s GDDS Regional
Project for Lusophone Africa, and its metadata were posted on the DSBB in February 2004.
It is now receiving technical assistance to implement the GDDS plan for improvement.
Most recently, technical assistance has been provided in the following areas:

CAPE VERDE—STATISTICS ISSUES
21.
The quality of economic and financial data provided to the Fund is generally
adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although there is a need for
substantial improvements in some areas. Economic data are available in official websites
www.minfin.cv, www.bcv.cv, and www.ine.cv. Weaknesses in the fiscal data make it
difficult to monitor some aspects of fiscal performance; they include large statistical
discrepancies, noncompliance with best accounting practices, and shortcomings in
institutional coverage and sectorization. Other shortcomings of concern are weaknesses in the
national accounts, a lack of short-term activity indicators besides the confidence barometer,
and gaps in the tracking of large external flows—notably FDI, emigrant deposits, and
remittances. Cape Verde has participated in the GDDS since February 2004. The metadata of
the monetary and financial sector were updated in August 2007.
22.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen statistics, but the statistical system
still suffers from a shortage of financial and human resources. A comprehensive master
plan has been developed under the direction of the National Statistical Institute (INE), which
assesses the need for upgrading the agencies that constitute the statistical system and outlines
steps to broaden and improve all areas of statistics. The plan envisages improvements in data
on national accounts (annual and quarterly), business statistics (including a new business
census), demographic and social statistics (including a household survey to update the
poverty profile), trade statistics (retail and international trade) macroeconomic indicators;
labor market and sectoral statistics, and update of the CPI basket every five years.
Cape Verde’s development partners have already committed a substantial part of the
estimated US$15 million required to implement the plan through 2010.
23.
The country has benefited from STA technical assistance (TA) under the GDDS
project for Lusophone Africa. The main purpose of this project was to help the government
implement the GDDS plans for improvement, in particular the adoption of the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). A first GFS mission visited the country in
March 2004, with follow-up missions in April 2006 and March 2007. STA TA has also been
provided in other areas, such as national accounts, consumer prices (with recent missions in
May–June 2006 and October 2007 in preparation for the launch of the new CPI), monetary
and financial statistics, and balance of payments statistics.
Real sector
24.
Although some improvements have been made to the national accounts,
significant weaknesses remain, including a lack of reliable demand-side GDP. The
timeliness of the data has improved, with the INE releasing production and expenditurebased GDP data for 2002–03 in 2005 and providing production-based GDP estimates for
2004–06 to the mission in October 2007. However, the lag is still large by international
standards. The base year for the constant price estimates, moreover, is outdated.
25.
INE is currently working on a complete overhaul of the national accounts. It is
updating the national accounts benchmark and base years from 1980 to 2002 and adopting

61
the 1993 SNA. The objective is timely compilation of GDP by industry and expenditure
categories at current and constant prices as well as institutional sector accounts.
26.
INE will also introduce Tourism Satellite Accounts. These accounts will measure
upstream linkages between the tourism sector and the rest of the economy and the import
content of tourism exports.
27.
Full implementation of the 1993 SNA would require a substantial improvement
in source data collection, for which capacity is currently lacking. The 2006 STA mission
found a critical need to improve the timeliness and accuracy of national accounts source data,
in particular the business survey. The capacity of INE staff working on national accounts was
found to be overstretched; they assess in detail and correct individual source data entries—
something not undertaken in most countries by national accounts compilers. The statistical
master plan will address many of these challenges.
28.
A new CPI series was released in February 2008. The previous official CPI was
based on weights dating back to 1989, four years before imports were liberalized, which
considerably changed consumption patterns. INE has had assistance from the National
Statistics Institute of Portugal and benefited from STA CPI missions in May–June, 2006,
October 2006, and October 2007, to support the introduction and dissemination of the revised
CPI. The new index has new weights and an updated commodity basket, and uses new
compilation software.
29.
Labor market statistics are weak. Data on unemployment are compiled with long
delays and there are no wage data.
Government finance
30.
Fiscal data has been improved. Benefiting from TA support under the GDDS
project for Lusophone Africa, the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compilation system
is being upgraded. Most deposits previously held with commercial banks have been
consolidated at the central bank. SIGOF, the Integrated Online Budget Management System,
has been expanded to cover all semi-autonomous institutes and most municipalities by the
end of 2007. In addition, a new chart of government accounts (PNCP) will be implemented
in 2009 that adopts accrual accounting and double-entry principles. GFS are not reported for
publication in the GFS Yearbook and International Financial Statistics.
31.
Quality is a serious concern. The fiscal accounts are subject to large statistical
discrepancies, flows and stocks are not consistent, and recording of arrears accumulation and
clearance operations is not in line with best practices. Significant delay in donor reporting of
project financing also affects the accuracy of fiscal data. Despite the recent revision of
external debt data, significant weaknesses affect preparation of debt sustainability analyses.
Multilateral debt statistics regularly differ from data received by creditors, and debt service
projections cannot be reconciled with the debt stock.

62
Money and banking
32.
The quality of monetary and financial statistics is adequate, in terms of both
accuracy and timeliness. A statistics mission undertaken in March 2007 helped BCV to
finalized the standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to STA. SRFbased monetary data have been published in the IFS Supplement since June 2007. These data
are fully aligned with the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
The mission also started building an integrated monetary database to meet STA, AFR, and
BCV statistical needs. Currently, there are gaps in tracking the source and direction of
changes in emigrant deposits, which cause difficulties in assessing the their interest
sensitivity and gauging the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.
Balance of Payments
33.
With technical assistance from STA, the accuracy, periodicity, and timeliness of
balance of payments statistics compiled by BCV have continued to improve. A greater use of
surveys, combined with the International Transactions Reporting System implemented by the
BCV, has permitted a significant expansion of data sources and statistical coverage, which to
a large extent, follow the recommendations of the 5th edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual. Dissemination of quarterly BOP data on the BCV website has been regular and in
2007 the BCV resumed regular and timely transmission of these data to STA for publication
in International Financial Statistics and in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
(BOPSY). However, the BCV does not compile an International Investment Position.

IMF Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Cape Verde
On June 30, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cape Verde and completed the fourth review
of the Policy Support Instrument. 1
Background
Over the last several years, Cape Verde has achieved a major economic transformation.
Real per capita GDP has increased on average by over 7 percent a year, faster than
other small island economies and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The
unemployment rate fell by more than 10 percentage points between 2001 and 2006.
Cape Verde is also on track to achieve most of the MDGs by 2015, including halving the
1990 poverty level. This is remarkable for a small island economy with no natural
resources. The transformation is reflected in an economy that is increasingly becoming
service-based, led by tourism and commerce. In recognition of its strong performance
and policy credibility, Cape Verde was accepted as a special partner of the European
Union in November 2007, was invited to join the WTO in December 2007, and
graduated from UN least-developed country (LDC) status in January 2008 (the second
in sub-Saharan Africa after Botswana and the first graduation in more than a decade).
Policy implementation under the PSI is also strong. All PSI quantitative assessment
criteria for end-December 2007 were met with wide margins. Revenues are ahead of the
authorities’ targets, and expenditures are as budgeted, which together have produced a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the June 30,
2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

65
significant reduction in public debt. Official reserves are also building rapidly. Thus,
domestic policies are strengthening the credibility of the exchange rate peg. Progress on
structural measures in the program is steady, especially reforms related to public
financial management, the tax system, the financial sector, and energy sector
regulation.
On recent developments, economic growth is strong with moderate inflation. The real
GDP growth rate peaked at 10.8 percent in 2006, boosted by tourism,
telecommunications, and construction. Based on information from the National
Statistical Institute (INE), GDP growth is estimated at about 7 percent in 2007 and,
factoring in the effects of the global economic slowdown, growth should moderate only
slightly to 6 ½ percent in 2008 as tourism and construction continue to expand. With the
peg to the euro and the high openness allowing rapid import price pass-through, twelvemonth inflation averaged about 3½ percent for December 2007–April 2008, broadly in
line with inflation in the euro area. While food and energy prices have risen, this has not
led to generalized inflation partly due to lack of a strong wage indexation.
Fiscal policy continues to support the peg. Prudent implementation of the 2008 budget
will ensure that domestic debt will be further reduced to 16 percent of GDP by end-2008.
Tax revenues are exceeding budget forecasts, reflecting not just economic growth but
also improvements in tax administration; also, asset sales have surpassed expectations.
These factors, together with continued expenditure restraint, have reduced the domestic
debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities’ target for domestic debt, 20 percent of GDP, was
reached in 2007, two years ahead of schedule.
The Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) continues to conduct monetary management
appropriately. Given the peg and a largely open capital account, passive monetary
management by the BCV has been setting the official policy rate consistent with its
endogenous equilibrium level, which smoothes and sterilizes short-term capital flows.
Reserves continue to accumulate, and while FDI-related imports have led to and
financed a higher current account deficit, there are no signs of a more general increase
in imports that would jeopardize the targeted increase in reserves. Excess liquidity has
been contained by sterilization, by the new investment opportunities on the Stock
Exchange following rapid development of the domestic equity market, and by growth in
private sector credit. The buildup of government deposits at the BCV is also helping to
sterilize external inflows. Thus, monetary management and fiscal prudence are both
supporting the exchange rate peg and promoting external stability.
Structural reforms are being undertaken to foster competition and enhance private
sector’s role in the economy. Several state-owned enterprises were privatized; the
government selected new management to prepare the national airline (TACV) for
privatization; and the process of privatizing the ports operator (ENAPOR) is underway.
Ahead of WTO accession, external tariffs were lowered. The Cape Verde Stock
Exchange has been revitalized; its market capitalization is now 25 percent of GDP (from
zero in 2005). Cape Verde has also made major strides in the last several years in
achieving the key objectives set out in the first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) and
in improving the well being of its citizens. The second PRSP submitted to the IMF Board
in June 2008 sets out Cape Verde’s medium-term goals and provides a comprehensive
and integrated strategy for achieving those goals.

66

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Cape Verde's impressive economic performance and
policy implementation in recent years, reflected in the country's recent graduation from
UN least-developed country status, accession to the WTO, and acceptance as a special
partner in the EU. They commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management and their commitment to the objectives of the PSI program. Directors
welcomed the faster-than-expected reduction of domestic debt and buildup of official
reserves. Prudent policies have catalyzed investment and export growth, especially in
the tourism sector, contributing to robust growth and moderate inflation.
Directors agreed that Cape Verde's external stability appears to be well secured despite
the recent increase in the current account deficit, as foreign direct investment is largely
financing this deficit. They considered that the exchange rate peg has served the
economy well, helping to achieve low inflation, and they took note of the staff
assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Looking ahead, Directors believed that continuing prudent fiscal policy will be critical to
safeguarding the exchange rate peg and reducing Cape Verde's vulnerability to shocks.
A medium-term fiscal strategy is needed to anchor expenditure and tax reform plans.
Directors urged the authorities to publish a medium-term fiscal framework as part of the
2009 budget cycle. They noted that given the larger-than-expected reduction of
domestic debt in 2007, the risk of debt distress remains low even with current plans to
increase capital spending. At the same time, some Directors observed that the overall
debt level, both domestic and external, remains relatively high, calling for continued
prudence.
Directors considered that further strengthening the financial system will be important to
safeguard its stability and enhance Cape Verde's growth prospects. They welcomed the
measures being taken by the Central Bank of Cape Verde to strengthen financial sector
regulation and supervision, including the recently published regulation that broadly
aligns prudential requirements for both on- and offshore banks. At the same time, banks
will need to broaden their source of funds to reduce their dependence on nonresident
deposits. Directors looked forward to the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment
Program, which should strengthen the authorities' hand on these issues.
Directors noted that structural reforms are necessary to maintain external
competitiveness and sustain high growth over the long term. They encouraged the
authorities to move ahead with their structural reform agenda to diversify the economy
and improve price flexibility. This will support private sector development and increase
the economy's resilience to shocks. Directors welcomed the recent progress made on
the regulatory framework for the energy sector, and urged the authorities to accelerate
the implementation of their broader energy sector reform plan, especially in the area of
the adjustment of energy prices.
Directors welcomed the new PRSP-II, as well as the progress that has been made in
improving the well-being of Cape Verde's citizens. They encouraged the authorities to

67
continue pursuing reforms consistent with the PRSP-II, and to improve further the
assessments of the costs of the PRSP-II's expenditure plans. The identification of
reliable and relevant poverty indicators, along with enhanced monitoring and evaluation
of the PRSP-II's implementation, will help the authorities gauge the effectiveness of their
efforts as they work to alleviate poverty and attain the Millennium Development Goals.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Cape Verde will be held within 24
months, subject to the provisions of the Executive Board decision on consultation cycles
in program countries.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under the Policy Support Instrument
for Cape Verde
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Cape Verde. The PSI was
approved on July 31, 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/172).
In completing the review, the Board granted a waiver for the non-observance of an
assessment criterion related to application of the mechanism for setting and adjusting
electricity, water, and fuel prices, given the strength of the authorities' policies and the
corrective measures taken.
Cape Verde's PSI is designed to enhance the sustainability of growth and development by
maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and moving forward with structural
reforms. It is also expected to help the country reduce macroeconomic risks, provide a
margin for safety against shocks, and prepare for a possible longer-term decline in access to
concessional external financing. Key measures are directed to reducing public debt, building
up international reserves, improving public financial management, and strengthening
financial sector and energy sector regulation.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
"Cape Verde's impressive economic performance in recent years reflects both prudent
macroeconomic management and economic reforms. Good policies have catalyzed
investments and export growth, especially in the tourism sector—breaking past dependence
on aid and remittances—leading to robust growth and moderate inflation.
"Continuation of prudent fiscal policy will be critical to safeguarding the exchange rate peg
and enhancing resilience against shocks. The PSI target for domestic debt was met two years
ahead of schedule, helping to build up foreign reserves faster and support the exchange rate
peg. This success was due largely to restraint on current spending, improved public financial
management, and robust tax revenues, reflecting improvements in tax administration. Going
forward, the prudent 2008 budget is consistent with further reducing domestic debt. The
forthcoming medium-term fiscal framework should help to anchor the authorities'
expenditure and tax reform plans, preserve the low risk of debt distress, and help accumulate
reserves to support the exchange rate peg and buffer shocks.

70
"Further strengthening the financial system will be important to safeguard its stability and
enhance Cape Verde's growth prospects. The authorities are making progress in
strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision, including the broad alignment of
prudential requirements for both on- and offshore banks. Strong oversight of banking system
soundness would help attract more diverse sources of financing and reduce dependence on
nonresident deposits. The Central Bank of Cape Verde is working to strengthen the set of
financial soundness indicators. The forthcoming FSAP should strengthen the authorities'
hand and enable them to better understand real and financial sector linkages.
"Structural reforms to make the economy more flexible will be key to enhancing
competitiveness and to sustaining high growth in the long term. Cape Verde's export base
remains narrow. The ongoing tourism boom offers a window of opportunity to facilitate
private sector development and enhance economic diversification. Diversifying the economy
continues to be an important strategic goal to increase resilience to shocks.
"Cape Verde has made major strides in the last several years in achieving the key objectives
set out in the first PRSP and in improving the well-being of its citizens. The PRSP-II sets out
Cape Verde's medium-term goals and provides a comprehensive and integrated strategy for
achieving them. Implementation of the PRSP-II would benefit from adequately costed
expenditure plans for key priorities and an improved monitoring and evaluation system," Mr.
Kato said.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries (and small island
states) that may not need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice,
monitoring and endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven. PSIsupported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported
programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and
social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is
normally reviewed semi-annually, irrespective of the status of the program (see Public
Information Notice No. 05/145).

71

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Cape Verde
June 30, 2008

1.
We thank staff for the comprehensive and well-illustrated report and selected issues
paper on Cape Verde as well as for the fruitful policy dialogue they continue to maintain with
the country’s authorities. The authorities appreciate the useful advice the Fund provides them
in support of their efforts to overcome the policy challenges facing the country. As is
customary, the authorities have consented to the Fund publication of their letter of intent, the
staff report, and selected issues paper.
2.
Cape Verde continues to make outstanding economic and policy achievements. Real
GDP growth continued to be strong over recent years. Macroeconomic and external stability
were consolidated, with inflation kept in check, domestic debt significantly reduced and the
external position largely improved. Along with falling unemployment, the incidence of
poverty continued to decline at a pace which, if maintained, should enable the country to
significantly reduce extreme poverty, in line with the poverty MDG. Recently, Cape Verde
earned a graduation from UN least-developed country status and a Special Partnership with
the European Union.
3.
Notwithstanding these accomplishments, the country continues to face a number of
challenges. Poverty and unemployment are still high despite having embarked on a steeply
declining path over the past several years. Growth performance is still hampered by a number
of impediments such as drought and weather vagaries, weak infrastructure and, more
recently, high food and energy prices. The authorities continue to show a strong resolve to
convert these challenges into opportunities to accelerate growth and poverty reduction. And
in this endeavor, they are hopeful that they will continue to benefit from the support of Cape
Verde’s international partners, notably the Fund.
Recent Performance under the Policy Support Instrument
4.
Cape Verde continues to keep up with its strong performance under the PSI, thanks to
sound macroeconomic and structural policies. Economic activity in 2007 was strong. In the
face of rising energy and food price increases, real GDP growth remained strong, reaching
about 7 percent. CPI inflation declined and is also expected to continue to follow its
downward path this year. The external current account deficit peaked, due to higher FDIrelated imports, but was more than financed by foreign investment flows.
5.
In regard to program performance, all quantitative assessment criteria were met, some
of which with wide margins. These include the end-December 2007 criteria on net domestic
borrowing and international reserves which were comfortably met. This program

72
overperformance reflects, among others, strict fiscal discipline, strong country ownership of
the PSI, improved tax administration, and prudent macroeconomic management. On the
structural front, the authorities continued to implement most reforms set forth in the PSI
program although some were carried out with delay primarily due to capacity constraints. In
particular, such constraints prevented a timely implementation of the continuous assessment
criterion on the full application of the mechanism for setting and adjusting fuel prices.
However, the authorities promptly took corrective actions by adjusting fuel prices on March
25, 2008, and working to develop by the end of this month a new fuel pricing formula with
the assistance of an international consulting firm. In light of these corrective actions, we call
on Directors to support the authorities’ request for waiver for the missed assessment
criterion.
6.
With the aim at broadening the tax base, the new General Tax Code and Judicial
Process Code will be submitted to the National Assembly. Going forward, it is the
authorities’ intention to improve the efficiency of the tax system so as to make it more
conducive to private sector development. Accordingly, the authorities will, in the coming
months, submit the income tax bills to the National Assembly along with draft legislation
aimed at streamlining tax incentives. With regard to financial sector reform, the authorities
took vigorous steps towards strengthening financial supervision and regulation. In particular,
anti-money laundering and CFT legislations were submitted to the National Assembly; so
were legislations to establish a financial intelligence unit. Similarly, the authorities
elaborated and published in March 2008 a mechanism for setting base utility tariffs, as part of
the energy sector reforms which will help reduce fiscal risks.
Reform and Policy Agenda
7.
It is appropriate that Article IV discussions focused on consolidating macroeconomic
stability and enhancing the resilience of the economy to shocks. This focus is particularly
opportune at a time when food and oil price increases pose an additional policy challenge to
the authorities. Latest available evidence indicates that these price increases are starting to
exert noticeable inflationary pressures in Cape Verde. A continuously high level of oil prices
would likely have an adverse impact on growth, as confirmed by staff simulations, and the
country’s external position. The authorities took steps to identify appropriate policy response
and to assist the most vulnerable households in their efforts to cope with these price rises.
This assistance took the form of measures that include the reduction of import duties and
value-added tax exemptions on some cereals. They are also considering ways of increasing
agricultural output, notably through improvements in rural infrastructure. Going forward, it is
their expectation that the Fund and other international institutions will provide the necessary
assistance in support of their efforts to cope with the oil and food price shocks.
8.
Implementation of the authorities’ reform and policy agenda will continue to proceed
according to the stated objectives of the PSI program. In 2007, domestic debt was reduced by

73
9 percentage points of GDP, thereby prolonging the downward trend followed by this
fundamental since the beginning of the PSI program and reaching the program original
target, a net domestic-to-GDP ratio of 20 percent, two years ahead of schedule. With the
prudent budget and policies set for 2008, the authorities expect to further consolidate this
achievement.
9.
Monetary policy will continue to be geared at helping further accumulate reserves
with a view of supporting the exchange peg which remains appropriate. The targeted pace of
this accumulation will be about 0.1 month of prospective imports per year, setting the stage
for reaching over 4 months by 2013. The BCV intends to develop a system aimed at better
monitoring external flows, including non-resident deposits, standing ready to change interest
rates, if necessary, to prevent destabilizing capital flows.
10.
My Cape Verdean authorities are committed to further improvements in public
financial management. Notably, by November 2008, the authorities intend to develop, and
submit for consideration by the Council of Ministers, a simplified medium-term fiscal
framework which will be also put in the public domain. It is expected that this will pave the
way for the adoption of a medium-term framework and investment program that adequately
capture the authorities’ intention to augment investments in infrastructure and the energy
sector.
11.
As the authorities attach high importance to safeguarding debt sustainability while
pressing ahead with their investment program, improving debt management will also rank
high on the authorities’ agenda. This will require addressing existing capacity constraints
and, to this end, the authorities would appreciate benefiting from Fund technical assistance.
12.
In line with the authorities’ commitment to strengthen the supervisory and regulator
framework of the sector, the central bank, BCV, published in November 2007 a set of new
prudential requirements for capital ratios, provisioning and loan classification, credit risk
assessment, and credit concentration. Reflecting the health of the banking system, all resident
banks currently comply with the new requirements. Going forward, the authorities will
continue to closely monitor compliance with the new regulations.
13.
The approval of the new base utility tariff mechanism will help reduce fiscal
liabilities by allowing full recovery of the costs borne by the electricity and water company,
Electra. The recent adjustment of fuel prices illustrates the authorities’ determination to
follow through their previous commitment under the PSI to exclude energy subsidies from
the 2008 budget. As noted above, they intend to finalize and publish soon a streamlined and
transparent fuel pricing formula. In anticipation of increased recourse to public private
partnerships (PPPs) to finance planned large-scale investments, particularly in the energy
sector, the authorities envisage to strengthen the regulatory framework for such PPPs. They
are also attractive to greater involvement of the private sector in the management of the

74
electricity company. This would be along the lines of other steps they are taking to promote
private sector development, including business-friendly measures such as the reduction of the
time necessary for creating a business and streamlining of the tax system.
Conclusion
14.
Cape Verde’s outstanding achievements over recent years have helped lift its
population out of absolute poverty and strengthen the country’s policy credibility. The
authorities are hopeful that these achievements will be viewed by Cape Verde’s development
partners as a motive for stronger engagement rather than disengagement. In particular, it is
their wish that the country’s graduation from least-developed country status earlier this year
will not lead to a premature shortage of concessional financing. The authorities welcome
