crisis on Nigeria. Growth is strong and oil revenues

substantial challenges: the fiscal stance weakened sharply in 2010, inflation averaged some 14 percent,
and reserves fell steadily. National elections, expected in April 2011, are putting pressure on the
government to spend, while monetary policy has focused on supporting the exchange rate and keeping
interest rates low.
Focus: Discussions focused on the case for fiscal consolidation, the appropriate stance and
instruments of monetary policy, the desirability of establishing a strong oil revenue-based fiscal rule,
and the steps needed to resolve the banking crisis.
Policy Advice:

Fiscal consolidation—on the order of 6 to 7 percent of non-oil GDP—should commence with the
2011 budget, both to rebuild policy buffers and to support monetary policy in reducing inflation.

Monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation, while allowing for more flexibility in interest
rates and the exchange rate. The increases in policy rates in September and November are steps in
the right direction.

A strong oil revenue-based fiscal rule would insulate the economy from the volatility in oil
revenues. Addressing the legal and institutional weaknesses of the current stabilization
mechanism by establishing a sovereign wealth fund could help if appropriate safeguards are put in
place. Embedding an oil revenue rule in legislation would strengthen macroeconomic
management.

Bank resolution needs to be pursued quickly and transparently, with the emphasis on ensuring that
costs are fully covered. Macro-prudential supervision should be strengthened to enhance capacity
to contain future risks to the banking system.
Mission: The staff team conducted discussions in Abuja and Lagos during November 4-18, 2010. The
team comprised Messrs. Rogers (head), Hussain, Salinas (all AFR), Gregory (SPR), and Woo (FAD).
The team met with Finance Minister Aganga, CBN Governor Sanusi, Planning Minister Usman, senior
officials, bankers, and business community representatives. World Bank staff participated in the
discussions.

I. CONTEXT: RAPID GROWTH, HIGH INFLATION, LOW INTEREST RATES, AND DECLINING
RESERVES
1.
The Nigerian economy has weathered both the global economic recession and its
own domestic banking crisis reasonably well. The economy expanded more rapidly than
expected in 2009 and continued to gain strength in 2010.1 The amnesty extended to rebels in
the oil producing region led to a sharp recovery in oil production while non-oil GDP growth
has remained high. Real GDP grew by 7.5 percent in the first half of 2010 (H1/H1) and is
projected to have risen to 8½ percent for the year as a whole. Growth in the non-oil sector
has been moderating since 2007, but remained robust at 8.3 percent in the first half of 2010,
with many sectors growing at double digit rates (Figure 1 and Table 1). Strong growth and
targeted public expenditures have helped Nigeria make some progress towards achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (Table 6). Nonetheless, policy slippages emerged during the
last year: commitment to the oil revenue rule weakened, leading to a pro-cyclical fiscal
stance; inflation remained high (Figure 1); and foreign reserves fell even as oil prices have
rebounded (Table 2).
2.
Fiscal policy has become highly pro-cyclical. After rising by 10 percent in 2009,
consolidated government spending increased by 37 percent in 2010. This was due primarily
to a surge in recurrent spending at the federal level, including a significant wage increase for
the public service (Table 3). The overall consolidated fiscal deficit contracted somewhat
because of high oil revenues, but the non-oil primary deficit increased by 5 percentage points
to 32.2 percent of non-oil GDP. In contrast to Nigeria, most oil exporting countries are
running fiscal surpluses (Figure 2).
3.
The pro-cyclical fiscal stance reflects the lack of adherence to the oil revenue
rule. The current rule and the associated Excess Crude Account (ECA) were established in
2004 to manage revenue volatility and improve the conduct of fiscal policy across all levels
of government (see Appendix I). It had been effective until recently, with the pro-cyclicality
of public spending declining substantially during 2005-8 as surplus oil revenues were
sterilized in the ECA. However, in the absence of a sound legal foundation, the
implementation of the oil rule and savings in the ECA depended on the informal agreement
among various tiers of government, leading to ad hoc disbursements from the account. Thus,
despite world oil prices and domestic oil production well in excess of the budget benchmarks
in 2010, the government spent all current oil revenues and drew on savings in the ECA at a
time when stabilization called for a rebuilding of ECA balances.
4.
Monetary policy has been accommodative, with a focus on maintaining exchange
rate stability and low nominal interest rates. Inflation has been stuck in the low double

Real GDP growth in 2009 was 7 percent, compared with the projection of 2.9 percent made at the time of the
last Article IV discussion.

4
digits for the past two years (12.7 percent in November) and has become pervasive across
sectors (Figure 1). Nigeria may be experiencing the lingering effects of the rapid monetary
expansion of 2006-09, when broad money growth frequently exceeded 40 percent (Table 4).
Despite high inflation, the CBN reduced the rate on its standing deposit facility from 4
percent in 2009 to 1 percent early in 2010 (see Figure 3 and Appendix II). Consequently, real
short-term interest rates have been highly negative, contributing to pressure on prices and the
exchange rate. Rather than raise interest rates or let the exchange rate depreciate, the CBN
sold reserves, which declined steadily throughout 2010 by some 20 percent despite strong oil
revenues (Figure 4).2 The CBN raised the interest rate on its standing deposit facility to
3.25 percent in September and to 4.25 percent in November. Short-term market rates have
since increased, but remain negative in real terms and reserves continued to decline. With
double digit inflation and a stable nominal exchange rate, the real effective exchange rate
appreciated by some 10 percent between mid-2009 and September 2010 and conventional
measures now point to an over-valued exchange rate (Box 1).
Box 1. Assessment of the Real Exchange Rate Level for Nigeria
The assessment of Nigeria’s real exchange rate is based on the IMF’s CGER methodology, adapted for
Nigeria’s circumstances, using data as of September 2010. The staff assessment concludes that the real
exchange rate is now overvalued. One method that relates the value of the naira to its fundamental determinants
suggests that the naira was in line with its predicted value. However, two other methods point to an
overvaluation. The macroeconomic balance approach suggests an overvaluation of 14 percent, reflecting
projected current account surpluses that are below the Nigeria-specific norm. The external sustainability
approach, which compares the projected current account surplus with the level needed to stabilize net foreign
assets, indicates an overvaluation of some 15 percent. These results should be treated with caution, however,
given uncertainties about the estimated current account norm and balance of payments data limitations.

Nigeria’s exchange rate regime is classified as “other managed”. Nigeria is an Article XIV member. As
reported at the time of the last Article IV consultation, multiple prices are a technical characteristic of the
central bank’s Dutch auction system and can give rise to a multiple currency practices (MCP). Staff does not
recommend approval of this MCP. A comprehensive assessment by MCM and LEG is needed to identify the
extent of remaining restrictions and multiple currency practices. The authorities have committed to participate
in such an assessment.

5
5.
Nigeria’s external balance deteriorated in 2010 despite a favorable external
environment. The terms of trade improved by 13 percent, following a drop of some
22 percent the previous year. With oil production and oil prices up sharply, oil export values
jumped 25 percent. However, the current account surplus declined from 13 percent of GDP
to 6.6 percent as imports of (nonoil) goods and services surged by some 33 percent. The
capital and financial account—particularly foreign direct investment—also deteriorated as
investors wait on the outcome of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which remains under
consideration with the National Assembly.3 International reserves fell to about 6.6 months of
(next year) import cover by the end of the year. These developments are in sharp contrast to
the experience of other oil exporting countries, where current account positions improved on
average by 3 percentage points and international reserves are generally rising. Nigeria’s
external debt remains low, at about 2.2 percent of GDP, and the joint Bank-Fund debt
sustainability analysis (see Supplement) indicates that the risk of external debt stress is low.

II. POSITIVE GROWTH OUTLOOK AND BALANCED RISKS
6.
The growth outlook remains positive. The authorities are projecting real GDP
growth of 7 percent in 2011 and 7½ percent in the medium term, with an inflation target of
9 percent in 2011, falling to 8½ percent in the outer years. The authorities expect that oil
production will hold steady in 2011 at 2.36 mbpd and will gradually rise to 2.45 mbpd by
2013, which the staff believes is achievable. Staff shares the authorities’ outlook for growth
in 2011, but is less optimistic about the medium term. Non-oil GDP growth has been
declining steadily for the past three years. Agriculture is the dominant non-oil activity and
growth in the sector has not come from rising productivity, but from the expansion of area
under cultivation indefinitely; a process that cannot sustain high rates of economic growth.
On this basis, staff is projecting GDP growth to trend down to about 6¼ by 2013. The
authorities’ inflation target is achievable, subject to the adoption of appropriate
macroeconomic policies.
7.
Risks to the outlook tend to the downside in the short term, but are otherwise
generally balanced. With oil production nearly at capacity, there is a greater risk of lower
rather than high production levels being realized in the immediate future. The inflation risk
hinges crucially on the 2011 budget. The National Assembly could pass a more expansionary
budget for 2011 than was submitted, undermining the CBN’s ability to deliver on inflation.
Finally, speculation against the naira could become intense should reserves continue to fall,
forcing the hand of the CBN to react quickly, resulting in either excessively high interest

omissions exceed both. The Information Annex details the data quality issues, particularly large errors and
omissions that complicate any assessment of Nigeria’s external position.

rates or a sharp depreciation. On the upside, a shift in government spending towards capital
formation and planned reforms in the power sector could boost growth in non-oil sectors in
the medium term, and passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill could unlock additional
investments in the oil sector. Risks to world oil markets generally point to higher rather than
lower prices. Other risks, notably weather and political uncertainty, are broadly symmetric.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: REBUILDING BUFFERS AND RESTORING FINANCIAL STABILITY
8.
Discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix to sustain growth and reduce
inflation. Key issues included the need for fiscal consolidation (while addressing key
infrastructure bottlenecks), the appropriate monetary policy stance and framework, and the
completion of bank resolution. A highly expansionary fiscal stance and an accommodative
monetary policy are keeping inflation high and exerting pressure on the naira. In the near
term, balancing the need for expenditures on infrastructure and social programs with the need
to rebuild safety buffers and reduce inflation will be the main challenge for macroeconomic
policy.
A. Using Fiscal Policy to Rebuild Safety Buffers and Support Monetary Policy
9.
The authorities have proposed a sharp contraction of fiscal deficits at all levels of
government and a substantial rebuilding of safety buffers.4 The authorities’ fiscal
framework is based on a budget oil reference price of $65 dollars through 2013, which
implies a large reduction in real expenditures in 2011 and modest growth thereafter. The nonoil primary deficit (NOPD) of consolidated government would be on the order of
24.9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011, a contraction of some 7 percentage points, with nearly
two-thirds of the adjustment occurring at the federal level.5 While revenues are projected to
rise moderately in 2011, the adjustment comes mostly from a near 19 percent reduction in
real primary spending by the federal government, mostly on recurrent outlays, though capital
spending is also budgeted to decline in real terms. The NOPD would continue to contract in
the medium term, reaching 19 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013.

Based on ‘Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper for 2011-2013’, issued in
September 2010 by Budget Office of the Ministry of Finance, Nigeria.

5

The MTEF does not propose or project a consolidated government fiscal position, but only the budget
reference price for oil and the federal government budget. However, given the dependency on shared oil
revenues by the state and local governments, and their limited ability to borrow, the budget reference price
effectively contains state and local government spending and deficits. Using the authorities’ proposed spending
at the federal level, and staff revenue projections, staff project the consolidated government fiscal position.

7
10.
Savings of oil revenues would be substantial. Savings of surplus oil revenues
would amount to $11.8 billion (4.8 percent of GDP) in 2011 and a cumulative $40 billion
through 2013.6 Though the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from about
16 percent of GDP in 2010 to 22½ percent by 2013, its net financial position would improve
as balances in the proposed sovereign wealth fund would rise by a greater amount.
11.
The staff supports the proposed fiscal consolidation. This adjustment would
mitigate demand pressures and support the CBN in achieving the authorities’ inflation
objective. The expenditure cuts appear achievable. While the reduction in outlays compared
to 2010 is substantial, total real spending would still be some 8 percent higher than in 2009,
with cuts at the federal level coming from reductions in fuel subsidies, overhead costs, and
the absence of certain large one-off expenditures in 2010. Capital outlays at the federal level
are budgeted to fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011, from an already low 3.6 percent in 2010.7
However, the MTEF understates total expenditures and the likely size of the NOPD by
excluding expenditures on domestic infrastructure projects that might be undertaken by the
proposed sovereign wealth fund (section B below). Moreover, no provision is made for the
costs of bank resolution, which the authorities expect to be covered from an off-budget
sinking fund.8 Nonetheless, the NOPD of the consolidated government for 2011 and for the
outer years is within the range determined by staff’s own assessment of fiscal sustainability
(Appendix III).
12.
A further reallocation of resources from recurrent to capital projects would be
more supportive of long-term growth and poverty reduction. An Expenditure Review
Committee, with participation from government, academia, civil society and the private
sector has been established to suggest long-term savings on recurrent outlays to support fiscal
consolidation and release resources for capital projects. The authorities recognize that
insufficient implementation capacity—not the availability of financing—has been the major
constraint to increasing spending on infrastructure and they are working to increase the
capacity to implement capital projects.
13.
In the medium term, fiscal policy needs to be anchored by a strong oil-revenue
rule that helps build an appropriate safety buffer for a counter-cyclical policy stance at
all tiers of government. Staff recommended that the medium-term fiscal framework should

during the next three years.

estimates in compiling the consolidated expenditure accounts.

8
be built on a simple multi-year moving average oil-revenue rule that allows for a rebuilding
of an appropriate stabilization buffer over the next 2-3 years. It further recommended that the
rule be embedded in law to avoid ad hoc changes in the benchmark oil revenue during the
budget process that could undermine the working of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment
Authority (NSIA). While the authorities recognized the weaknesses in the current rule, there
are currently no plans to entrench an oil-revenue rule in the draft legislation establishing the
NSIA.
14.
Efforts are also underway to improve expenditure efficiency and strengthen
public financial management and non-oil revenues. For better cash management, a census
of government accounts has been completed. As a first step, capital accounts of all ministries
at the CBN are to be consolidated in 2011 and performance-based budgeting (PBB) is being
considered on a pilot basis in a few selected ministries/agencies. Once fully established, PBB
would help in assessing the effectiveness of public spending and facilitate the setting of
expenditure priorities. As part of this process, key performance indicators have been agreed
with spending units. An integrated financial management information system, which is at the
final stage of procurement, will be implemented in phases and will support both the Treasury
Single Account and PBB initiatives. The authorities also pointed to efforts that are underway
to strengthen non-oil revenue, including a tax audit of key revenue generating agencies, and
to establish a sovereign risk unit within the Ministry of Finance.
B. Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority
15.
The authorities are proposing a Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority—a
sovereign wealth fund—to replace the current oil savings mechanism. It will have three
separate components: a stabilization fund, a fund for future generations, and a domestic
infrastructure fund (Appendix 1). The proposed legislation (currently with the National
Assembly) would establish a Governing Council that would include representatives from
civil society organizations, academics, and other private sector representatives. The council
would advise the Board of Directors on broad objectives of the Authority. The proposed
legislation would also require an annual external audit and publication of an annual report.
A minimum of 20 percent of surplus oil revenues would be allocated to each of the three
components in any given year, with the remaining 40 percent allocated by the Board of
Directors among the three funds.9 The infrastructure fund would finance investments in
power generation, distribution and transmission, water and sewage treatment and delivery,
roads, port, rail and airport facilities and other infrastructure-related projects within Nigeria.
16.
The proposed NSIA would represent an improvement on some aspects of the
current oil savings mechanism, but it also has some weaknesses. Withdrawals from the
stabilization fund would be subject to approval of the Minister of Finance and could occur

9
only when actual hydro-carbon revenues fall below projected revenues. This would reduce, if
not eliminate, discretionary withdrawals from the stabilization fund, and abolish the current
80/20 rule. However, spending from the domestic infrastructure fund could undermine the
stabilization function of the NSIA, a point appreciated by the authorities and one that would
be taken into consideration when making investment decisions. Staff argued that the federal,
state and local government budgets remain the most appropriate vehicles for allocating public
resources to domestic infrastructure and that domestic investments by the NSIA could
undermine the budget process. However, the authorities stated that the NSIA would adhere to
the Santiago Principles and noted that the draft legislation requires that such investments by
the NSIA be consistent, to the extent possible, with budget investment programs. Staff
queried the appropriateness of building foreign assets for future generations while
simultaneously issuing debt to finance deficits, noting that the only way to accumulate net
financial assets for future generations was to run fiscal surpluses.
C. Clarifying the Objectives of Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
The CBN pursues an eclectic monetary policy with multiple objectives. Price
stability is one of these, but recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) statements also cite
exchange rate stability as a prime objective and in addition point to the importance of
maintaining low interest rates as a tool for promoting growth (Appendix II). CBN officials
recognize that there are trade-offs involved in pursuing these various goals, but rely on
judgment to balance competing objectives as economic developments unfold. They noted
that inflation in Nigeria was significantly influenced by structural factors (limited supply
response, non-competitive market structures), and hence was only weakly influenced by
monetary policy; that exchange rate stability played an important role in containing inflation
and inflationary expectations; and that the difficult (if now-easing) situation in the banking
sector had constrained monetary policy flexibility. These factors had favored an
accommodative monetary stance during 2010, coupled with intervention to support the
exchange rate. Reserve losses had been manageable, and had been significantly influenced by
a series of one-off transactions. Furthermore, while inflation remains above the government’s
target, it has been falling slowly for the past few months. That said, the CBN began to raise
policy interest rates in September 2010 (Figure 3), and official indicated that they would
consider further tightening in due course, if warranted.
18.
The staff argued that a commitment to a more specific inflation objective in the
range of 5-10 percent would help reduce and anchor inflation expectations. At the same
time, a more flexible approach to exchange rate management would prevent the emergence
of one-way bets against the naira. Quantitative monetary targeting, currently in place but not
adhered to, would help anchor expectations, but instability of money demand in recent years
suggests caution in sticking rigidly to such a framework. The proposed fiscal retrenchment in
2011 would undoubtedly help reduce inflation, but the CBN must stand ready to let nominal
interest rates adjust as needed to reduce inflation should the approved budget not deliver
sufficient or timely support. For the very near term, staff recommended that the CBN raise its

10
entire interest rate corridor if interbank rates were fall below the current MPR (6.25 percent)
and should stand ready to raise the corridor further should inflation and exchange rate
pressures persist. Looking forward, the staff supports the CBN’s previously stated plans to
move to an inflation-targeting regime after the necessary preparatory work has been
completed.
19.
The CBN has been concerned at the sharp slowdown in bank lending to the
private sector in 2010, along with the presence of (long-standing) high interest rate
spreads. Private credit has contracted slightly in real terms since the CBN intervened in ten
banks in August 2009 (Figure 5), due partly to increased emphasis on credit quality by the
banks but also to weaker demand for credit. In addition to keeping interest rates low to spur
private credit, the CBN has expanded the operations of its Development Finance Directorate
to provide direct loans (at below-market interest rates) and to guarantee loans to preferred
sectors and SMEs (Box 2). CBN credit to the private sector now amounts to about 3 percent
of GDP.10 The CBN sees such intervention as necessary to ensure credit is extended to
productive sectors at affordable (below-market) interest rates; absent such intervention, the
pattern of lending would be focused on large well-established customers and would entail
excessively high interest rates.
Box 2. CBN Development Finance Initiatives
Intervention Fund for Industry and Power: The CBN has created a N500 billion fund in 2009 to support credit
to the power (N300 billion) and SME manufacturing sector (N200 billion). In May 2010, it announced that part
of the N300 billion for the power facility would also be used to help restructure loans to Nigerian airlines.
Domestic financial institutions will channel these funds to the targeted sectors. The loans will carry a fixed
7 percent annual interest rate with 15 year maturity. These institutions will pay a 1 percent management fee to
the Bank of Industry for the funds, but bear all the credit risk. To access this facility, banks will need to provide
credible collateral. While the facility for SME manufacturing has been fully utilized, there is no disbursement
from the power sector facility. The CBN is considering 5 loan requests from the aviation industry.
Loan Guarantees for SMEs. In addition, the CBN announced a guarantee scheme (N 300 billion) for new loans
to SMEs from domestic banks and other financial institutions. These loans to SMEs will be provided at banks’
prime lending rate (about 4-5 percent less than the regular rate) and only SMEs with no non-performing existing
loans will qualify. The CBN and the creditor institution will split the risk on an 80/20 basis.
Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme. This N200 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) scheme was created in April
2009, and funds are being channeled through domestic banks to commercial agriculture producers. These loans
carry an interest rate not exceeding 9 percent with a maximum maturity of 7 years. So far, about half of the
amount earmarked under this facility has been utilized—mostly in 2010.

Based on the CBN’s September 2010 balance sheet.

11
20.
Staff argued that the slowdown in credit in the aftermath of a credit bubble is
not unexpected and that the CBN should be cautious about pushing for higher credit
growth at this time. Pursuing policies to expand credit in the near-term could create
additional inflationary pressures. The diversification of lending to SMEs, agriculture and
other under-served sectors should be addressed through targeted reforms, such as
strengthening the credit risk bureaus, improving collateral execution and bankruptcy
procedures including through expansion of commercial courts, and strengthening of the land
registry. These actions would also help reduce interest rate spreads, which could be reduced
further by reforms to reduce the cost of doing business in general. Staff also noted that the
special development initiatives of the CBN pose on and off-balance sheet risks and constitute
quasi-fiscal activities that should be undertaken, if at all, within the context of the federal
government budget.11
D. Completing Bank Resolution and Preserving Financial Stability
21.
In 2009, special examinations of all banks by the CBN revealed that 10 banks—
accounting for about a third of banking system assets—were either insolvent or
undercapitalized. The banking crisis had its origins in the forced consolidation of the sector
in 2005-06, which sought to reduce the number of banks while increasing their individual
size. However, the consolidation was not accompanied by sufficient supervision to verify that
the capital of merged institutions was adequate. In addition, this period of consolidation was
accompanied by a highly expansionary monetary policy, with the growth rate of credit to the
private sector peaking at over 140 percent per year in early 2008. Most of the expanded
credit was used to purchase equities, and in many cases in the stocks of domestic commercial
banks that were extending the credit. When the equity bubble burst, non-performing loans
(NPLs) of many banks began to mount rapidly; the ten troubled banks were particularly hit
hard because of their large exposure to equity-related loans.
22.
The quick and firm actions by the CBN in the second half of 2009 likely
prevented a systemic banking crisis. The CBN’s actions included: (i) liquidity injections of
N 620 billion (2.5 percent of 2009 GDP) to the troubled banks in the form of subordinated
debt; (ii) guarantees for all interbank transactions, foreign credit lines, and pension deposits;
(iii) replacing management in 8 of the intervened banks; and (iv) announcing a commitment
to protect depositors and creditors against losses. These quick actions stabilized the banking
system and gave the authorities the time to design a strategy for resolving the intervened
banks.12
11

Some of the loans are collateralized by government securities pledged by intermediary banks, mitigating the
risk to the CBN.
12

MCM is providing extensive technical assistance, including through resident advisors, in both the bank
resolution and banking supervision areas.

12
23.
The newly-established Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has
begun to purchase the NPLs at a price in excess of book values, with a view to restoring
the equity of the intervened banks to zero. The cost of cleaning up the balance sheets and
recapitalizing the 10 intervened banks is estimated by the authorities at about N 2.4 trillion
(7.5 percent of GDP). The authorities expect to cover the cost of bank recapitalization
through grants from the CBN, a levy on banking assets, and by selling NPLs at a premium as
asset prices rise. The initial recapitalization bonds are three-year, zero-coupon instruments
that will be replaced at maturity with longer-term coupon-bearing bonds. Once equity in the
insolvent banks is brought to zero, the banks would be sold to private investors who would
bring in additional capital sufficient to meet statutory requirements.
24.
Staff urged the authorities to incorporate the recapitalization costs into the
federal budget so adequate provision could be formally appropriated. Staff also advised
against using the CBN to finance what are essentially fiscal costs of recapitalization. Staff
pointed out that the funding plan could result in a financing shortfall and/or inadequate
capital for the troubled banks and therefore could undermine the success of the
recapitalization effort. In response, the authorities noted that the costs to be borne by the
CBN are small (less than 0.2 percent of GDP per year for a decade) and that their
assumptions regarding revaluation and recovery rates of assets were conservative, largely
eliminating the risk of any revenue shortfall and hence any need for budget resources. The
CBN plans to remove the guarantees on pension deposits, interbank lending, and foreign
credit lines in the middle of 2011, believing that these guarantees are no longer needed in the
context of restored confidence in the banking system.
25.
Substantial progress has been made in strengthening banking supervision since the
full extent of the banking crisis came to light. On-site examinations are under way for all
non-intervened banks. Lax enforcement was one of the key factors contributing to the
banking crisis, so it will be important to rigorously follow up with any corrective measures
that may be necessary. The CBN has already started implementing risk-based supervision on
a pilot basis, and full implementation will enhance the CBN’s capacity for early detection of
stress.
E. The Longer-Term Development Strategy
26.
The authorities have established a highly ambitious development agenda for the
next decade. The strategy (Vision 20:2020) aims for an average annual growth rate of
13½ percent over the next 10 years. This would be unprecedented and require a massive
increase in the economy-wide investment rate and far-reaching changes in the overall
business environment.13 While the authorities expect the bulk of the investment to come from
the private sector, the annual federal government investment needs contained in the first
13

The MTEF for 2011-13 does not incorporate these investment requirements. For this reason, they have also
been excluded from the DSA.

13
implementation plan amount to about 7 percent of GDP, equivalent to some 250 percent of
the expected capital spending in 2010. Staff cautioned that achieving such an increase in
public investment while adhering to a strong counter-cyclical fiscal stance would require a
major shift in outlays from recurrent to capital spending, substantial increases in non-oil
revenue, and a marked improvement in project implementation capacity.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Nigeria’s growth remains strong and its medium-term prospects are favorable.
Reforms initiated earlier this decade, which yielded large oil savings, helped mitigate the
impact of the global economic crisis. The economy is expected to grow above trend this year.
Continued rapid growth is projected over the medium term, based on robust (though
declining) growth in non-oil sectors. Social and poverty indicators are generally improving
and are expected to continue doing so if growth remains strong.
28.
The fiscal consolidation contained in the proposed 2011 budget and mediumterm expenditure framework is welcome. Fiscal policy in 2010 has been overly
expansionary and the fiscal adjustment envisaged in the 2011 budget would help to rebuild
safety buffers and provide much needed support to monetary policy. However, the needed
fiscal consolidation is large and could be difficult to achieve in an election year. If a looser
budget is passed by the National Assembly, monetary policy would need to be
correspondingly tighter to stem inflationary and exchange rate pressures.
29.
A strong transparent fiscal rule would help make counter-cyclical fiscal policy a
permanent feature of Nigeria’s public finances and put an end to the boom-bust cycles
caused by swings in oil prices. The government’s plan to tackle the difficult issue of
institutionalizing the oil stabilization fund through the NSIA is welcome, although the
proposed spending on domestic infrastructure projects risks undermining the Authority’s
stabilization function and duplicating or frustrating on-budget public investment. Channeling
such expenditures through government budgets in accordance with a transparent oil-revenue
rule embedded in legislation would strengthen the stabilization function of the NSIA.
30.
The government’s proposed measures to strengthen public finance management
and non-oil revenues are appropriate. Performance-based budgeting will help assess the
efficacy of spending and facilitate the prioritization of expenditures. This will be critical if
the authorities are to substantially raise public investment spending without undermining
service provision or macroeconomic stability. The proposed introduction of a single treasury
account system will help improve cash management and provide additional support to the
conduct of monetary policy. While oil receipts will continue to dominate revenues for the
coming years, efforts to improve non-oil revenue collections will strengthen the overall fiscal
position and reduce the vulnerability of public spending to volatile oil prices in the longer
term.

14
31.
Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks is critical for sustained high growth.
However, public investment spending should be executed at a pace that does not jeopardize
macroeconomic stability. In addition, while the infrastructure deficit in Nigeria is substantial,
an increase in public investment could be a source of considerable waste if adequate quality
control mechanisms are not put in place. The NSIA-sponsored investments in infrastructure
would need to be closely coordinated with the fiscal authorities to ensure that they are
consistent with budget-funded infrastructure projects and do not undermine the stabilization
function of the Authority.
32.
Continued inflationary pressures and the steady decline in international reserves
call for a tightening of monetary policy. The recent increases in policy rates by the CBN
are welcome, but additional increases will likely be needed if fiscal consolidation is not
sufficient or timely.
33.
Monetary policy needs a well-defined nominal anchor. The pursuit of multiple
objectives by the monetary authorities sends unclear signals regarding the future path of
prices, interest rates, and international reserves. Moving toward an inflation-targeting regime
in the medium term would be an effective way to lower and firmly anchor inflation
expectations. A more flexible exchange rate would help ensure that one-way bets against the
naira do not emerge, and provide an additional policy response to external shocks. The CBN
should unwind its special development finance initiatives and focus more on its core mandate
of ensuring price and financial sector stability.
34.
Recapitalization of the insolvent banks has begun and the authorities’ plan to
return these banks to private ownership is welcome. Ensuring adequate resources to cover
the costs of recapitalization will be important and the government should stand ready to
provide budgetary resources if necessary. Publishing AMCON’s operations and financial
results is important for promoting good governance and accountability.
35.
Continued progress in strengthening the financial supervision framework is
welcome. Full implementation of risk-based and consolidated supervision and stress testing
would help the CBN detect emerging problems in the banking sector. Regulatory forbearance
contributed to the emergence of Nigeria’s banking crisis, so strong enforcement measures
should be a key component of the supervision framework.
36.
The authorities’ long-term development strategy sets highly ambitious growth
and investment targets. The emphasis on private-sector led growth is appropriate, as is the
focus on spending more on public infrastructure. It is important, however, that the mediumterm expenditure framework continue to give priority to maintaining macroeconomic
stability.
37.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1

Large errors and omissions in the balance of payments suggest that the current account surplus is overestimated by a significant (but unknown)
amount.

2

If the costs of the bank recapitalization were incorporated in the budget, they would raise the NOPD by some 0.9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011,
with the relative impact diminishing over time.
Includes all components of the proposed sovereign wealth fund.
4
Includes $2.6 billion in 2009 on account of the SDR allocation.

If the costs of bank recapitalization were incorporated in the budget, they would raise the NOPD by some 0.9 percent of non-oil GPD
in 2011, with the relative impact diminishing over time.

Appendix I. Nigeria: Current Oil Stabilization Mechanism and
Key Features of the Proposed NSIA
Background: The constitution provides that all tiers of government–federal, state, and local share in oil revenues. All oil revenue inflows are received into the Federation Account. The
constitution provides that oil-producing states receive 13 percent upfront as derivation grants.
Of the remaining 87 percent, the federal government receives 52.7 percent, states 26.7 percent,
and local governments 20.6 percent. A key fiscal policy challenge in Nigeria has been
managing volatility of oil revenues in this complex federal fiscal system.
A. The Current Oil Revenue Stabilization Mechanism
Adoption of an oil-revenue based rule: An oil revenue fiscal rule was adopted in 2004. The
rule is based on an informal political agreement among various levels of government and is not
rooted in legislation. The agreement provided for allocation of benchmark oil revenues, which
are based on a budget benchmark oil price and projected oil production. The budget oil price is
politically agreed and approved by parliament. Any oil revenues in excess of the benchmark
level are transferred into the “Excess Crude Account (ECA)” at the central bank in the names
of the various tiers of government. A Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) was adopted by the
federal government in 2007—partly as an attempt to formalize the “voluntary” oil revenuebased fiscal rule. The view of many legal observers, however, is that the FRA cannot bind
other levels of government. In September 2007, a political agreement was reached under
which all states would pass fiscal responsibility legislation, but progress in promulgating
similar legislations is so far limited.
Early experience with the oil revenue rule: In early years, a conservative budget oil price
relative to world market prices was used, which produced significant fiscal surpluses and
sizable balances in the ECA (text figure). The ECA balances were used for debt buyback
operations with official creditors and debt relief (in 2005-06), which resulted in a sharp
substantial reduction in Nigeria’s external debt. Despite payments for debt buyback and the
financing of power projects, the ECA balances peaked at $20 billion in 2008. In the Nigerian
context, this simple fiscal rule based on budget oil price was easily understood by all
participants in the political process and achieved some traction in the media, which regularly
reports on the Federation Account Allocation Committee’s monthly meetings and changes in
the ECA balances.
Recent experience with the oil revenue rule: The sharp decline in oil prices starting in late
2008 tested the fiscal rule and the savings account for the first time. In addition, increased
unrest in the oil producing region the Niger Delta led to a decline in oil production.
Consequently, the authorities withdrew resources from the ECA to offset the shortfall in oil
revenue. However, a recovery in oil prices and in production (owing to an amnesty in Niger
Delta) during the second half of 2009 did not halt withdrawals from the ECA. The 80/20 rule,
whereby 80 percent of the excess revenues saved in the ECA in the previous year would be

33
disbursed regardless of movements in world oil prices, and other ad hoc withdrawals from the
account, have almost depleted the ECA and undermined its stabilization function.

Strengthening the legal and the institutional framework for managing the oil savings will
require addressing a number of key issues. First, the oil revenue-based fiscal rule needs to be
well-defined—for example a moving average of prices—and to be consistent with rebuilding
the buffers and macroeconomic stability objective. Second, the objective of the oil fund
(stabilization and/or savings), governance arrangements, and funding and withdrawal rules
should be robust and transparent. Third, all spending financed from the oil account/fund
should be integrated into fiscal strategies, budgets, and accounts. The authorities are working
to establish a sovereign wealth fund—Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA)—that
would address many of these issues.
B. Key Features of the Proposed NSIA
Institutional set up: The NSIA will be owned by all three tiers of the government and a
Governing Council of owners will supervise the Authority. In addition to representatives of all
owners, the Governing Council will also include members from academia, civil society and
youth organizations, and other private sector representatives. A professional Board of
Directors will oversee management of the NSIA.

34

Scope: The NSIA will comprise three funds: a stabilization fund (to offset shortfalls in
hydrocarbon revenues), an infrastructure fund (to develop infrastructure), and a saving fund
(for future generations). Each of these funds will be ring-fenced—there will be no crossfinancing from one fund to another.
Oil revenue-based rule: The draft legislation does not specify any oil revenue rule. The final
determination of the benchmark hydrocarbon revenue and the underlying oil-price benchmark
is left to the National Assembly. The surplus hydrocarbon revenue is defined as the realized
revenue less the benchmark revenue.
Funding: Initial funds equivalent to US$1 billion are to be transferred from the ECA.
Thereafter, in years with excess hydrocarbon revenue, each of the three funds will receive at
least 20 percent of the total excess amount disbursed into the NSIA and the Board will allocate
the remaining 40 percent among the three funds. In addition, the NSIA’s affiliates and
subsidiaries will be able to borrow (including in foreign currency).
Spending: The stabilization fund will be used to offset shortfalls in hydrocarbon revenues
from the benchmark levels, on a quarterly basis and ex post. The infrastructure fund will invest
in priority infrastructure and social projects. It will be able to make private equity investments
in reputable firms engaged in infrastructure activities, co-invest directly in infrastructure
projects, and participate in infrastructure funds with multiple outside investors. The spending
from the infrastructure fund will be guided by the Authority’s rolling five-year investment plan
and will initially focus on power generation and distribution, water services, and transport
networks (roads, ports, rail and airport facilities).
Transparency: The NSIA accounts will be audited annually by an internationally recognised
auditing firm. The NSIA will make its Annual Reports and quarterly financial reports
accessible to the public.

Appendix II: Nigerian Monetary Policy Regime
The CBN pursues multiple monetary policy objectives. The CBN pursues both price and
exchange rate stability without formally announcing an explicit target for either. In its
monetary policy statement for 2011/20, the CBN asserts that it “would strive to achieve the
government’s overall inflation objective” and sets out broad money growth targets for the two
years.1 At the same time, the communiqués of the Monetary Policy Committee site “exchange
rate stability” as a prime objective.2 While officially recorded capital flows are small, Nigeria
is regarded as having a fairly open capital account, rendering the simultaneous achievement of
these objectives difficult.3 In addition, the CBN keeps its policy rates low (currently negative
in real terms) to encourage banks to lend and provides direct loans and loan guarantees to
preferred sectors at below-market interest rates. In 2010, the CBN demonstrated a revealed
preference for exchange rate stability, as the exchange rate remained practically unchanged
while inflation was above the government’s target.
While the CBN does not announce an exchange rate target, for the past year its auction
rate has not deviated from the period average by more than 1 percent. This has effectively
stabilized the interbank exchange rate as well. This is achieved by the CBN’s meeting all
effective demand for foreign exchange at its semi-weekly auctions (the Wholesale Dutch
Auction System – or WDAS) at the preferred exchange rate. The effective demand for foreign
exchange presented to the CBN window is likely affected by policies to prevent speculation.
These include prohibiting commercial banks from reselling foreign exchange purchased from
the CBN in the interbank market, allowing purchases from the CBN only for the immediate
demand of dealers’ clients, and requiring the return of all foreign exchange purchased through
the auction but not sold to clients within 5 days.
Central components of monetary policy are the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and the
standing lending and deposit facilities. This is a fairly standard set of instruments used to
guide both the level and the volatility of short-term interest rates. The CBN rarely intervenes
in domestic money markets at the MPR, thus there is no market interest rate that tracks it. On
the other hand, the standing facilities do create an upper and lower band for the interest rate on
secured inter-bank lending. By raising, lowering, and narrowing the band, the CBN can affect
both the period average and intra-period volatility of the interbank rate. Thus, when the

government’s inflation targets were set at 10.1 percent for 2010 and 8.5 percent for 2011. The broad money
growth targets were set at 29 and 27 percent for the same two years, respectively.

averaged 2.0 percent. Since raising the corridor, the interbank rate has averaged 6.9 percent.
The Cash Reserve Ratio and the liquidity ratio are additional tools for managing
liquidity. The CRR has been reduced gradually over the years from 9.5 percent in 2004 to
1 percent in 2009. The LR was reduced from 40 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2009.

Appendix III: An Analysis of Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability in Nigeria1
1. Introduction
The appendix provides an estimate of a long-term fiscal sustainability benchmark for
Nigeria, using the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) approach. The management of fiscal
policy in Nigeria has been challenging because of the country’s heavy dependence on oil and
gas revenue that is uncertain, volatile and exhaustible. High volatility of oil revenue and
difficulties in forecasting future oil prices make budgetary planning and execution difficult.
The exhaustibility of oil raises complex issues of long-term fiscal sustainability and
intergenerational equity.
Under the PIH approach, the government spends the net oil wealth at a gradual pace that
ensures a constant share for each generation according to some welfare criteria – that is,
government consumption smoothing over time in line with expected permanent income from
oil reserves.2 This in turn can be translated into a sustainable path for the non-oil primary
deficit, providing an upper bound for the permissible government non-oil deficit over the
long term that can be funded from the use of oil revenue. It can be used to assess the
sustainability of present policies against the benchmark and to consider alternative policy
scenarios that are consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability.
2. Data and Assumptions
Forecasting future real oil and gas revenue requires projections for the oil and gas prices and
the volume of oil and gas production. As for the future oil production, Nigeria is reported to
have proven reserves of about 36.2 billion barrels (see BP Statistical Review of World
Energy, June 2008). The proven gas reserves are reported to be 33.3 billion barrels of oil
equivalent (Figure 1). Following scenarios are evaluated (Table 1):


In baseline I, oil prices are based on the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO)
projections for 2010-15 and the assumption that the (long-run) oil price will remain at
the 2015 level (US$79.53/barrel) indefinitely.



In baseline II, oil price projections are based on the WEO projections for 2010-15
and the long-run real oil price of US$122.81 per barrel in 2035 which is from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2010 (AEO).



Alternative scenarios: Two additional price paths, higher long-run oil price ($202
per barrel in 2035) and lower long-run oil price ($42.49 per barrel in 2035) from

38
AEO, are also considered. The gas price projections (baseline, higher price, and lower
price scenarios) are taken from AEO. Additionally, two alternative scenarios based on
reserves are explored.
The baseline long-run real interest rate is assumed to be 3 percent which is broadly in line
with the historical average yields of 10-year government bonds in industrial countries minus
inflation rate. Two alternative scenarios, higher (4 percent) and lower (2 percent) real longrun interest rates, are also considered. The oil tax take is kept constant at the 2006-08 average
level of 67.7 percent of total value of oil production, and the gas take is also kept constant at
the 2004-08 average of 6.74 percent of total gas production value.
3. Main Results and Issues for Consideration
Under the baseline assumptions, the permanently sustainable non-oil primary deficit
(PSNOPD) in Nigeria is estimated to be around 24-29 percent of non-oil GDP. See Table 1.
However, the PSNOPD estimate is sensitive to the underlying assumptions on prices and
parameters. Under the baseline parameters, the lower price scenario yields a PSNOPD of
13.6 percent of non-oil GDP, whereas the higher price scenario produces an estimate of
48.5 percent of non-oil GDP for PSNOPD. With 2 percent real interest rate and other
baseline parameters, the PSNOPD ranges from 10.7 to 38.9 percent of non-oil GDP under
various price scenarios. Nonetheless, the results suggest that under conservative (but not
pessimistic) assumptions on oil and gas prices (baseline scenarios I and II), the estimated
PSNOPD is around 24-29 percent of non-oil GDP, on average, for various alternative
parameters.
In general, the PIH provides some useful sustainability benchmark to guide fiscal policy over
the medium term. However, the design of a sustainability benchmark needs to take into
account the specific circumstances of the country. For example, the design of such a
benchmark will be dependent on the social welfare criteria, which in turn is dependent on the
country’s preferences and circumstances. The above analysis is implicitly based on the
constant distribution criteria under which the social objective is to maintain the purchasing
power of the oil wealth distributed every year, with the government spending a constant
amount in real terms. This will imply a declining annuity over the years as a share of non-oil
GDP as non-oil GDP grows. By 2013, for example, the above estimate of PSNOPD under the
baseline assumptions falls to a range of 19-23 percent of non-oil GDP.
Second, the analysis treats all the government spending as consumption, although spending
oil wealth on infrastructure and human capital could lead to higher non-oil GDP growth (and
a higher sustainable non-oil primary deficit). Thus, evaluating fiscal sustainability without
considering the potential positive effects on growth of government investment should be
viewed as providing a conservative benchmark.
Finally, there is substantial uncertainty over the oil and gas wealth estimates due to unknown
factors such as future oil and gas prices, reserves, production costs, extraction rates, and
interest rates. Thus, it is important to update the sustainability benchmark regularly to
incorporate new information, using conservative assumptions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
NIGERIA
Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis for 2010 Under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries1
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Sean Nolan and James Roaf (IMF)
And Jeffrey D. Lewis and Jan Walliser (IDA)
January 27, 2011
Based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Nigeria
remains at a low risk of debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the case of the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. For the customized stress test,
which simulates a persistent oil price shock, all indicators deteriorate when compared to the
baseline results, but remain within all of the country-specific thresholds relevant for Nigeria.
The central finding of the DSA, that Nigeria is at a low risk of debt distress, is the same as that
for the last DSA, published in November 2009. However, the findings from the customized
scenarios also show that, without significant compensating policy measures, a prolonged oil
price shock or deterioration in the current account balance could undermine the recent
progress made in achieving macroeconomic and debt sustainability. But given Nigeria’s
strong financial starting position, timely policy action should be able to avert future debt
sustainability problems. The assumptions used for this DSA are broadly similar to those used
in 2009, although with a higher oil price projected throughout the baseline forecast period.
The analysis is complicated by the large errors and omissions in the balance of payments for
Nigeria, and the DSA only applies to debt at the federal level.

Prepared by IMF and IDA staffs in collaboration with the Nigerian authorities. Debt data, sustainability issues,
and the new debt limit policy were discussed with the authorities in the course of the 2010 Article IV
consultation. This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint
Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, January 22, 2010 (available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 and http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40). The analysis
updates the 2009 DSA (IMF Country Report for Nigeria 09/315).

A.

Background

1.
The previous DSA for Nigeria was undertaken as part of the 2009 Article IV
consultation and published in November 2009. Following the final phase of Nigeria’s Paris
Club Agreement in 2006, which led to an $18 billion reduction in Nigeria’s external debt,
external public debt is projected to total US$4.8 billion, or 2.2 percent of GDP, at end-2010.
Approximately $4bn of that total external debt stock is multilateral debt, of which over
90 percent is owed to IDA. The breakdown for external debt by main creditor is as follows:

2.
One important limitation of this DSA is that it only applies to debt contracted at the
federal level. Data on sub-national borrowing is currently not available. While sub-national
borrowing is currently limited and tightly regulated, there is scope for state governments to
expand their exposure to domestic creditors. Public debt data analysis is also complicated by a
multiplicity of off-budget funds, and the lack of data to include debts contracted by public
enterprises.

3

B.

Macroeconomic Assumptions

3.

The assumptions underlying this DSA, covering the period 2010–30, are as follows:



Average GDP growth of 6 percent over the period 2010-30 (somewhat below the
average of 6.6 percent for 2007-2009), reflecting buoyant growth of non-oil GDP of
around 6.4 percent and more modest growth of oil and gas GDP of 3.4 percent (which
assumes a pick up relative to 2008-2009 as security-related disruptions ease, and a
gradual increase in the utilization of Nigeria’s extensive reserves of gas).



There will be a recovery in capital inflows, including in foreign direct investment to the
oil sector. The scale of which will be influenced by political developments and the
specific terms and features of the Petroleum Industry Bill, currently under
consideration in the National Assembly. In line with WEO projections, the analysis
assumes an oil price of US$76.2 per barrel in 2010, increasing to US$84.75 per barrel
by 2013, and then remaining constant in real terms thereafter.2



A consolidated government non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) averaging around
25 percent of non-oil GDP over the medium term and declining gradually thereafter.
This is broadly consistent with the medium-term projections outlined in the
government’s medium-term fiscal strategy. Such a stance would also be consistent with
preserving oil and gas wealth for future generations based on estimates derived from a
permanent income hypothesis exercise. In addition, it is assumed that the oil-pricebased fiscal rule continues to be applied, with a budget oil price assumed to be on
average $10 per barrel below the projected oil price.3



Following an annual decline in export growth in 2009 because of lower oil prices,
export growth resumes in 2010, returning to around 6 percent per year by 2016. The
acceleration in export growth is driven largely by developments in the oil and gas
sectors. Imports are also expected to have increased in 2010, reflecting a strongly
expansionary fiscal policy and the real appreciation of the Naira. The current account
balance continues to improve throughout the forecast period as strong non-oil imports
are more than offset by increasing oil and gas exports. This trend then reverses after
2023 as oil and gas production plateaus, while non-oil imports continue to grow in line
with non-oil GDP.

2

The DSA is based on WEO oil price projections as of October, 2010. The recent upward revision in the oil price
projections would have a more beneficial impact on debt sustainability.

3

The government is assumed to resist pressures to loosen the current fiscal policy stance and instead establishes a
medium- and long-term sustainable fiscal position.

4
4.
At the time of the last DSA, Nigeria’s external public debt was projected to total
$4.5 billion, or 2.2 percent of GDP, at end-2009, while domestic public debt was projected to
reach 12 percent of GDP at end-2009. In the event, external debt totaled 2.4 percent of GDP,
while domestic public debt was 13.3 percent of GDP. The assumptions made in the 2009 DSA
have proven broadly accurate, with a higher oil price and improved current account surplus
seen in 2009/10 than had been forecast at that time. However, the fiscal stance has weakened
substantially over what was envisaged at the time of the previous DSA, where a series of
disbursements from the Excess Crude Account at the central bank in 2009 and 2010 have
depleted the Account.
5.
The assessment makes the assumption that the Nigerian authorities issue a $500m
Eurobond, and draw on the $500 infrastructure loan that has been negotiated with the Chinese
authorities for which a memorandum of understanding has been extended through 2011. Both
of these disbursements are projected to take place in 2011. The analysis also assumes that, if
taken forward, the China loan would be on concessional terms.4
6.
It is important to note two issues with the external sector data for Nigeria that
complicate the debt sustainability analysis. First, there are large errors and omissions in the
presentation of the balance of payments, which may reflect an underestimation of current
account debit transactions, and which leads to the observed large residuals in the DSA
presentation. There is also a break in the balance of payments series between 2005 and 2006,
where the authorities’ data is used for the first time.
C.

External Sustainability5

Baseline
7.
In the baseline scenario (Table 3a and Figure 1), the nominal external debt burden is
projected to be broadly unchanged throughout the projection period. The present value (PV) of
external debt falls consistently throughout the projection period, and the PV of external debtto-GDP ratio also declines steadily, reaching 0.2 percent by 2030. The debt service to exports
and the debt service to revenue ratios also decline consistently throughout the projection
period. All debt and debt service indicators remain below their respective thresholds
throughout the projection period.

4

The authorities announced in December 2010 that the loan from China would be for 20 years with a 2.5 percent
interest rate.

5

The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external debt sustainability
which is guided by indicative, country-specific, debt burden thresholds based on the relative strength of a
country’s policies and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.44 (medium performer), which is the three year
average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant country-specific
thresholds are a PV of debt to GDP of 40 percent, a PV of debt to exports of 150 percent, and a debt service to
exports ratio of 20 percent.

5
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
8.
Standardized stress tests (Table 3b and Figure 1), even the most extreme, show that the
PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio is not likely to exceed 15 percent of GDP over the
projection period. Under the most extreme standardized stress test (i.e., the export shock), the
PV of debt-to-exports ratio reaches a peak of over 60 percent, far below its indicative debt
burden threshold of 150 percent.
9.
A country-specific alternative scenario was also examined. This scenario is designed to
illustrate the impact on the external accounts and the debt dynamics of a prolonged oil price
shock (in light of Nigeria’s high dependency on oil, as well as the high level of oil prices
projected over the medium term relative to a trend such as 10-year moving average price). The
impact of the oil price shock on the external accounts is calibrated as one standard deviation of
Brent crude prices over the 1970-2010 period. This reduces future oil prices by US$20 per
barrel. To reflect the likely policy response, changes were also made to government
expenditure projections, for example in 2012 this moved government expenditure from 28.6 of
GDP in the baseline to 26 percent of GDP in the alternative scenario. All indicators worsen as
a result of this second country-specific scenario but remain within the country-specific
thresholds relevant for Nigeria.
D.

Fiscal Sustainability

10.
The amount of domestic debt outstanding (as of September 2010) is about 13.2 percent
of GDP, and is projected to be 1.2 percent of GDP in 2030. The current maturity structure of
domestic debt is favorable, with the short-term debt only accounting for a quarter of total debt.
In the baseline scenario (Table 1 and Figure 2) consolidated government deposits continue to
accumulate at the central bank, reaching more than US$70 billion by 2030. The accumulation
in deposits will begin to slow beyond 2030 in line with the eventual decline in oil production.
In light of the accumulation of such significant levels of government deposits, and the low
level of gross debt,6 the fiscal debt sustainability exercise for Nigeria utilizes a concept of net
debt, defined as gross consolidated government debt (external and domestic) less gross
consolidated government assets (specifically, the balance in the ECA).7
11.
The standardized stress tests underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust to the
economic environment. In particular, debt may become very high if the primary balance is
unchanged from the 2010 level. Despite the ongoing recovery of oil revenue from the sharp
drop during the global financial crisis, the expansionary fiscal stance in 2010 is expected to
result in a sizeable primary deficit of 6.4 percent of GDP, compared to a projection of
2.7 percent of GDP in 2011 in the baseline scenario. With oil prices stabilizing and economic
6

The PV of the public sector’s gross debt burden would decline throughout with no further accumulation in gross
debt from 2017 when the overall balance swings to a surplus.

For illustrative purposes, Figure 1 also traces the evolution of gross debt in the baseline scenario.

growth continuing as assumed in the baseline, fiscal policy will need to adjust accordingly.
(Table 2 and Figure 2). To the extent that the staff’s fiscal policy assumptions under the
baseline scenarios, which assume significant fiscal improvements over the medium term, are
not materialized, the debt outlook will be negatively affected, although the resulting risk to the
debt sustainability assessment is still likely to be low.
E.

Conclusion

12.
Nigeria is at low risk of external debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust throughout the projection
period. Including domestic debt in the analysis would not significantly alter the debt outlook.
However, the findings from the customized scenarios also show that, without significant
compensating policy measures, a prolonged oil price shock or deterioration in the current
account balance could undermine the recent progress made in achieving macroeconomic and
debt sustainability. But given Nigeria’s strong financial starting position, timely policy action
should be able to avert future sustainability problems.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Large residuals through the forecast period arise due to large errors and omissions on the current account.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as ‘other managed arrangement’. The
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) intervenes periodically in the interbank market and sells
foreign exchange to banks and exchange bureaus through wholesale Dutch auctions (WDAS)
normally held twice a week. The CBN publishes information on the results of the auctions on
its web site; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not published.

3
Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange
rate between the naira and the dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The
CBN has not implemented this regime. The CBN sets monetary growth targets to guide
policy implementation, although these targets have not been effective in recent years.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that
expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed
on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of
financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation was concluded on October 16, 2009.

NIGERIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of December 31, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data deficiencies—in
particular a lack of high frequency data on economic activity, inadequate information on subnational public
finances, and large errors and omissions in the balance of payments—continue to hamper policy design and
monitoring. The Statistics Act passed in 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics as the main
coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements, including better information
sharing between data producing and collecting agencies. Nevertheless, a number of problems continue to
prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, in particular lack of good source data, and
insufficient computerization.
National accounts: Statistical methods used to derive production-based GDP have been improved through the
development of more comprehensive estimates for a number of individual industries, although a number of
statistical challenges remain. As reported in IMF Country Report No. 8/64, revisions to the national accounts
published in late-2007 led to some apparent discontinuities in the series for non-oil GDP, and in particular
agricultural output in 2002 and 2004, which complicates analysis of historical economic activity. Work is
ongoing to conduct a new agricultural census, which should lead to improvements in the measurement of
agricultural production—a key sector accounting for over half non-oil GDP—which is currently estimated on
the basis of outdated survey information. The reliance on the consumer price index to construct the constant
price GDP series leads to weaknesses. The introduction of additional indices, such as a producer price index,
would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price measure. The base year for the national accounts
(1990) is in urgent need of updating given the significant chances to the structure of the economy since then.
The compilation of GDP using the expenditure approach would facilitate analysis of savings-investment
balances. A lack of good quality high-frequency data on economic activity makes it difficult to assess current
and recent economic performance.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price data, is
available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to May 2003=100, and there are plans to use the
2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97 survey-based expenditure weights.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are opaque and complicated not only by the federal structure but
also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds. The most pressing shortcomings are related to inadequate data
coverage, particularly of the subnational governments which comprise almost one-half of total government
expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the subnational fiscal accounts which makes it
difficult for it to play a stabilizing role by targeting a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this issue
have been stymied by constitutional restrictions. To facilitate the timely preparation of a consolidated set of
fiscal accounts, governments at all levels need to use consistent budget classification, chart of accounts, and
accounting systems. There is also a need to formalize the publication of government accounts on a monthly or
quarterly basis and to report on the operations of parastatals.

10

Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation of monetary
statistics. Earlier problems with the CBN accounting framework and IT issues, which had contributed to
significant distortions in reported monetary data, have now been resolved. There is a need for a clearer measure
of commercial banks’ foreign assets and liabilities that captures both their on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
The definition of the other depository corporations (ODCs) sector should also be extended beyond commercial
banks to include all deposit-taking nonbank financial institutions, such as microfinance banks and primary
mortgage institutions.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including both core and
a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN. However, weaknesses in
transparency and disclosure practices among banks undermine the reliability of this data. [The requirements to
move to a common year-end reporting period by the end of 2009 and adopt IFRS accounting standard from the
beginning of 2010 will be key steps in enhancing the credibility of this information.]
Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s balance of
payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have expanded the range
and improved the quality of data sources used to compile the balance of payments statistics.
There are however still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which complicate the assessment
of external sustainability. It will be important, therefore, to further strengthen the measurement of the balance of
payments and the international investment position. There is a need for improved validation of transactions
reported by banks, measurement of transactions outside the banking system and the possible under invoicing of
imports, and verification of estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the banking sector (which are
difficult to reconcile with other sources, such as data from Bank of International Settlements reporting banks).
Nigeria has recently agreed to participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, which should
facilitate improvements in the measurement of the international investment position.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the Data Template
on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) should work to extend the coverage of their database to include private sector
liabilities and foreign investment in domestically issued debt securities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 17, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Nigeria
On February 11, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Nigeria has weathered the global economic recession and its own domestic banking crisis
reasonably well. Economic growth in the first half of 2010 remained above 7½ percent and is
expected to reach about 8½ percent for the whole year on the back of a recovery in oil
production and continued strong growth in other sectors. However, inflation has been stuck in
the low double digits for the past two years and foreign reserves have been falling as the
Central Bank of Nigeria has focused on maintaining exchange rate stability and low interest
rates.
The fiscal stimulus intensified in 2010, notwithstanding the already solid growth performance
and high inflation. After rising by 10 percent in 2009, consolidated public spending increased

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

by 37 percent in 2010. The non-oil primary deficit has increased by 5 percentage points to
32 percent of non-oil GDP. Despite world oil prices well in excess of the budget benchmark
price, the government spent all current oil revenues and drew on savings in the Excess
Crude Account, at a time when stabilization called for a rebuilding of buffers. Despite high
inflation, the CBN reduced the rate on its standing deposit facility. In response to pressure on
the currency, the CBN sold reserves rather than raise interest rates or let the exchange rate
depreciate. The CBN recently raised interest rates, but short-term real interest rates remain
negative.
The economic outlook remains positive and risks are generally balanced. Nigeria’s economy
is projected to grow by 7 percent in 2011, moderating gradually in subsequent years. Inflation
is projected to decline to 9 percent by the end of 2011. Near-term risks to growth mostly
relate to domestic factors. On the upside, a shift in government spending towards capital
formation and planned reforms in the power sector could boost growth, and passage of the
Petroleum Industry Bill could unlock additional investments in the oil sector. On the
downside, there is a greater risk of lower rather than higher oil production. The inflation risk
hinges crucially on the 2011 budget. The National Assembly could pass a more expansionary
budget for 2011 than was submitted, undermining the CBN’s ability to deliver on inflation.
Finally, speculation against the naira could become intense should reserves continue to fall.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Nigeria’s strong external position and low debt helped mitigate
the impact of the global financial crisis. However, a pro-cyclical fiscal stance and an
accommodative monetary policy have resulted in high inflation and a loss in international
reserves.
Directors supported the authorities’ planned fiscal consolidation to rebuild fiscal space and
contain price pressures. They welcomed efforts underway to strengthen nonoil revenues, as
well as the draft budget for 2011, which aims to reverse the expansion in real public spending
in 2010. Directors also saw the need for a strong oil-revenue rule to prevent policy procyclicality going forward. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish
sovereign wealth funds under the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) to shield
the budget from oil-revenue volatility and enhance the management of oil wealth. However,
noting that one of the NSIA funds would finance infrastructure projects, they encouraged the
authorities to channel such expenditures through the budget in order to safeguard the
stabilization function of the NSIA and the quality of public investment.
Directors considered the central bank’s recent increase in policy rates appropriate. Further
monetary tightening may be needed should inflation pressures continue. Directors took note
of the staff’s assessment of an overvaluation of the naira, and stressed that greater exchange
rate flexibility would prevent one-way bets in the foreign exchange market and cushion
external shocks.

3
Directors expressed concerns about potentially conflicting objectives of monetary policy and
advised that the policy framework should focus more clearly on price stability. They generally
agreed that moving gradually toward an inflation-targeting regime, once the necessary
institutional underpinnings are in place, would help anchor inflation expectations. Directors
generally supported scaling back the central bank’s development finance initiatives as soon
as feasible while protecting the central bank’s balance sheet and pursuing reforms to deepen
capital markets.
Directors commended the authorities for their actions to stabilize the financial sector. They
welcomed the establishment of an asset management corporation to clean up bank balance
sheets and encouraged the authorities to maintain full transparency in bank resolution.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

DOCUMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

Statement by Moeketsi. Majoro Executive Director for Nigeria
February 11, 2011

My Nigerian authorities are in agreement with the overall staff analysis particularly the recent
economic performance and the medium term outlook as well as the policy advice. They also support
the staff recommendation that the next Article IV consultation be carried out on the standard 12month cycle. My authorities note the various concerns raised in the report especially on the medium
term growth prospects, oil production capacity, infrastructural development, the lack of adherence to
the oil revenue rule, the eclectic monetary policy and the dwindling international reserves due to
fiscal expansion with potential downside risk to economic growth. They wish to assure the Executive
Board that adequate measures are already put in place to address them. I, therefore, wish to reemphasize my authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation; implementation of strong oil-revenue
based fiscal rule, more focused monetary and financial sector policies, quick resolution of the
banking crisis and strategic economic reforms.
Real Sector
The medium term growth would be achieved through increased focus on the agriculture. A key
element of this is the shift to higher value crops in addition to new lands under cultivation in order to
increase yield and productivity. Also, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Agricultural Credit
Scheme of N200 billion, and the massive investment in irrigation facilities and storage facilities,
including silos for storing surplus grains would further boost productivity in this sector.
The crude oil production expected in 2011 could be slightly less than the 2.36 million barrels per day
(mbpd) as reported by staff. However, recent estimates by the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) indicated that crude oil production capacity is between 2.71 and 3.0 mbpd. This
indicates that there is still a substantial margin to be exploited before reaching capacity.
To address the infrastructural needs of Nigeria, it is noteworthy that one of the many independent
power projects (IPPs) has been completed and has injected 250MW into the national grid while
quite a number of others are nearing completion and will soon feed the national grid. This would
significantly boost prospects for growth in the medium term.

2

Fiscal Consolidation
In the last two years, my authorities have played an active role in providing stimulus to the economy
as necessary. The surge in government spending, particularly in 2010, was occasioned by the
unanticipated expenditure on wage increase for civil servants, medical personnel, university lecturers,
etc. In realization of this, the Federal Government took proactive step to set up a special committee to
review the recurrent spending in the budget in September 2010. Additionally, my authorities are
optimistic that the Legislature would not pass a budget that is significantly expansionary.
In the medium term, my authorities intend to continue with direct spending on priority projects,
particularly in the area of critical infrastructure taking into consideration the need for fiscal
consolidation. The authorities’ fiscal consolidation has commenced with the 2011 budget. In this
regard, the fiscal consolidation efforts of the authorities are expected to reduce the budget deficit from
the envisaged 6.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.7 percent in 2013. This is very much in line with the
fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP provided for in the 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA). Although
the deficit is expected to be financed largely by borrowing, this does not pose any risk as the debtsustainability analysis conducted independently by my authorities and the joint Bank-Fund team
shows that the debt level will remain sustainable under a number of unfavorable economic scenarios in
the medium to long term.
The focus of fiscal policy will be to foster inclusive growth and job creation; optimize capital spending
by rationalizing recurrent expenditure and maximizing government’s revenues; accelerate the
implementation of reforms to enhance the quality and efficiency of public expenditure; and reinstate
greater prudence in the management of the nation’s financial resources.
Going forward, the overall fiscal strategy will seek to: (i) promote fiscal discipline and
diversification in revenue sources, (ii) outline fiscal policy which will work in consonance with
monetary policies to create an environment of macroeconomic stability, (iii) adhere to prudent limits
for expenditure to ensure relatively low fiscal deficits with little public sector borrowing and
sustainable levels of public debt; and (iv) create a framework within which public funds can be
allocated optimally.
On the revenue side, the authorities are fully committed to expand the revenue base and improve the
efficiency of revenue collection. Measures are already in place to accelerate the identification and
resolution of revenue leakages. These include the strengthening of pre-shipment inspection for crude
oil and gas; conducting audits of all revenue generating agencies and those required to remit
internally generated revenue to the treasury; and fast-tracking the implementation of key reforms by
the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Nigerian Customs Service.
Oil Revenue-Based Fiscal Rule
The authorities have resolved to adhere to a strong oil revenue-based fiscal rule, which is already
embedded in the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007. The rule allows the Minister of Finance to
modify the benchmark depending on utilization. The essence is to ensure that any excess accruals
provide an avenue to leverage other public private partnership funding partners to participate in any
identified investment program of government.

With regard to the infrastructural component of the proposed sovereign wealth fund, the model to be
used by the Federal Government within the Medium Term Fiscal Framework would involve the
private sector such that any additional expenditure would not impair macroeconomic stability. In this
regard, the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) and the Procurement Act enacted in 2007 would be
strictly adhered to by the Federal Government. Furthermore, once the Nigerian Sovereign Investment
Authority (NSIA) bill is passed, the three components of stabilization, infrastructure and savings for
future generation would be properly ring fenced with no cross funding from each other. Additionally,
the governance structure being proposed would ensure that the activities of the NSIA comply with the
highest standard of accountability and transparency. Moreover, in view of the joint ownership of the
proposed sovereign wealth fund by the three tiers of government, the investment activities of the NSIA
would be properly discussed and agreed.
To further protect government earnings against the volatilities in the oil market, my authorities
intend to adopt an oil price hedging strategy which will provide the option of transferring the risks
associated with downside movement in the oil price to a third party.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The primary objective of monetary policy in Nigeria is the maintenance of price stability. The CBN is
committed to lowering inflation which is essential for sustainable growth in the economy. After
periods of accommodative monetary policy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and domestic
banking crisis to address financial stability concerns, the recognition of inflationary pressures on the
system led to monetary tightening starting with the monetary policy decision of September 2010,
which raised Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 25 basis points from 6 to 6.25 percent. The recent
monetary policy committee meeting of January 25, 2011 further increased the MPR to 6.5 percent.
Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) was also raised by 100 basis points and Liquidity Raito (LR)
increased from 25 to 30 percent.
CBN remains committed to the goal of single digit inflation. However, since inflation in Nigeria is
significantly influenced by structural factors and not monetary policy alone, adopting inflation
targeting now will not be feasible. The focus is on addressing the structural impediments that influence
inflation in Nigeria, and once those are addressed, inflation targeting can be considered. Furthermore,
the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) made adjustments to the CPI calculation in which reduced
weights were assigned to local food production and higher weights assigned to other factors including
imports. This change will increase the impact of imports on the inflation.
Concerning exchange rate, the management of exchange rate volatility by the CBN is critical to
achieving price stability, being an import dependent economy. The speed and degree of exchange rate
pass-through in Nigeria is relatively high; therefore, the management of exchange rate volatility is
necessary to achieve price stability. In this regard, the CBN will only intervene in the foreign
exchange market to minimize speculative demand and smoothen market volatilities.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, pressure was put on reserves as foreign investors
divested in Nigeria to meet financial obligations at home. While the CBN stands committed to
meeting all legitimate foreign exchange demand, it is taking steps to curtail sources of leakages in
the system. For example, licenses to category “A” bureau de change were revoked and reserve

build-up has commenced, starting November 2010. In addition, CBN will soon commence foreign
exchange forward sales to reduce the pressure on spot demand and to cut down on speculative
demand.
Credit growth to the private sector after the banking crisis dried up as banks struggled to keep afloat.
The intervention by the Central Bank in the credit market is to achieve two broad objectives: to
encourage credit market to function properly and to increase access to finance to the private sector.
Following the Central Bank intervention in the banking sector, growth in credit to the private sector
slowed, affecting economic activities and access to credit for business and households. Many sectors,
firms, and households that depend on bank financing resorted to costly alternative avenues for
financing, as commercial banks scaled back their lending. Noting that the slowdown in credit growth
was constraining recovery in the short run, in addition to limiting prospects for longer-term growth,
the CBN intervened.
The intervention in the credit market was targeted at areas of the economy with the most spillover
effect on the rest of the economy, such as power, small businesses and agriculture. These are sectors
that have the potential to increase employment and contribute to long-run growth. Furthermore, the
consequences of not intervening would have been more costly to long-term growth as credit and
economic activities almost came to a standstill. While preliminary data indicates that the intervention
contributed positively to growth in economic activities, a full assessment of the impact of the
intervention on CBN balance sheet is currently being undertaken. In addition, the CBN is working on
other targeted reforms aimed at strengthening access to credit to the private sector.
The various monetary and financial sector policies adopted since 2009 have ensured a return of
financial system stability as the banking system no longer poses any systemic risk to the nation’s
economy. My authorities are fully committed to continue adjusting these policies where necessary, to
take care of any downside risks that may arise. Accordingly, ongoing reforms at creating commercial,
merchant and specialized banks that will enhance the funding of productive activities will be
vigorously pursued. My authorities are also committed to reforms in the capital market as an
alternative source of funding to the private sector.
Banking Crisis Resolution
My authorities are committed to quick resolution of the banking sector crisis. In the past two years,
the authorities through the CBN have carried out comprehensive reforms of the banking system. It is
expected that these reforms would be completed in 2011, given the critical role the banking sector
plays in achieving the economic growth objectives. One notable channel for the resolution is the
establishment of the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) in 2010 which has
successfully issued N1.03 trillion (US$ 10 billion) worth of consideration bonds to 21 banks in
exchange for non-performing loans (NPLs) and intends to absorb all the bad loans by end of March
and resolve the banking crisis by end-June 2011. The successful disposal of these risky assets will
leave the banks with cleaner balance sheets that will facilitate their access to credit markets for
raising capital and enable them to carry out their traditional role of financial intermediation.
Furthermore, the authorities will strengthen macro-prudential regulation and supervision and ensure
good governance in the banking system.

Structural Reforms
My authorities have shown their increasing commitment to far reaching structural reforms that will
reposition the economy on the path of sustainable growth. This year marks the commencement of the
implementation of the First National Implementation Plan (NIP) under the Vision 20:2020 economic
blueprint. One key area of considerable emphasis is public financial management (PFM).
In this regard, the implementation of wide-ranging PFM reforms to (i) improve the quality and
efficiency of spending; (ii) maximize, protect and diversify government revenues, and
(iii) instill greater fiscal prudence in the management of the nation’s financial resources have
commenced. A high-level Expenditure Review Committee has been established to work out practical
measures to rationalize recurrent expenditure without compromising the quality of service delivery
capacities. Furthermore, the Integrated Pay-roll and Personnel Information System has been
introduced in sixteen Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) which have so far saved
government over 12 billion naira (about USD80 million) in personnel cost. In 2011, the system will be
extended to the remaining MDAs.
While increasing the quantum of capital outlays is important, my authorities feel that enhancing the
quality and efficiency of public expenditure is more critical. As a result, they intend to engage global
project management firms to enhance capital project management and delivery. This will complement
the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative governance structure which has been introduced to
enhance transparency and accountability in the execution of capital projects. Also the deployment of
the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System and a revised chart of
accounts will facilitate the tracking of the tangible deliverables achieved by MDAs in terms of
measurable outputs and outcomes.
Conclusion
I would like to reiterate my authorities’ commitment to the design and implementation of good
macroeconomic policies. In this regard, the continuous dialogue with and assistance of the Fund is
highly appreciated.
