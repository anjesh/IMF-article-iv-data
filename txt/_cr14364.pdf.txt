STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE
STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES
Context: Sudan’s economy has yet to recover from the shock of South Sudan’s
secession three years ago, which took away three-quarters of oil production, half of its
fiscal revenues, and two-thirds of its international payments capacity. Despite progress
in implementing policies to address the resulting imbalances, inflation remains high and
growth sluggish. Macroeconomic adjustment has been complicated by structural
weaknesses, a heavy debt burden, U.S. sanctions, and volatile domestic and regional
political factors. The authorities embarked earlier this year on a stabilization program
supported by a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program runs through end-2014,
and the authorities have not yet decided if they want a new SMP; the mission for the
third SMP review in December will discuss the matter with them.
Developments, outlook, and risks. Economic performance this year has been mixed as
growth has remained subdued and inflation still high at about 40 percent. Growth is
expected to rebound in 2015, but the outlook remains uncertain. The risks are largely
tilted to the downside, although prospects of a successful national dialogue could lead
to resolution of domestic conflicts and improved international relations.
Article IV. Discussions focused on policies to secure macroeconomic stability,
strengthen social safety nets, and a move to sustainable and inclusive growth. Fiscal
consolidation (through revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization, including a
gradual phase-out of fuel subsidies) should continue, accompanied by increased public
investment and social spending. Tight monetary policy and lower central bank financing
of the government should help lower inflation. There is also a need for steps to lower
the large premium in the foreign exchange market. Stronger supervision is needed to
improve banks’ resilience. More should be done to improve the business climate to
boost growth.
Program performance: The program remains on track. The authorities continue to
minimize non-concessional borrowing and maintain satisfactory track record of
payments to the Fund. They recently devalued the official exchange rate by 3 percent to
help address external imbalances, which together with a large appreciation of the

SUDAN

parallel market rate, has helped lower the premium. Going forward, priority should be
given to further reducing inflation by continuing fiscal consolidation, tightening
monetary policy, and gradually closing the gap between the official and parallel
exchange rates.
Debt relief. Relief requires reaching out to creditors, normalizing relations with
international financial institutions, and continuing to establish a track record of
cooperation with the IMF on policies and payments. The authorities’ agreement with
South Sudan to extend the “zero option” by two years is a positive step.

SUDAN

INTRODUCTION
1.
Sudan is a fragile state weighed by a heavy debt burden and an unsettled domestic
and regional political environment. These problems, together with limited revenue mobilization,
have been constraining Sudan’s growth prospects and poverty reduction efforts. The economic and
financial situation worsened following the secession of South Sudan in 2011. The domestic conflicts
in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur states and the new conflict in South Sudan threaten
domestic and regional stability. U.S. sanctions, which were recently extended for an additional year,
are also creating uncertainties.
2.
Sudan’s external debt, most of which dates back to the 1970s, is unsustainable.
External debt, at the end of 2013, was estimated at US$45 billion (78 percent of GDP)—most of
which, including its debt to the IMF, is in arrears.1 The unresolved arrears, combined with
U.S. sanctions since 1997, rule out access to most sources of external financing, including
concessional borrowing.
3.
Sudan has had 14 Staff Monitored Programs (SMPs) since 1997. These programs
provided the authorities with comprehensive frameworks to design and implement policies and
reforms to address their economic challenges. They helped the authorities stabilize the economy
through tight fiscal and monetary policies and supported the modernization of tools to manage the
economy, including through reforms in monetary policy operations, tax policy, and public financial
management. These programs also facilitated the provision and sequencing of technical assistance
from the Fund and others.
4.
Sudan’s economy has yet to recover from the shock of South Sudan’s secession three
years ago. Sudan has been heavily dependent on oil since the late 1990s: the oil sector provided
sizeable budget revenues and a major share of the country’s foreign exchange receipts. The
secession of South Sudan in 2011 took away three-quarters of oil production, half of fiscal revenues,
and two-thirds of the international payments capacity. As a result, the economic situation
deteriorated significantly, resulting in the buildup of large economic imbalances.
5.
A first attempt was made in June 2012 to address the economic imbalances through a
package of corrective measures.2 Nevertheless, the outcome for 2012 was mixed while the reform
process was interrupted in 2013 with the adoption of a budget void of any significant reform
measures in support of the needed fiscal consolidation.
6.
In September 2013, the authorities embarked on a stabilization program the success of
which hinges significantly on improvements in the domestic and regional political

environments. The program’s objective is to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen social
safety nets, and lay the groundwork for sustainable growth. In parallel, the authorities expect that
the national dialogue in Sudan initiated earlier this year and the return of peace in South Sudan will
ensure the continuation of oil flows. The authorities consider their stabilization program supported
by the SMP a basis for a track record towards debt relief from international creditors, which is crucial
for sustaining growth and the adjustment process.
7.
The recent breakdown in relations with correspondent banks has complicated
international financial and trade transactions (Box 1). During the second quarter of 2014, most
foreign banks stopped transacting with Sudanese banks following the US$8.9 billion penalty levied
in June 2014 by the U.S. authorities on BNP-Paribas for violating the U.S. sanctions on doing
business with Sudan and other countries. As a result, the foreign exchange market tightened and the
parallel exchange rate weakened significantly.
Box 1. The Recent Breakdown in Correspondent Bank Relations
In recent months, Sudanese banks have experienced a breakdown in their correspondent
relations with foreign banks. This comes as a result of the prosecution by the U.S. of BNP
Paribas in early 2014 for breaking U.S. sanctions against Sudan and other countries. Foreign and
local entities based in Sudan are reporting difficulties and delays in processing foreign exchange
transfers to and from Sudan.
As a result, trade has been adversely affected, and the shortage of foreign exchange in
Sudan has worsened. Export receipts are being delayed. Importers are unable to obtain trade
financing (e.g., letters of credit) or transfer payments. Embassies, international organizations, and
other entities based in Sudan—who are all exempt from sanctions—are affected by foreign
correspondent banks’ refusal to process foreign exchange transactions. The June and September
payments to the IMF were received with long delays as a result of this situation.
If the breakdown in relations with correspondent banks continues, it is likely to have a
considerable negative impact on the economy: (i) growth will be affected because exports and
imports will decline. The lower imports of foodstuffs, intermediate goods, and raw materials will
result in lower domestic consumption and production; (ii) inflation will rise as a result of shrinkage
of supplies and higher cost of imports; and (iii) shortage of foreign exchange will contribute to
depreciation of the exchange rate on the parallel market, thereby fueling inflation and
undermining macroeconomic stability. These adverse developments will impact the poor and the
most vulnerable segments of the population, and will most likely increase poverty rates in Sudan.
1

In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions on doing business with Sudan and other
countries and was fined US$8.9 billion by the U.S. authorities.

8.
The political environment has improved somewhat with progress on the national
dialogue. In August 2014, the leaders of the Umma Party and the Sudan Revolutionary Forces (both
opposition) signed a declaration in Paris calling for, among other things, an end to the fighting in
the two border states and the adoption of democratic and peaceful principles to foster political
change. This was followed in early September 2014 by an agreement on the principles of the
National Dialogue in Addis Ababa between the Paris Declaration group, representatives of the
National Dialogue 7+7 Committee, which comprises seven each representatives from the opposition
and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), and the African Union High-Level Implementation
Panel (AUHIP). This agreement was followed by the release of some political prisoners.
9.
The armed conflict in South Sudan, which erupted in December 2013, persists. The
conflict has affected oil production there and forced many South Sudanese to seek refuge abroad.
Sudan has granted unrestricted access to its territory to refugees from South Sudan and has
received more than 100,000 of them so far. The UN relief agencies have been assisting the refugees.
10.
The authorities have started implementing an outreach strategy with South Sudan
under the auspices of the AUHIP to garner support for debt relief. Sudan and South Sudan,
together with the African Union (Tripartite Committee), developed an outreach strategy and an
action plan to help garner support for debt relief, which was supported by the June African Union
summit. In September, members of the Tripartite Committee held a briefing for key external
creditors in Khartoum to discuss the need for debt relief, which was followed by a briefing by the
Minister of Finance to the diplomatic community on Sudan's economic policy implementation and
the need for debt relief to support the implementation of poverty reduction policies. These briefings
were followed by meetings with the donor representatives in Washington during the Annual
Meetings. Furthermore, the two countries recently agreed to extend the “zero option” to
October 2016.3
11.
The authorities’ policies since the last Article IV consultation have be en broadly in line
with Fund recommendations. Notable achievements include improving revenue mobilization,
containing expenditure, and unifying the official exchange rates. However, monetary policy
management remains weak, including the central bank’s involvement in quasi-fiscal operations, and
the business environment still needs to improve.

3

Sudan and South Sudan in September 2012 reached the so-called “zero option” agreement whereby Sudan would
retain all the external liabilities after the secession of South Sudan, provided that the international community gave
firm commitments to the delivery of debt relief within two years. Absent such a commitment, Sudan’s external debt
would be apportioned with South Sudan based on a formula to be determined.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOKS, AND RISKS
12.
The secession of South Sudan had a significant impact on the Sudanese economy.
Between 2010 and 2012, annual oil production dropped from 168 million barrels to 38 million
barrels, budgetary oil revenues from 11.5 percent

To adjust to the new economic
situation, in 2011 the authorities developed a three-year emergency plan and implemented
some corrective measures in June 2012 and

mid-2013. However, there was civil unrest, including
the loss of life, in reaction to some of the reforms.
14.
Despite progress in implementing adjustment policies, economic performance through
end-2013 was mixed. Growth started to recover in 2013
Text Figure 3. Oil Exports, 2010-14

purchases by the central bank. The gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates
dropped to about 47 percent. Gross international reserves declined to US$1.6 billion—about
1.9 months of imports (Table 2).

15.
Macroeconomic performance has been improving gradually in 2014. Economic activity
has been recovering owing to a rebound in gold extraction and growing manufacturing, trade, and
services sectors. On the fiscal front, the budget deficit dropped to 0.4 percent of GDP (against
1.2 percent the previous year) by mid-year, curbing government recourse to central bank financing.
The current account deficit is also estimated to have narrowed to 2.7 percent of GDP in H1 2014
from 4.6 percent of GDP in H1 2013, following last September’s exchange rate devaluation and the
fiscal consolidation efforts. Inflation, which peaked at 47 percent in July, declined to 39 percent in
September thanks to a good agriculture harvest and the drop in the parallel market exchange rate.5
16.
The parallel market exchange rate premium has declined considerably (by
18 percentage points since August 2014). This

appreciation of the parallel market rate following

at 2.9 percent as gold extraction is expected to
be strong and agriculture to rebound owing to
favorable weather. Inflation is expected to
decelerate to 29 percent by year-end as the one-off effects of the September 2013 fuel price
increases dissipate, monetary policy is tightened, and food price declines owing to the expected
good harvest. The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 1.0 percent of GDP (0.2 percentage points
better than previously projected) on account of improved revenue collection and tight expenditure
control (Table 3). The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 6.5 percent of GDP on account
of continued fiscal consolidation.

18.
The outlook for 2015 has improved. An anticipated good agriculture harvest and
continued robust gold production are expected to strengthen economic growth to about
3½ percent. Continued tight monetary policy should help reduce inflation to 21 percent. The overall
5

In the second quarter of 2014, a series of exogenous events—the uncertainty associated with the conflict in South
Sudan, the breakdown of correspondent banking relations with international banks, and floods that reduced food
supply—and the injection of excess liquidity by the central bank through unsterilized gold purchases depreciated the
parallel exchange rate and increased inflation.
6
Sudan has two official exchange rates. First, there is the “indicative” rate set by the central bank. Second, there is an
“official” rate set by the central bank within ± 4 percent of the indicative exchange rate and applied to government
transactions. The difference between the “official” and the “indicative” rates is now less than 2 percent. Commercial
banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to set their rates ± 4 percent of the indicative exchange rate. In
practice, commercial banks trade at the upper part of that band.

fiscal deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged relative to 2014, thus limiting government
recourse to central bank financing. This, together with greater exchange rate flexibility, should help
contain the current account deficit to about 6 percent.
19.
Implementation of the authorities’ adjustment program should help restore
macroeconomic stability and improve growth prospects over the medium term. Driven by
agriculture, minerals, and oil, growth is expected to accelerate gradually to about 4.7 percent
in 2019. With prudent macroeconomic policies, inflation is expected to fall to single digits by 2017.
The external current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow toward sustainable levels
(Table 1). However, the external debt overhang and the large arrears, along with U.S. sanctions, will
continue to hinder access to external financing and weigh on growth prospects.
20.
Risks are largely tilted to the downside. Downside risks include the fragile domestic
security and political situation, regional tensions, and global risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix).
Public discontent with the costs of the economic reforms in the wake of the 2015 presidential
elections and a setback to the national dialogue could complicate the domestic political situation
and weaken the reform effort. The breakdown of correspondent bank relations, if sustained, could
weigh on trade, investment, and growth prospects. On the upside, a lasting peace agreement in
South Sudan would help the recovery of oil production there and result in higher transit revenues
for Sudan.
21.
In the event of a crisis in Sudan, spillovers would be mainly in the surrounding region.
Sudan’s integration with the region and the global economy has been stunted by sanctions and its
unsustainable debt position. Spillovers from a possible deterioration of economic conditions in
Sudan would mostly affect the immediate neighbors, especially South Sudan, which relies heavily on
oil pipelines and food supply routes in Sudan.

the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
22.
Recent efforts to stabilize the economy, following the large economic imbalances that
emerged after South Sudan seceded, are bearing fruit and need to continue despite the
difficult circumstances Sudan faces. The ongoing fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by
monetary policy tightening to help rein in inflation and stem depreciation pressures. Adjustment of
the official exchange rate to align it with market conditions should go a long way toward reducing
external imbalances and enhancing the economy’s resilience to real shocks. Structural reforms are
needed to help boost investment and growth over the medium term in the non-oil sectors, create
jobs, and reduce poverty.
23.
Mitigating the impact of the macroeconomic adjustment on the poor should remain a
priority. Sudan’s very high inflation rates have had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups
and the poor. Expanding social safety nets will go a long way to protect the poor and build broader
support for policies and reforms.
24.
In parallel, Sudan needs to continue efforts to secure progress toward debt relief by
reaching out to its major creditors. Debt relief would unlock access to foreign financing, which
would help support Sudan’s growth potential through infrastructure and social investment and FDI.

B. Restoring Macroeconomic Stability
25.
Discussions focused on policies and reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and
supporting broad-based growth. In particular, the emphasis was on:

12



Fiscal consolidation—through revenue mobilization and retrenchment of current spending,
including a gradual phase-out of fuel subsidies—should continue, accompanied by
increased public investment and social spending.



Tightening monetary policy and further lowering central bank financing of the government
to help further lower inflation.



Greater flexibility of the official exchange rate to reduce the parallel market rate premium,
improve the availability of foreign exchange, enhance competitiveness, and help build
reserves.



Strengthening bank supervision to enhance banking penetration and improve banks’
competitiveness and resilience.



Improving the business climate to bolster private sector-led growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Pursuing Fiscal Consolidation
26.
The authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan is advancing but continued efforts are
needed to achieve the goal. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is targeted to decline by
1.4 percentage points of GDP to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2014. This will help limit the overall fiscal
deficit to 1 percent of GDP, down from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013. As a result, central bank
financing of the fiscal deficit is expected to drop to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014, from 0.7 percent of
GDP last year (Tables 4, 5, and 6). These objectives are supported by:


Enhanced revenue mobilization. Under their economic program, the authorities aim at
raising total revenue to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (against 9.2 percent of GDP the
previous year) reflecting the full-year effect of the reform measures taken in
September 2013, including substantial increases in domestic fuel prices; these are estimated
to yield additional revenue of about 1.2 percent of GDP. The authorities also plan additional
measures, although their impact will be felt in 2015 and beyond, to reduce tax exemptions,
reform the taxation of gold-related activities, and improve tax administration. In this context,
a tax and customs reform committee established in March began reviewing tax exemptions
and the application of the VAT, and, more broadly, to improve tax policies and practices.
Recommendations are expected to be reflected in the 2015 budget;



Streamlined expenditure. Current spending is projected to be limited to 11 percent of
GDP, mainly by containing the wage bill and subsidy increases, while public investment and
social spending are each expected to increase by 0.3 percentage points of GDP to mitigate
the negative impact of ongoing subsidy reforms on the most vulnerable. Staff underscored
the importance of continued streamlining of nonpriority spending and containing the wage
bill to curb inflation.

27.
Rationalizing fuel subsidies remains key to achieving medium-term fiscal
sustainability, along with strengthening social safety nets (Box 2). In the first half of 2014, fuel
subsidies amounted to 1 percent of GDP due to an unusually warm weather that led to increased
fuel consumption, and are expected to reach close to 2 percent of GDP by end-year. In March 2014,
Fund technical assistance recommended further steps to reduce fuel subsidies, including the
adoption of a flexible fuel pricing mechanism, while improving social safety nets with better
targeting of social assistance to the most vulnerable, and systematic monitoring and evaluation of
the social safety net system.

Box 2. Fuel Subsidies Reform
Sudan can no longer afford to maintain large fuel subsidies. Before the secession of South Sudan, fiscal revenues from the oil
sector financed direct and indirect subsidies to fuel prices. The secession resulted in the loss of about 60 percent of those
revenues. Rising international oil prices has also put upward pressure on subsidies.
Fuel subsidies in Sudan are costly, regressive, and
inefficient. Direct subsidies amounted to about 2 percent
of GDP in 2013, despite a 162 percent average-weighted
increase in the prices of fuel since June 2012. (Box 2
Figure 1) The total fiscal cost is more than twice as high
when tax exemptions and special tax rates for fuel
products are included. The poorest quintile of the
population received only 3 percent of the total subsidy
in 2011 (Box 2 Figure 2). Subsidies provide an inefficient
social protection and crowd out high-priority public
expenditure. Also, relatively low fuel prices in Sudan could
encourage smuggling of fuel to neighboring countries
and promote overconsumption of energy (Box 2 Figure 3).

The authorities have used part of the fiscal space created by reduced subsidies to bolster social safety nets
(SSNs). They reinforced the Social Initiative Program, including the Cash Transfer Program (CTP), health insurance for the
poorest, microfinance, rural women’s empowerment program, and others (Box 2 Table). Considering the bottom three income
quintiles in Sudan received only 26 percent of total fuel subsidies in 2011 or 0.3 percent of GDP, cash compensation for the
income loss of poor population could be
achieved at a cost of less than 1 percent of
GDP a year.
Removing fuel subsidies is a part of a broad
reform strategy. The authorities plan to
gradually phase out fuel subsidies by 2019,
including by adopting a flexible pricing
mechanism. This should be accompanied by a
communication campaign that highlights the
cost and inequity of current subsidies. The authorities should also review the current SSN programs and develop, with assistance
from the World Bank and other donors, a comprehensive medium- to long-term social protection strategy.

28.
Looking ahead, continued fiscal consolidation is vital to securing macroeconomic
stability and fiscal sustainability. Accordingly, staff recommended a zero primary fiscal balance
in 2015, about the same level as in 2014, but rising to a primary fiscal surplus of about 1 percent of
GDP by 2019 to put the ratio of the domestic public debt to GDP on a declining path (Table 7). This
will require reducing the non-oil primary deficit by mobilizing more revenue while ensuring the
fairness of the tax system and shifting government expenditure towards social and investment
spending.
29.
Strengthening public financial management is necessary to strengthen budget
planning, execution, and monitoring. Reforms will need to be centered on the development of a
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) to enhance macroeconomic management and facilitate the
implementation of poverty reduction policies. Other key reforms include implementing the Treasury
Single Account and effective budgetary controls, linked to a credible cash plan, to prevent arrears,
and improving the public accounting system. These should be supplemented by improving withinyear budget reporting and transparency, including by publishing quarterly revenue and spending
data.
30.
The authorities would benefit from continued Fund technical assistance. This will help
the authorities improve gold taxation, streamline tax incentives, and enhance the efficiency of the
tax system over the medium term. Technical assistance will also continue bolstering public financial
management, including by helping complete the banking infrastructure that will support the transfer
of funds to the Treasury Single Account and prepare an MTFF.

Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation is critical for restoring macroeconomic
stability. They reiterated their commitment to their fiscal program for 2014 and to continued fiscal
consolidation over the medium term. The authorities expect that the ongoing tax and customs
reforms will help mobilize additional revenue, and confirmed their intention to phase out fuel
subsidies over the next five years. At the same time, the authorities committed to strengthening
social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population to avoid the recurrence
of the social discontent and violence that followed the September 2013 fuel price increase. They will
continue to enhance their PFM reforms, including the MTFF. The authorities welcomed continued
Fund technical assistance. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed in principle to continued fiscal
consolidation in 2015, as recommended by staff, but they were not yet ready to discuss a fullfledged budget and supporting measures with the staff. Such a discussion will take place during the
forthcoming mission for the third review under the SMP.

Improving Monetary Policy Credibility
32.
Monetary policy should be geared to reducing inflation. Despite improvement in the
government’s fiscal position, unsterilized gold purchases by the central bank led to faster reserve
money growth than targeted by mid-2014. To help reduce inflation, the central bank should mop up
the large excess reserves, reduce unsterilized gold purchases, and refrain from using the parallel

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SUDAN

exchange rate for these purchases. Staff encouraged the central bank to continue using reserve
money as nominal anchor—instead of the official exchange rate—given that most private sector
foreign exchange transactions are conducted at the parallel market rate.
33.
Bringing inflation under control will require greater de facto central bank
independence. The monetary policy framework has been hampered by fiscal dominance since the
secession of South Sudan. The fiscal consolidation path initiated this year has led to an improvement
in fiscal performance and a corresponding reduction in central bank financing, which has reduced
reserve money growth. In order to enhance monetary policy credibility, staff encouraged the
authorities to enhance the operational independence of the central bank and to mandate it to
maintain price stability. In this regard, the central bank should continue to gradually reduce its
monetization of the budget deficit, and cease quasi-fiscal operations, such as the provision of
foreign exchange at the official rate to the government for fuel and wheat imports.7 Staff also
encouraged the central bank to develop a communication strategy to improve transparency and
help anchor inflation expectations.
34.
The institutional framework of monetary policy management should be strengthened.
Enhanced coordination between the central bank and the ministry of finance would improve
liquidity forecasts and management. The recently established interbank money market, once fully
operational, will improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and banks’ liquidity management and
may help dampen inflationary pressures in the future;8 nevertheless, its success will first hinge on the
central bank ability to reduce excess reserves in the system. To address excess liquidity, a 20 percent
cap on banks’ holdings of government and central bank securities should be relaxed.

Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities agreed that tightening monetary policy should help reduce inflation.
They are committed to limiting central bank financing of the budget to the level agreed under the
program, reducing unsterilized gold purchases by the central bank to contain reserve money
growth, and continue using reserve money as the nominal anchor. The authorities are considering
relaxing the cap on banks’ holdings of government and central bank securities, but are concerned
that such a measure may crowd out private sector credit. They noted that the provision of foreign
exchange at the official rate for fuel and wheat imports was temporary and is aimed at avoiding
social discontent. They requested Fund technical assistance on improving foreign exchange
management.

7

The cost of quasi-fiscal activities, including the purchase of gold at the parallel market exchange rate and the sale of
foreign exchange at the official market rate to finance fuel and wheat imports, amounted to 0.7 percent of GDP
during the first half of 2014.
8

To promote interbank activities and reduce banks’ excess reserves, the authorities recently established a “liquidity
management fund” to encourage interbank activities. Banks are required to contribute a total of SDG 750 million in
proportion to the size of their deposits, of which 60 percent is in the form of government securities and the
remainder in cash. Banks can borrow overnight from this fund with a 0.1 percent fee, to cover liquidity shortages.

Enhancing Exchange Rate Flexibility
36.
Sudan faces large and unsustainable external imbalances. Staff’s external stability
assessment points to significant overvaluation of the currency and problems with external
competitiveness (Annex 1). This conclusion is also supported by the wide gap between the official
and parallel market exchange rates, which was 65 percent in the third quarter of 2014, before
narrowing to 47 percent in mid-November. Despite two step devaluations in 2012 and 2013, high
inflation has fully eroded the initial real depreciation of the exchange rate.
37.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is essential to reducing external imbalances,
enhancing competitiveness, and building up international reserves. Given the shortage of
foreign exchange on the official market, the parallel market has nearly completely replaced the
official market as a source of foreign exchange for private transactions. Staff urged the authorities to
rapidly adjust the official exchange rate in order to reduce the overvaluation of the currency. Closing
the gap would remove an implicit tax on exports, rationalize imports, and reduce quasi-fiscal costs.
Staff stressed that with continued fiscal consolidation and tight monetary policy stance, and given
that most of the economy already operates at the parallel market rate, devaluation of the official
rate is unlikely to result in higher inflation.
Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to gradually close the gap between the
official and parallel market rates, but are reluctant to provide a specific timeframe. They
expressed readiness to make gradual monthly adjustments to the official exchange rate. This,
together with an expected appreciation of the parallel exchange rate driven by robust agriculture
exports and increased foreign exchange receipts from oil transit fees later in the year, would help
close the gap and reduce quasi-fiscal losses. In their view, the official rate is a strong determinant of
the parallel market rate, and they fear that any rapid change in the former would only impact the
latter without closing the gap, as had happened in the past two years.
Financial sector policies
39.
The financial system in Sudan is dominated by the banking sector and operates under
Islamic principles. At end-2013, there were 37 banks, including two established during the year,
which accounted for 90 percent of the financial sector assets. Monetization and financial
intermediation are low, with broad money at only 21 percent of GDP and credit to the private sector
at a low 10.4 percent of GDP at end-2013. Inter-bank transactions are limited, although there is an
informal inter-bank market, Qard Al Hassan, whereby banks lend to each other without charging
any fees.

Banking sector soundness indicators remain positive. The capital adequacy ratio
exceeded the required 12 percent at end-2013 (Table 8). Although there were modest declines
recently in the ratios of liquid assets to total assets and liquid assets to short-term liabilities, banks’
liquidity remains comfortable. The ratio of NPL declined from 7.6 percent at end-2011 to 4.0 percent
in September 2014.
41.
The CBOS has taken several measures to improve the performance of the banking
sector. It started implementing best practices in banking supervision, which included the CBOS
divesting from some public banks, and improving and upgrading the regulatory and institutional
framework. The authorities have also taken a number of actions to broaden access to banking
services, which included simplifying the procedures for opening bank accounts, encouraging banks
to open new branches and setting up a credit registry system. As a result, since end-2013, 32 new
bank branches were opened, and 37 new ATMs and about 200 cash points located in supermarkets
were installed. In addition, the CBOS is preparing to introduce mobile banking.
42.
The authorities are continuing to upgrade the AML-CFT framework. Following the
passage of the amended AML-CFT law in June, the CBOS established, with IMF technical assistance,
an upgraded AML/CFT circular to enhance preventive measures requirements for the financial
institutions under its supervision. A robust supervisory framework would enhance the effectiveness
of the AML/CFT regime and further actions are required to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s
monitoring process.
43.
Stronger bank supervision and privatization are needed to improve banks’
competitiveness and resilience. Key recommendations include: (i) continuing the implementing of
best practices in bank supervision, inspection, and enforcement; (ii) the CBOS to divest its remaining
interests in commercial banks; and (iii) the completion of the restructuring plan for Omdurman bank
is also important.

Authorities’ views
44.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s assessment of the financial sector. They
acknowledged that further efforts are needed to bring bank supervision in line with best practices.
They welcomed technical assistance from the Fund to this end. The authorities also pointed to

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

progress on the banking sector review, which is being finalized. They intend to gradually privatize
their share-capital in banks and have requested Fund assistance in this effort.

C. Policies to Support Inclusive Growth and Reduce Unemployment
45.
Improving the business climate is essential for achieving high and sustained growth.
Sudan’s business climate, as measured by the 2014 World Bank Doing Business survey, is ranked 149
among 189 countries—in the lowest quartile of all surveyed countries as in previous years.9 Key
weaknesses include difficulties in obtaining licenses, accessing credit, and trading across borders.10
Addressing these weaknesses, fighting corruption including by mobilizing AML measures, and
strengthening the judiciary would help improve the business climate.
46.
Increased investment in human and physical capital is needed to help boost growth
and make it broad-based. Sudan lags in the areas of human development and public sector
capacity, as evidenced by the UNDP’s 2012 Human Development Index (Sudan ranked 171 out of
186 countries) and the World Bank’s 2012 Country and Policy Institutional Assessment (Sudan is
classified as a weak performer). Addressing these weaknesses requires improving the prioritization
of public expenditure with increased allocations to the education and health sectors. Improving
infrastructure—electricity, roads, and railways—and strengthening regional connectivity are also
critical for improving productivity and access to markets, and for lowering transportation costs.
47.
Unemployment is a persistent problem, especially for women and the youths. In 2012,
the unemployment rate was estimated by the World Bank at 14.8 percent of the labor force
(20 percent for women and 24 percent for the youth), with little change since 1991. Labor
participation was estimated at about 54 percent (76 percent for men and 32 percent for women). To
reduce unemployment, investment in skill-formation activities for the unemployed is important.
Providing equal opportunities to women in these activities could significantly boost labor
participation and economic growth. Reforms in the agriculture sector, which supports nearly
70 percent of the population, will also help in employment generation (Annex 2).

Protecting the Most Vulnerable
48.
Improving the efficiency of the social safety net is critical to protecting the most
vulnerable. Sudan’s social indicators compare unfavorably with regional comparators. Phasing out
fuel subsidies should be accompanied by measures that shield the poorest and help middle-income
groups to adjust11. The authorities intend to increase the number of beneficiaries of the cash transfer
9

These indicators should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of respondents, limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumption on business constraints and information availability.
10

U.S. sanctions against Sudan also generate additional costs and difficulties for international trade and foreign
direct investment.
11

The WB is currently providing technical assistance to Sudan to improve the targeting, payments and monitoring
mechanisms of the social safety net.

program to 500,000 families in 2014 (410,000 as of September 2014),12 complemented by private
programs such as the Zakat Fund,13 which benefits 4.5 million households.
49.
Work is underway to prepare a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with
donor support. The project structure is in place and a household budget survey will be completed
by March 2015 to serve as a base on which to develop the poverty reduction strategy. The
authorities will use a broad and inclusive consultation process to prepare the PRSP. In the meantime,
the authorities are implementing policies identified in the I-PRSP.

Authorities’ views
50.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of advancing pro-poor policies.
They are committed to providing assistance for the neediest as evidenced by the implementation of
the I-PRSP, their social commitments under the SMP, and the policy initiatives aimed at shielding the
poor and vulnerable from the costs of the reforms. Nevertheless, the authorities noted that their
efforts are constrained by the limited resources and expressed hope that fast-track progress on debt
relief would unlock concessional resources that would boost pro-poor programs.

D. External debt
Debt sustainability analysis
51.
Sudan continues to be in debt distress. Both public and external debt ratios remain at
high levels (91 percent and 79 percent of GDP, respectively), and most of the external debt is in
arrears. In line with the results of past Debt Sustainability Analyses (DSAs), Sudan’s debt is
unsustainable. All external debt indicators breach their indicative thresholds under the baseline
scenario, and many of those remain above the thresholds throughout the 20-year projection period.
It is therefore critical for Sudan to follow sound economic policies, continue garnering support for
debt relief, avoid selective debt servicing, and minimize non-concessional borrowing. As of endJune 2014, nonconcessional external borrowing for development projects was limited to
US$147 million, with an average grant element of 26 percent.14 There was no additional
nonconcessional external borrowing between June and September 2013. Staff noted that any new
borrowing would eventually need to be treated as part of any comprehensive debt relief workout to
restore external debt sustainability.

12

The total budgeted amount for social spending in 2014 more than doubled compared to 2013 to SDG 2 billion
(or 0.4 percent of GDP).

13

Zakat is the practice of taxation, prescribed by Islam, imposed upon Muslims based on accumulated wealth and
distributed to poor Muslims; the Zakat Fund is not part of the government budget.

Prospects for debt relief
52.
Debt relief prospects are predicated on normalizing relations with international
financial institutions, and establishing a track record of cooperation with the IMF on policies
and payments. While Sudan has met some of those requirements (Box 3), further efforts are
needed to reach the Decision Point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative.
At this stage, it is not possible to assign a firm timeline for the fulfillment of all the remaining steps,
which mainly depend on the result of the bilateral outreach to creditors. Staff advised the authorities
to continue to: (i) reach out to all their external creditors, jointly with South Sudan, to secure their
participation and support for the debt relief process; and (ii) continue to strengthen cooperation
with the Fund on policies and payments, including through the ongoing SMP. Staff welcomed the
recent decision by Sudan and South Sudan to extend the “zero option” to October 2016.
Box 3. Path to Normalization of Relations and Debt Relief
Sudan is eligible for debt relief under the HIPC initiative, but has not yet met all the qualifications. The normalization
of relations with external creditors, including the Fund, other multilateral institutions, and bilateral creditors, is a key
pillar of the requirements for debt relief, requiring efforts in specific areas for each class of creditor. As of now, Sudan
meets the following conditions for the HIPC initiative:



Faces an unsustainable debt burden that cannot be addressed through traditional debt relief mechanisms;



Has developed an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) document. Sudan’s I-PRSP was assessed by the
staffs of the Fund and the World Bank and was discussed by both Boards in September 2013, and



In 2012 Sudan reconciled its external debt as of end-2010 in order to determine its HIPC eligibility. The
reconciliation expires at end-2014. A new debt reconciliation exercise will have to be conducted when Sudan
nears the Decision Point.

To reach the Decision Point, Sudan would still need to undertake the following:



Obtain assurances of support for HIPC debt relief from a large majority of creditors representing at least
70 percent of HIPC-eligible debt;



Whereas Sudan has already done 14 SMPs with the Fund, it would still need to establish with the IMF a track
record of strong policy performance for at least six months in the period leading up to the Decision Point,
which could take the form of an SMP judged by the Executive Board to meet the policy standards associated
with upper-credit tranche arrangements; and



Clear its arrears with the Fund, and have a fully financed plan and a timetable to clear arrears with the World
Bank and the African Development Bank in order to restore its eligibility to borrow from these sources.

The resources required for the IMF's participation in the HIPC Initiative have not yet been identified. As the costs
to the Fund for providing debt relief to Sudan were not included in the original costing estimates for the HIPC
initiative, additional financing will need to be secured when Sudan is ready to clear its arrears and embark on the
HIPC initiative.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SUDAN

53.
Sudan’s arrears to the Fund totaled SDR 977.7 million at end-October 2014. Sudan
made payments totaling about US$7.5million (SDR 4.9 million) thus far this year as agreed under the
SMP. They intend to make the remaining quarterly payment to reach a total of at least $10 million
in 2014. Staff encourages the authorities to make payments to the Fund that are at least sufficient to
cover obligations falling due, make payments regularly, and to significantly increase them as Sudan’s
payment capacity improves.
Authorities’ views
54.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment and advice. They agreed with the results
of the DSA. They expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the debt relief process, but
remained hopeful that the international community will support Sudan for a fast-track debt relief.
They underscored that the extension of the “zero option” was a goodwill gesture, and that in the
meantime they would step up their outreach efforts to creditors, including through the joint
approach. They agreed to minimize non-concessional borrowing as agreed under the SMP and
indicated that they will borrow on the best terms possible to invest in priority agriculture, energy,
and infrastructure projects.

E. Statistical Issues
55.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although the
timeliness, coverage, and periodicity of data reporting could be improved. Further improvements
require strengthening interinstitutional and interdepartmental cooperation on data collection and
reporting, and enhancing the capacity of the units responsible for compiling statistics.

SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE SMP
56.
Performance in the second quarter of 2014 was broadly satisfactory: all June
quantitative targets under the SMP were met, except for the indicative target on reserve
money (LOI, Attachment I, Table 1). Central bank NDA was contained and NIR was on target. Tax
revenue, the non-oil primary deficit, and social spending over-performed, and, as a result, domestic
and central bank financing of the central government were well below targets. However, reserve
money growth at 8 percent in the year-to-June exceeded the 6.2 percent target, owing to
unsterilized gold purchases by the central bank. The authorities have also adjusted the official rate
by 3 percent starting in September to narrow the gap between the official, and the parallel market
exchange rates. They intend to gradually continue this adjustment process.
57.
End-December targets were adjusted. The quantitative benchmarks and targets, except
for the domestic financing of the central government and net international reserves have been
revised taking into account improved revenue collection and contained spending. The endDecember ceiling on net domestic financing of the central government and the floor on net
international reserves have been revised taking into account projected lower external financing. The

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

completion of the structural benchmark on the restructuring of Omdurman Bank is now envisaged
in December, instead of November.
58.
Efforts to keep the structural reform agenda on track are continuing, with delays in
some areas but early achievements in others (LOI, Attachment I, Table 2). Early achievements
include the extension of the GFSM 2001 classification to all states and issuance, in January, of a
directive to close all central government accounts in commercial banks. The tax audit manual has
been distributed to the relevant departments and training started at end September, and the
establishment of appropriate IT systems is also under way. Further, an amended AML/CFT law was
enacted. However, there were some delays. The committee, set up in March to review tax
exemptions and enhance collections, finalized its report in October instead of June, and work is still
ongoing to strengthen the penalty procedures for noncompliant taxpayers. Similarly, the
restructuring plan for Omdurman Bank is still under preparation and should be finalized before
year-end.
59.
The authorities agreed that the current SMP, which ends in December 2014, has
provided them with a framework to address their economic challenges. However, they have yet to
decide on proceeding with a new SMP for 2015, and plan to discuss the way forward with the staff
during the third review of the SMP.

ARTICLE VIII ISSUES
60.
Sudan’s exchange rate regime and the measures taken to restrict access to foreign
exchange have been determined to give rise to exchange restrictions and multiple currency
practices (MCPs), which are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII (Box 4). These
measures include an exchange rate regime with multiple effective rates and a policy of rationing
foreign exchange and allocating it to certain sectors, such that foreign exchange is limited for other
current international transactions. The authorities have unified official exchange rates to within a
±4 percent band of the central bank indicative rate. However, a number of exchange restrictions and
MCPs remain in effect (see Informational Annex). Staff urged, in line with previous
recommendations, the authorities to eliminate the remaining restrictions and MCPs, noting that
such measures are not helping Sudan’s economy to reduce external imbalances, attract foreign
investment, improve resource allocation, and enhance external competitiveness.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SUDAN

Box 4. Exchange Rate System
Sudan maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that are subject to
Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3:



An exchange restriction arising from the government's limitations on the availability of
foreign exchange and the allocation of foreign exchange to certain priority items;



A multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from the establishment of an
official exchange rate (the CBOS rate) for use in all government exchange transactions
which in practice differs by more than 2 percent from the rate used by commercial banks;



A multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from large spreads between
the CBOS rate and the parallel market exchange rate due to the CBOS’ limitation on the
availability of foreign exchange which channels current international transactions to the
parallel market; and



An exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice arising from the imposition by the
government of a cash margin requirement for most imports

The Authorities’ Views
61.
The authorities indicated that they were unable to remove all exchange restrictions
and MCPs because of continued pressures on the balance of payments. Shortage of foreign
exchange persists despite projected increased foreign exchange receipts from agricultural exports
and oil transit fees later in the year. Given current constraints on the CBOS’s ability to meet all the
demand for foreign exchange, the authorities had to maintain temporary restrictions and engage in
MCPs for strategic priority needs such as imports of food and fuel. The CBOS remains committed to
gradually removing the remaining exchange restrictions and MCPs. It will begin to remove the
exchange rate restrictions and multiple currency practices by November 2015 and will remove all
restrictions within three years.

STAFF APPRAISAL
62.
Sudan’s economy has yet to recover from the shock of South Sudan’s secession three
years ago. Despite progress in implementing policies to address the resulting imbalances, inflation
remains high and growth sluggish. Macroeconomic adjustment has been complicated by structural
weaknesses, a heavy debt burden, U.S. sanctions, and volatile domestic and regional political
environments, which affect confidence and investment.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

63.
The authorities embarked last year on an adjustment program to restore
macroeconomic stability and lay the foundations for sustained and inclusive growth. The
adjustment to the new economic situation is proceeding through fiscal consolidation, monetary
tightening, and structural reforms. The authorities have implemented difficult corrective measures,
the latest of which in September 2013 entailed a sharp reduction in fuel subsidies, a unification of all
official exchange rates, and exchange rate devaluation; these unfortunately led to civil unrest and
the loss of life. Adjustment efforts continued in 2014 under the SMP.
64.
Economic performance has gradually improved this year but growth has remained
subdued and inflation still high at about 40 percent—a sign of continued imbalances. Growth
is expected to rebound on account of a good harvest, but the outlook remains uncertain amidst
high vulnerabilities, and is weighed by the breakdown of correspondent banking relations,
U.S. sanctions, and a fragile domestic and regional political environment. Risks are largely tilted to
the downside, though prospects of a successful national dialogue could ultimately lead to resolution
of domestic conflicts and improved international relations.
65.
Fiscal consolidation should continue while bolstering social safety nets and improving
the quality of spending. The favorable fiscal performance in the first half of 2014 is positive and
the authorities should continue with disciplined execution of their fiscal program. Enhanced revenue
collection efforts and gradual reduction of fuel subsidies should ensure reduction in fiscal
imbalances, create space for development and social spending, and reduce government recourse to
central bank financing.
66.
Monetary policy should continue focusing on reducing the very high inflation. This will
require limiting unsterilized gold purchases by the central bank to contain reserve money growth.
Promoting a market for government securities and making fully operational the recently established
interbank money market to address chronic excess liquidity are important for improving monetary
policy management.
67.
Exchange rate flexibility is key to rebuilding reserves and external competitiveness.
The wide gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates suggests persistent external
imbalances, and the authorities’ commitment to gradually close this gap is welcome. Resorting to
foreign exchange restrictions does not address the underlying external imbalances, and the recent
removal of some of these measures is a step in the right direction. The authorities’ commitment to
eliminate the remaining foreign exchange restrictions and the multiple currency practices is
appropriate. In the interim, Staff supports the authorities’ request for the approval of remaining
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices given that these measures are adopted for
balance of payments reasons, and are temporary and non-discriminatory.
68.
More efforts are needed to enhance financial stability. Stronger banking supervision and
privatization are needed to improve competitiveness and resilience of banks. The current restriction
on commercial banks’ holdings of government and central bank securities should be relaxed. Further
strengthening and implementation of the AML/CFT framework would contribute to improving
financial stability and integration into the global financial system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

SUDAN

69.
Structural policies should focus on fostering sustained and inclusive growth. Reforms
to improve the business environment will promote private sector led growth. Improving the quality
of spending to support human capital formation and better targeting of social safety nets will be
critical for expanding opportunities and protecting the most vulnerable groups from the effects of
fuel subsidy reforms. In this context, the launch of the PRSP process is welcome and will offer an
instrument to implement coherent macroeconomic and structural reforms to lift growth prospects
and reduce poverty.
70.
Performance under the SMP is broadly satisfactory. All of the end-June quantitative
targets, with the exception of the indicative target on reserve money growth, were met. The
authorities have also made good progress toward meeting their end-September structural
benchmarks. The SMP continues to provide a useful framework for the authorities’ policy and reform
efforts. The authorities have made determined efforts to implement their program, which
nevertheless is subject to significant downside risks, including the fragile domestic security and
political situation and regional tensions.
71.
Gaining the support of the international community is critical for the success of
Sudan’s reform strategy and minimizing risks. Resolving Sudan’s unsustainable external debt is
of paramount importance. While Sudan has made some progress towards meeting the requirements
for debt relief, the successful implementation of the SMP and intensification of outreach to bilateral
creditors will help the case for a comprehensive debt relief. In this regard, staff urges the authorities
to reach out to their external creditors, including under the framework of the Joint Approach with
South Sudan and the African Union High-level Implementation Panel. Staff welcomes the recent
agreement between the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to extend the “zero option” to
October 2016. It encourages the authorities to minimize nonconcessional borrowing and avoid
selective debt servicing, as these may complicate reaching agreement with creditors on a debt
resolution strategy. Sudan should continue efforts to strengthen its cooperation with the Fund on
policies and payments, including in the context of the SMP. Staff encourages the authorities to make
payments to the Fund that are at least sufficient to cover obligations falling due, make payments
regularly, and to significantly increase them as Sudan’s payment capacity improves.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
Current account imbalances, an overvalued exchange rate, and low international reserves continue to
undermine Sudan’s external stability. Three years after the secession of South Sudan, Sudan has not
yet fully adjusted to the permanent loss of oil exports and has not restored its external competitiveness.
Applying the EBA-lite methodology, staff estimated a 40 percent exchange rate overvaluation relative
to economic fundamentals. Further adjustment would involve diversifying exports, allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility, developing a business environment supportive of the non-oil private sector,
and gradual buildup of reserves.

Background
1.

Sudan’s balance of payments deteriorated significantly following the secession of

South Sudan in 2011. Sudan lost about three-quarters of oil production and two-thirds of exports.
The current account balance deteriorated, shortages of foreign exchange emerged, and the
exchange rate on the parallel market diverged from the official rate. Under the government’s threeyear emergency plan, the authorities devalued the Sudanese Pound (SDG) from 2.9 to 4.4 SDG/USD
in June 2012 and subsequently to 5.7 SDG/USD in September 2013. However, fiscal and monetary
policies remained expansionary for most of this period. As a result, inflation surged, the current
account deficit remained high, and the parallel market exchange rate continued to drift away from
the official rate.

Recent external developments
2.

The current account balance improved

in the first half of 2014. While exports were
unchanged, imports declined by 15 percent yearon-year in the first half of the year, reflecting
adjustment from the September 2013
devaluation as well as a tightened fiscal stance.
From July 2013 Sudan also started receiving
stable oil-related revenue flows—oil transit fees
and TFA transfers—from South Sudan. As a result,
the current account deficit is expected to narrow to 6½ percent of GDP in 2014 from 8¾ percent
in 2013.
3.

The exchange rate continued to depreciate on the parallel market before stabilizing in

recent months (Figure 1). External shocks contributed to this depreciation in the first half of the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

year, including the conflict in South Sudan and the U.S. prosecution of an international bank for
violating U.S. sanctions. By mid-2014, the

Figure 2. REER and NEER

parallel market rate reached

(January 2010 - June 2014)

9.5 SDG/USD—a 20 percent depreciation

September 2013, has been largely reversed by
high domestic inflation relative to trading
partners (Figure 2); (iv) international reserves

The External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology was developed as a successor to the macroeconomic
balance approach used under CGER. EBA-lite takes into account a broader set of factors—including policies, cyclical
conditions, and global capital market conditions—that may influence the current account and real exchange rate.

balance has diverged from the norm (Figure 3), and was about 4 percent of GDP above the level
consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies, adjusted for cyclical factors, in 2013. Because of
Sudan’s relatively low elasticity of the current account to the REER of 0.09—owing to its low exportand import-to-GDP ratios3 —reducing the current account by 1 percent of GDP requires an
11 percent real depreciation. Hence, the current account gap translates into an exchange rate
overvaluation of 41 percent.

Non-price competitiveness
6.

Weak institutions and an unfavorable business environment undermine Sudan’s

competitiveness. Sudan’s business climate, as measured by the 2014 World Bank Doing Business
survey, is ranked 149 among 189 countries—in the lowest quartile of all surveyed countries—as in
previous years. 4Indicators point to difficulties in obtaining licenses, accessing credit, and trading
across borders. Sanctions imposed on Sudan by the United States generate additional costs and
difficulties for international trade and foreign direct investment. Sudan also lags in the areas of
human development and public sector capacity, as evidenced by the UNDP’s 2012 Human
Development Index (Sudan ranked 171 out of 186 countries) and the World Bank’s 2012 Country
and Policy Institutional Assessment (Sudan is classified as a weak performer).

Reserve adequacy
7.

Sudan’s international reserves are below the levels considered adequate. Gross

international reserves have been on a declining trend since 2006. Following the September 2013
depreciation, they increased moderately (Figure 4) to 1.6 months of imports from a trough of
1.3 months. However, they are still well below the traditional recommended minimum coverage of
3 months of imports, and below the optimal level suggested by the new methodology for lowincome countries, which suggests an optimal reserve level of 6 – 6½ months for Sudan, based on
country-specific probabilities and the costs of balance of payments crises (Figure 5).5

3

Trade elasticities, estimated by Tokarick, 2010, were applied: Sudan has an export supply elasticity of 0.57 and an
import demand elasticity of 1.23.
4

These indicators should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of respondents, limited

Conclusion
8.

Sudan’s external sector continues to be vulnerable to shocks. To restore external

stability and increase resilience to external shocks, Sudan needs to: (i) introduce greater
exchange rate flexibility to reduce overvaluation and close the gap between the official and parallel
market exchange rates, and gradually remove restrictions on access to foreign exchange;
(ii) continue fiscal consolidation and tighten further monetary policy to contain inflation; and
(iii) develop the country’s infrastructure and human capital; this requires stepped-up efforts by the
authorities to secure debt relief to reduce the unsustainably high external debt burden and unlock
concessional foreign financing; (iv) undertake structural reforms aimed at removing structural
impediments, and strengthening institutions to create a supportive business environment; and
(v) gradually build up reserves to provide sufficient buffers against shocks.

Annex II. Sources of Growth in Sudan
1.

Agriculture has the potential for significant inclusive growth. This sector has, since at

least 1980, carried promise of becoming a bread basket of the Arab world. However challenging
climatic conditions, low productivity and developmental neglect have kept that promise unfulfilled
so far.
2.

Agriculture supports nearly 70 percent of the population and accounts for about

27 percent of GDP. That share declined from the high of 47 percent in 1996 before the advent of
oil in 1998. Since then, agriculture also lost its position as a prime exporting sector. However, this
trend has reversed since the secession of South Sudan. Agriculture exports were 18 percent of
exports in 2012 and 39 percent in 2013—nearly as much as oil. They more than doubled within one
year, owing to exchange rate depreciation and increasing export orientation of agriculture. Sudan’s
trade partners highly value Sudan’s agricultural products. One of these, gum Arabic, Sudan
dominates the world market.
3.

The authorities plan to turn agriculture into the growth engine. The regional economies

are showing interest in agriculture and imports of its products. Staff expects, as economic reforms
take hold, agricultural exports will dominate Sudan’s exports.
4.

Agriculture can lead economic growth provided a number of reforms are

implemented. The World Bank has identified necessary reforms and policy actions comprising
infrastructure investments, improving access to agricultural inputs, making agricultural markets
more efficient, eliminating fees and taxes not related to services provided by the state, and
improved extension services.1
5.

Agricultural sector reforms should improve economy-wide productivity and growth.

According to the IMF research, agricultural reforms are associated with higher productivity growth
and higher manufacturing sector productivity that can yield economy-wide productivity gains,
including by facilitating structural transformation.2
6.

Gum Arabic production is a sector within agriculture with significant potential to

deliver inclusive growth. An estimated five million people are directly involved in the gum

procurement and utilization of the gum trees. The gum Arabic “belt”—an area of half a million
square kilometers where gum trees are growing—extends from the border of Sudan with Ethiopia to
its border with Chad and Central African Republic. The gum is exempt from the U.S. sanctions, is
widely exported, and used in food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and other industries.
7.

Recent reforms in the gum sector have increased production and exports, and lifted

incomes of gum producers. The reforms have been supported by the World Bank and International
Fund for Agricultural Development.3 The production increased from 20,000 tons in 2009-10 to
88,000 tons in 2013-14. Further increases are expected as the reforms continue. The producers’ take
of the gum price has increased from 15 percent to 50 percent improving livelihood and providing
incentives for responsible production.
8.

Gold mining is another sector with considerable potential. Sudan is rich in mineral

resources, and exports of gold have grown rapidly

Table 1. Gold: Sudan and top producers in the world

since the late 2000s. In 2011, gold exports were
13 percent of total exports, in 2012 for
42 percent, and in 2013 for 36 percent. Reliable
data on gold production are not available, but
judging by export volumes Sudan could be the
15th largest gold producer in the world and the
third largest in Africa (Table 1). Anecdotal
evidence suggests that significant amounts of
gold are smuggled out of Sudan.

Gold mining is dominated by artisanal

miners. Most artisanal operations are in the North where surface deposits are located. Those are
becoming progressively depleted leading to rising operation costs. The authorities estimate that
close to one million workers (about 11 percent of total employment) are in gold mining. The
authorities are planning to provide extension services to them to improve the safety of operations
and legalize them.
10.

The government is attracting foreign companies to invest in gold mining. It had

awarded 127 concessions of which 10 have started production. The oldest mining operation in
Sudan since 1991 is operated by Sudan’s Ariab Mining Company with La Mancha Resources Inc. of

Canada. Interest in gold mining in Sudan is shown by Egypt, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, UK, Russia,
and China. The government plans to develop gold mining as a part of the broader development
mineral sector. They are also focusing on associated minerals and on processing the extracted
minerals to higher value-added products. At end-2012 they opened the first gold refinery with a
capacity of 150 tons per year.
11.

Reliance on gold mining for development is not free from challenges. The most obvious

ones are owing to fluctuations of the world price of gold (Table 2). Prices for Sudan’s gold exports
have been lower than the indicated world price (GAS price in Table 2) and exports have fluctuated in
response to changing prices. In 2013, when,
reportedly, the lack of confidence in gold as

this could possibly disrupt its exports and deal a blow to Sudan’s development prospects.
12.

Total factor productivity (TFP) is likely to become a major source of growth in Sudan

owing to structural changes in the economy and the sudden stop of reliance on oil after the
secession of South Sudan. Although these changes had a negative influence on the economy, they
are also removing many of the constraints that hampered TFP growth. It will take some time for the
supply of inputs to respond to new price structures and new opportunities, especially given the risks
still facing the economy. Nevertheless the productivity improvements can happen much faster.
13.

Labor and capital will need to contribute to growth to assure that it is balanced and

sustainable. Human capital had historically grown at about 1 percent per annum. Removal of
constraints on the economy would likely increase growth rate of human capital. Similarly, capital
services are likely to increase assuring sustainable, inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Khartoum, November 21, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
We appreciate the support received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through the StaffMonitored Program (SMP), on which we embarked to achieve our dual objective of addressing the
macroeconomic imbalances created by the secession of South Sudan and advancing our reform
program in a challenging domestic and external environment, while at the same time garnering
international support for debt relief. This letter updates our March and June 2014 Letters of Intent
and Memorandums of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which remain valid, and revises the
technical memorandum of understanding (attached) to reflect the recent agreement with oil
companies in South Sudan.
We have met all the end-June quantitative benchmarks and targets set for the second review of the
SMP, except the indicative target on reserve money growth which was missed but will be achieved
by year-end through corrective measures described below. We have also made good progress on
structural conditionality by advancing implementation of the reforms agreed under the program,
most notably in the areas of revenue administration, public financial management, and anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
The tangible benefits of the program are already evident, most notably in continued economic
recovery and greater fiscal stability, although we need to continue our efforts to bring inflation
down. We consider these results evidence of a track record of macroeconomic performance and
policy implementation required to obtain debt relief, which remains an utmost priority for us.
Economic growth continues broadly as expected, performance in gold extraction has been very
good, and we expect a bountiful harvest thanks to ample and timely rains. Twelve-month inflation
has begun to decline from 46 percent in August to 39 percent in September, and this is expected to
continue as the impact of the one-off effect of last year’s energy price hikes, the exogenous events
that led to the depreciation of the curb market exchange rate in the first half of the year, and
seasonal factors begin to dissipate. The depreciation pressures in the curb market have eased and
the gap with the official exchange rate declined from 65 percent in August to 47 percent in midNovember. Reserve money grew by 8 percent over the first six months of the year, exceeding the
6.2 percent target for June. Gross international reserves increased to US$1.6 billion and net
international reserves exceeded the June target. Fiscal performance in the first half of the year was
strong: with revenue rising by more than 60 percent relative to the same period last year and
46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

expenditure in line with targets, the budget deficit dropped to 0.4 percent of GDP (against
1.2 percent last year). In parallel, the central bank’s net credit to the government declined over the
first six months of the year.
Much remains to be done, though, and in the months ahead we will build on the progress already
achieved. With this in mind, we have reached an understanding with the IMF staff on a revised
macroeconomic framework for the remainder of 2014 and the medium term, updated quantitative
benchmarks and indicative targets for end-December 2014, and re-phased the structural
benchmark on the restructuring plan for the Ommdurman Bank, as the preparation of the plan will
take longer than previously envisaged (Tables 1 and 2).
We remain committed to implementing the agreed policy mix aimed at achieving macroeconomic
stability. We will: (i) continue fiscal consolidation through revenue enhancement and fiscal
retrenchment, while broadening social protection and allocating more resources to productive
projects; (ii) continue our tight monetary policy stance and improve the monetary transmission
mechanism; iii) address external imbalances by assuring greater exchange rate flexibility through a
managed-float exchange rate system; and (iv) enhance the capacity of the financial public sector.
Our macroeconomic objectives for 2014 remain broadly in line with the first review projections. We
expect non-oil real GDP to grow by 2.9 percent as a result of a rebound in agriculture, gold
extraction, continued good performance in manufacturing, robust export performance, and
productivity gains as reforms take hold. We are committed to: (i) bringing inflation down to about
30 percent by year-end, reflecting the combined effects of fiscal consolidation and further monetary
policy tightening, as well as the dissipation of the base effect from last year’s energy price
adjustments; (ii) limiting the overall fiscal deficit to 1.0 percent of GDP, reflecting improved revenue
collection and contained spending; and (iii) narrowing the current account deficit to 6½ percent of
GDP, reflecting improved exchange rate flexibility.
Owing to our adjustment efforts, the medium-term outlook remains favorable despite being
weighed by the difficult domestic and external environment, the absence of significant foreign
financing, the unsustainable debt burden, and the adverse impact of sanctions on the domestic
economy, cross-border transactions, and foreign investment. The outlook has been further clouded
by the widespread negative effect of the sanctions against an international commercial bank
involved in transactions with Sudan, which are taking a heavy toll on our economy and, ultimately,
on the poor.
Fiscal adjustment remains the cornerstone of the program. On the revenue side, we are pressing
ahead with the implementation of the revenue-enhancing measures outlined in the March and June
MEFPs. In particular, progress is underway to rationalize tax exemptions, strengthen taxpayer
compliance, and advance a framework that uses risk-based audit and non-audit interventions. The
committee on tax and customs reform has advanced its work; its report was finalized by October
and its recommendations will be incorporated in the 2015 budget. On the expenditure side, we
continue to be committed to the SMP targets for the year despite some overruns on goods and
services and on fuel subsidies due to exceptionally warm weather, and we are strengthening public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

financial management as outlined in the March and June MEFPs. We are containing the wage bill
and ensuring improvements in operations of the state-owned oil company and the electricity sector.
We have extended the GFSM 2001-compatible classification to the six remaining states, and have
closed all central government accounts in commercial banks except in areas with no Central Bank of
Sudan (CBOS) branches.
We will further tighten our monetary policy stance to keep inflationary pressures in check. In this
context, we will maintain our reserve money growth target of 14.7 percent for the year, despite the
overshooting in the first half of the year, and will limit monetary financing of the fiscal deficit to
0.4 percent of GDP. To achieve this, we will reduce the injection of liquidity in the economy as we
will contain domestic gold purchases at the curb market rate, even though gold exports constitute
an important source of foreign exchange. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen the
central bank’s independence and improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by:
(i) improving the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies; (ii) promoting an interbank
market for commercial banks; (iii) expanding the open market operations to provide commercial
banks with the opportunity to recycle unused cash balances; and (iv) relaxing restrictions on
commercial banks’ holdings of government and central bank securities to help develop a market for
such securities and reduce excess liquidity.
To improve the operation of the banking sector, we are working to implement best practices in bank
supervision, inspection and enforcement; update the risk-based manuals for offsite and onsite
supervision; limit the direct ownership of banks by CBOS; and upgrade the legal, regulatory, and
institutional framework of the sector. We will finalize a plan to restructure Omdurman National Bank
in line with the recommendations of the independent audit by December 2014. To strengthen our
governance framework, we have enacted an amended AML/CFT law.
A continuation of the tight monetary policy stance, lower fiscal deficits, and enhanced exchange rate
flexibility should reduce the gap between the official and curb market exchange rates. The persistent
gap between those two rates reflects insufficient foreign exchange supply and limited exchange rate
flexibility, together with absence of international financial support. We fully recognize the urgent
need to reduce this gap, and have introduced measures to enhance flexibility in foreign exchange
transactions. Specifically, commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus have been allowed to set
the exchange rate freely within the trading bands of the managed float regime, while exporters have
been allowed to sell their proceeds to any importer at an agreed price. From end-June, we have
begun a gradual adjustment of the indicative rate with a view to achieving convergence between the
official and the curb market rates. As part of our commitment to enhance flexibility, we adjusted the
official exchange rate by 3 percent to narrow the gap between the two rates. This will be followed by
regular adjustments as needed, depending on market developments to preserve our limited foreign
exchange reserves and the economy’s competitiveness.
We remain committed to improving the business environment, strengthening our social policies,
and upgrading debt management. The reform agenda will continue to focus on lowering the cost of
doing business in order to attract increased domestic and foreign investment. We are also taking
action to improve transparency and governance. We will continue our efforts to improve the human
48

SUDAN

capital and reduce poverty within the framework of the I-PRSP, and we will finalize a full PRSP with
support from external donors. Specifically, in addition to increased assistance to the most needy, we
are also allocating more funds to basic social spending, which has already increased in line with
targets.
Resolving the unsustainable debt burden remains the government’s utmost priority. In this regard,
we are profoundly disappointed that none of our efforts have been matched by the creditors or the
international community so far. Indeed, we have satisfied key technical requirements, including a
long track record of economic performance that spans 13 successful SMPs, finalized our I-PRSP, and
reconciled our external debt records with creditors. We urge creditors, donors, and the international
community to recognize our efforts and commitment, as evidenced by our track record of
performance under the current and past SMPs, and to take concrete and positive action towards
awarding debt relief on an equal footing with other countries. In the meantime, we are committed
to: (i) minimizing non-concessional borrowing, and to borrowing on as concessional terms as
possible; and (ii) continuing to make regular quarterly payments to the IMF totaling at least
US$10 million in 2014, and further increasing them if Sudan’s payment capacity improves.
The deadline under the “zero option” elapsed in September 2014, and according to the agreement,
the external debt would have been apportioned between Sudan and South Sudan since creditors,
donors, and international community have not provided firm commitments to deliver debt relief.
This failure by the international community to move toward granting debt relief has come at great
socio-economic cost to Sudan, and has stifled our attempts to spur economic growth and reduce
poverty. Nevertheless, in light of recent events in South Sudan and in order to give time to the
Tripartite Committee (Sudan/South Sudan/African Union) to carry out its outreach strategy, the
parties have agreed to extend this deadline to September 2015. Moreover, we intend to: (i) continue
our technical work; (ii) step up, through the Tripartite Committee, our joint outreach efforts towards
the international community to secure debt relief; and (iii) supplement the joint outreach with
bilateral outreach to intensify the process, while reporting all efforts in this regard to the Tripartite
Committee.
The government of Sudan is committed to a comprehensive national dialogue to achieve
sustainable peace in Sudan, as envisaged in the agreement signed in Addis Ababa on September 4
under the auspices of the African Union High-level Implementation Panel.
We believe that the policies set forth herein and in the above-mentioned MEFPs are sufficient to
achieve the objectives of our program, and we stand ready to take any additional measures that
may become necessary for this purpose. We will consult with Fund staff in advance of any revision of
the policies described here and in the March and June MEFPs, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies. We will remain in close contact with Fund staff and provide timely information required for
monitoring economic developments and implementation of policies under the SMP.
We authorize the IMF to publish this letter and the policy documents related to this second review
under the SMP.

Definitions
6.

Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) net domestic assets (NDA) are defined as reserve money

minus CBOS net foreign assets (NFA), minus revaluation accounts. CBOS Net foreign assets (NFA)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

are defined as foreign assets minus foreign liabilities. Foreign assets comprised of active accounts
and other foreign assets of the CBOS. Foreign liabilities comprised of the following items: CBOS use
of Fund credit, overdue Fund charges, liabilities to other international organizations, short-term
liabilities, and other foreign liabilities. Revaluation accounts are as noted in the balance sheet of the
CBOS.
7.

CBOS net credit to the central government (NCG) is defined as CBOS credit to the central

government minus total central government deposits. Central government deposits include all
accounts of line ministries and agencies controlled by the government;
8.

CBOS credit to the central government includes temporary advance, plus CBOS’s acquisition

of Government Musharaka Certificates (GMCs) and Government Investment Certificates (GICs), plus
CBOS long-term claims on the central government;
The central government comprises all accounts of line ministries and agencies controlled by the



government (corresponding to Group no. 11, Group no. 12, and some accounts of the Group
no. 19 in the CBOS general ledger), the Zakat funds (recorded under Group no. 13), and margin
deposits placed with the CBOS by the central government against letters of credit issued by the
CBOS. The definition includes all oil-related accounts controlled by the government (e.g., OSA).
9.

Net international reserves (NIR) are total gross official foreign reserve assets on active

accounts minus official short-term liabilities. The gross reserve assets include assets maintained on
accounts with overseas correspondent banks, foreign exchange banknotes in the vaults of the
central bank, monetary gold, and SDR holdings. Short-term liabilities include the foreign liabilities,
net of barter and payment agreements and non residents’ time liabilities, as reported in the balance
sheet of the CBOS. 1
10.

To evaluate program targets, the guinea equivalent values of foreign exchange denominated

items in the balance sheet of the CBOS will be calculated at the program exchange rate of SDG
5.672 per U.S. dollar, and SDG 8.708 per SDR. For currencies other than SDR and U.S. dollar, cross
program exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will be fixed as of end-March 2014.
11.

Domestic financing of the central government is defined as total net domestic borrowing by

the central government, including net borrowing from the banking system (including GMCs and
GICs), net sales of GMCs and GICs outside the banking system, promissory notes (i.e., standing
1

orders, letters of guarantees,2 sanadats, etc.), revenues from privatization (net of new acquisition of
financial assets), revenues from leasing, buildup of domestic government arrears, and drawdown in
government cash deposits at the CBOS.
12.

Non-oil primary fiscal balance of the central government (NOPB) is defined as non-oil

revenues3 minus non-oil expenditures 4excluding net interest payments (interest payments minus
interest receipts) cumulatively since the beginning of the calendar year.


The floor on the NOPB set in Table 1 will be lowered by the excess in project loans or budget
loans relative to program assumptions. The floor on the NOPB set in Table 1 will be raised by the
shortfall in project loans relative to program assumptions.

13.

Debt is defined for program purposes in accordance with Executive Board Decision

No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).


For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one
or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s)
in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i)

Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);

2

These guaranties are issued by the government to finance capital and current spending and may, in some instances,
be countersigned by the CBOS.
3

Oil revenue include royalties, oil income taxes, oil-related profit transfers, income from state equity in the oil sector
(including national oil company dividends), oil export taxes, receipts from granting exploration rights, and signature
bonuses.
4

Oil expenditures include government investment in the oil sector and any associated recurrent spending, other
current oil spending, and transfers to national oil companies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

SUDAN



(ii)

Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and

(iii)

Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property, while the lessee or retains the title to
the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period
of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out in point (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

14.

A non-concessional external debt ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the

public sector of new nonconcessional borrowing debt with nonresidents with original maturities of
one year or more. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not yet been received. This applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been
extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the public sector.


The public sector comprises the central government, the central bank, nonfinancial public
enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake—
typically owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not consolidated in the budget,
and other official sector entities.



For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the
public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in
cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public sector to
finance partially or in full any a shortfall incurred by the debtor.

15.

For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least

35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present
value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the
debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt. The degree of concessionality of debt will be calculated

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

using 5 percent discount rate. The concessionality calculator is available via the Internet at
www.imf.org.
16.

Central government budget expenditure arrears are defined as budgeted central

government payments to residents determined by contractual obligations that remain unpaid
90 days after the due date. Under this definition, the due date refers to the date in which domestic
debt payments are due according to the relevant contractual agreement, taking into account any
contractual grace periods.
17.

Broad money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the banks, banks’

demand, and time and savings deposits. It also includes transferable deposits and margin deposits
against letters of credit placed by state and local governments, nonfinancial public enterprises, and
the nonbank private sector with the CBOS.
18.

Reserve money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the banks, total

reserves (required and excess) for banks, and deposits at the CBOS included in broad money.
19.

The program sets a floor on priority social spending of the central government. For the

purpose of the program, priority social spending of the government is defined as the central
government’s spending on social benefits program that includes cash transfer, spending on health
insurance, on primary health care, and students support.
20.

Transitional financial arrangement (TFA) is defined as in the September 2012 agreement

between Sudan and South Sudan and consists of financial transfers paid by the government of
South Sudan and totaling $3.028 billion. These payments are expressed in per barrel terms
($15/barrel), based on South Sudan’s projection of an average of 152,000 barrels/day of oil
production. If production is higher, payments will be made at the agreed rate until cumulative
payments reach $3.028 billion.
21.

Oil transit fees from South Sudan government are defined in the September 2012

agreement as the fees paid by South Sudan government for exporting its oil using Sudan’s pipeline
and oil infrastructure. These fees (i) average $9.1/barrel, of which only $6.9/barrel accrue to the
government (including government’s share in the pipelines and processing facilities) and the rest to
oil companies; and (ii) will apply for the whole 3½ year period and will be renegotiated thereafter.
22.

Oil transit fees from oil companies are defined as the government’s share in the fees paid by

oil companies operating in South Sudan for exporting their oil using Sudan’s pipeline and oil
infrastructure.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

SUDAN

Adjustors
23.

An adjustor will be applied for the oil transit fees from South Sudan government and oil

companies and TFA accrued from carrying crude oil from South Sudan. The gross programmed
government revenue is based on the program’s assumptions about oil transit fees and TFA from
South Sudan. Accrued revenue is the cumulative government revenue inflows based on actual
shipments at current international prices (f.o.b. Port Sudan).5 The local currency equivalent of the
dollar difference between the programmed and accrued oil transit fees and TFA, needed to calculate
the adjustor, will be obtained by multiplying the dollar difference by the average of the monthly
exchange rates prevailing during the period in question.
The programmed value for the oil transit fees and the TFA are as shown in the Table below.

The payments to the IMF are defined as a minimum quarterly payment of US$2,500,000.

Program Monitoring
25.

The Sudanese authorities established a program-monitoring committee composed of senior

officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Petroleum, the CBOS, and other relevant
agencies. The IMF Resident Representative has an observer status on this committee. The committee
is responsible for monitoring the performance of the program, recommending policy responses,
informing the IMF regularly about the progress of the program, and transmitting the supporting
materials necessary for the evaluation of benchmarks. The committee shall provide the IMF with a
progress report on the program on a monthly basis within four weeks of the end of each month,
using the latest available data.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The legal tender is the Sudanese guinea, which replaced the Sudanese dinar in proportion
SDG 1=SDD 100 in mid-2007. Sudan has a de jure managed floating and a de facto other managed
exchange rate regime. It has two official exchange rates. First, there is the “indicative” rate set by the
central bank. Second, there is an “official” rate set by the central bank within ± 4 percent of the
indicative exchange rate and applied to government transactions. The difference between the
“official” and the “indicative” rates is now less than 2 percent. Commercial banks and foreign
exchange bureaus are required to set their rates ± 4 percent of the indicative exchange rate. In
practice, commercial banks trade at the upper part of that band.
Sudan maintains the following measures subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2
and 3: 1) An exchange restriction arising from the government's limitations on the availability of
foreign exchange and the allocation of foreign exchange to certain priority items; 2) A multiple
currency practice and exchange restriction arising from the establishment of an official exchange
rate (the CBOS rate) for use in all government exchange transactions which in practice differs by
more than 2 percent from the rate used by commercial banks; 3) A multiple currency practice and
exchange restriction arising from large spreads between the CBOS rate and the parallel market
exchange rate due to the CBOS’ limitation on the availability of foreign exchange which channels
current international transactions to the parallel market; 4) An exchange restriction and a multiple
currency practice arising from the imposition by the government of a cash margin requirement for
most imports.
Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussion was concluded
by the Executive Board on September 20, 2013.

FSAP Participation
The FSAP work took place during October 9–14, 2004 and was completed during
December 1–14, 2004. The Financial System Stability Assessment report was discussed by the
Executive Board on April 29, 2005.

Resident Representative
The Fund’s resident representative office in Khartoum was opened in October 2005, as a shared post
with Djibouti. It was converted to a full post in September 2006.

Technical Assistance
In January 1995, the Executive Board decided to resume Fund technical assistance to Sudan. The
following table contains a summary of the technical assistance provided since 2004. This assistance
has been provided both from headquarters and from the IMF’s Middle East Technical Assistance
Center (METAC).

SUDAN

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of July 31, 2014)
1.
The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) has no active lending
portfolio in Sudan because of the country’s default on its financial obligations to IDA, which led to
the suspension of disbursements in April 1993. After discussions between the World Bank and the
Sudanese authorities on the need for Sudan to take steps toward normalizing its relations and
establishing a track record with the World Bank, the authorities made small, intermittent debt
service payments between mid-1999 and 2008. The amount of payments has not been sufficient to
prevent a continued accumulation of arrears, which currently stand at about US$800 million and are
growing.
2.
The World Bank was a major player in the reconstruction of Sudan following the Addis
Ababa peace agreement of 1972, but was mostly absent from Sudan between 1993 and 2002. As the
prospects for peace with the South rose in 2003, the World Bank formulated a strategy for a
potential reengagement. Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on
January 9, 2005 by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, the
World Bank became the administrator for two large Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) that support
the CPA, and built up its program of non-lending support. Fifteen MDTF partners1 have contributed
US$790 million in paid-in funds to the MDTFs. MDTF-supported projects initially experienced
implementation challenges, as have all development and recovery programs in Sudan, but
performance has steadily improved. Significant results are being seen on the ground, including the
successful MDTF-supported launch of the CPA-mandated new national currency and the completion
of the 5th Population Census, though daunting challenges remain—most notably low capacity,
especially at the state level and in the South. The MDTF closed at the end of 2013.
3.
A new World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Sudan was discussed by the World
Bank’s Board in September 2013. The ISN aims to support the Government of Sudan to achieve the
overarching goal of shared growth and institutional reform that provides economic opportunities
and reduces conflict. The Bank will focus on supporting activities that accelerate growth and expand
sources of growth, ensure equitable distribution of resources and access to services, and respond
urgently to opportunities to consolidate peace in areas emerging from conflict. The Bank will
support Sudan through carefully selected knowledge products and projects financed through
partnership funds and structured across two pillars: (1) Manage the Economic Transition, and
(2) Address Socio-economic Roots of Conflict.

The World Bank presently maintains a portfolio of approximately $120 million in nonlending technical assistance, funded primarily from global trust funds. The portfolio cuts across a

range of important issues consistent with the ISN, including education, agriculture, environmental
protection, and peace-building. In April 2014, the World Bank’s Board approved a new Sudan MultiPartner Fund (SMPF) as a successor to the MDTF. It is expected that this new Fund will have starting
capital approximating $10 million; it has proven challenging to mobilize donor support for this new
Fund. Governing arrangements will be similar to the MDTF, with the Government of Sudan
engaging as a full partner in the Fund’s Oversight Committee. The purpose of the Fund is to support
the two pillars of the Bank’s ISN within the context of Sudan’s national development strategy (i.e.,
the current I-PRSP and forthcoming full PRSP, where the World Bank is leading the dialogue in
collaboration with the AfDB).
5.
The entry points for World Bank support—through management of the SMPF and other
partnership funds as well as non-lending activities—vary according to the diverse conditions facing
different regions of Sudan. At the National level, a focus on managing the transition and stabilizing
peace entails a major role for analytical work and policy dialogue in support of the I-PRSP which
focuses to a large extent on activities to promote economic diversification through a vibrant private
sector. In Darfur, the World Bank works with partners, as security allows, to assess development and
recovery needs and to prepare rehabilitation and development programs to be implemented as
soon as conditions are right.
6.
IDA’s financial reengagement requires clearance of Sudan’s outstanding arrears. The
clearance of these arrears can only be undertaken once a firm and comprehensive agreement
among preferred creditors is in place. Such an agreement would also include significant reductions
in bilateral debts, so as to make the total debt service obligations sustainable. Following the
eventual clearance of IDA arrears, an exceptional IDA allocation for Sudan as a post-conflict country
would be sought, and the World Bank would prepare another strategy document which would
include, inter alia, a pipeline of projects. The World Bank, together with the IMF supports the
technical preparation of Sudan for a debt relief process through the Technical Working Group on
Sudan’s External Debt, which met 8 times between 2011 and 2014 and brings together major
bilateral and multilateral creditors of Sudan. In addition, March 2014 saw the Bank deploy a mission
of its Debt Reduction Facility (DRF) to engage Sudan on matters related to its commercial debt
obligations. The Bank continues to urge Sudan to intensify its outreach to its key creditors.
7.
The World Bank has completed a series of major non-lending products since the CPA
in 2005, including a National Public Expenditure Review in 2007, a Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study (DTIS) in 2008, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) in 2009, a Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment in 2011 and a Sub-National Public Expenditure Review in 2013. Other major
sector works include an Investment Climate Assessment in 2010 and Education and Health Status
Reports in 2011 and 2012. Major non-lending products planned to be completed and delivered in
2014/15are: A new Country Economic Memorandum focusing on economic diversification, an
Update to the 2008 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, Promoting Private Sector Revitalization in
Darfur, a Benchmarking of the Business of Agriculture, and Financial Sector Capacity Building with a
focus on financial inclusion.

To enrich this menu of policy and analytical support, the World Bank will seek to deepen
dialogue—and open up space for civil society participation in such dialogue—in areas such as:
managing the economic transition; making fiscal decentralization work; promoting economic
diversification; and local area development.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 18, 2014)
Group’s Portfolio and Arrears
1.
Since its first intervention in 1971 in Sudan, the Bank Group (AfDB) has approved to date
42 operations amounting to a total net commitment of UA331 million2. The Bank also approved
grants for emergency assistance under the Special Relief Fund in 2001, 2003, 2010 and 2013
amounting to a total of US$3.0 million. The most recent is the Public Financial and Economic
Management and Capacity Building Project approved in February 2014 financed with
US$34.8 million from the Fragile States Facility (FSF). In terms of sector distribution, the portfolio is
dominated by agriculture (54%), followed by infrastructure (28.6 %), multi sector (8.9%), finance (6
%) and social sectors (2.5 %).
2.
The Bank’s ongoing operations include the Technical Capacity Building for Preparation of
Full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (TCB PRSP), which was approved in July 2013 for
US$2.85 million from Fragile States Facility. Support to PRSP preparation includes replicating the
National Baselne Household Survey (NBHHS) by conducting a new household survey. This project
will also help set up functioning management and coordination structures that will enhance the full
participation of all donors and stakeholders, under the leadership and ownership of the
Government. Other ongoing operations include the Darfur Water Project for Conflict Resolution and
Peace Building, which was approved in April 2012 and is financed by Euro 3.3 million from the
African Water Facility (AWF). This project will rehabilitate and construct water infrastructure in Darfur
and demonstrate an integrated approach to water development. Under the Fragile States Facility
(FSF), the other ongoing projects include Capacity Enhancement for Debt Management and
Resource Mobilization (CEDMRM) approved in May 2012 for UA 1.05 million. The CEDMRM will
build institutional and human capacities in Debt Units and other departments in the Ministry of
Finance and National Economy (MoFNE), and the Central Bank of Sudan. Sudan has also been able
to access competitive Bilateral Trust Fund financing for notable projects including: (i) Economic
Diversification and Private Sector Study financed with USD 485,000 aimed at identifying
opportunities for private sector contribution to the economy; (ii) Technical Assistance to Mamoun
Beheiry Centre approved in August 2012 for US$260,500 which aims to improve the quality of policy
analysis and policy dialogue currently in Sudan and (iii) the Capacity Building and Assessment of
Options for Increasing Access to Energy in Sudan approved in October 2012 for US$340,500 that
intends to identify and map out energy poverty in Sudan. In addition, a grant to support the
University of Nyala (Darfur) to undertake a study on Scientific Adaptation of Livestock Breeds to
Climate Change was approved in May 2013 for US$497,000.

The AfDB has not been able to undertake much needed regular investment activities in the
country since 1995 because of arrears. As of end-August 2014, the arrears to the Bank Group stood
at UA 207.4 million, of which UA 91.9 million is to the African Development Fund (ADF) window and
UA 115.5 to the African Development Bank (ADB).

Strategy and Programming
4.
The Bank has maintained field presence and sustained policy dialogue with the Government
of Sudan and Development Partners, especially on arrears clearance and debt relief and PRSP. It has
conducted technical assistance and capacity building activities, using grant resources that are not
affected by the arrears situation of the country (Fragile State Facility and the Bilateral Trust Funds).
Recently, the Bank has also explored the opportunities to finance private sector operations in Sudan.
To this end, the Bank has organized a Business Information Seminar on 14th September 2014 to
expose the Sudanese private sector to the Bank’s private sector financing opportunities.
5.
Given the arrears situation of the country, the Bank has not been preparing Country Strategy
Papers for Sudan since 1994. Instead, it has been preparing Country Briefs, as the appropriate
programming document. The last Country Brief (CB) was approved in October 2012 covering the
period 2012–2014. However, a new CB covering the period 2014-2016 was prepared and will be
considered by the Board on 24th September. The new CB is aligned with Sudan’s development
priorities as articulated in the National Development Plan (NDP) for 2012-2016 and I-PRSP, as well
as with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013–2022). In particular, they are fully consistent with the
Bank’s Strategy for Engagement in Fragile Situations in Africa 2014-2019, which builds on the
Bussan New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States and the recommendations of the High Level
Panel on Fragile States. All these documents primarily underscore the building of state capacity
through institutional strengthening, and promoting inclusive and equitable growth.
6.
Sudan still faces most of the challenges that prevailed when the last Country Brief
(2012-2014) was prepared. These challenges include creating the conditions for peace and security,
stabilizing the economy, enhancing institutional capacity, addressing weaknesses in PFM and
improving overall governance. Since these issues remain relevant in Sudan today, the Bank has
maintained these priorities in the new CB 2014-2016. Therefore, the previous focus on policy
dialogue, technical assistance, capacity building and targeted operations will be maintained, but
consolidated under two Pillars: i) Governance and Accountability; and ii) Skills and Technology.
These two Pillars are complementary and mutually reinforcing, as they both seek to assist Sudan
acquire the human and institutional capacity required to get out of fragility. In this context, progress
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

was made on a number of issues and initiatives; Sudan has made significant progress in improving
the political stalemate with South Sudan, evident in the signing of the Cooperation Agreement in
2012 and the Matrix of Implementation in 2013, which forms a solid framework for permanently
resolving post-secession issues. On internal peace, the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD)
represents a solid milestone which augurs well for stability in Darfur. Finally, the on-going AUHIPbrokered negotiations between the GoS and SPLM-N, as well as the initiation of national dialogue
for inclusive political reform, further demonstrate progress towards consolidation of internal peace
and security.
7.
Furthermore, Sudan has made considerable progress in implementing sound
macroeconomic policy reforms, including bold austerity measures in both 2012 and 2013 and
monetary policies. This has significantly reduced fiscal deficit, and relatively reduced exchange rate
distortions, curbed inflation and stabilized the economy. Openness, transparency and accountability
in the use of public resources are now being strongly strengthened by a Bank-financed project on
public financial management, approved in December 2013. The country has also achieved nearly all
technical milestones for HIPC debt relief as set by the Technical Working Group (TWG) comprising
the Bank, WB, IMF and creditors, Sudan and South Sudan, and the AUHIP as facilitator. Notable
among these milestones are: i) completion of the I-PRSP adopted in 2012; ii) over 90% reconciliation
of external debt in 2012; iii) establishment of debt scenarios in 2012; iv) preparation of an Arrears
Clearance and Debt Relief Strategy (ACDRS) in 2013; v) concluding and initiating the implementation
of new SMP agreed with the IMF in 2014. The Government will use its debt relief strategy to prepare
a coordinated arrears clearance plan for the Bank and the BWIs as soon as it gets positive signals
from creditors on HIPC debt relief.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of September 20, 2014)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Sudan’s current statistical data base appears broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring, but needs further improvements, including upgrading the base year, coverage,
periodicity and timeliness of national accounts data; improving labor market and direct investment
data; and more detailed and comprehensive fiscal accounting. Enhancing the status of the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) with the authority and resources to compile and disseminate official
statistics and coordinate the national statistical work program is important for further statistical
improvements, and should be addressed within the context of the ongoing work in developing a
five-year National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (2012-16). Retooling of the CBS’
computing infrastructure should also be accorded high priority.
National accounts: The CBS lacks a comprehensive data collection program, and relies largely on
administrative reporting which is not optimal for national accounts compilation. Economic surveys
were last conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, and the benchmarks derived from these surveys inform
current estimates of value added. The compilation of GDP by activity depends heavily on indirect
indicators of growth rates and price indicators that are less appropriate. Informal activities are not
covered, and are likely to be significant in areas such as retail trade and construction. Sudan’s
national accounts data are based on the System of National Accounts 1968 (SNA 1968), and the base
year of the existing GDP constant price series (by activity and by expenditure) is 1981. National
accounts statistics are compiled with a lag exceeding three years; and there are no national accounts
or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. On the expenditure side, data are lacking on
final consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks.
The adoption of updated statistical guidelines (SNA 2008), rebasing of the national accounts, and
developing procedures to improve the timeliness of GDP estimates should be among the core
medium-term objectives of Sudan’s national accounts work program. There is an urgent need to
increase funding to the CBS and to rebuild its capacity for conducting household, agricultural and
enterprise surveys.
Price statistics: Practices in the production of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are good. Monthly CPI
data (base year=2007) are provided shortly after the end of each month. However, the CBS should
begin developing plans for a new household expenditure survey to facilitate weight updates to the
existing CPI. The CBS is developing for the first time, a quarterly producer price index (PPI) for
manufactured goods. STA’s recent multisector statistics mission (April 2012) conducted a preliminary
assessment of the methods and procedures for compiling the PPI; and issues regarding the frame
and the sample size were raised with the authorities. The mission also advised on how the base year
weights would need to be adjusted to reflect the reduced contributions of oil to the Sudan
economy.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics reported to MCD are broadly
adequate for program monitoring, with the main revenue, expenditure, and financing items
reported on a monthly basis with a lag of about one and half month. The reported statistics are for
the central government only, and do not include the states and publicly owned corporations. Data
are submitted using an economic classification and, while the allocation of resources by MOFNE to
the various ministries is reported, their actual expenditures are not.
Since STA’s multisector statistics mission (April 2012), there has been a progress in implementing
GFS classifications at the level of state governments. However, there has been no progress in all
other sub-national governments and extra budgetary funds. The responsibility for GFS compilation
and dissemination is assigned to the chamber of account within the MOFNE. There are no
comprehensive data reconciliations on government claims on and liabilities to the banking system;
and the recording of “arrears securities” is not in line with the GFSM guidelines. The compilation of
consolidated GFS for the general government with the objective of producing the statement of
government operations should be a key priority.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS): Sudan has received significant technical assistance to
improve the collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. STA’s
multisector statistics mission (2012) found that all major recommendations made by the previous
MFS mission in 2007 have been implemented. STA fielded two MFS missions —one in October 2012
and another one in January 2014—to assist in addressing data issues and improving the account
classifications in the standardized report forms. The current coverage of Sudan’s monetary statistics
includes the CBOS and 32 commercial banks, which constitute the other depository corporations
(ODCs). Due to South Sudan’s secession, the Bank of South Sudan (BOSS) and the conventional
banks operating in South Sudan were excluded from the coverage of the CBOS and the ODCs,
respectively, beginning with July 2011 data. The revised monthly statistical return has been used by
all commercial banks to report data for compiling monetary statistics. However, stronger efforts are
needed to improve the consistency in reporting of inter-bank data. Going forward, the CBOS should
also develop a work program for collecting and compiling data on insurance corporations and
pension funds for inclusion in Sudan’s monetary statistics.
External sector statistics: Daily exchange rate data are posted on the CBOS’ web page with
minimal lags. There are several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with
regard to direct investment (DI), external debt arrears, remittances, goods and services, capital
transfers and oil statistics. The lack of survey data continues to affect the compilation of important
balance of payments and IIP items such as DI. The implementation of a DI survey has been delayed
due to the lack of financing. Consistency between external sector statistics and monetary and
financial statistics needs to be further improved, in particular regarding the recording of reserve
assets (ongoing) and the treatment of Fund accounts. Compilation of the data template on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity should be initiated. During the last METAC
mission it was clarified that CBOS’s earmarked reserves are not readily available; therefore they are
not to be classified as reserve assets. Currently only the SDR holdings, reserve position in the Fund,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SUDAN

and foreign currency holdings at CBOS vaults are reserve assets.
STA’s 2012 multisector statistics mission assisted the CBOS in improving the compilation of a
number of balance of payments and IIP items. METAC is providing ongoing support to improve the
accuracy and consistency of external sector statistics. The CBOS should resubmit BOP and IIP data to
STA including significant corrections discussed in the last METAC mission.
Data Standards and Quality
Sudan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since August 2003. GDDS
metadata and plans for improvement need to be updated. No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA
Annual data reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover only budgetary central
government up to 1999. No monthly and quarterly fiscal data are reported for the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). The reporting of external trade statistics for inclusion in the Direction of
Trade Statistics (DOTS) database is done with significant lags. National accounts data are not
provided for publication in the IFS. The CBOS has compiled and reported to STA for publication in
the IFS, the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR for the central bank and 2SR for ODCs. However,
timeliness of data reporting and dissemination should be improved. The CBOS also reports to STA,
quarterly balance of payments and annual IIP data. As a follow up the STA’s recent multisector
statistics mission, the authorities should submit updated GDDS metadata for dissemination on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE
STAFF MONITORED PROGRAM—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Adnan Mazarei and
Ranil Salgado (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)and the International Development Association (IDA)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Sudan continues to be in debt distress.1 Both
public and external debt ratios remained high, and most of the external debt is in arrears.
Consistent with the results of past DSAs, Sudan’s debt is assessed to be unsustainable. All
external debt indicators breach their indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, and many
of them stayed above the thresholds throughout the time horizon of the analysis. It is therefore
critical for Sudan to follow sound economic policies, including a prudent borrowing strategy, and
to continue garnering support for debt relief.

[This DSA update was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff under the joint Fund-Bank Low-Income
Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).] Sudan’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
Rating averaged 2.34 for 2011-13 and falls under the weak performer category. Sudan’s fiscal year runs from
January 1 to December 31.

SUDAN

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Sudan’s economy has yet to recover from the shock of South Sudan’s secession in 2011.
Sudan lost three-quarters of oil production, two-thirds of exports, and half of fiscal revenues in the
secession. A heavy debt burden, international sanctions, and volatile domestic and regional political
environments continue to weigh on economic performance. Growth has been subdued and inflation was
high since the secession.
2.
Economic performance in the first half of 2014 was mixed. Under a new staff-monitored
program (SMP) with the IMF for the year 2014, the authorities have tightened fiscal and monetary policy
stances. Government borrowings from the central bank was reduced, reserve money growth slowed (albeit
higher than the program target), and international reserves increased marginally. However, inflation
remains stubbornly high, affected by past energy price hikes, exchange rate devaluation, and continued
supply disruptions due to conflict. There is a large gap between the parallel market rate and the official
exchange rate.
3.
The “zero-option” and prospects for debt relief. Debt relief prospects are predicated on
reaching out to creditors, normalizing relations with international financial institutions, and establishing a
track record of cooperation with the IMF on policies and payments. As for the “zero-option”2, the Sudanese
authorities have indicated that they have agreed with South Sudan to extend the deadline for another 2
years till October 2016 in order to avoid immediate apportionment of debt between the two countries. In
the meantime, they will step up outreach efforts to creditors to garner support for debt relief.

STRUCTURE OF DEBT
4.
Sudan’s external debt remained very high as of end-2013.3 In nominal terms, it amounted to
about US$45 billion (79 percent of GDP), of which about 85 percent was in arrears (Error! Reference
source not found.). The structure of external debt has not changed over the last decade. The bulk is public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt (US$43.4 billion, of which 88 percent in arrears), mainly owed to
bilateral creditors and roughly equally divided between Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors (Figure 2).
Only a small fraction is private debt owed to suppliers (US$1.6 billion).

2

Sudan retained all the external debt under the “zero-option” following the secession of South Sudan, provided that
(i) South Sudan joined Sudan in outreach efforts for debt relief, and (ii) the international community gave firm
commitments to the delivery of debt relief. The deadline for these conditions to be met was set at September 2014. If
the conditions are not met, Sudan’s external debt would be apportioned between the two countries, based on a
formula to be determined within six months from the deadline.
3

Debt data were provided by the Sudanese authorities, complemented by information obtained during the 2011
external debt reconciliation exercise as well as Fund and World Bank staffs’ estimates.

5.
External public borrowing has been limited in recent years (Table 1). Sudan has been largely
cut off from access to external financing due to its arrears with the creditors. It has been only able to
contract new debt—below 1 percent of GDP per year in 2012-14—with a limited number of multilateral
and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. The newly contracted debt has been mainly used to finance projects
in the agriculture, services and energy sectors. In the first half of 2014, some US$152 million of new debt
(0.2 percent of GDP) was contracted, including US$99 million from a multilateral creditor and US$53 million
from bilateral creditors. The new debt contracted is within the annual limit of US$600 million under the
SMP. There has not been any new private external debt in decades.

Sudan’s total public debt reached 91 percent of GDP by end-2013. The bulk of the public debt
is external debt. Domestic debt has been on the rise due to increased domestic financing of the budget,
albeit to a still relatively low level (13 percent of GDP).

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Underlying Assumptions
7.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA have been updated based on
developments in 2013 and the first half of 2014 (Box 1). The differences compared to the
macroeconomic framework in 2013 DSA are driven by: (i) lower growth and higher inflation outturns in
2013 relative to previous projections; (ii) the impact of the policy measures carried out in September 2013,
including a step devaluation in the official SDG/USD exchange rate and increases in domestic fuel prices;
and (iii) outturns in the first half of 2014. Both the fiscal and current account deficits are projected to be
lower than in the previous DSA over the medium term, reflecting improved fiscal performance as well as
higher oil-related revenues from South Sudan. As in previous DSAs, this DSA update does not base its
baseline or any alternative scenario projections on speculations about the timing and magnitude of arrears
clearance, possible external debt relief or debt apportionment between Sudan and South Sudan.
Box 1. Sudan: Macroeconomic Assumptions 2014-34
Natural resources. The outlook is informed by discussions with the Ministries of Oil and Mining. Oil production is projected at 127
thousand barrels/day in 2014, a moderate increase from 119 thousand barrels/day in 2013. Enhanced recovery in existing fields and
further exploration will likely help production to further increase over the medium term, reaching a peak of 210 thousand
barrels/day in 2020 before it start to gradually decline. Meanwhile, annual production of gold is projected to increase by 3 percent
per year until 2020 stable afterwards. Price projections are guided by the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO). Price for
Sudan’s crude oil is projected to average at US$91/barrel, and remains stable at US$87/barrel in the longer term.
Real sector. The real GDP growth rate is expected to gradually increase to 4.7 percent until 2019 and then to average 4.2 percent
over 2020–34. Medium term real GDP growth mainly reflects a strengthening non-oil sector led by the agriculture and mining
sectors under macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms in the areas of business environment, education and health, and
1

reducing unemployment . Inflation, as measured by GDP deflator, is projected to be high in the near term, but will stabilize over the
medium term; it averages at 15 percent in 2014-19 and 5½ percent in 2020-34.
Fiscal sector. The fiscal deficit is projected to improve over the medium term, reflecting a combination of improvements in tax
revenue collection, increase in oil revenues, and containment of current spending, including a gradual phasing out of fuel subsidies.
Over the long run, the fiscal d eficit is expected to average some 1 percent of GDP, reflecting (i) a gradual increase in tax revenues,
against the backdrop of decreasing oil revenues and (ii) increase in capital spending. Domestic debt to GDP ratio is projected to be
stable under the growth and fiscal performance assumptions.
External sector. The current account deficit is expected to improve slightly over the medium term, reaching 5 percent of GDP by
end-2019, reflecting further fiscal consolidation as well as growth in oil and non-oil exports. In the long run it is expected to be
stable at 5-6 percent of GDP as oil exports decline while non-oil exports continue to increase. The current account deficit will be
financed by foreign direct investment and continued accumulation of external debt arrears.
External debt. Reflecting continued limited access to international finance and a deteriorating debt service capacity, disbursements
of new loans are expected to be limited, at about 0.4 percent of GDP during 2013–33. In line with the recent portfolio of new
contracted debt, the share of new concessional loans is kept at around one third. It is assumed that Sudan will continue to fail to
service obligations arising from the stock of arrears.

B. External Debt Sustainability
8.
Sudan’s external debt stock remains unsustainable under the baseline scenario (Figure A1
and Table A1). All PPG external debt level ratios continue to breach their indicative thresholds throughout
the 20-year projection period. The present value (PV) of PPG external debt is at 125 percent of GDP at end2013—more than four times of the 30 percent threshold for weak policy performers—and is projected to
stay above 60 percent of GDP through the projection period. Similarly, both the PV of debt-to-exports and
the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios are above 1300 percent in 2014, well above their respective thresholds.
Although these ratios are projected to improve based on the assumptions of robust growth and limited
external borrowing over the medium to long run, such improvements are insufficient to bring debt to
sustainable levels.
9.
In addition, Sudan’s debt outlook is vulnerable to a range of shocks (Figure A1 and Table A2).
The PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-revenue and debt service-to-revenue ratios are most vulnerable to a onetime depreciation shock, whereas the PV of debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports ratios are most
vulnerable to an exports shock. A standard one-time 30 percent depreciation shock in 2015 would increase
the PV-of-debt to more than 160 percent of GDP in that year, and result in a permanently upward shift in
the debt path.

C. Public Debt Sustainability
10.
Public DSA results mirrors those of the external DSA (Figure A2 and Tables A3). The debt ratios,
albeit declining, converge to relatively high levels in the long term. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to stay well above the indicative benchmark throughout the projection period. Similar to the
external DSA, the public DSA bound tests show that public debt path is most vulnerable to a one-time
30 percent real depreciation (Table A4).

CONCLUSIONS
11.
Sudan remains in debt distress. The results of this DSA are broadly unchanged from those in
previous DSAs. External debt remains unsustainable. Over the long term, all public and public-guaranteed
external debt burden ratios remain well above their respective indicative thresholds (except for the debt
service ratios at the end of the projection horizon). Public debt is also unsustainable, driven mostly by
external debt dynamics.
12.
Further efforts are needed for Sudan to obtain much-needed debt relief and regain access
to external financing. Sudan needs to: (i) step up outreach efforts to its creditors to garner broad support
for debt relief; (ii) continue to cooperate with the IMF on economic policies and payments with a view to
establish a track record of sound macro policies; and (iii) limit new borrowing on non-concessional terms as
much as possible, since it further increases the future debt burden, and secure foreign support on highly
concessional terms to finance necessary development and infrastructure expenditures.
13.
The authorities generally agree with the results and assessments of the DSA. They agree that
Sudan’s external debt is at unsustainable levels, debt service burdens are beyond Sudan debt servicing
capacity, and as a result Sudan continues to accumulate external debt arrears. They agree that nonconcessional borrowing is costly and therefore should be minimized. They reiterated that debt relief is

urgently needed for Sudan’s economic development, and remain hopeful that international community will
support Sudan to secure a debt relief in the near future. In this regard, the authorities will step up their
efforts in reaching out to creditors.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Sudan and Second
Review under Staff Monitored Program

On December 3, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Sudan.
Sudan’s economy has yet to recover from the shock of South Sudan’s secession three years ago,
which took away three-quarters of oil production, half of its fiscal revenues, and two-thirds of its
international payments capacity. In March 2014, Sudan reached understandings with IMF staff
on a staff-monitored program (SMP) for 2014 (See Press Release No. 14/139). The program is
consistent with the government’s emergency three-year strategy adopted in the wake of 2011
South Sudan secession and aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen social safety
nets, and create condition for sustainable and inclusive growth. Macroeconomic adjustment has
been complicated by structural weaknesses, a heavy debt burden, external sanctions, and volatile
domestic and regional political environments, which affect confidence and investment.
Economic performance in 2014 has been mixed. Growth remains relatively low, and inflation
high. The budget deficit has narrowed compared with 2013 on account of improved revenue
collection and tight expenditure control. Growth in monetary aggregates has slowed significantly
from the end of 2013. Following a large appreciation of the parallel market exchange rate and a
small devaluation of the official exchange rate, the gap between those rates has declined
considerably. The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 6.5 percent of GDP on
account of continued fiscal consolidation.
Implementation of the authorities’ adjustment program should help restore macroeconomic
stability and improve growth prospects over the medium term. Driven by agriculture, minerals,
and oil, growth is expected to accelerate gradually to about 4.7 percent in 2019. With prudent
macroeconomic policies, inflation is expected to fall to single digits by 2017. The external
current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow toward sustainable levels. However, the
external debt overhang and the large arrears, along with protracted political transition and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

unsettled regional civil conflicts will continue to hinder access to external financing and weigh
on growth prospects.
Resolving Sudan’s unsustainable external debt is of paramount importance for the successful
adjustment to the impact of South Sudan’s secession, implementation of the government’s
poverty reduction policies, and for supporting inclusive growth. The key pillar of the
requirements for debt relief is normalization of relations with external creditors, including the
Fund, other multilateral institutions, and bilateral creditors. In this regard, it is critical for the
authorities to reach out to their external creditors, including under the framework of the Joint
Approach with South Sudan and the African Union High-level Implementation Panel. The recent
agreement between the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to extend the “zero option” for
another two years till October 2016 is a welcome step2.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors noted a gradual improvement in Sudan’s macroeconomic performance
despite difficult economic and social conditions related to South Sudan’s secession and political
insecurity. Directors welcomed Sudan’s continued engagement with the Fund under the staffmonitored program (SMP). They encouraged the authorities to sustain the reform momentum in
order to reduce macroeconomic imbalances, foster resilience, and promote broad-based,
inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance in the first half of 2014, which helped
create fiscal space for much-needed social and investment outlays. They called for a
consolidation of recent gains, through a further streamlining of low-priority expenditures and
enhanced revenue mobilization, and recommended cuts in tax exemptions and reform of goldrelated taxation, as well as a reduction in fuel subsidies. Directors cautioned that the decline in
subsidies should also be accompanied by reinforced social safety nets, to help safeguard the poor
and vulnerable and enhance the success of the economic reforms. They noted that an integrated
public financial management system would be critical to modernize the budgetary framework
and improve fiscal governance.
Directors called for a tightening of the monetary stance and strengthening of the monetary policy
framework, to contain high inflation. They encouraged continued use of reserve money as the
nominal anchor, and advised that monetization of the budget deficit and unsterilized gold
purchases be curtailed. Directors noted that reforms to strengthen the independence of the central
bank would help bolster monetary policy credibility.
2

In September 2012, Sudan and South Sudan reached the so-called “zero option” agreement under which Sudan
would retain all the external liabilities after the secession of South Sudan, provided that the international community
gave firm commitments to the delivery of debt relief to Sudan within two years. Absent such a commitment,
Sudan’s external debt would be apportioned based on a formula to be determined.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

While welcoming the recent adjustment of the official exchange rate, Directors called for
enhanced exchange rate flexibility to help eliminate the parallel market rate premium and
improve the availability of foreign exchange, to rebuild international reserves and promote
external competitiveness. They considered remaining exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices unhelpful in addressing the underlying external imbalances, and
recommended their removal.
Directors encouraged the authorities to advance structural reforms to foster sustained and
inclusive growth. They supported reforms to strengthen the business environment and the legal
framework for private investment, including improvements to the AML/CFT regime and
implementation of other policies identified in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Directors recognized that the external debt overhang weighs heavily on the country’s
development. They welcomed the recent extension to September 2016 of the “Zero Option”
agreement, whereby Sudan retains all the external liabilities after South Sudan’s secession
conditional upon receipt of commitment to debt relief from the international community within
two years. Directors supported continued joint outreach to creditors with South Sudan and the
African Union High Level implementation Panel, to help garner support for debt relief. They
encouraged Sudan to minimize non-concessional borrowing, avoid selective debt servicing, and
continue strengthening the cooperation with the IMF on policies and payments.

IMF Management Concludes the Second Review under the Staff-Monitored Program
for Sudan
On November 19, the Management of the International Monetary Fund completed the second
review under the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP)1 with Sudan.
Despite the major challenges facing Sudan, performance under the SMP, which expires at
end–2014, has been satisfactory. The authorities met all June quantitative targets under the
SMP, except for reserve money growth, which the authorities are taking corrective measures
to address. On structural reforms, the authorities adopted an amended law on Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and closed all government accounts
in commercial banks. They continue to minimize non-concessional borrowing and maintain
satisfactory track record of payments to the Fund as agreed under the SMP. Fund
Management welcomes the authorities’ commitment to meeting the program’s objectives.
The outlook for the rest of 2014 remains favorable. Non-oil growth is projected at 2.9 percent
as gold extraction is expected to be strong and agriculture to rebound due to favorable
weather. Inflation is expected to drop to 29 percent by year-end from 47 percent in July as
the one-off effects of the September 2013 fuel price increases dissipate, monetary policy is
tightened, and food prices decline owing to the expected good harvest. The fiscal deficit is
expected to narrow to about 1.0 percent of GDP. The outlook for 2015 has improved but is
subject to domestic and regional risks. Real GDP growth is projected at 3.4 percent supported
by a good harvest, robust gold production, and the recovery of oil production.
The authorities’ medium-term program focuses on policies and reforms to reduce inflation,
increase international reserves and achieve high and inclusive economic growth. The
implementation of the government’s medium-term program faces challenges, including a
dearth of external financing, economic sanctions, and an unsustainable external debt burden.

An SMP is an agreement between country authorities and Fund staff to monitor the implementation of the
authorities’ economic program. SMPs do not entail financial assistance or endorsement by the IMF Executive
Board.

Sudan is in debt distress with most of its external debt in arrears. Debt relief prospects are
predicated on normalizing relations with international creditors. In this context, Sudan has to
intensify efforts, jointly with South Sudan, to secure broad support for comprehensive debt
relief from Sudan’s bilateral external creditors. The agreement between the governments of
Sudan and South Sudan to extend the deadline for the “zero option” for two more years is
positive in this regard.2
IMF staff will continue to provide the authorities with policy advice in implementing and
monitoring their economic program. The IMF will also continue to provide technical
assistance to Sudan to help strengthen institutional capacity for economic management.

In September 2012, Sudan and South Sudan reached the so-called “zero option” agreement under which Sudan
would retain all the external liabilities after the secession of South Sudan, provided that the international
community gave firm commitments to the delivery of debt relief to Sudan within two years. Absent such a
commitment, Sudan’s external debt would be apportioned based on a formula to be determined.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive
Director for Sudan, and Ms. Serero, Advisor
to Executive Director for Sudan
December 3, 2014
The Sudanese economy continues to grapple with the economic shock brought about by the
secession of South Sudan in 2011; and the resultant significant contraction in public finances,
creating a massive fiscal imbalance and significantly reducing their capacity in international
payments. In addition, the challenging domestic and regional political environment; a huge
debt burden; and the protracted US and other international economic sanctions, make it even
more difficult for Sudan to recover from the effects of loss of oil revenues. The authorities are
implementing a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) which serves to anchor the macroeconomic
framework, support their reform program, rebuild donor and investor confidence
and lead to macroeconomic stability.
Sudan is one of the remaining HIPC eligible countries, which is yet to receive debt relief.
The authorities anticipate that the SMP would support their efforts to fulfill conditions
required to reach a decision point under the HIPC initiative, though they are greatly
disappointed with the lack of progress by the international community in granting them debt
relief, as part of the ‘Zero Option’ Agreement.
Recent Economic Developments
Inflation has dropped drastically from an average of 45 percent between May and August, to
an annual rate of 39 percent in September and 28 percent in October. The significant decline
in the September inflation was largely driven by the dissipation of the effects of fuel price
increases a year ago. In October, the drop in inflation is attributed to an appreciation of the
parallel exchange rate, and the increased foreign exchange inflows on the backdrop of higher
exports of livestock and the receipt of oil transit fees from South Sudan.
Performance under the Program
The program remains on track, with all end-June quantitative targets met, while the indicative
target on reserve money was missed due to excess liquidity arising from purchases
of gold by the central bank. Structural benchmarks for end September are on track, and as
part of the commitment to eventually align the official and the parallel exchange rate, the
authorities have devalued the official rate by up to 3 percent since September, 2014. In

2
addition, the authorities have remained committed to making payments to the Fund and
minimizing non-concessional borrowing.
The Near to Medium Term Outlook
The agricultural and gold sectors are expected to continue to boom until year end, leading to
a stronger recovery in the export sector. In addition, a good harvest is expected to continue to
ease pressure on food prices, and drive the overall inflation further down, while the parallel
exchange rate is expected to decrease further and stabilize at its normal rate The budget deficit
is expected to decline from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1 percent in 2014, in tandem
with the reduction in the non-oil primary deficit, and maintain the reduction in
government borrowing from the central bank. These positive developments are expected to
continue in 2015, pushing growth slightly up to 3.5 percent and inflation further down to
about 20 percent.
Growth is expected to continue rising gradually from about 4 percent in 2016 to nearly 5
percent in 2019 due to a combination of; retained momentum in the agriculture, mining and
oil sectors and implementation of the adjustment program. However, this positive prognosis
may be reversed by challenges in security and political environment both, domestically and
in the region.
Fiscal Policy
Despite the improved fiscal performance in the first half of 2014, the fiscal space remains
tight and macroeconomic imbalances continue. However, the authorities remain committed to
applying concerted efforts, critical to restoration of fiscal stability. In this regard, the
authorities will adhere to a fiscal program that promotes fiscal consolidation, mobilizes
additional revenue and eases the debt burden. The program aims to narrow the budget deficit
by reining in fuel subsidies, by way of gradual elimination, while at the same time, containing
the wage bill. This would free up some resources to be used in increasing social sector
spending in order to enhance social safety nets to protect the vulnerable and support
public investment to reinvigorate inclusive economic growth and create employment.
To boost public revenues, the authorities will strengthen the tax policy and administration,
and rationalize tax exemptions, with the view to improve revenue collections. This process
would be guided by the recently completed recommendations of the Tax and Customs
Committee Review, and would be taken into account during the formulation of the 2015
public budget. In addition, the rise in fuel prices implemented through the September 2013
reforms package will make a positive contribution to domestic revenue mobilization efforts.
The authorities are also implementing public finance management reforms which aim to
improve budget classification and fiscal reporting, and develop a medium term fiscal
framework to enhance budget planning and preparation. Overall, the reforms would facilitate
planning, execution and monitoring of the budget, and contribute to the envisaged reduction
in the overall fiscal balance.

3
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
Despite the dramatic reductions experienced in recent months, inflation remains too high.
Therefore, in line with advice from staff, the authorities have committed to a tight policy
stance to mitigate any buildup of inflationary pressures. They also aim to restrict the
monetization of the fiscal deficit to program targets, and mop excess liquidity arising from
gold purchases by the central bank at the parallel exchange rate, and substitute reserve money
growth for the official exchange rate, as a nominal anchor.
The fiscal shock and other underlying economic fundamentals necessitated the adoption of
some temporary relief measures, including the subsidization of imports of basic necessities
such as wheat, fuel and medical supplies. This development arose from the need to protect
the poor and the most vulnerable.
The authorities agree with Staff on the need to bridge the gap between the official and the
parallel rate and eventually move to a flexible exchange regime. However, the authorities are
mindful of the social sensitivities around hikes in the price some imported goods. Experience
has also shown that a devaluation of the official rate could lead to further depreciation of the
parallel exchange rate. Under these circumstances, the authorities are more comfortable with
a cautious and gradual closure of the gap between the two rates, at a pace commensurate with
conducive domestic economic conditions.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are implementing a number of structural reforms to help stimulate the
economy. Reforms to the business climate are expected to promote private sector investment,
job creation and growth of the economy. In addition, banking sector reforms will improve
financial intermediation and access to commercial bank lending by the private sector. With
respect to poverty alleviation, the authorities are implementing policies included in the
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, while the preparation of a full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper is in progress. The authorities will continue to implement reforms in areas of
human capital development in order to improve labor productivity.
Public Debt and Debt Relief
Sudan’s public debt levels have reached unsustainable levels, and the debt burden continues
to rise with the accumulation of arrears and the need for credit to fund development
expenditure and the provision of social safety nets. Under the SMP, the authorities have
committed to a limited nonconcessional external borrowing, though prospects for
concessional borrowing remain low, and access to credit remains tight. As extensively
discussed in our previous Buff Statements, the high debt burden is exerting a toll on
government and its citizenry. Therefore, the need for debt relief in Sudan remains urgent and
critical to restore macroeconomic stability.
The authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the original deadline for the
‘Zero Option’ elapsed without debt relief for Sudan. It is regrettable that the 14 satisfactory

4
SMPs, the implementation of policies of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP),
external debt reconciliation, and adherence to repayment to the Fund, have all failed to
advance the process of achieving debt relief. Nevertheless, the authorities have agreed with
South Sudan, to extend the deadline for the ‘Zero Option’ to September 2016, in part, to
allow time for South Sudan to address the ongoing internal challenges. Both countries will
step up efforts in outreach to Sudan’s creditors.
Article VIII Proposed Decision
Staff has determined that some aspects of Sudan’s exchange rate policy are subject to
approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3(i) of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Sudan is still suffering from the debilitating effects of oil revenue loss, due to the secession
of South Sudan. As a result, the central bank still faces shortages of foreign exchange, hence
the capacity to make international repayments remains limited. Therefore, the short term
measures implemented to address the balance of payments problems are still relevant.
To this effect, my Sudanese authorities request the support of the Executive Board in
approving the ‘Proposed Decision’ on page 26 of the Staff Report. This would allow them
the necessary time to devise an appropriate strategy to phase out the interventions.
Conclusion
The authorities broadly agree with staff that a combination of tight monetary and fiscal
policies, and the move towards a single flexible exchange rate, could go a long way in
correcting the prevailing macroeconomic imbalances. At the same time, the authorities
recognize that reforms to the exchange rate policy should be undertaken within the context of
a framework that simultaneously addresses reforms to both fiscal and monetary policies. To
this end, they are committed to implementing prudential macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms to foster macroeconomic stability, sustain the growth momentum and
reduce poverty.
The authorities are also committed to normalize relations with the development partners and
expect to be accorded debt relief as other countries which have benefited from the HIPC
initiative.
