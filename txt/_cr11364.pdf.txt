KEY ISSUES
Context. With the recovery well advanced, policies have gradually moved to a
tightening stance. The pace of the policy tightening must be balanced, with a need to
sustain economic growth under possibly significant external headwinds.
Monetary policy. The supportive monetary policy stance remains appropriate given a
negative output gap, well-anchored inflationary expectations, the ongoing fiscal
consolidation, and a challenging global environment. The monetary authority has some
room to adjust policies in response to a deterioration in the outlook or renewed
turbulence in international markets.
Fiscal policy. The authorities have appropriately shifted toward fiscal consolidation.
The federal government is leading the initial fiscal effort, and regional governments are
expected to follow suit. Canada has room to respond flexibly to changes in the
economic outlook, including by allowing full operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers
should the recovery falter. A temporary stimulus could also be considered in a major
downside scenario.
Managing elevated household debt and housing prices. The authorities are closely
monitoring the housing market and have adopted macro-prudential measures to curb
mortgage growth; however, additional measures may be needed in the event of further
sustained increases in household debt and house prices, currently at historically high
levels.
Financial Sector. The Canadian banking sector is in a solid position and has weathered
well the recent volatility in international financial markets. External headwinds pose the
main risk to the financial system, especially if they were to lead to a protracted period
of high unemployment. The authorities have appropriate instruments to quickly
provide liquidity in response to distress in global markets.

authorities consider the current Assets to

changes to the ACM are appropriate in the
future to simplify dual reporting of leverage
and to adapt the ACM to elements of the

liquidity standards under Basel III may prove to
be more challenging, although these standards
have not yet been fully defined. The authorities
have endorsed both the liquidity coverage

completion of an observation period for
subsequent revisions of existing domestic
regulations. Their expectation is that Canadian
banks should be able to gradually satisfy the

The authorities are committed to

keeping the adoption of a national

the development of CCPs for repo and OTC

securities regulator was referred to the
Supreme Court for review and a decision is still
pending. The eventual adoption of the draft
will require substantial coordination across
provinces and the federal authorities, and a
transitional office is currently in charge of
harmonizing provincial rules. The authorities
expect to launch the national regulator in
2012, with most provinces expected to join.
Progress toward the establishment of a central
counterparty (CCP) for repo markets is on
track, which will help reduce counterparty risk
and enhance transparency. For OTC
derivatives, authorities are evaluating a shift
towards global clearing houses. They noted

Box 1. A Decade of Waning External Competitiveness
The external trade balance has been deteriorating
gradually over the last decade, after reaching a
record high surplus in 2000–01. In the 1990s, Canada
faced a boom in external trade, benefiting from a large
depreciation of the currency and bilateral trade
agreements (CUSFTA/NAFTA), leading to a trade surplus
close to 6 percent of GDP. After 2001, however, exports
declined sharply as a share of GDP, even though Canada
faced very favorable terms of trade in 2003–08. Since
2009, the trade balance has reverted to a deficit.
Although non-energy exports were hit the hardest
during the recent crisis, weak export performance
started well before 2007. Between 2000 and 2007,
merchandise exports excluding energy grew at an
average annual rate of 0.4 percent. Subsequently,
exports collapsed with the crisis and have remained well
below pre-2008 levels. Non-energy export volumes are
more than 10 percent below 2000 levels, while total
merchandise exports are about 6 percent lower than a
decade ago.



Weak labor productivity growth vis-à-vis foreign
peers such as the U.S., U.K., and Japan. There are
several possible explanations for the productivity
lag, including abundant labor supply (and low
incentives to invest in human capital), low
investment in business R&D, and excess capacity
built in the 1990s in the manufacturing sector as
firms expected to keep a solid presence abroad.

220

The weaker export performance in some key
markets in the U.S. (the largest trade partner by
far) also coincided with gains from emerging
economies, especially China. Since 2000, Canada’s
market share of U.S. imports has dropped by 40–
50 percent in key sectors such as machinery,
transportation, and manufacturing goods—
suggesting that increased competition from lowcost countries also contributed to Canadian firms’
poor performance abroad.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. General Government Gross and Net Debt
Canada has the lowest general government (GG)
net debt among G-7 economies, reflecting
substantial holdings of financial assets. At end2010, gross debt of the GG amounted to 85 percent
of GDP, while net debt amounted to only 30 percent.
Less than half of the debt is owed by the federal
government and the remainder by the provinces and
local governments. From 2007–10, gross debt of the
GG rose by almost 20 percentage points and net
debt by 7 percentage points, as government claims
on Crown corporations (mainly loans and equity on
SOEs, and foreign exchange reserves) rose
significantly. At present, these claims account for
40 percent of total GG financial assets.
The increase in the gross debt of the federal
government in recent years reflects both fiscal
deficits and loans to Crown corporations. At the
federal level, gross debt reached 41¼ percent of
GDP in 2010, while net debt was 25½ percent of
GDP. The difference is mainly explained by large
loans to Crown corporations since the beginning of
the crisis. Of these, government loans to the Canada
Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC) now
represent about 30 of its total financial assets. The
CMHC loans provided support to the mortgage
market through the purchase of mortgage pools (the
so-called IMPP program), which are expected to be
repaid by 2015. Other sizable financial assets at the
federal level include accrued tax receipts not yet
collected and loans to international institutions.
The provinces and local governments have
relatively high financial assets. While their total
gross debt amounted to 52 percent of GDP in 2010,
their net debt was only 16 percent of GDP. The
substantial financial assets of sub-national
governments include: (i) investments in domestic and
foreign bonds and shares (around half of total assets,
in part reflecting Alberta’s oil fund); (ii) government
claims for about 20 percent of total; and (iii)
receivables (mainly accrued tax revenues to be
distributed by the federal government), loans, and
cash reserves.

Box 4. Rising Health Care Spending Pressures
The health care system in Canada is
predominantly publicly-financed and
decentralized to the provinces. Public health care
expenditures, representing about 70 percent of total
health expenditures, are estimated to have increased
to around 8½ percent of GDP in 2009–10. Health
expenditures have increased rapidly in the 2000s
mainly reflecting high health care inflation (due in
part to rising earnings of health care professionals),
technological changes (which contributed to rising
hospital and prescription drug costs), and to a lesser
degree demographic factors (ageing).1 The cash
component of the “Canada Health Transfer” from the
federal government to the provinces and territories
finances about 20 percent of provincial public health
spending.
The rise in public health expenditures is the most
important long-term fiscal challenge faced by
Canada, as in other advanced economies. The
share of health spending in provincial budgets has
been steadily rising and accounts for close to
40 percent of total program spending. The Canadian

Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) projects that
health and other ageing-related expenditures will
rise substantially over the next decades as a
consequence of health care inflation and as the
effects of population ageing intensify. The annual
contribution of ageing factors to public health
spending growth would rise from 0.9 percentage
points in 2010 to 1.2 percentage points by 2032, and
decline gradually after that. Even abstracting from
ageing, the PBO assumes that health spending
would grow faster than nominal GDP (0.4 percent a
year, in line with the 1976–2010 average). As a
consequence, public health expenditures would
reach 13 percent of GDP around 2050 and
15 percent of GDP by 2085. In addition, annual
federal elderly benefits are projected to rise by
1 percent of GDP by 2035/36 under the PBO study.
The pressures from health and other ageing-related
spending would hence lead to a substantial increase
in the deficit and public debt over the long term if
no compensatory spending or revenue measures
were taken.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards in
the Financial System

www.imf.org

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported by
a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with major
international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few recommendations to
further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial system’s resilience, most of
which have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or senior
officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on a number
of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad compliance with the
Basel Core Principles;

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly created
association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators. Although
there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate commission was created
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

to develop specific recommendations on further harmonization and streamlining of
securities regulation.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report No. 02/51,
03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the requirements
of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents best practice. In
particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts. Fiscal management
was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax administration, open
procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and provincial
budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the procedures for the
budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic reporting of the use
of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of publication of reconciled
national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates over the forecast horizon,
and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics Canada
of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a Financial
Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive descriptions of budget
and expenditure management procedures, including a joint document entitled
“Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed accounts of policies
and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the Treasury Board
Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in Budget and Update
documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate
and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies.
Official institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the
macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and institutional frameworks.
These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that statistical work is conducted
within a quality assurance program and with sufficient resources. Integrity is ensured by
the professionalism of the staff, transparency in statistical policies and practices, and the
provision of ethical guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow internationally
accepted guidelines in the production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is wellsupported by excellent efforts to develop source data that facilitate a high degree of
accuracy and reliability. Statistics are generally relevant, well documented, available with
good frequency on a timely basis, and readily accessible to users, who trust them as
objective.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already
being addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary
and financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs
now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts
(CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing
of Terrorism

IMF Country Report
No. 08/372, 12/11/08

Summary: Canada underwent a detailed FATF evaluation of its anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2007. Shortcomings
were identified with respect to the scope of customer due diligence, AML/CFT
supervision, and the Canadian financial intelligence unit. Since then, a number of steps
have been taken to strengthen the framework in these three areas, resulting in significant
improvements.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 08/59, 02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the major
banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some challenges related
to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there were some concerns
about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to enter highly
competitive foreign markets or complex activities.
The update reiterated the advantages of moving towards a single securities regulator,
including the streamlining of policy development, reductions in compliance costs, and

II. STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness of Canada’s economic data are
considered to be excellent both in the context
of the Article IV consultation and for purposes
of ongoing surveillance. Canada has
subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). The data ROSC was published on
October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely
and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency thereby facilitating the
analysis of economic developments and
assessment of policy proposals within a
quantitative macroeconomic framework. In
May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth
transition from Laspeyres methodology for
estimating real expenditure-based GDP to
Fisher index formulae, which enabled more
accurate comparison between Canada and
other G-7 countries.
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides
quarterly data (a Statement of Government
Operations along with a Balance Sheet) on the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

consolidated general government and its
subsectors following the Government Finance
Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001)
recommendations. In addition, the Department
of Finance Canada provides monthly and
annual data on the federal government’s
budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for
Canada’s banks and other financial institutions,
according to the national presentation. The
provided data enable adequate assessment of
the impact of fiscal policy measures on
Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada
provides timely and adequate coverage of
daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly data
related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides
timely information on a quarterly frequency on
the balance of payments, external debt, and
the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on
Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template,
thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
December 19, 2011
1.
This note reports on information that has become available after the staff report
(SM/11/319) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data points to a mixed picture, with stronger-than-expected GDP
rebound in Q3 but increasing signs the economy is now decelerating. Real GDP grew by
3½ percent (s.a.a.r.) in Q3, after a small contraction in the previous quarter due to one-off
factors. This growth reflected a strong rebound in net exports, while the growth of final
domestic demand weakened. On the other hand, rising unemployment (7.4 percent in
November) and recent activity surveys (such as the October and November manufacturing
PMI) suggest the economy is decelerating. The rebound in net exports led to a decline in
Canada’s current account deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in the third quarter. However,
external trade developments remain volatile, with exports falling by 3 percent in October,
partially reversing the improvement observed in previous months. Inflation fell slightly in
October, with core inflation remaining around the Bank of Canada’s 2 percent target. The
fiscal outturn for Q3 suggests that the general government fiscal deficit is broadly in line
with staff projections.
3.
On December 6, as anticipated, the Bank of Canada left the overnight rate
unchanged at 1 percent. In its statement, the Bank noted that the weaker external outlook
was expected to dampen GDP growth in Canada through the financial, confidence, and trade
channels. While inflation has been somewhat higher than envisaged, inflationary pressures in
the quarters ahead are expected to remain subdued, especially given the existing slack in the
economy.
4.
On November 30, several central banks, including the Bank of Canada, took
further coordinated actions to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity support to the
global financial system. The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the
European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank agreed to lower
the pricing on the existing temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis
points. These swap arrangements have been extended to February 1, 2013. As a contingency
measure, these central banks have also agreed to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap
arrangements, so that liquidity can be provided in each jurisdiction, in any of their currencies,
should market conditions so warrant. The Bank’s December Financial System Review noted
that risks to Canada’s financial system have increased over the last six months, mainly due to
the external environment.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On December 19, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Canada. 1
Background
Thanks to a decisive policy response, a resilient financial sector, and high commodity prices,
the economy expanded well above its potential rate in 2010 and early 2011, with gross
domestic product (GDP) returning to pre-crisis levels in the second half of 2010. The expansion
stalled in the 2nd quarter of 2011, partly due to temporary factors and unfavorable external
conditions, although indicators point to a pick-up in the 3rd quarter. Domestic demand remains
the driver of growth. While government spending and private consumption have slowed,
business investment remains buoyant reflecting low funding costs, cheaper imports of capital
goods, and elevated commodity prices. Unemployment has declined steadily from its 2009
peak, but remains above pre-crisis levels.
The external current account balance deteriorated sharply in recent years, reflecting the effects
of the crisis and a loss of external competitiveness over the last decade, with a deficit of
3 percent of GDP in 2009–10. Exports of autos, machinery, and lumber were particularly
affected by the collapse in U.S. demand, the strength of the Canadian dollar, and competition
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:

from emerging markets. The weak export sector has also hampered a stronger recovery in
private sector employment, especially in manufacturing where employment remains 10 percent
below 2008 levels.
Economic growth is expected to be moderate in the near term, with significant uncertainty
related to the unsettled external environment. While interest rates remain low, growth in
personal consumption and real estate investment is expected to be relatively subdued, in light
of high household debt and measures taken to contain mortgage credit growth. With weak net
exports and ongoing fiscal adjustment, business investment is anticipated to play a key role in
sustaining growth. Threats outside Canada—including further turbulence from Europe and its
impact on global financial markets—are the main source of risk. On the domestic front, high
household debt levels, coupled with elevated house prices, are the main vulnerability.
Monetary policy continues to be highly accommodative given ongoing economic slack and wellmanaged inflationary expectations. The policy rate remains at exceptionally low levels—the
target for overnight rate has been kept at 1 percent since September 2010, and no hikes are
expected in the near future given that core inflation has remained around the inflation target,
inflationary expectations are well anchored, and external risks are high.
Fiscal consolidation is now under way with the federal government leading the efforts. The
authorities envisage a return to budgetary balance by 2015–16 with an ambitious plan to bring
spending as a share of GDP back to pre-crisis levels, while remaining flexible to changes in the
economic outlook.
Canada’s corporate and financial sectors continue to display resilience amid the recent
turbulence in international financial markets, also reflecting strong supervision and regulation.
Despite some recent tightening, credit conditions remain highly favorable, with both firms and
banks taking advantage of funding costs well below historical averages. Banks’ financial
soundness indicators are at strong levels, with near-term risks stemming primarily from potential
spillovers from European markets.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ exemplary macroeconomic management and
financial sector oversight, which have enabled Canada to weather the global crisis well.
Directors noted that the pace of the recovery has slowed, after a strong rebound in 2010. While
Canada’s medium term outlook remains broadly favorable, near term downside risks are high
due to the financial market turmoil in Europe and rising household indebtedness. Accordingly,
policymaking should remain flexible and pragmatic in the period ahead.

3
Directors endorsed the Bank of Canada’s conduct of monetary policy. They agreed that, with
the prevailing economic slack and with core inflation and expectations well within the target
range, monetary policy should continue to be accommodative at present. Most Directors agreed
that there is scope for further monetary easing if the economy weakens. Directors welcomed the
Bank of Canada’s preparedness to respond quickly to liquidity strains in the event of increased
financial turbulence from Europe.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to gradually remove fiscal stimulus and return to
fiscal balance over the medium term. They stressed that provincial governments also need to
move ahead with fiscal consolidation. Most Directors agreed that, within the medium term
consolidation plans, there is space for countercyclical fiscal support if the economic outlook
deteriorates, given the low level of government net debt.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ adoption of macro prudential measures to curb the build up
of mortgage debt. With household debt at a historical high and various indicators suggesting
house price levels above fundamentals in some regions, Directors called for continued vigilance
in this area. Strengthening oversight of the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation will be
particularly important. Directors welcomed the authorities’ willingness to take additional action
should prices and household indebtedness continue to rise.
Directors commended Canada’s strong financial regulation and supervision. This has resulted in
a stable and resilient banking sector, which has resisted the international financial crisis well
and remains well prepared to deal with most adverse scenarios. Nonetheless, Directors called
for continued close monitoring of spillover risks, as well as risks associated with a prolonged
period of exceptionally low global interest rates. Directors welcomed Canada’s leadership in
implementing the international financial reform agenda, and its valuable contributions to
developing new global regulatory standards.
Directors highlighted a gradual loss of external competitiveness over the years and the
importance of reversing this trend, particularly through efforts to improve the business
environment and boost productivity. Directors also stressed the need for a concerted effort to
contain the rising health care costs associated with population aging. The forthcoming review of
transfers from the federal government to the provinces provides an opportunity to address this
issue.
