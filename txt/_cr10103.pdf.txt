EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With the economy transitioning to what is projected to be the post-oil period, discussions
focused on policy adjustments aimed at achieving fiscal sustainability; raising investment
efficiency; improving public financial management; and supporting economic diversification.
Background and outlook
Oil has brought great wealth and growth to the Equatoguinean economy. However, with
crude oil production on the decline and still-large development needs, preparations for the
post-oil period should begin. The authorities’ ambitious public investment program implies
significant government dis-saving over the medium term, to the detriment of external
stability. Longer-term prospects hinge on the successful diversification of the economy.
The authorities’ policies and views


Guided by the National Development Plan 2020, policies aim to build up basic
infrastructure in support of improved social welfare and greater diversification.



There is increasing recognition of the need to increase government savings over the
medium term, but spending commitments reduce the scope for near-term adjustment.



Efforts to strengthen public financial management are being stepped up, through
collaboration with the international community.



Collaboration with banks on financing modalities for SMEs is being discussed, while
support for financial sector development at the regional level continues.



The role of government in economic diversification is that of facilitator. However, in
the near term, it may be necessary to fill gaps left by an unwilling private sector.

Staff’s recommendations


Starting in 2010, steps toward a sustainable fiscal position should be taken to reverse
the projected near-depletion of government savings over the medium term. The
non-oil primary deficit should be brought down to around 40 percent of non-oil GDP.
Such an adjustment is large but feasible, as the envelope covers projects in train with
space for new priority spending. Spending rationalization and right-sizing are needed.



Better public financial management is critical, especially on expenditure control.
Efforts to strengthen transparency and governance should continue.



The exchange rate regime has served the economy well, but unsustainable fiscal
policies pose serious risks to external stability. On reserve holdings, the authorities
should comply with obligations under CEMAC to support the exchange rate peg.



Successful economic diversification requires continued action to strengthen human
capital and improve the business climate; financial sector development is also key.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Oil has brought great wealth and growth to the Equatoguinean economy, but
challenges remain. Real GDP has increased forty-fold since 1995, and large oil revenues
have allowed the government to embark on an ambitious infrastructure investment program
while amassing foreign savings. Basic infrastructure is being developed, and although
achievements in social areas have been muted, expenditure in this area is programmed to rise.
However, with crude oil production on the decline and still-large development needs,
preparations for the post-oil period outside of infrastructure should not be delayed. Longterm prospects will depend on the ability to develop a thriving non-oil sector which provides
growth and employment opportunities.
2.
The discussions focused on policies to safeguard macroeconomic and external
stability as oil revenues wane, while at the same time making progress toward achieving
the wide-ranging goals set forth in the National Development Plan 2008–20 (NDP).
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Background
In 2009, performance of Equatorial Guinea’s oil-based economy was mixed. Oil prices and
production declined, while unprecedented public sector investment buoyed non-oil growth
but sent the fiscal deficit soaring. The external position weakened.
3.
Economic developments continue to be underpinned by hydrocarbon sector
activity and public investment (Figure 1).


Growth in 2009 was driven mainly by continued strong activity in hydrocarbon
derivatives (mostly liquefied natural gas, LNG) and a surge in public investment
(construction, utilities, housing), which more than offset the effect of falling crude oil
production.1 Real GDP is estimated to have expanded by about 5 percent.



Inflation continued to rise to about 7¾ percent, despite falling global food and oil
prices, due to lack of competition in the retail sector, rising public sector wages, and
strong domestic demand.



The external position weakened. The stock of government savings—the relevant
proxy for the international investment position—declined moderately, but remained
large, propped up in part by renewed foreign borrowing. The current account

1

After peaking in 2008, crude oil production fell by 11½ percent in 2009. Outside of oil production, severe
statistical deficiencies call for caution in assessing economic developments.

5
Figure 1. Equatorial Guinea: Recent Economic Developments, 2004-10
In 2009 growth moderated as robust construction
and hydrocarbon derivatives output was offset by
declining oil production.

Lack of competition in local goods markets and strong
demand pushed inflation higher, but real appreciation
was muted by a weakening of the Euro in late 2009.

plummeted, with rising hydrocarbon derivatives exports insufficient to offset falling
crude production, the plunge in oil prices, and the surge in public investment-related
imports. The deficit of about 16 percent of GDP was financed mostly by FDI and
public debt.


The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 4 percent in the 12 months through
December 2009 as late-year weakening of the euro to which the CFA franc is pegged
mitigated the effect of inflation above that of trading partners.

4.
In 2009, over-execution of budgeted capital expenditure led to a substantial
deterioration of the fiscal position, while official foreign assets held at the Bank for
Central African States (BEAC) declined (Figure 2).


The overall fiscal balance shifted into a deficit of 8.0 percent of GDP (versus a
surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in the original budget), while the non-oil primary
deficit (NOPD) plummeted to over 100 percent of non-oil GDP (80 percent of non-oil
GDP in the budget). Foreign borrowing and a drawdown of government savings of
near equal parts financed the deficit.2



Revenue came in nearly on budget as lower oil royalties were offset by customary
over-performance in other areas resulting from conservative budgeting.



Expenditure surged over the course of the year as oil prices recovered, and the
revised budget targets adopted in March were abandoned. Unprecedented spending
under the public investment program (PIP) surpassed the original budget by some
25 percent. Current expenditure rose moderately reflecting a slightly higher wage bill,
some additional spending on goods and services, and the start of implementation of
spending—albeit small—under the Social Needs Fund.



Notwithstanding the relatively modest decline in government savings,
government assets held at BEAC declined by half, with the share held outside the
regional central bank rising to over 70 percent (50 percent in 2008). Gross official
reserves of BEAC are estimated to have declined by about $1.5 billion to
$14.2 billion at end-2009, broadly reflecting the reduction in Equatorial Guinea’s
deposits.

2

The authorities drew $498 million from a $2 billion (nonconcessional) line of credit extended by the Chinese
government in late 2006 to help finance infrastructure for electrification and port enlargement. A $380 million
long-term loan on more concessional terms is being made available to finance housing construction.

5.
Liquidity remained ample, rising toward end year as government spending
increased. Interest rates edged down, in line with declining international rates and an
increase in competition amongst banks for big customers.
6.
The underdeveloped financial system was unscathed by the global financial
turmoil, and appears generally sound. Total outstanding credit at end-2009 was small at
3½ percent of GDP. There is no evidence of capital repatriation by foreign banks, and
exposure to complex derivatives by local subsidiaries was nil. Identified problems in a small,
weaker bank have been broadly resolved by a new strategic partner, and banks report having
no difficulty in meeting new capital requirements.3 While financial sector soundness
indicators do not raise red flags, they are volatile due to the fact that credit to the private
sector is concentrated in very short-term lending to government contractors.4 Increasing use
of certification-prior-to-payment on public projects starting in January 2009 led to a
temporary rise in nonperforming loans, most of which were resolved within six months as
project completion progressed and the government made payments to contractors.
Outlook and Risks
7.
The medium-term outlook is clouded by the onset of declining hydrocarbon
production and a nascent non-oil sector, with policies posing additional risks. With a
negative contribution from oil, overall growth is expected to be significantly lower in the
future than during the oil boom, averaging about 1½ percent (Figure 3). The authorities
expect robust growth in the small nonhydrocarbon sector, as investments in basic
infrastructure begin to bear fruit and new public investments support continued construction
activity. Transportation is projected to grow steadily (ports, roads), with construction of a
second LNG train and hosting of two official regional events providing an additional boost
over the next few years. However, as the PIP winds down and hydrocarbon production tapers
off, activity will increasingly need to be driven by private sector activity, which depends on
the ability to strengthen productivity and improve the business climate. With prospects for
rapid export diversification low, the current account would remain in deficit, mostly
reflecting the large import component of the public investment program. The external
position would weaken, with government savings dropping sharply as falling oil revenues
fail to cover strong planned spending. With the PIP winding down, public external debt
would resume a downward trend post-2012 and remain robust to standard shocks.

4

By end-2012, banks must increase registered capital to 10 billion CFAF (5 billion minimum end-2009).

At end-2009, over 85 percent of lending was short term, with over three-quarters financing construction
related to public investment, backed by what is perceived in most cases to be a government guarantee.
Contractors place little of their own capital at risk as government provides an initial project advance. The
distribution of bank assets between credit and excess reserves tends to swing sharply from month to month,
mirroring advancement in the construction process.

The outlook is subject to significant risks.



The economy will continue to be reliant on oil. A negative oil price shock relative to
the baseline would further weaken the external position and/or necessitate a sharp
fiscal adjustment. Heightened political risk could depress foreign direct investment.



High public investment may not translate into non-oil growth—with over 1,000
projects in the PIP, implementation and absorptive capacity may become strained,
leading to lower investment efficiency than assumed under the baseline.



Diversification of the economy may stall under slow progress on key structural
reforms to improve the business climate, reducing growth prospects.



On the upside, new oil discoveries would increase oil wealth and growth over the
production period, but the fiscal and external sectors would remain highly vulnerable
to oil price volatility.5
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

With the economy transitioning to what is projected to be the post-oil period, discussions
focused on policy adjustments aimed at achieving fiscal sustainability, raising investment
efficiency, improving public financial management, and supporting economic diversification.

Oil exploration is ongoing, but no new finds have been announced. Minerals may provide another source of
income, however, lack of a mining law may hold back development in this sector.

A. Strengthening external stability through sustainable fiscal policy
9.
Given current projections for oil prices and production, the authorities
concurred, in principle, on the need for expenditure rationalization. Staff calculations
indicate that planned expenditure would exceed expected revenue over the medium term,
leading to a near depletion of the stock of government savings by 2015 and a significant
weakening of external stability. Moreover, investment of such a magnitude may spur
inflationary pressures and drag on competitiveness. With few prospects to increase revenue
markedly over the near term, a reduction in investment expenditure would be needed.
10.
In recognition of large development needs, the authorities noted that social
expenditure should not only be protected but increased, and investment efficiency
safeguarded. On expenditure outside of the social area, high-return projects should continue,
with staff noting apparent scope to further prioritize, re-phase and/or right-size lower
productivity investments to be closer in line with expected medium-term activity.
Non-priority investments should be eliminated.
11.
The authorities saw little scope to reduce spending over the near-term due to
upcoming commitments made when oil prices were high. Construction of facilities to host
the African Leader’s Summit (2011) and African Cup of Nations (2012) are underway, and
basic infrastructure projects in both social and productive areas must be completed in order to
support future economic activity.
12.
Nonetheless, the authorities are taking actions aimed at increasing savings over
the medium term. They noted that while expenditure is expected to decline significantly
once basic infrastructure is complete, there is growing awareness of the desirability of
adjustment over the near term. A high-level committee has been formed to study project
prioritization, and a supervisory body is being established, whose role will be to strengthen
expenditure quality and control, including through reducing collusion between project
managers and construction companies. Moreover, they envisioned that revenues from any
new oil fields would go toward increasing savings.
13.
Staff recommended that starting in 2010, initial steps be taken to place fiscal
policy on a sustainable path through reversing the loosening that occurred in 2009.
Targeting a NOPD of around 40 percent of GDP is feasible and desirable, as frontloading the
adjustment would reduce vulnerability, strengthen the external position and lessen the need
for a sharper adjustment down the road. Near-term adjustment of such a magnitude would
also address the risk of large budgetary overruns in 2010–11, which the authorities agree
could be potentially large.6 In contrast, staff agreed with the authorities that moving

In part reflecting weaknesses in the budget process, the 2010 budget envisions a large reduction in
infrastructure spending which is inconsistent with the spending profile of existing and planned new projects.

12
immediately to a position consistent with a constant annuity under a permanent income
model (PIM) would imply an undesirably large fiscal adjustment which leaves insufficient
space to address pressing development needs. Such an adjustment would imply a reduction in
capital expenditure by some 75 percent, and abandonment of many projects already in train.
14.
Staff recommended an alternative expenditure scenario which provides
sufficient fiscal space for priority projects while placing the fiscal position on a path to
sustainability. Specifically, staff suggested limiting investment expenditure over 2010–12 to
1,200 billion CFAF—somewhat above the level contained in the authorities’ 2009 revised
budget—which places the NOPD firmly on a declining path. This amounts to a reduction of
about 25 percent in planned expenditure, but fully covers investments in train with room for
new priority projects. Post-2012, as projects are completed, expenditure should be reduced
further. Somewhat lower construction activity and growth may result from eliminating
inefficient projects, but the impact going forward is expected to be limited due to rising
investment efficiency.7 Under such an expenditure path, the NOPD would be reduced
significantly, with government savings rising over the medium term.

15.
The fiscal adjustment under the staff’s expenditure scenario also addresses
concerns regarding external stability. The exchange rate peg has served the economy well,
but falling oil production and unsustainable planned expenditure would weaken the external
position over time. All specifications and approaches employed to assess external stability
point to the need for a substantially higher current account balance than under the
Staff estimate potential overruns relative to budget of some 7 percentage points of GDP in 2010. Nonetheless,
the baseline scenario does fully capture the authorities’ triennial spending plan for 2010–12.
7

Given the high import component of spending, under staff’s scenario, growth would average 1 percent per
year over the medium term versus 1½ percent under the baseline due to lower construction activity.

13
policy-dependent baseline. The macroeconomic balance and external sustainability
approaches (under various allocation rules) both yield a (minimum) required current account
adjustment of some 15 percentage points of GDP in 2015—a magnitude which could not be
achieved without fiscal adjustment. With non-oil private sector imports stable at about
7 percent of GDP over the medium term and oil accounting for 99 percent of exports,
policies should aim to lower public expenditure-related imports (75 percent of total imports)
and support successful economic diversification. This result is consistent with the findings
for the CEMAC region as a whole, which indicate that external stability requires regionally
higher public savings and structural reforms to bring the real effective exchange rate in line
with medium-term fundamentals (IMF Country Report No. 09/267).
16.
Discussions also centered on ways to strengthen non-oil revenue. The authorities
shared staff’s concern about sharply falling oil revenues in the context of increasing current
expenditure pressures—notably, on operations and maintenance of sizeable public
investments. They saw scope for further improvements in tax administration, including
through modernization of the tax and customs departments. They are also creating
autonomous public agencies charged with upkeep of public investment, such as roads and
buildings. As diversification progresses, road maintenance would become increasingly
self-financing through tolls, while additional revenue from growing port services and
possible export of electricity is also envisioned. Staff highlighted that going forward tax
holidays should be limited, while increased government savings over the medium term would
provide an additional source of financial income down the road.
B. Public Financial Management: Strong institutions and governance
17.
The large over-execution of investment expenditure in 2009 points to weak
budgetary control, while apparent under-budgeting of 2010 spending is indicative of
deficiencies in the budget process.8 The authorities noted that current spending is well
controlled and progress in tracking PIP expenditure has been made with the assistance of two
macrofiscal advisors backstopped by the IMF, but agreed that insufficient coordination
among departments and between ministries surrounds the PIP.
18.
The authorities noted that capacity constraints and other hurdles would need to
be overcome to improve PFM. Unreliable electricity supply and communication networks
would have to be resolved to ensure uninterrupted processing and recordation of fiscal
transactions. However, basic infrastructure should be in place by 2012; collaboration on
developing appropriate software to record transactions is ongoing; and technical assistance is
serving to improve capacity. Moreover, investment efficiency should be enhanced by the new
supervisory body charged with overseeing disbursement of payments to contractors and

for comment. The draft PER points to weaknesses in most areas of public financial management.

14
planned use of outside experts for pre-project analysis in areas which the relevant line
ministry does not have expertise.
19.
The authorities have demonstrated their commitment to improved transparency
through progress on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). After
initial delays, the EITI process is progressing rapidly, as previously confidential information
on state oil companies has been released. The final reconciliation report has been posted on
the internet and validation is underway. An extension past the March 9, 2010 deadline was
requested to complete validation and tie up loose ends.
20.
On reserve holdings, the authorities reiterated their commitment to CEMAC but
noted that in light of the losses incurred in the recent fraud scandal they would not
increase holdings in BEAC until the situation had been fully resolved. At an operational
level, financing the fiscal deficit through running down BEAC deposits while increasing
offshore holdings is financially advantageous, given BEAC’s lower remuneration.
Nonetheless, the authorities reaffirmed their readiness to switch deposits into BEAC to
strengthen support for the exchange rate peg, if necessary.
C. Economic diversification and private sector-led growth
With hydrocarbon production expected to taper off, Equatorial Guinea will need to advance
other sources of value added if development is to be sustained. Successful diversification
requires strong human capital, financial intermediation, and an enabling business
environment.
21.
Guided by the framework in their NDP, the authorities aim to graduate to
emerging country status by 2020. In view of the exhaustible nature of oil resources,
sustained growth would be achieved through economic diversification (Box 1). In the current
phase (2008–12), oil wealth is being used to build up basic infrastructure. Longer-term
policies will aim to strengthen the business climate and foster identified sectors of potential
growth and employment creation. Current business climate indicators point to a wide-ranging
structural reform agenda.9

9

Despite much higher income, Equatorial Guinea ranks 170 of 183 countries on the World Bank’s Doing
Business 2010, in line with sub-Saharan Africa peers. It ranks somewhat below regional peers on Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (2009).

15

Box 1. National Development Plan 2020: Potential Sources of Growth and
Diversification
The authorities’ NDP identifies key areas of potential growth and employment creation
based on resource allocation and geographic location. Diversification is expected to be
further supported by increasing regional integration and investment in basic
infrastructure. Identified sectors of potential growth include:


Fishing and aquaculture, as well as agriculture aimed at food security and import
substitution, with limited scope for export of traditional agricultural commodities;



Transport services, via both ports and roads;



Tourism, including officially sanctioned events and eco-tourism; and



Financial services.

22.
In recognition of the important role to be played by small- and mediumenterprises (SMEs), the authorities are beginning to work with the banking sector on
improving access to financing. Modalities are yet to be decided but proposals include
creation of a credit fund (i.e., a long-term government deposit) which banks could loan out at
concessional rates, a guarantee fund, or a direct interest rate subsidy.
23.
More broadly, the authorities support regional initiatives to strengthen financial
sector development. Improvements over the past year include real-time interbank clearance
and ATM machines at the individual bank level. The fiber-optic cable to the mainland should
be operational by end-year, allowing faster and more reliable real-time information transfer
from the island. Work is also ongoing on introducing an ATM network, use of credit cards,
and a government debt market to facilitate liquidity management.
24.
Outside of the financial sector, the authorities’ diversification strategy envisions
the government facilitating, not competing with, the private sector. The national strategy
should be seen in the context of the larger regional strategy to strengthen CEMAC integration
and graduate to emerging market status by 2025—ports and highways in Equatorial Guinea
are a key pillar to increased trade. Over the near-term, the authorities will also continue to
orient the economy toward identified key sectors (agriculture, fishing, tourism), filling the
void left by an unwilling private sector through creation of public companies and agencies, as
they have done in the management of public investment (highways, real estate).
25.
There was broad agreement that not all conditions were yet in place which
would allow for rapid emergence of a predominantly non-oil economy. Increased

16
spending on human capital development at all levels is underway, although much more is
required, especially on increasing the number of teachers and healthcare professionals. Given
the large reform agenda and capacity constraints, the authorities noted that once basic
infrastructure is sufficiently advanced work in other areas would be stepped up, including in
some cases on needed legal reforms.
IV. DATA ISSUES
26.
The authorities are fully aware of severe data deficiencies, and are seeking to
ramp up technical assistance (Informational Annex). The World Bank recently identified a
resident national accounts consultant who should begin work soon, and a grant request is
being prepared to fund technical assistance to prepare and supervise the implementation of a
household survey. Long-awaited improvements in population data should result from the
census slated for 2011.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Equatorial Guinea faces immense challenges. The outlook is clouded by declining
oil production, but policies pose significant risks to macroeconomic and external stability.
Policy adjustment is needed but must balance risks against development needs. A large fiscal
adjustment is required but feasible, and should be frontloaded. Over the medium term, oil
dependence will continue, with longer-term prospects dependant on the ability to develop
alternative sources of value added through economic diversification.
28.
Moving toward a sustainable fiscal position starting in 2010 would halt the
projected near-depletion of the stock of government savings and strengthen external
stability. The NOPD should be brought down to around 40 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010
and be placed on a downward path thereafter—a spending envelope which fully covers
projects in train with space for additional priority projects aimed at improving living
standards and productivity today and in the future. With few near-term prospects for a
sizeable increase in non-oil revenue, adjustment would have to come through lower
expenditure. Significant scope may also exist to rationalize and right-size productive
investment in line with expected future economic needs. Non-priority projects should be
scrapped and new sources of non-oil revenue should be sought.
29.
Strengthening public financial management is critical. Improved budget planning
and control, particularly over public investment, are urgently required to ensure the effective
spending of oil wealth and improve macroeconomic management. Investment efficiency
would also be strengthened by redoubled efforts at prioritization, increased use of project
appraisals and better coordination across agencies.
30.
EITI should be viewed as part of an on-going commitment to improved
transparency and governance. With initial reconciliation complete, efforts should be
broadened, including through publication of contract awards and audit reports. More

17
generally, increased dissemination of information on government operations, including
foreign asset holdings, would demonstrate commitment in this area.
31.
The exchange rate regime has served the country well, however, unsustainable
planned fiscal spending poses risks to external stability. The projected near-depletion of the
stock of government savings has stark implications for the stability of the region, given the
nation’s considerable weight in regional foreign asset holdings. More broadly, for the
CEMAC region as a whole, external stability requires regionally higher public savings and
productivity-enhancing structural reforms to bring the real effective exchange rate in line
with medium-term fundamentals.
32.
In this context, the authorities should comply with their obligations under
CEMAC. The recent shift in reserve management not only implies a smaller contribution to
the CEMAC common pool of reserves, it marks an increase in exposure to oil price volatility,
rising future debt service, and lower holding of risk-free assets. Government savings should
be strengthened and the decline in the share of foreign assets held in BEAC reversed.
Overexposure to oil and risky assets should be avoided, as should contractual debt
obligations which are not warranted on financial grounds.
33.
The wide-ranging goals of the NDP necessitate a comprehensive approach to
development and poverty alleviation. Notwithstanding capacity constraints, the time has
come to move beyond infrastructure and focus increasing attention on actions to strengthen
human capital and improve the business climate. Collaboration with the banking sector on
facilitating lending to SMEs should continue, but it will be key to limit potential contingent
liabilities. Support for regional initiatives aimed at financial market development should also
continue, especially those aimed at lengthening loan maturity and reducing reliance on
implicit government guarantees. The integrity of the system would be enhanced by
operationalizing the national financial investigation agency (ANIF) charged with anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT). Outside of the financial
sector, removal of barriers to private sector activity and reducing regulatory discretion are
crucial, and will allow lagged growth effects from infrastructure investment to play out more
fully. More competitive goods markets would also serve to bring down prices, increasing the
purchasing power of Equatoguineans, while improvements in productivity will help raise
competitiveness.
34.
Data deficiencies are severe and hamper assessment of economic developments
and policy formulation. The 2011 Census should resolve longstanding discrepancies on
population figures and should be complemented by a household expenditure survey which
could inform future social policies. Capacity building through technical assistance should
continue, with the aim of participating in GDDS as improvements are made.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation
with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
Approved by Domenico Fanizza and Dhaneshwar Ghura
April 8, 2010
EQUATORIAL GUINEAEXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Equatorial Guinea’s external debt is projected to remain low and sustainable over
the medium term. A debt sustainability analysis (DSA)—using the middle income country
template—also demonstrates that the country’s external debt would remain well below the
CEMAC convergence criteria of 70 percent of GDP under all stress-test scenarios (Figure 1).
2.
Notwithstanding, it is worth noting that the authorities have begun borrowing again
in the context of implementing their large public investment program—a policy shift. As a
result, external debt is expected to rise to about 12 percent of GDP in 2012 before resuming a
declining trend. By 2015, external debt would amount to just below 6 percent of GDP (less than
1 percent of GDP in 2008, Table 1).
3.
The new debt relates to a US$2 billion credit line from the Chinese government
signed in late 2006. The loans are earmarked for infrastructure, including four projects in
electrification and improvements to Bata harbor. Loan terms are non-concessional, carrying an
interest rate of 5½ percent, 5 years maturity with 2 years grace. A repayment guarantee in the
form of liquid deposits at the Eximbank of China equivalent to 30 percent (minimum) of the
outstanding stock of debt is required. The Chinese government is also reported to have extended
an offer for a US$380 million long-term loan for housing construction on more concessional
terms (17 years maturity, 2 years grace, at 2 percent interest). Given the uncertainty regarding the
latter loan, it is not included in the DSA, but would not alter the overall assessment.
4.
Most of the stress-test scenarios indicate potential risks, but still-sustainable levels of
external debt. All shocks are calibrated over the seven-year period 2003–09. The shorter
calibration period is warranted given that the government only started to receive the fiscal
revenues of the oil fields discovered in the mid- and late-nineties in 2003. Debt dynamics are
most sensitive to an oil and hydrocarbon derivatives price shock, with a $20 reduction in the oil
price and a proportional reduction in derivatives prices leading to a potential tripling of the debt
stock. A similar increase in debt would arise in the event that the authorities continue to
accumulate debt after 2012 at the same rate (average) as they did over 2010–12.

1/ Derived as [r - g -  (1+g) +  (1+r)]/(1+g+ +g  ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US
dollar terms,g = real GDP growth rate, = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [- (1+g  (1+r1+g+ +g  ) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency
( > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes. The large residuals in 2012-2015 are due to the projected reduction in government savings during that period.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP. Under this scenario,
the debt stock turns negative starting in 2011 ( i.e., Equatorial Guinea would become a net creditor). Negative values have been suppressed.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Safeguard Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States, of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. The safeguards
assessment completed on August 30, 2004 found that the BEAC has implemented a
number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since an earlier 2001
safeguards assessment, but further progress needs to be made in key areas. The main
recommendations of the 2004 assessment were reported in IMF Country Report No. 05/3.
Equatorial Guinea’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed exchange
rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. A 2007 temporary
ministerial order requires authorization of the General Directorate of Banking prior to
rapid money transfers abroad by non-bank financial institutions.
Article IV Consultations
Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the Executive
Board on November 3, 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 09/102).
Technical Assistance
FAD provided an 18-month technical assistance during 1992–94 to reorganize the tax
department and personnel training.
FAD conducted a review of PEM and tax administration systems in 1997.
FAD conducted a diagnostic mission on key deficiencies and training needs in public
finance in May 2003.
FAD conducted a diagnostic mission on modernization of public expenditure
management processes and steps for reforming the system in July 2005.
STA evaluated the collection of monetary statistics and proposed steps to adopt the
methodology of the 2000 Manual on Monetary and Financial Statistics in
December 2002.
STA conducted a diagnostic mission on real sector statistics in July 2005.

ANNEX III.
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 17, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The deficiencies in
quality, timing, and coverage in most macroeconomic data are related to insufficient administrative and
technical capacity. Poor centralization of information between the island and continental regions is also an
issue. Technical assistance has resulted in some progress but there is still a need to consolidate these gains,
including through participation in the General Data Dissemination System and significant strengthening of the
capacity of the National Institute of Statistics (NIS).
National Accounts: National accounts are compiled at current and constant prices, but often contain significant
inconsistencies. A 2007 STA mission provided assistance to prepare a business register/sample frame and a
database on employment and compensation of employees, basic source data for improving the coverage of the
national accounts. The mission revised estimates on oil and non-oil GDP for the period 2000–06 with 2000 as
base year, and reclassified manufacturing of oil and gas derivatives in the non-oil sector following the UN
International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC,) Rev. 3. A pilot Agricultural
Production Survey (APS) 2005–06 was conducted with the support of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, and a Quick Household Survey (QHS), with national coverage, was conducted between
December 2006 and February 2007 in a sample of 5,240 households. Even though the QHS did not collect data
on income and the collected expenditure data reflect seasonality, the results of the QHS, if adjusted, would have
been valuable in updating the basket and weights of the CPI (currently, corresponding to 1986) and compile
poverty and other social indicators. However, these data have become unavailable and are not being used. The
World Bank has recently identified a resident advisor on national accounts statistics under its current service
agreement, with work scheduled to begin soon. The World Bank is also assisting the government in drafting a
grant proposal for a Household Expenditure Survey to be used for updating the CPI weights and compiling
poverty indicators. A census scheduled for 2011 should serve to clarify long-standing misunderstandings on
population statistics.
Price statistics: Compilation of the official CPI resumed in January 2009, with data collected in six major
cities. However, a number of deficiencies remain, including outdated weights and composition of the basket of
goods and services, and gaps in the time series corresponding to the period for which data was not collected
(June 2005 – February 2006, and 2008). Imputations for missing data do not always reflect underlying trends. In
general, the CPI tends to underestimate inflation.
Government finance statistics: Two macrofiscal advisors (backstopped by the IMF but paid for by the
government) in place since 2008 have made progress in tracking government expenditure under the large public
investment program, and following technical assistance from France, there have been some improvements in
fiscal accounting. Further improvements are needed, including on coverage. Equatorial Guinea does not report
fiscal data to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. However, the authorities do provide budget execution data to AFR, although full information on the
reconciliation with the monetary accounts is still lacking. The fiscal data are not subject to any internal process
of verification as internal and external audit capability remains weak. There is no functional classification of
expenditure, and dissemination practices needed improvement. Gains in transparency have been made through
the EITI process, with reconciliation reports posted on the World Bank website in March 2010, including
information on state owned oil companies.

7

Monetary statistics: The BEAC regularly reports monetary, interest rates, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in IFS, but delays occur in the submission of data to STA. In mid-2007 the BEAC started a project
to migrate monetary statistics of member countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the MFSM. As a part
of this project, a regional workshop was organized by the BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of
source data from commercial banks to the MFSM concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop
to provide guidance and advice. Submission of data by the BEAC using the standardized report forms is
pending.
The accuracy of monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border movements of BEAC-issued
banknotes among Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale (CEMAC) member countries.
About 60 percent of banknotes issued in Equatorial Guinea by the BEAC national directorate circulate in
Cameroon and only 26 percent remain in the country, while currency in circulation in Equatorial Guinea
includes some 18 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and as much from Gabon.
Balance of payments: Although the BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays are long and the data
suffer from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. At present, BOP data are often not derived from
records of current stocks or flows. Statistics are still largely constructed on a historical basis from estimates
rather than actual financial and customs records, including information on the hydrocarbons sector available to
some parts of the government. Customs data have improved since the implementation of the Central African
Customs and Economic Union reform and the deployment of customs brigades. However, data analysis is still
hampered by the lack of computerization. While some progress has been made in compiling current and
financial account items, the lack of current source data is a key concern.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System participant.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Real sector statistics reported to STA (International Financial Statistics, IFS) are limited to GDP (without
breakdown by sector or expenditure category), exports, and imports. The February 2010 issue of IFS includes
data for GDP through 2005 and exports and imports through 2008; the latest year for which balance of
payments data is available is 1996. Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA for publication in IFS
or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) regularly
reports monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for publication in IFS, but the timeliness of these
data needs improvement.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Equatorial Guinea
On April 23, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Equatorial Guinea on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s
lapse of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without
convening formal discussions.
Background
Despite tumbling oil prices in the wake of the global crisis and lower crude oil production
following its peak in 2008, real economic activity expanded by around 5 percent in 2009,
propped up by a surge in public investment and continued strong activity in hydrocarbon
derivatives (mostly liquefied natural gas). Inflation edged higher, pushed up by lack of
competition in the retail sector, rising public wages and strong domestic demand.
The external current account shifted into deficit, as rising hydrocarbon derivatives exports were
insufficient to offset the decline in crude oil production, the plunge in oil prices and the sharp
increase in public investment-related imports. The deficit was financed mostly by foreign direct
investment and foreign debt.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The overall fiscal balance shifted into a deficit of about 8 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), mostly because of a ramping up of investment spending as oil prices recovered. The
non-oil primary balanced plummeted to a deficit of over 100 percent of non-oil GDP. The stock
of government savings declined moderately but remained large, propped up in part by
renewed foreign borrowing. However, the share of official foreign assets held in the Bank of
Central African States (BEAC) declined significantly, with savings increasingly held offshore.
The underdeveloped financial system was unscathed by the global financial turmoil, and
appears generally sound. There is no evidence of capital repatriation by foreign banks, whose
local subsidiaries had no exposure to complex derivatives. Furthermore, banks remain highly
liquid and report no difficulties in meeting new capital requirements.
The medium-term outlook is clouded by the onset of declining hydrocarbon production. Overall
growth is likely to drop over the medium term due to lower oil output. While growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sector is expected to pick up as investment in basic infrastructure begins to
bear fruit and new public investments support continued construction activity, future activity will
increasingly need to be driven by private sector activity. Low export diversification and high
public investment-related imports will likely keep the current account in deficit over the medium
term. Under current public expenditure plans, the external position would weaken, with the
stock of government savings dropping sharply as oil revenues wane.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Oil has brought great wealth and growth to the Equatoguinean economy, and strong oil
revenues have financed both an ambitious public investment program and the accumulation of
large financial assets. Basic infrastructure is being developed, and steps have been taken
toward increased transparency. However, challenges related to declining oil production and
poverty are cause for concern, and the large public spending program poses significant risks
to macroeconomic and external stability. Over the medium-term, oil dependence will continue,
with longer-term prospects dependant on the ability to develop alternative sources of value
added through economic diversification.
The public spending program must appropriately balance development needs against risks to
stability. In this context, priority should be given to public investment projects aimed at
improving living standards and productivity. Moving toward a sustainable fiscal position starting
in 2010 would halt the expected near-depletion of the stock of government savings over the
medium term. Frontloading the adjustment by bringing the non-oil primary deficit down to
around 40 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 and placing it on a downward path thereafter would
both provide sufficient fiscal space for priority projects and strengthen external stability. With
few near-term prospects for a sizeable increase in non-oil revenue, the bulk of the adjustment
would have to come through expenditure rationalization and the right-sizing of productive
investment in line with expected future economic needs.

3
Improvements in public financial management are critical to ensuring the effective spending of
oil wealth and strengthening macroeconomic management. In this context, investment
efficiency would benefit from improved budget planning and control, redoubled efforts at
prioritization, and increased use of project appraisals. The authorities should also build on
recent achievements in the area of transparency and governance, including through
publication of contract awards and audit reports, and increased dissemination of information
on government operations, including on foreign asset holdings.
The exchange rate regime has served the country well, but continued unsustainable fiscal
spending could negatively impact stability in the region. For the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community (CEMAC) region as a whole, external stability requires regionally higher
public savings and productivity-enhancing structural reforms to bring the real effective
exchange rate in line with medium-term fundamentals. The authorities should comply with their
obligations under CEMAC, raising contributions to the common pool of reserves.
Overexposure to oil and risky assets should be avoided, as should contractual debt obligations
which are not warranted on financial grounds.
The wide-ranging goals of the National Development Plan necessitate a comprehensive
approach to development and poverty alleviation, and increasing attention should be placed on
actions to strengthen human capital and improve the business climate. Efforts to broaden and
deepen financial intermediation, including lending to small and medium enterprises, should
continue. Moreover, removal of barriers to private sector activity and reducing regulatory
discretion are crucial steps which would allow lagged growth effects from infrastructure
investment to play out more fully.
Data deficiencies hamper assessment of economic developments and policy formulation. The
planned 2011 Census should resolve longstanding discrepancies on population figures, and
should be complemented by a household expenditure survey which could inform future social
policies. Capacity building through technical assistance should continue, with the aim of
participating in General Data Dissemination System as improvements are made.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
