STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is recovering gradually, helped by supportive macroeconomic
policies, favorable external conditions, and improved market confidence. This, together
with a welcome reduction in vulnerabilities, supported Hungary’s financial stability
during bouts of volatility in emerging markets over the past year. Nevertheless, external
and public debts remain high, thus making the economy susceptible to shocks; and the
country faces subdued growth prospects. The government’s strategy to address these
challenges included sizeable fiscal consolidation and unconventional measures that
increased the state’s role in the economy and shifted the burden of adjustment to
specific sectors.
Policy recommendations. Policies should aim at building buffers and comprehensively
addressing obstacles to strong, sustained growth.








Fiscal policy. Adopt an ambitious and growth-friendly fiscal adjustment strategy to
reduce the public debt ratio sustainably and build policy space. The strategy should
rely on durable expenditure consolidation, enhanced composition of spending, and a
gradual elimination of distortionary taxes.
Monetary policy. Stop monetary policy easing and stand ready to raise the policy
rate if market conditions warrant. A clear communication strategy will play a crucial
role in guiding market expectations. Maintain adequate reserve coverage to support
financial stability.
Financial sector. Help restore financial intermediation by improving the banks’
operating environment, including steps to facilitate faster resolution of nonperforming loans and to reduce the tax burden on banks. The Funding for Growth
Scheme should remain limited, targeted, and time-bound, with fiscal costs clearly
recognized.
Structural reforms. Advance structural reforms aimed at removing labor market
bottlenecks, enhancing the business climate, and boosting productivity in the
services sectors. Limited government interference in the economy and increased
policy predictability could strengthen confidence, and foster private sector
investment and employment creation.

Discussions took place in Budapest during March 5–17, 2014, and
were continued in Washington, D.C. on April 11–12, 2014. The staff
team comprised Messrs. Christou (Head) and Klein, Ms. ElGanainy
(all EUR), Ms. Jenkner (FAD), and Ms. Oner (SPR); and was joined
by Mr. Roaf (senior regional resident representative, EUR) for a few
days. Messrs. Prader and Benk (OED) attended some meetings.
Mmes. Blasco and Nguyen (both EUR) assisted in the preparation
of the staff report. The staff team met with Minister for National
Economy Varga, Minister for National Development Németh,
Central Bank of Hungary Deputy Governors Balog and Gerhardt,
other senior officials, and representatives from the private sector
and think tanks. A workshop was held in Budapest during the
mission jointly with the Central Bank of Hungary and the Ministry
for National Economy to discuss background papers prepared by
staff (included in the Selected Issues Paper accompanying this
report) and the authorities. Hungary is an Article VIII country
(Informational Annex: Fund Relations). Data provision is adequate
for surveillance (Informational Annex: Statistical Issues).

CONTEXT
1.
Hungary achieved a welcome reduction in vulnerabilities, but the economy remains
susceptible to shocks. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the country underwent sizeable fiscal
consolidation, the current account turned into surplus, external debt declined, and inflation
decelerated sharply. These improvements in fundamentals helped Hungary weather recent financial
market volatility well and maintain market access. However, external and public debt levels are still
among the highest in the region resulting in large financing needs and heavy reliance on
nonresident funding. A shift in market sentiment could thus destabilize the economy, particularly
given the high balance sheet exposure of the private and public sectors to exchange rate risk.
Therefore, reducing the still-high vulnerabilities should be the focus of policies going forward.

participants in the German-Central European supply chain. Hungary has endured a prolonged

Moreover, Hungary faces subdued growth prospects.
This calls for a strategy to comprehensively address obstacles to stronger growth.
3.
The ruling party’s convincing win in the April 2014 elections suggests no major change
in the thrust of economic policies . Fidesz retained its two-third majority in parliament and full
control over the legislative process. The party’s economic policy platform features a continuation of
efforts to increase disposable income (including by adopting a debt relief scheme for FX mortgage
holders), reducing utility prices, and maintaining the sizable public work programs. Fidesz has also
vowed to ease the tax burden on labor, to boost the industrialization of the economy by signing
strategic agreements with large multinational manufacturers, to increase domestic ownership in the
banking sector, and to create a non-profit utility sector.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

since 2008. This largely reflected higher public

Inflation has fallen to a record-low level.
Against excess production capacity, utility price
cuts, and a moderation of import prices, headline
inflation decelerated sharply to 0.4 percent at end2013. More recently, it has remained around zero
reflecting in part another round of utility price cuts.
Core inflation and inflation expectations have
decelerated as well, albeit more gradually, and have
remained around the National Bank of Hungary’s
(MNB) 3 percent inflation target.

6.
Unemployment has declined sharply, but labor market conditions are still weak. Labor
market participation increased by about one percentage point to 65.1 percent at end-2013. At the
same time, public works programs continued to expand (Box 2), with the number of registered
individuals exceeding 400,000 (or about 10 percent of total employment) at end-2013. Largely as a
result of this expansion, the unemployment rate declined to 9½ percent in 2013:Q4 from 11 percent
(both seasonally-adjusted) in 2012:Q4. Meanwhile, job creation in the private sector has been weak
and real wage growth in this sector moderated further to about 3 percent at end-2013.
7.
The fiscal deficit remained well below the EU limit in 2013. Following the substantial
adjustment in 2012 (3½ percent of GDP) and additional measures in 2013 to ensure that the fiscal
deficit remains below 3 percent of GDP, Hungary exited the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure in June
2013. With lower-than-budgeted tax revenues more than offset by strict expenditure control, the
2013 fiscal deficit (2.2 percent of GDP) over-performed the 2.7 percent target, thus keeping the
policy stance broadly neutral. Public debt declined only slightly to just above 79 percent of GDP.
8.
The central bank continued to ease monetary policy through both conventional and
unconventional measures. Against decelerating inflation, low risk premia, and a negative output
gap, the Monetary Council reduced the policy rate––albeit at a slowing pace––to a record-low level
of 2.5 percent. Furthermore, the central bank introduced the Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS) with
the aim of easing access to finance for SMEs and improving their credit conditions, inter alia,
through a subsidized lending interest rate (Box 3). After the implementation of the Scheme’s first
phase under which the equivalent of 2.4 percent of GDP was lent by commercial banks, the MNB
extended the Scheme with a possible increase in the allocated amount to up to 6.6 percent of GDP.
9.
The banking sector is still under pressure and bank balance sheets continued to
contract. While aggregate capital and liquidity positions remained adequate, many banks posted
losses for a third year in a row, due to high levels of NPLs (16.9 percent, 2013:Q4), weak economic
activity, and a heavy tax burden. Portfolio cleaning remained sluggish, and speculation about future
debt relief for FX mortgage holders has incentivized some borrowers to suspend their debt service
payments, thereby adding further pressure on bank balance sheets. Despite the accommodative

integrated them into a single body under the ownership of the state-owned Development Bank. The
integration process is expected to be completed by end-2014 and is likely to add a key market
player to the banking system.1

10.
External stability has improved, but still-high external debt and financing needs are a
reason for concern. The current account is in surplus, reflecting in part elevated savings in response
to ongoing deleveraging, and external debt has fallen substantially. However, despite the decline,
external debt is 119 percent of GDP, the net international position is at -93 percent of GDP, open FX
positions on private sector balance sheets are about 21 percent of GDP; and gross external financing
needs average 26 percent of GDP per year over the medium term. Moreover, reliance on
nonresidents for local currency-denominated government securities continues, and such holdings
stood at 32 percent of the end-March 2014 outstanding stock, with a high concentration in the
investor base (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper).
11.
Staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. Econometric estimates based on the EBA methodology have low explanatory power
and yield mixed results for Hungary. Specifically, the Current Account Balance approach suggests
that the current account norm is a small deficit, about 5 percent of GDP below the cyclicallyadjusted balance in 2013; thus, Hungary’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be
undervalued. However, in staff’s view, this approach does not adequately capture savings (and
therefore the current account) remaining elevated due to Hungary’s still-large external liabilities, and
the need to substantially reduce them over the medium term. The Real Effective Exchange Rate
approach reveals an overvaluation of the exchange rate by about 20 percent, and the External
Sustainability approach finds the REER undervalued by just under 10 percent. Other price indicators,
such as unit labor costs, do not point to competitiveness problems.

1

The total assets of cooperative credit institutions amounted to €7.2 billion at end-2013, thus making the integrated
body the fourth-largest in the banking system. The authorities’ plans to increase their loan-to-deposit ratio (currently
60 percent) would increase their importance in the banking system further.

However, non-price indicators point to an erosion in Hungary’s market share and
attractiveness for FDI. After an impressive expansion in export markets starting in the mid-1990s,
reflecting growing links with the German supply chain, Hungary’s export market share has been

Sovereign CDS spreads have moderated recently
to just above 200 basis points (end-April). Taking advantage of favorable external conditions, the
government secured financing for most of its maturing external debt in 2014 (US$7¼ billion,
5½ percent of GDP) with the US$2 billion and US$3 billion Eurobond placements in November 2013
and March 2014, respectively.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
14.
Staff expects the economic recovery to gather further momentum, with excess
productive capacity narrowing slowly. Real GDP is projected to grow 2 percent in 2014 as
investment and private consumption continue to improve on the back of more favorable financing
conditions and a lower drag from deleveraging. Driven by a significant expansion in automobile
production, exports are expected to expand further, but given their high import content and the
expected surge in imported consumer and investment goods, the overall contribution to growth

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

from net external demand would be limited. At the same time, the current account is projected to
remain in surplus this year. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around
1¾ percent. The impetus from domestic demand is expected to strengthen somewhat, and the
contribution from net external demand is set to decline as import growth recovers. The latter
together with slowing deleveraging and aging population dynamics would help normalize savings
and turn the current account to a deficit, in line with its norm. Underlying inflationary pressures are
expected to gradually build up, as spare capacity diminishes and the impact of one-off effects on
prices wanes.
15.
Risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—are tilted to the
downside. Staff noted that in an unchanged policy scenario, external vulnerabilities would pose
risks to financial and economic stability in case of adverse external shocks. Uncertainty regarding
advanced economies’ monetary policies or a further re-pricing of emerging markets or other risks

could erode demand for Hungarian assets, spilling over through the banking (deleveraging) and
balance sheet (exchange rate) channels. Moreover, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region
would exacerbate downside risks through trade and financial linkages, including through exposure
to common nonresident financial institutions and investors (Box 5). A protracted slowdown in key
trading partners could also hurt Hungary’s recovery through its impact on exports. On the domestic
front, continued government interference in the economy could exacerbate deleveraging with
adverse confidence effects, undermine Hungary’s international competitiveness further, and hurt
investment and growth. On the upside, the expansion of the FGS may temporarily boost growth
further and so could upside surprises to euro-area growth.
Authorities’ views
16.
While broadly agreeing with the near-term outlook, the authorities were more upbeat
about Hungary’s medium-term prospects and the balance of risks. They agreed that, despite
the recent improvement, external vulnerabilities remain high, and concurred that deterioration in the
external environment would adversely influence Hungary through trade, financial, and confidence
channels. To this end, they agreed that developments in Russia and Ukraine could affect Hungary;
but they had not observed any immediate impact. The authorities viewed the risks to the outlook as
broadly balanced and argued that the likelihood of capital outflows is low, particularly given that
Hungary’s investor base has become more stable in recent years following the increase in the share

of real-money investors. They also argued that the economy’s improved fundamentals have instilled
confidence in foreign investors as evidenced by the recent decline in the sovereign CDS spreads and
the heavily-oversubscribed auctions of government paper. Finally, they were more upbeat about
Hungary’s growth potential and also noted considerable upside risks to growth, including from a
pickup in corporate lending and on the back of the stimulatory impact of the FGS; as well as from a
stronger external environment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policies should be geared toward boosting potential growth, and reducing public and external debts.
Discussions thus focused on the need to build policy buffers further and adopt a comprehensive growth
strategy that would encompass a growth-friendly fiscal adjustment, revival of financial intermediation,
and structural reforms. Such a strategy would contribute to a faster reduction in risk premia and a
higher level of investment and growth.

A. Fiscal Policy—Finding the Right Balance
17.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, but noted that
policies appeared insufficient to reduce the public debt ratio.


The fiscal stance is projected to relax in 2014. With the deficit target increasing to 2.9 percent
of GDP, mainly on the back of increases in expenditure on health, education and projects cofinanced with the EU, the structural deficit is set to widen by about one percentage point of
GDP, leaving public debt roughly unchanged at about 79 percent of GDP. Moreover, in staff’s
assessment, the budget over-estimates potential revenue collection, which implies that the
deficit target is likely to be met only if all budget reserves (0.7 percent of GDP) are saved.



Over the medium term, staff projects the fiscal deficit to come down only modestly. In the
updated convergence program, the government targets a reduction in the deficit to 1.9 percent
of GDP by 2017. However, based on staff’s baseline macro scenario, current policies, and the
authorities’ ambitious investment agenda, partly funded by EU transfers, the fiscal deficit would
decline only slightly to 2¾ percent of GDP. This would imply a further easing of the fiscal stance
as the output gap closes and revenues recover back to their potential. Public debt, at around
78 percent of GDP, would remain a significant vulnerability (Appendix I).

18.
There is a need for a clear and credible strategy to gradually but steadily reduce public
deficits and debt over the medium term. Staff sees scope for a smooth fiscal consolidation path
that would strike a balance between sustaining the economic recovery and putting the debt-to-GDP
ratio decisively on a downward trajectory. To this end, staff recommended containing the fiscal
impulse in 2014 to ½ percent of GDP, which would entail an adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP
compared with the approved budget, followed up by a structural tightening of about ½ percent of
GDP annually throughout 2015–19. Such a strategy—which would help build much-needed fiscal

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

buffers and strengthen confidence—would bring the
structural deficit to about zero and reduce public debt
to just below 70 percent of GDP by 2019.3
19.
The adjustment strategy should rely on
durable expenditure consolidation, enhanced
composition of expenditure, and gradual
elimination of distortionary taxes.4 At over 50 percent
of GDP, government spending is among the highest in
the region, financed increasingly by distortionary
sectoral taxes. A sustainable expenditure retrenchment
would, therefore, create the needed fiscal space to
rationalize the tax system.

On the tax front, there is a need to: (i) streamline the tax regime through a reduction of
exemptions, special regimes, and elimination of distortionary sectoral taxes; (ii) reduce the high
tax wedge for low-income workers; and (iii) decisively tackle VAT fraud, particularly in the basic
food sector (See: Box 7, Country Report No. 13/85).

Strong fiscal institutions are critical to boost policy credibility and investor confidence.
Frequent changes in the fiscal targets and adoption of ad-hoc measures weaken policy
predictability. The fiscal rules currently in place are broadly in line with the requirements of the
Stability and Growth Pact, and are supplemented by a framework of domestic fiscal rules that
exhibits a number of design flaws (see: Box 1, Country Report No. 12/13). Staff thus recommended
simplifying the system and stressed the need to set the rules in structural terms to avoid procyclicality. The authorities’ intention to adopt a binding multi-year budget framework, which would
help anchor market expectations and contain spending pressures are welcome. Finally, staff called
for providing the Fiscal Council adequate resources and greater operational independence to assess
the sustainability of the fiscal stance and risks ahead.
Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation. While they
acknowledged some risks to the 2014 budget, including due to the inclusion of substantive gains in
tax collection through administrative improvements, they believe that saving only part of the budget
reserves will be more than sufficient to meet their deficit target. Over the medium term, they expect
the deficit to come down mainly by continuing their policies of partial freezes in government wages
and in spending on goods and services; but also benefitting from past reforms to restrict eligibility
and reduce the generosity of social transfers.

22.
Regarding structural fiscal policies, differences in views centered on ways to boost
demand and supply of labor and appropriate tax policies. The authorities felt strongly about the
merits of the public works program and targeted reductions in employer contributions under the
Job Protection Act. They were hesitant about potential intervention based on reported income, such
as lowering the substantial tax-wedge for low income workers which has increased in recent years.
The authorities pointed to progress in rationalizing loss-making SOEs and putting the pension
system on a firmer footing. Regarding sectoral taxes, they stressed that they do not intend to phase
them out in the near future given the lack of fiscal space. Furthermore, they disagreed with the
mission’s characterization of the taxes as distortionary sectoral taxes arguing that taxes such as the
financial transactions tax or the telecom levy are relatively broad-based consumption taxes.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

the impact of recent exchange rate depreciation.
24.
At the same time, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the external
environment. Hungary’s interest rate differentials have reached a record low, and further
compression—also due to normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies—may reduce
the attractiveness of Hungarian securities. This, together with possible re-pricing of emerging
market risk in the wake of a slowdown in some large emerging markets and geopolitical tensions in
the region, could potentially lead to a disorderly movement of capital flows. The recent steepening
of the yield curve may point to increased uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook, and forward
rate agreements are pricing a policy rate hike of 40 basis points by end-2014.
25.
With these considerations in mind, staff recommended keeping the policy rate on hold
and adopting a monetary policy tightening bias. The proposed monetary policy stance strikes a
balance between cyclical considerations and financial stability concerns. The former set of
considerations would justify maintaining the current accommodative stance before commencing the
tightening cycle later in the year. However, the economy is still susceptible to shocks and remains
highly vulnerable to exchange rate risk given its large open FX position. Sharp and persistent

exchange rate depreciation could also endanger price stability.6 Staff, therefore, urged the
authorities to keep the policy rate on hold, maintaining the present accommodative policy stance
until there are signs that inflationary pressures are building up. In the event that external conditions
deteriorate sharply, the MNB should also stand ready to tighten. Staff emphasized the importance of
maintaining the confidence of market participants in the central bank’s inflation targeting

nonresidents, and risk of market volatility are
expected to remain elevated. Accordingly, staff underscored the need to maintain adequate reserve
coverage to support financial stability and smooth exchange rate volatility if the FX market dries up.
.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities broadly agreed that changes in market sentiment continue to pose
risks, but didn’t see a need for adopting a tightening bias. With inflation expectations
moderating to around the MNB’s inflation target and the still-sizeable negative output gap, the
authorities argued that inflationary pressures are likely to remain contained in the period ahead. In
their projections, headline inflation is set to remain below 3 percent in 2014 and reach the inflation
target in 2015. They concurred, however, that the increased volatility in the global financial markets
requires enhanced vigilance, as risk perceptions can shift rapidly. In this connection, they reiterated
the view of the Monetary Council to reassess the policy stance in light of market conditions. Finally,
they considered the current level of reserves comfortable, and reaffirmed their commitment to
maintain reserves within the adequacy range in the period ahead.

C. Financial Sector—Repairing Financial Intermediation
28.
There is an urgent need to restore financial intermediation. Despite the recent
improvement in economic activity, credit is projected to contract further in 2014. Staff argued that
long-lasting restoration of financial intermediation should rely primarily on a sustainable
improvement in banks’ operating environment, including a reduction in the heavy tax burden on
banks and higher policy predictability. Staff cautioned about the high level of restructured loans
(about 18 percent of total loans) and argued that the high level of NPLs continues to hinder credit
growth.

The pass-through from exchange rate depreciation of 1 percent to prices is estimated at about 0.3 percent over a
period of one year.

This underscores the need for a faster cleanup of
banks’ asset portfolios, including by removing legal,
regulatory, and tax impediments.7 To this end, staff
welcomed MNB’s efforts to address such
impediments, and stressed that a swift adoption
and implementation of a personal insolvency
framework in line with best international practice
would be important. Staff also stressed that a
possible new FX mortgage debt relief scheme
should envisage appropriate burden sharing
among all stakeholders.

Lending under the FGS should be limited, targeted, and time-bound, with fiscal costs

compensates banks for lending to more risky SMEs. Moreover, this Scheme should remain timebound and limited to SMEs, while fiscal costs should be transparently reported.
30.
The ongoing integration of the co-operative credit institutions responds to the
increasing need of improving their financial standing and operations. The integration process
should help ensure adequate risk management practices, enhance their lending capacity, and
ultimately increase their market share. As their overall role in the banking system is expected to
increase substantially over time, it is important to put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure no
state interference in their lending activity and strategic decisions.

Staff welcomed recent improvements in the financial stability framework, which would
help safeguard the Hungarian financial system against a wider range of risks. The adoption of

into the MNB and equipped it with micro-prudential instruments, also reinforced the MNB’s macroprudential tool kit, and thus allowed the MNB to address financial gaps in a more efficient and
effective manner. 8 While noting that financial and price stability are interlinked, staff stressed the
importance of establishing adequate checks and balances to ensure that financial stability concerns
will not override the MNB’s objective of price stability. In this regard, the establishment of the
Financial Stability Council, which is responsible for financial sector stability, and decides about
macro-and micro-prudential supervisory and regulatory instruments, is a step in the right direction.
While the authorities have yet to decide whether to join the European Banking Union, staff stressed
the importance of not falling “behind the curve” and encouraged the authorities to strengthen the
supervisory framework further, including by adopting a bank resolution framework.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities emphasized the role of the FGS in repairing financial intermediation
and didn’t share staff’s concerns about its modalities. They agreed that credit is likely to remain
weak in the period ahead, reflecting both demand and supply-side factors. In this regard, they
viewed the FGS as a useful monetary tool to boost bank lending to SMEs. The authorities considered
the FGS’s modalities appropriate and were confident that demand would pick up later in the year.
They agreed that the FGS involves costs, but considered them as relating to the MNB’s monetary
operations that could be offset by balance sheet management. While agreeing that commercial
bank profitability is likely to remain subdued in the period ahead, they considered the bank levy and
the bank transaction tax necessary given the limited fiscal space. On NPLs, the authorities concurred
that their high level impedes credit growth and expected the task force responsible for identifying
measures to facilitate faster portfolio cleaning to submit its recommendations to the Financial
Stability Council in the coming months. As for their efforts to strengthen the supervisory framework,
the authorities are in the process of drafting a new law that will implement the Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive, with full implementation envisaged early next year.

adverse business environment. Moreover, weaknesses in the labor market, including the low
participation and employment rates, also weigh on long-term growth.
34.
The erosion in market share and the drop in FDI undermine Hungary’s growth
prospects. In staff’s assessment, this mainly reflects structural factors rather than exchange rate
developments and it could undermine Hungary’s current role in the German-Central European
Supply Chain. Staff underscored the need to move up in the value chain. This should entail measures
to upgrade labor force skills, promote entrepreneurship and innovation, reduce the tax burden, and
improve the business climate to support investment and growth.
35.
Renewed structural reform momentum is needed to remove obstacles to growth. Past
reforms to boost labor demand and supply have borne fruit, but further steps are required.
Consideration should be given to boosting labor demand by differentiating the minimum wage
across different groups and linking future increases to productivity growth; and reducing labor
market skills mismatches by strengthening the training component of active labor market policies
(see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). Moreover, there is a need to increase policy
predictability, and reduce the regulatory and tax compliance burden on businesses. Finally, staff
called for the restructuring of the remaining loss-making transport SOEs, and cautioned against
recent measures to reduce utility prices further as part of the government’s strategy to make the
energy sector non-profit, arguing that it may compromise the quality of services and undermine
investment plans.
36.
Staff analysis suggests that a comprehensive and ambitious structural reform package
could lift Hungary’s potential growth substantially. Such a policy package could entail measures
to: (i) increase labor participation; (ii) improve the quality of fiscal policy, including by eliminating
distortionary sectoral taxes; and (iii) enhance the business environment. While considerable
uncertainty surrounds the quantification of reforms and their impact on potential growth, model
simulations suggest that in such a reform scenario, potential growth could return to its pre-crisis
rates over the medium term (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper).
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities were more optimistic about Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects
citing strong impetus from structural reforms and recent policy measures. They viewed
medium-term potential growth at about 2½ percent, largely on account of higher investment due to
increased EU funds, more favorable financing conditions for SMEs, and labor market reforms. The
authorities noted that the recent decline in Hungary’s export market share is mainly linked to the
changing structure in the manufacturing sector, particularly in the telecom sector, and argued that
the increase in the peers’ market shares mainly reflects a catching-up process. However, they
indicated that the diversification of Hungary’s export destinations, including through trade links with
Asian countries, the expansion of Eximbank operations, and the planned increase in the production
capacity in the automobile industry, would boost export performance. Finally, the authorities added
that the utility price cuts were part of their strategy to develop a non-profit energy sector, which is
critical to reduce high energy costs and enhance competitiveness.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The Hungarian economy is strengthening but continues to face vulnerabilities. The
economy has emerged from the 2012 recession and growth is gaining momentum. External demand
has been supportive, but the economic upturn is largely driven by a pickup in domestic demand, on
the back of stimulative macroeconomic policies. Inflationary pressures have subsided, and external
vulnerabilities have declined somewhat, thanks to persistent current account surpluses and
improved market sentiment, which allowed the government to secure most of its external financing
needs for this year. While these developments are welcome, still-high public debt and related
financing needs, heavy reliance on nonresident financing, and a large open FX position continue to
pose significant risks. Hungary’s subdued medium-term growth prospects further exacerbate these
vulnerabilities.
39.
A stronger policy framework would help tackle these challenges. The improved
economic conditions provide an opportune time to reduce vulnerabilities and unlock Hungary’s
untapped growth potential. To this end, a recalibration of macroeconomic policies to build the
necessary policy buffers, alongside a renewed reform momentum aimed at addressing structural
impediments, strengthening institutions, and increasing policy predictability would contribute to a
faster reduction in risk premia, sustain market access, and boost investment and potential growth.
40.
Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is necessary to put the public debt ratio firmly on
a downward path. To this end, the authorities’ commitment to fiscal adjustment over the medium
term is welcome, and it will need to be backed by a clear and credible strategy encompassing
ambitious growth-friendly fiscal reforms. Those could include better targeting of social benefits,
restructuring the remaining loss-making SOEs, and streamlining public sector employment. This,
along with measures to reduce tax exemptions and address VAT fraud, would free up fiscal space for
growth-enhancing tax and expenditure measures. The government’s plan to introduce a binding
multi-year budget framework with the 2015 budget would bolster fiscal policy predictability and
help contain spending pressures. However, a more independent and adequately-resourced fiscal
council is essential to monitor the risks ahead and ensure the sustainability of public finances.
41.
The monetary policy easing should end and a tightening bias should be adopted. While
underlying inflationary pressures have eased and inflation expectations have come down to around
the MNB’s inflation target, uncertainty about the external environment justifies a cautious monetary
policy stance, particularly given Hungary’s vulnerability to exchange rate risk. In this regard, the
policy rate should be kept on hold and the current accommodative monetary stance can continue to
support economic activity. The precise timing of commencing the tightening cycle should depend
on signs that inflationary pressures are building up. However, the central bank should also stand
ready to tighten if external conditions deteriorate sharply. Adequate international reserves need to
be maintained to mitigate excessive exchange rate volatility and support financial stability.
42.
Well-functioning financial intermediation is essential for economic growth. While
demand factors contribute to weak credit market activity, banks’ balance sheet constraints have also
played a role. Removing regulatory, legal, and tax impediments, alongside a prompt introduction of
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

a personal insolvency framework, would help accelerate the cleanup of banks’ asset portfolios and
prevent repeated restructuring of non-performing loans. Reducing the tax burden on banks and
improving policy predictability would also support lending activity. To this end, it is essential to
ensure that future FX debt relief schemes would entail appropriate burden sharing among all
stakeholders. Subsidized lending under the FGS has helped improve credit conditions for SMEs, but
further refinement of the Scheme’s modalities could ensure a more effective monetary policy
transmission mechanism and a higher impact on economic activity. All in all, the scheme should
remain time-bound and limited to SMEs, with fiscal costs clearly recognized.
43.
Sustained progress on wide-ranging structural reforms would help unleash Hungary’s
full growth potential. Demand management policies cannot address the root causes of weak longterm growth. Instead, decisive implementation of structural reforms aimed at improving the
business climate, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, reducing the regulatory burden,
rationalizing taxes, and boosting productivity in the services sectors, including by restructuring the
remaining loss-making SOEs, is critical to boost potential growth and support Hungary’s
advancement in the regional supply chain. Increased policy predictability and limited government
interference in the economy would enhance market confidence and support private investment.
Efforts to increase labor supply and demand should continue, and greater emphasis should be
placed on mitigating skill mismatches, investing in knowledge industries to move up in the value
chain and compensate for the narrowing labor cost differentials, adjusting the tax wedge on low
income earners, and ensuring that minimum wage increases are in line with productivity growth.
44.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

also limit government interference in the economy, would help tackle domestic risks.

However, the program has been increasing the burden on public finances. Its focus has shifted
over time, from mostly part-time employment to largely full-time employment and the cost to the

Raising Hungary’s growth potential should
entail a more effective use of funds spent on the public works program. This could be achieved by
shifting resources from increasing the number of participants and the size of wage compensation
toward higher spending on vocational training, with a focus on new skills development. Hungary is
amongst the group of countries that have relatively high horizontal skills mismatch (a mismatch of field
of education) and retraining workers would be a relevant area to focus on.

HUF 250 billion, but it was later raised to HUF 425 billion (1½ percent of GDP). The maximum
maturity of the loans is 10 years and participating banks fully bear credit risk. The second pillar of
the scheme allocated HUF 325 billion to facilitate the conversion of SMEs’ FX loans into forint at
the same refinancing terms, but, given the high interest for the first pillar, the MNB enabled credit
institutions to use their credit lines allocated under the second pillar for the first pillar. The scheme
also established a third pillar (HUF 1,150 billion; equivalent to 4 percent of GDP) aimed at
reducing foreign currency liabilities of banks and MNB’s interest expenses by making foreign
exchange available to banks that would like to reduce their holdings of MNB bills and repay
external liabilities.
Second phase: This phase envisages an increase in the allocated amount up to HUF 2,000 billion
(6.6 percent of GDP), though only HUF 500 billion were initially allocated, to be operational until
end-2014. It has the same financing terms for banks, but 90 percent of the additional funds
available are required to be used for new loans only. The remaining 10 percent is available for
refinancing of the FX loans. More recently, participation requirements were relaxed to include real
estate companies, individual farmers, leasing companies, and non-bank financial intermediaries,
and the limit of financing for an individual borrower was raised to HUF 10 billion from
HUF 3 billion.
Utilization
About 93½ percent of the overall amount (HUF 701 billion) was disbursed to credit institutions.
The majority of the amount was disbursed to pillar I (HUF 472 billion), divided between new
investment loans (41½ percent), loans for working capital (26½ percent), and refinancing (about
43 percent), while HUF 229 billion was disbursed under pillar II (Table). The scheme also facilitated
a significant decline in the interest rate for new loans, and increased the average loan maturity.

Box 3. The Funding for Growth Scheme (concluded)
While the first phase was met by high interest by enterprises, the expansion of the FGS seems very
ambitious and its full utilization during the envisaged period does not seem to be realistic for a
number of reasons. First, the initial disbursement of FGS funds has already met a substantial part
of the SMEs’ demand for new credit. The lack of qualified borrowers makes the possibility of
banks expanding their loans by around 30 percent during an 18-month period very distant.
Related to this, Eximbank has been expanding its lending financed by issuance of external bonds,
especially focusing on meeting demand by exporting SMEs which arguably are higher-quality
borrowers. Second, many banks will not be able to substantially expand their lending under the
FGS due to balance sheet constraints. Finally, the current maximum interest rate of 2½ percentage
points may be attractive for lending to high-quality SMEs, but may be binding for more risky
ones.1/
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that banks will manage to utilize the full amount of the second
phase; and staff assumes that up to HUF 500 billion will be utilized. Indeed, central bank data
indicate that the utilization of the second phase in the first six months
(October, 2013–March, 2014) stood at about 18½ percent (HUF 92.7 billion), of which 11 percent
of the allocated amount was utilized for new investment loans.
Potential growth impact
A model-based approach (using the GIMF), which is calibrated for the Hungarian economy, is
employed to assess the potential impact of the FGS on economic growth.2/ The provision of FGS
funds is modeled as a temporary decrease in the riskiness of Hungarian corporate borrowers,
which in turn reduces the external financing premium. Thus, as a result of the utilization of the first
phase and assumed utilization of HUF 500 billion in the second phase, the cost of capital would
decline and, therefore, corporate debt and business investment would increase. Real GDP would
increase by approximately 0.1 percentage point compared to the baseline on impact because of
the increase in domestic demand, particularly investment. In the next periods, real GDP would be
higher by up to 0.2 percentage points.

1/ The FGS follows the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), which also aims at boosting lending to SMEs.
However, unlike the FGS, the FLS is based on collateral swap, with amounts depending on new lending. In addition, the FLS does
not impose a cap on the lending rate.
2/ The GIMF is a multi-region, forward-looking, DSGE model developed by the IMF for policy analysis and international economic
research. For details on GIMF, see Kumhof et al (2010) “The Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF)—Theoretical
Structure” IMF Working Paper 10/34, Washington: International Monetary Fund.

Box 4. Export Developments and External Competitiveness
Hungary’s integration into the German-Central European Supply Chain (GCESC) drove its
impressive export performance until 2009.1/ Starting in the mid-1990s, many German firms
outsourced or relocated part of the production process to the CE4 countries, starting with
Hungary, drawn to lower unit labor costs, high-quality human capital, and proximity to markets.2/
This integration process led Hungary’s export volume to quadruple during 1995–2009, while also
raising intermediate goods imports, particularly in the knowledge-intensive sectors such as the
automotive industry. Hungary also received substantial foreign direct investment from Germany
during that period, which brought technology transfers, raised Hungary’s external competitiveness
in the knowledge-intensive sectors and its domestic value added, creating jobs and supporting
income convergence.3/ Moreover, close economic ties with Germany served as a shock absorber
during the global financial crisis.
At the same time, the integration into the supply chain has posed challenges. The increased
trade dependency on Germany has been reflected in

contributed to increased exposure to global shocks.

The Cluster Report’s analysis indeed indicates that the

CE4 countries are more exposed to spillovers from the
90
rest of the world. This, together with the increased
85
concentration of exports in the knowledge-intensive
industries such as machinery and transport

equipment, suggests that Hungary needs to maintain

These challenges are further complicated by mounting competitiveness pressures. Since
2009, Hungary’s export growth moderated significantly and its share in world exports has been
declining. This may partly reflect peers’ catching up, but with no strong evidence of exchange rate
misalignment, it also reflects declining competitiveness. This is evidenced further in the recent
sharp decline of investment from 23 percent of GDP in the late 1990s to a record-low 17 percent
in 2012. Moreover, Hungary’s ranking in the Global Competitiveness report slipping by 11 places
in the past 3 years. As unit labor cost differentials with Germany narrow, Hungary may also face
difficulties in sustaining its current role in the GCESC, particularly given that other CESEE countries
are making strides in removing impediments to trade, thus becoming potential candidates for the
GCESC.

1/ See German-Central European Cluster Report, Country Report No. 13/263.
2/ The CE4 group comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland.
3/ During 1995–2009, domestic value added in Hungary’s exports increased by 14 percent of GDP, most of this in the
knowledge-intensive sectors.

Box 5. Hungary’s Linkages with Russia and Ukraine
The economic risks from developments in Russia and/or Ukraine, especially ones that lead to
disruptions in energy trade, would affect Hungary through its impact on the other economies of
the region and the global economy more than through direct linkages. Financial linkages may
become more pronounced at times of market turbulence, but are less likely to have adverse
spillover effects otherwise.
Russia is an important source of final demand for Hungarian goods, but mainly through
indirect supply chain links. Hungary’s direct export links with Russia and Ukraine are limited,
as it exports just 2 and 1¾ percent of GDP to each one, respectively—a total of 3½ percent of
Hungary’s exports—largely concentrated in the “machinery and transport equipment”
industries. However, final demand from Russia, in particular for automobiles produced in
Hungary and supplied indirectly through the German supply chain, is an important driver of
exports, and, thus, lower growth in Russia could lower Hungarian exports (see IMF European
Department, Regional Economic Issues, Spring 2014.)
Hungary has a significant dependency on Russia and Ukraine for its energy imports.
Hungary imports about 5½ percent of GDP from Russia and just below 1 percent of GDP from
Ukraine, with the former supplying most of Hungary’s imported gas and over 60 percent of its
imported fuel. In addition, there is only limited possibility for re-routing gas imports through
other countries. On the other hand, with seasonally-low demand and ample gas reserves
(about 3 months of consumption), Hungary can overcome short-lived disruptions. At the same
time, Hungary relies heavily on imported energy: 70 percent of the energy and 40 percent of
the electricity it consumes in a year. Moreover, as the entire region is heavily dependent on
energy imports from Russia, lengthy disruptions in gas supply would adversely affect
production in Hungary also through the impact on other countries.
Direct financial channels are limited, but a marked deterioration in market sentiment
could adversely affect Hungary. Hungary’s banking system is directly exposed to Russia and
Ukraine mostly through OTP’s subsidiaries, which account for 9 percent and 6 percent of the
group’s total assets, respectively. A sustained deterioration in the operating environment in
Russia/Ukraine would adversely affect OTP’s profitability, but given its high capital buffers, it is
unlikely to endanger the group’s financial soundness or have a significant effect on its
operations in Hungary. The market share of Sberbank, the only Russian bank operating in
Hungary, is only 2 percent and the bank is not systemically important. That said, a broader repricing of emerging market risk in the region may have considerable repercussions for
Hungary by reducing the appetite for Hungarian and/or other emerging market assets. This
impact could be amplified if some investors that play a significant role in the Hungarian and
Ukrainian markets decide to re-balance their portfolio and reconsider their exposure to the
region.
FDI links are limited. Hungary’s FDI positions in Russia and in Ukraine are 2.2 percent and
1.6 percent of total FDI abroad, respectively.

Box 6. The Role of SMEs
In Hungary, SMEs account for 53 percent of the business sector’s value added (2012). While
low compared to the EU median of 60 percent, it is broadly consistent with the share of other
countries that have integrated into the German-Central European supply chain (e.g., Czech
Republic, Poland, and Slovakia) where large multinational companies operate in the knowledgeintensive and high value added sectors. Moreover, SMEs’ employment amounts to 71 percent of
business sector’s employment, which is significantly above the EU median of 67 percent, thus
underscoring their pivotal role in job creation.
Performance
SMEs’ real value added fell by 28 percent during 2009–12, more than offsetting the sharp increase
in the pre-crisis period, while the decline in employment was more moderate (5½ percent). The

Overall, credit to SMEs contracted by 18 percent in

2012 relative to end-2008 and, although a sharp
decline of credit also took place among large enterprises, estimations by the MNB suggest that
supply-side factors mostly affected SMEs, while weak lending to large companies was mainly
attributable to lack of demand.1/
Impact on economic activity and policy response
A cross-country estimation is employed to study the impact of tight credit conditions faced by
SMEs on economic activity in Hungary.2/ The results suggest that a shock to lending standards
that is similar in magnitude to the estimated “net tightening” in 2008 (average of 20 percent,
“purged” of factors that also affect demand for credit) leads to a cumulative contraction of
1¾ percentage points of GDP in the following four quarters. This implies that nearly a quarter of
the GDP contraction in 2009 (6¾ percent) can be attributed to the tight lending conditions that
SMEs faced. As the adverse effect of the credit supply shock has a prolonged effect (estimated at
an additional 1 percentage point in the subsequent four quarters), the drag on economic activity
from the “net tightening” is likely to have persisted in subsequent years, particularly given that
banks continued to tighten lending standards in 2010. In 2011–12, credit supply conditions
remained broadly unchanged (on average); therefore, the adverse impact on economic activity is
likely to have moderated.

Box 6. The Role of SMEs (concluded)
Policy response
The MNB has responded to the tight credit conditions with both conventional and unconventional
measures. In parallel to the gradual reduction of the policy interest rate to a record low level of
2.6 percent (as of March 2014), the MNB launched the Funding for Growth Scheme in June 2013,
which, among others, aims to boost lending by providing loans to SMEs with preferential interest
rate (Box 3).3/ While the program has provided some relief and shifted credit growth to SMEs to a
positive territory, it is likely to have a limited impact on growth, absent complementary measures
to restore the banks’ financial intermediation role, including through an improvement in the
operational environment for banks. In this regard, steps to facilitate faster NPL resolution and to
reduce the tax burden are imperative.

3/ Additional mechanisms are in place to support SMEs’ access to financing. These include (i) state-owned guarantees provided
by Garantiqa, (ii) guarantees and direct lending by the Hungarian Development Bank, and (iii) government’s subsidized-shortterm lending program (“Szechenyi Card”).

Appendix I. Hungary: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Hungary’s high public and external debt and financing needs remain important sources of
vulnerability. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to remain at around 80 percent of
GDP while gross financing needs are forecast to hover above 20 percent of GDP. This exposes
Hungary’s public debt to considerable risks, particularly from lower GDP growth. External debt is
expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the government continuing to make net
repayments. The projected downward path is sensitive mainly to exchange rate shocks.
Under current policies, public debt is projected to remain at just under 80 percent of GDP
over the medium term. This scenario is underpinned by a net lending/borrowing balance of near
3 percent of GDP; interest rates on sovereign bonds and loans gradually increasing in line with
global WEO assumptions; and medium-term output growth of 1¾ percent. The scenario assumes
that financial markets remain accessible and there are no significant interest rate spikes, with
sovereign and maturity spreads remaining at near 2014 levels.
The baseline scenario is subject to considerable risks which, if materialized, would likely set
public debt on an increasing trajectory. With public debt at around 80 percent of GDP, negative
shocks, even of a relatively small size, may trigger adverse reactions from financial markets,
especially considering that annual gross financing needs are hovering above 20 percent of GDP with
large reliance on non-resident financing. Possible shocks include an increase in sovereign spreads
through contagion effects from other emerging economies, depreciation pressure on the exchange
rate, reduced appetite by international investors, and an increase in global interest rates in line with
U.S. monetary policy normalization. On the domestic front, risks include possible shocks to the
primary fiscal balance from long-standing fiscal vulnerabilities in the public sector, including
recurrent needs to restore service provision by SOEs; public wage pressures; and revenue
uncertainty driven by new tax schemes and volatile VAT and corporate tax collection.
Based on historical volatility, probabilistic analysis of debt dynamics indicates that public
debt could enter an increasing trajectory with a probability of 50 percent. Moreover, assuming
that policy rigidities do not allow improving the primary balance by more than 2 percent of GDP in a
single year, the probability that public debt enters into an increasing trajectory increases to
75 percent. This constraint is driven by the already high tax burden that leaves virtually no room for
significant revenue-raising measures, and also by the fact that expenditure-based consolidations
typically take more time to design and implement.
Hungary’s external debt has declined in recent years but remains high. Gross external debt has
declined from its peak of about 150 percent of GDP in 2009 to 119 percent by end-2013. The
improvement mainly reflects heavy bank deleveraging that began during the global financial crisis,
although this was partly offset by higher external government debt. Intra-company loans related to
FDI remain broadly stable, amounting to just above 20 percent of gross debt throughout this period.
Going forward, external debt is expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the
government continuing to make net repayments. External bond issuances and continued purchases

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

of HUF-denominated securities by nonresidents are expected to keep government external debt
elevated, albeit declining in percent of GDP over the medium term.
Shocks to the exchange rate in particular are the main source of risk to external debt
dynamics, reflecting high external liabilities. External debt remains sustainable under a range of
shocks. Staff analysis shows that external debt is particularly vulnerable to exchange rate shocks, and
to a lesser extent, to growth or current account shocks. A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent
would add nearly 35 percentage points of GDP to external debt. An adverse permanent growth or
current account shock of ½ standard deviation of their historical variation would add about 12 to
15 percentage points of GDP to external debt, respectively.

3/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
4/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
5/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
8/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) was finalized on January 28, 2009.
The assessment found that the central bank had a relatively strong safeguards framework in place.
The MNB’s control environment was well established, and the audit and financial reporting practices
adhered to international standards. The assessment recommended measures to improve the process
of program data reporting to the Fund and to strengthen audit oversight, especially over the central
bank’s basic tasks. In recent years the central bank law was subject to numerous changes. Going
forward, it is critical to avoid undue changes to the MNB’s legal framework and to ensure that the
law continues to support MNB’s operational and legal independence.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The Hungarian forint is classified as floating, effective November 1, 2008. Hungary has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions except for those maintained solely
for the preservation of national or international security and that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Effective February 27, 2012, the MNB
discontinued the program of foreign exchange sale tenders, which involved multiple exchange rates
for spot transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
Hungary is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV Board discussion took place on
March 18, 2013. The associated Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2013/pn1338.htm and the staff report at

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance


General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.



Government Finance Statistics: Data reporting on fiscal accounting needs to be improved
further. The monthly cash-basis accounts of the central government prepared by the
Ministry of National Economy do not reflect the GFS presentation and provide no
information on financing. This complicates staff’s ability to analyze trends and to
appropriately anticipate the impact on general government accounts. Data on revenue and
expenditure arrears has been readily provided by the authorities upon request, but provision
of this data on an automatic basis would facilitate the monitoring of obligations on an
accrual basis. Similarly, automatic provision of local government revenues and expenditures,
as well as of financial statements of state-owned enterprises (an important source of
contingent liabilities), would allow for closer regular monitoring of the general government.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 6, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Hungary
On May 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Hungary.1
Hungary’s economy emerged from the 2012 recession and posted 1.1 percent growth last
year, mainly driven by government investment and consumption, and also net exports.
Private demand—although strengthening on the back of accommodative monetary conditions
and improved market confidence—remained weak, and credit to the retail and corporate
sectors continued to contract, albeit at a slowing pace. Output growth is projected to pick-up
to 2 percent this year as investment and private consumption continue to improve, while
exports expand further. Underlying inflationary pressures have eased, and inflation
expectations have come down to around the National Bank of Hungary’s (MNB) inflation
target. Unemployment declined despite the increase in the participation rate, mainly due to
the expansion of public works programs; but labor market conditions remain weak.
Hungary has experienced a welcome reduction in its vulnerabilities thanks to a persistent
current account surplus, low headline inflation, and a significant fiscal consolidation. These
developments helped Hungary withstand various bouts of emerging market turmoil over the
past year relatively well. However, still-high public and external financing needs, heavy
reliance on nonresident funding, uncertainty regarding advanced economies’ monetary
policies, and the potential reemergence of financial stress in emerging markets pose risks.
The government has secured financing for most of its maturing external debt in 2014 with the
recent Eurobond placements.
Hungary has demonstrated a strong commitment to keeping the fiscal deficit within the EU
limit. The 2013 deficit is estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP, over-performing the 2.7 percent
target, as lower tax revenues were more than offset by prudent expenditure control. Public
debt declined only slightly to just above 79 percent of GDP. For 2014, the deficit target of

with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

2.9 percent of GDP implies a structural relaxation of about one percent of GDP leaving
public debt broadly unchanged at about 79 percent of GDP.
Comforted by decelerating inflation, low risk premia, and a negative output gap, the MNB
reduced the policy rate to a record-low level of 2.5 percent (as of April 2014). Furthermore,
the MNB introduced the Funding for Growth Scheme with the aim of easing access to
finance for SMEs and improving their credit conditions through the provision of subsidized
lending interest rate.
Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects remain subdued, as private consumption is still
hampered by the ongoing repair of households’ balance sheets; while the weak business
environment continues to weigh on private investment. Banks remain under stress, reflecting
the heavy tax burden, high non-performing loans, and a weak growth outlook. Labor
participation, while somewhat increasing, remains low. These challenges are further
compounded by rising competitiveness pressures, as reflected in the loss of export market
share, owing to the deterioration in the business climate, particularly the institutional
framework and tax policy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Hungary’s economic recovery, supported by accommodative
policies, but noted that the economy continues to face significant risks arising from an
uncertain global environment, the still high public debt, large financing needs, and extensive
reliance on non-resident funding.
Against this background, Directors underscored the need for a recalibration of
macroeconomic policies to rebuild policy buffers and ambitious structural reforms to
improve medium-term growth prospects. Priorities include strengthening institutions,
increasing policy predictability, and promoting private sector participation in the economy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence and sustainable debt
reduction. They encouraged the authorities to implement a durable adjustment strategy,
focusing on expenditure retrenchment and elimination of distortionary taxes. Continued
efforts are also needed to reduce tax exemptions and address VAT fraud. Directors noted that
these steps should be complemented by growth-friendly fiscal reforms, which could entail
better targeting of social benefits, restructuring the remaining loss-making SOEs, and
streamlining public sector employment. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to
introduce a multi-year budget framework and underscored the importance of an independent
and adequately-resourced fiscal council.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors observed that, while inflationary pressures have eased and inflation expectations
have come down, there remains uncertainty surrounding the external environment, which
calls for caution in monetary conduct. Directors saw merit in halting the monetary easing
cycle as long as there are no evident signs of inflationary pressures, noting that the current
accommodative stance can continue to support economic activity. They also emphasized that
adequate international reserves would help mitigate exchange rate volatility and support
financial stability.
Directors called for further steps to restore financial intermediation and facilitate the
resolution of non-performing loans, including by reducing taxes on banks and removing legal
and regulatory impediments to a clean-up of banks’ portfolios. They saw scope for further
refining the modalities of the Funding for Growth Scheme to improve the targeting and
effectiveness of its lending.
Directors welcomed progress in improving the functioning of the labor market. They stressed
that broad-based structural reforms are essential to boost potential growth and support
Hungary’s advancement in the regional supply chain. They also recommended improving the
business climate, including by reducing the regulatory burden and rationalizing taxes.

Statement by Mr. Prader and Mr. Benk on Hungary
May 23, 2014

Since the last Article IV consultation Hungary has achieved a remarkable reduction in
vulnerabilities despite the volatile external environment. Economic activity picked up in the
past one and a half year, driven both by internal demand and net exports. The external
balance has been strengthening, backed by the current account surplus and continuous
reduction in external debt. Disciplined fiscal policy preserved a stable fiscal balance and
moderately declining public debt.
That being said, the authorities are aware of the surrounding risks and remaining
vulnerabilities, stemming primarily from the volatile external environment and the still
elevated financing needs. They remain committed to prudent macroeconomic policies,
focusing their strategy on sustainable debt reduction, increasing labor participation,
improving competitiveness, and reducing financial vulnerabilities. The authorities thank staff
for the thorough and constructive discussions during the Article IV mission and for their
valuable advice on macroeconomic policies.
Economic developments and outlook
The economy strengthened in 2013, with output growth reaching 3.5 percent in the first
quarter of 2014. The composition of growth shifted towards a more balanced structure, where
the pick-up in external demand has been complemented by the recovery of internal demand,
backed by reviving public and private investment and consumption. The accelerating growth
is coupled with a rising current account surplus. Headline inflation decelerated sharply driven
by the still-existing spare capacities in the economy and one-off price cuts in regulated utility
prices.
Going forward, growth momentum is expected to persist over the forecast horizon. Against
the background of the latest incoming data the authorities are more optimistic than staff about
the growth prospects, expecting GDP growth rates exceeding 2.5 percent both for the current
and for next year. Rising exports will remain an important driver of growth, supported by
increasing FDI in the manufacturing sector and the new production capacities brought into
the automobile industry, in addition to the strengthening of external demand. Investment is
likely to pick up further, as the easing of credit constraints and the increased use of EU
funding add to the improved outlook for activity. Nevertheless, consumption recovers only
gradually despite the improved disposable income, as deleveraging continues to act as a drag
on households. Inflation is expected to rise back into the price stability range of 3 percent as
the output gap narrows and the one-off effects phase out. Labor market conditions remain
loose, with moderate wage conditions coupled with gradually improving private sector
employment.

2
Fiscal Policy and Consolidation
The authorities are fully committed to conduct prudent fiscal policies compatible with
sustainable debt reduction, and building buffers which allow for countercyclical policy. The
key building blocks of fiscal policymaking have been expenditure reductions through
structural measures, fair tax burden-sharing among various economic players in accordance
with their capacity, and employment-friendly taxation which shifts the burden from labor to
consumption and turnover taxes (growth-oriented reform).
Fiscal discipline and prudence helped the government to keep the deficit comfortably within
EU limits and exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Rigorous budget execution and
corrective actions, where needed, ensured that both the 2012 and 2013 deficits
overperformed the initial target. Going forward, fiscal policy seeks to support economic
recovery while complying with the requirements of the fiscal framework, which in turn is
based on keeping the deficit below 3 percent, complying with the medium-term fiscal plan
regarding the structural balance, and preserving the declining debt ratio.
In this vein, the 2014 budget allows for a countercyclical structural impulse of about 1
percentage point, while a broadly neutral fiscal stance is envisaged for the subsequent years.
Budgeted contingency reserves for 2014 provide sufficient buffers to address unforeseen
risks and meet the 2.9 percent deficit target at a comfortable margin. Corrective actions and
potential savings have already been identified in order to offset the underperforming
revenues due to lower than expected inflation.
The authorities appreciate staff’s constructive policy recommendation on the medium-term
fiscal adjustment strategy. Many of them, where feasible, are already under implementation,
or given due consideration for the 2015-17 fiscal plan. Several measures have been
implemented to address tax compliance and VAT fraud: reverse charge VAT mechanism in
the agricultural sector, connection of cash registers to the tax authority and limitation of cash
payments between firms, the effect of these showing already early results in the 2014 VAT
revenues. Streamlining the range of VAT preferential rates, while consistent with the
government’s general policy, should be evaluated against equity, inequality, social, and tax
efficiency considerations. Spending on non-EU related goods and services will remain under
strict nominal control and decline as a share of GDP, while public nominal wages remain
frozen except in the education and healthcare sectors. Social transfers will also decline
substantially as a share of GDP, as pensions are indexed to inflation, while other benefits
remain frozen. Sector specific taxes, except the bank levy, were replaced by consumption and
turnover type taxes (financial transaction levy, telecommunication tax) based on a “broad
base - low rate” approach. The centralization of the local government’s finances gives the
government stricter control over spending and contracting new local debt. The reorganization
of public transportation companies is ongoing.

3

Monetary Policy and Financial System
The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) launched an easing cycle in August 2012 in association
with the improving market sentiment vis-à-vis Hungary and the strong global risk appetite.
The subdued inflationary pressures, the still negative output gap, and the supportive risk
perception associated with the economy allowed the continuous lowering of the policy rate to
2.5 percent. Going forward, a cautious approach to policy is needed due to uncertainty in the
global financial environment. However, a tightening bias would be warranted only if risk
perception shifts and global volatility increases.
The current level of international reserves is adequate by a variety of metrics, and there is no
compelling evidence showing that the exchange rate is misaligned.
The monetary toolkit has been complemented by new elements. The MNB announced the
Funding for Growth Scheme in April 2013, aiming at providing liquidity to credit institutions
to alleviate disruptions in lending to SMEs, reinforce financial stability, reduce the external
vulnerability of the Hungarian economy, and ultimately revert the vicious credit squeeze low growth cycle. The first phase of the program (June-September 2013), with a disbursed
amount of about 2.5 percent of GDP, strengthened competition in the SME credit market and
substantially alleviated the interest burden of firms. The second phase, running until the end
of 2014, puts greater emphasis on the stimulation of economic growth by focusing on the
supply of new loans to finance new investments. Although the utilization of the second phase
evolves gradually owing to the time lag needed for the implementation of new projects, 60
percent of the 126 bn HUF (about 0.4 percent of GDP) of the already contracted loans as of
April were new investment loans.
From August 2014 on, the MNB’s main policy instrument will change: the two-week MNB
bill will be replaced by a two-week deposit facility, which only counterparties will be
allowed to hold with the Bank, and will be excluded from the range of eligible collateral for
the Bank’s lending operations. This will provide an incentive to the banking sector to
contribute to the reduction of the country’s external vulnerability by shifting the Hungarian
economy’s debt structure towards dominantly domestic financing sources. Other changes,
like the introduction of interest rate swap, long-term repo operation and asset swap can
encourage banks to buy long-term HUF government bonds and improve the maturity profile
of the public debt financing.
The integration of the financial supervisory authority into the central bank has been an
important improvement in the financial stability framework. The established Financial
Stability Board ensures the coordination between micro-prudential regulatory supervision of
the individual risks of institutions and macro-prudential regulatory oversight. The revision of
the Act on Credit Institutions – transposing the EU rules based on Basel III (CRD IV
directive) at the end of 2013 – has also strengthened the supervisory toolbox and financial
stability.

4
Debt and Financing Vulnerabilities
The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a declining path since 2010, dropping 3 percentage
points by the end of 2013. The share of FX-denominated debt declined by more than 10
percentage points during the past three years, thanks to the financing strategy of covering the
new financing needs by issuing domestic currency denominated papers, while FX
denominated bonds were issued only to cover rollover needs. The nonresident holdings share,
though still elevated, has turned to a declining trend during the past year, and there is also
evidence that the composition of the foreign investor base shifted towards more stable, real
money players. The retail bond program, started in 2012, has been highly successful and as a
result, domestic households are currently holding 10 percent of total government securities
stock. Additionally, domestic institutional investors increased their demand for government
securities, and, following some changes in monetary policy instruments, demand from banks
is expected to rise even more in the near future.
These developments, coupled with other improving external indicators, determined that
Hungary experienced lower volatility than other emerging markets during the market turmoil
over the past year.
Structural Reforms
Structural transformations and supply-side measures, intended to address structural
bottlenecks and raise Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects, are underway.
Diversification of export destinations, and gaining new markets are supported by the
provision of effective financing and insurance facilities for exporters by the operation of
Eximbank. Efforts are stepped up to develop a non-profit energy sector and reduce high
energy costs for investors to international levels.
Labor market conditions have been substantially reformed to boost both labor supply and
labor demand. On the demand side, changes to the Labor Code facilitated the shift towards
more flexible employment types. The Job Protection Act in 2013 reduced the tax wedge
(typically though allowances in social contribution tax) for disadvantaged groups with
perhaps the lowest productivity, but with the highest responsiveness to incentives to join the
workforce, such as low-income, low-skilled, young, old, long-term unemployed, returning
mothers, career starters. The Act covered more than half of low-wage earners. More recently,
the extension of the family tax allowance decreased further the tax wedge for families in the
lower income brackets. Nevertheless, measures based on reported income are not preferred
by the authorities due to the severe underreporting of income. However, differentiating the
minimum wage based on geographic regions or employee groups may be feasible. On the
supply side, the transformation of the unemployment and disability benefits and the early
retirement system, encouraged the return to the job market of the groups concerned. Mobility
benefits should alleviate geographical mismatches. Overall, the labor market reforms, aiming
at a workfare state and work-based social-security system, are already reflected by the
continuously rising labor force participation, private employment and public work scheme
employment, and declining unemployment.
