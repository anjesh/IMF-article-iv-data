Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation,
Ninth Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and

Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia and
Policy Development and Review Departments
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Saleh M. Nsouli and Michael T. Hadjimichael
November 16, 2004
•

Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation and the ninth review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement were held in Islamabad during August 30–September 7, 2004. The staff team
consisted of Messrs. Zavadjil (head), van Rooden, Schimmelpfennig (all MCD), Baig (FAD), Finger (PDR), and
Singh (ICM). Messrs. Khan (MCD) and Mirakhor (Executive Director) joined the mission during August 30–31.
The mission was assisted by Mr. Lorie (Senior Resident Representative).

•

The mission met with Prime Minister Aziz, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Husain, Finance Advisor
Shah, Finance Secretary Ahsan, and other government officials. The mission also met with representatives of
commercial banks, private and public enterprises, labor unions, and nongovernment organizations.

•

Pakistan’s request for a three-year arrangement under the PRGF, with access of 100 percent of quota
(SDR 1.03 billion), was approved by the Executive Board on December 6, 2001 (IMF Country Report
No. 01/222). So far, Pakistan has drawn SDR 861 million under the current arrangement. As of September 30,
2004, total Fund credit and loans outstanding to Pakistan amounted to SDR 1.3 billion (126 percent of quota).

•

The last Article IV consultation was discussed by the Executive Board on November 1, 2002 (IMF Country
Report No. 02/246). At that time, Executive Directors noted the progress made in achieving macroeconomic
stability, but urged the authorities to further improve public debt dynamics, address Pakistan’s social gap, and
deepen structural reforms. Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was discussed by the Executive
Board on March 8, 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/24 and 04/70). Directors noted that it represented an
adequate framework for Pakistan’s efforts toward sustainable growth and poverty reduction and provided a
sound basis for Fund concessional assistance. The Executive Board completed the eighth program review on
June 23, 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/211), when Directors commended the authorities for the country’s
impressive recovery from macroeconomic crisis, despite sometimes difficult domestic and external
circumstances. They stressed that the country still faced major challenges to ensure that growth was maintained
and translated into sustained poverty reduction.

•

Pakistan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. It maintains a restriction subject to Fund approval in the
form of a 50 percent limit on advance payments for some imports.

Executive Summary
Pakistan has successfully recovered from the 1998/99 crisis. Growth has rebounded to
6½ percent. Fiscal adjustment, supported by official inflows and debt relief, has led to a
substantial improvement in public and external debt indicators. Reflecting strong export
growth and remittances, the balance of payments has turned around and international
reserves now cover six months of imports. Still, poverty and unemployment remain high.
Implementation of the PRGF program remains broadly on track. All quantitative
performance criteria (PCs) and indicative targets for end-June 2004 were met. Structural
reforms continue to be advancing, although four structural PCs were breached. A temporary
intensification of an existing and the imposition of a new exchange restriction, however,
were quickly reversed, and new tax exemptions have been offset by other tax measures,
while a missed PC in the energy sector has since been implemented.
The discussions focused on the key policy challenges of sustaining strong economic
growth and reducing poverty. To help lift a significant share of the population out of
poverty, the authorities are aiming to increase the pace of economic growth to 8 percent
annually over the medium term. This is ambitious and will require a substantial increase in
private and public investment. Improvements in the investment climate through structural
reforms, including in the energy sector, are necessary to raise domestic investment and
attract more foreign investment. Accelerating growth will also require the continuation of
sound macroeconomic policies.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy aims to balance the need for higher
levels of social and investment spending with reducing the debt burden. The 2004/05
budget is consistent with this strategy and aims to limit the overall fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) to 3.2 percent of GDP, helping to reduce the public debt ratio to 63 percent of GDP.
Creating room for a further increase in health and education spending, as well as
infrastructure investments, will depend on raising tax revenues and further reducing transfers
to state-owned enterprises.
Inflation picked up in 2003/04 and the SBP has stepped up its efforts to tighten
monetary policy. While inflation appears to have leveled off recently, the SBP should
tighten monetary policy further to avoid that inflationary expectations become engrained. A
tighter monetary stance would also alleviate pressures on the exchange rate and reduce the
need for exchange market intervention.
Pakistan will not seek a successor arrangement once the current PRGF arrangement
expires in December 2004. The authorities remain committed, however, to maintaining a
close dialogue with Fund staff. The staff’s position is that Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) is
not warranted for Pakistan, even under the proposed framework for extending PPM to PRGF
resources. The outstanding combined PRGF/GRA resources at end-2004 will be only
117 percent of quota, given the authorities’ commitment not to draw the final PRGF tranche,
while Pakistan’s external position has strengthened considerably.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In the attached letter dated November 12, 2004 and the accompanying
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the government of Pakistan
requests completion of the ninth and final review under the PRGF arrangement. The
authorities also request waivers for the nonobservance of four structural PCs. While the tenth
disbursement is conditional upon completion of this review, the authorities state in the
attached letter that they will not draw the final tranche.
2.
The political and security situations remain complex. A new government was
announced in August 2004. Prime Minister Aziz retained the finance portfolio, which bodes
well for the continuation of reforms. Pakistan’s National Assembly has approved a bill to
allow President Musharraf to continue as both president and army chief, much to the ire of
the opposition. Operations against militants in the border areas are ongoing and have
prompted retaliation from affected groups, including an attempt on the prime minister. The
dialogue with India is progressing, though differences over Kashmir remain.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
As part of the Article IV consultations, the staff took a fresh look at
developments and reforms since the 1998/99 crisis, and particularly performance under
the 2000 Stand-By Arrangement and the subsequent PRGF arrangement. By 1998/99,
Pakistan had virtually run out of foreign exchange reserves and public debt obligations were
not being met. Economic growth had slowed to an average of below 3 percent in 1996/97–
1998/99. The Stand-By Arrangement focused therefore on restoring macroeconomic
stability. The subsequent PRGF arrangement centered on further strengthening
macroeconomic stability, raising growth, and reducing poverty.1 The PRGF arrangement
included wide-ranging structural reforms, focusing on revenue administration, expenditure
management, and the energy and financial sectors. Unlike under previous programs,
quantitative targets were mostly met or exceeded, and structural reforms measures were
largely followed through, though in some cases with delays.
4.
The fiscal and monetary policy mix yielded quick macroeconomic stabilization
(Table 1, see also Box 1). Significant fiscal consolidation was achieved largely by savings on
the interest bill and increases in nontax revenues. The resulting fiscal space was used to
reduce government debt while raising social- and poverty-related spending. Monetary policy
was tightened immediately after the crisis, and inflation was brought down successfully.
Large remittances strengthened the Pakistani rupee and helped to achieve an unprecedented
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. This allowed the SBP to reduce interest rates,

This strategy is further elaborated in Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IMF Country Report
No. 04/24).

Box 1. Pakistan’s Macroeconomic Improvement—Windfall or Homemade?
Of great interest in both Pakistan and abroad
has been the question of whether the stronger
macroeconomic situation stems primarily from
an improved external setting in the aftermath
of the September 11, 2001 events, or because of
domestic adjustment. Many, sometimes
complex, external factors have affected Pakistan’s
economy. On the positive side, Pakistan has
benefited from higher external grants and
remittances, and increases in textile and clothing
quota allowances. On the negative side, Pakistan
has suffered from high petroleum prices, a
prolonged drought (2000–02) and the perception
of a worsened security situation. These factors are
not easily quantified, but a decomposition of the
fiscal and external accounts can shed some light
on the contribution of external versus domestic
factors.

contributed to Pakistan’s reserve build-up, as higher gross inflows merely helped to meet the increase in Pakistan’s
external obligations. On the fiscal side, the improvement in the overall balance (including grants) was helped by
significantly higher grants, but were facilitated also by improvements in nontax revenue (including defense receipts),
along with substantial savings on domestic interest expenditure (see table). Lower domestic borrowing costs reflected
improved macroeconomic policies and financial reforms.

Growth has recovered from crisis and adverse circumstances. After emerging
from the financial crisis, a severe drought, and the post-September 11 environment,
Pakistan’s growth performance compares well with regional peers. Initially, net external
demand supported growth. However, in 2003/04, the contribution of net external demand
turned negative and domestic demand has taken over as the engine of growth.

There is no clear evidence yet on
poverty trends, reflecting a lack of
comparable current data (see Box 2).
Encouragingly, per capita GDP has grown
significantly. Social- and poverty-related
expenditures have been raised to 4.7 percent of
GDP in 2003/04, from 3.8 percent of GDP in
2001/02. However, many intermediate outcome
indicators for the health and education sectors
have yet to show significant improvements

limited administrative and institutional capacity

be a constraint to rapid progress in poverty
reduction. Meanwhile, real wages in the
manufacturing sector have declined by
7½ percent in real terms since 2000/01. Pakistan
is still ranked low in the 2004 UNDP human
development index. Overall, poverty remains
widespread and Pakistan faces a major challenge
in trying to meet its Millennium Development
Goals (Table 3).

Box 2. Poverty Trends
A government survey conducted in early 2004 suggests that poverty has fallen over the last three years.
The survey showed a decline by 4 percentage points in the poverty rate, to 23 percent. However, the results of
this survey are not fully comparable with those from earlier household surveys, as its sample size was much
smaller and the poverty line may have been underestimated. But even taking this into account, the recent survey
does seem to indicate a positive trend. Other, more comprehensive surveys have been launched recently (MEFP,
paragraph 25), but their results will only become available in the second half of 2005. A firm assessment of
poverty trends cannot be made until the results of these surveys are known. Reports from nongovernmental
organizations and labor unions meanwhile claim that the poor have yet to benefit from the recovery and that
inequality has been rising in recent years.

7.
Structural reforms aimed at establishing a modern economy were successful in
many areas. The banking sector is more competitive and efficient following restructuring
and privatization, as well as the strengthening of supervision and prudential regulations.2
Foreign exchange transactions have been further liberalized, including through allowing
banks to purchase foreign exchange from money changers. Finally, Pakistan has liberalized
its trade regime substantially in recent years, reducing tariffs and removing most nontariff
barriers.
8.
Fiscal reforms also made progress. The revenue system has been strengthened
through administrative reforms, the introduction of universal self-assessment, as well as
reductions and rationalizations of customs tariffs and tax rates. However, despite these
reforms, revenue collection has strengthened only modestly in recent years, and Pakistan’s
revenue-to-GDP ratio remains low in international comparison.3 Improvements have been

recommendations for strengthening the revenue intake.

made in expenditure releases and fiscal reporting, but systems still have to catch up with the
devolution process. In a few areas, the legislative agenda still has to be completed, including
the implementation of the fiscal responsibility, benami,4 and anti-money laundering laws.
9.
The role of the state in the economy has diminished and governance improved.
Governance in fiscal and financial management has been strengthened, but weaknesses
remain in the energy sector, tax and local administration, and the police. Regulatory agencies
to protect the consumer and ensure stability have been established in many areas, while the
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has been split into smaller companies
to improve governance and facilitate privatization. However, government intervention
continues to be evident in the wheat and cotton markets and in the pricing of petroleum
products and electricity, which has undermined the budget. Political devolution has laid the
groundwork for improving social service delivery, but full administrative and financial
empowerment of local governments is still lacking.
III. RECENT PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF ARRANGEMENT
10.
The PRGF program is broadly on track. All quantitative PCs and indicative targets
for end-June 2004 have been met (see MEFP, Table 1a). Moreover, all but four structural
PCs have been met (see MEFP, Table 2, and Box 3).
Box 3. Structural Conditionality
1.

Coverage of structural conditionality for the last review under the PRGF program

The focus of structural conditionality for the last review has been on broadening the tax base, strengthening tax
and customs administration, and advancing electricity sector reforms (MEFP, Table 2). The large number of
energy sector measures reflects the importance of this sector for the achievement of macroeconomic objectives,
notably fiscal consolidation, as well as frequent delays in implementing reforms in this sector.
2.

Status of structural conditionality from earlier reviews

Despite some delays, all of the structural conditionality has been largely met. Some tax exemptions that should
have expired were extended, while some new exemptions were introduced. The impact on the budget, however,
has been negligible.
3.

Structural areas and conditionality covered by World Bank lending

The World Bank approved in September the first of three Poverty Reduction Support Credits. Conditionality
aims predominantly at (a) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) accelerating power and gas sector reforms;
(c) increasing fiscal space for health and education expenditures; and (d) improving governance through
(i) reforms in financial management, procurement, and other anti-corruption and accountability institutions;
(ii) civil service reform; and (iii) devolution, through the transfer of increased resources to lower levels of
government.

Box 4. Rebasing of National Accounts Statistics
In the spring of 2004, the Federal Bureau of Statistics completed a revision of Pakistan’s national
accounts statistics. The objective was to bring Pakistan’s national accounts closer in line with the 1993 UN
System of National Accounts. As part of the exercise, the base year was moved from 1980/81 to 1999/2000. The
new statistics capture better the changes that have occurred in the Pakistani economy in the past 20 years, as
several areas of economic activity had been either seriously underestimated or not captured at all.
The rebasing exercise resulted in GDP estimates for 1999/2000 and following years that were almost
20 percent higher compared to the old base estimates. This, however, leaves the fundamental policy
assessment largely unchanged. Per capita income, while improved, remains low. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
lower, but is still relatively high. Revenue collection and social spending now appear even lower in the relation
to the new GDP, underscoring the need for continued policy efforts.

The SBP has started to tighten monetary policy. Rapid growth of broad money has
been driven predominantly by strong private sector credit growth, fueled by low interest rates
and ample bank liquidity (Tables 7 and 8). The SBP has raised treasury bill (TB) cut-off rates in
recent months; the six-month TB rate was increased by around 100 basis points between
January and August 2004, and by another 39 basis points in September 2004. Policy makers
resisted market pressures to tighten more quickly in an effort to balance inflation and growth
objectives. Real interest rates for maturities up to three years remain negative.

The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in 2003/04 was lower than
programmed (Table 9). Despite higher-than-projected private transfers, the current account
surplus was smaller than targeted. This reflected high imports during the second half of the fiscal
year on account of rising oil prices and strong domestic demand. The capital account was also
weaker than expected, because of shortfalls in project lending and prepayment of relatively
expensive external debts. Still, SBP foreign exchange reserves increased to $10.6 billion at endJune 2004 (six months of next year’s imports of goods and nonfactor services), despite sales by
the SBP in the fourth quarter to slow the depreciation of the Pakistani rupee. These pressures
continued in the first quarter of 2004/05. Given the inflation differential to Pakistan’s trading
partners, this led to an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, partly reversing the
sustained depreciation that took place since 2002. In November 2004, the SBP imposed a new
and intensified an existing exchange restriction on advance payments of imports (first missed
structural PC, MEFP, paragraph 21), but shortly thereafter reversed the measure.

Revenue administration and fiscal reporting have been strengthened, but new
tax exemptions have been introduced. Additional medium- and large-taxpayer units, as
well as a pilot customs office, have been opened, organized along functional lines and
stressing taxpayer facilitation. The 2004/05 federal budget was prepared according to a new
chart of accounts that is largely Government Finance Statistics compatible. Five minor tax
exemptions were introduced or extended (second missed structural PC, see MEFP,
paragraph 10) in the 2004/05 budget, but it also included offsetting measures, for example
the introduction of a capital value tax on stock transactions and of duties on IT equipment
and oil exploration. Overall, revenue projections have been revised up.
16.
Reforms in the power sector are advancing, though measures were again
delayed. The financial performance of the two power utilities in 2003/04 was better than
projected, largely because of a weather-related better fuel mix (Tables 10 and 11). A
restructuring of the power sector has now been completed with the unbundling of WAPDA
into generation, transmission, and regional distribution companies. However, preparation of
financial recovery plans for WAPDA’s successor companies has been delayed because the
regulator has yet to determine tariffs in line with the cost recovery principle (third missed
structural PC, see MEFP, paragraph 13). Implementing the determination would have
implied much higher than budgeted subsidies to the utilities, which would have put the fiscal
targets at risk. The government announced an energy tariff subsidy policy in early November
after some delay (fourth missed structural PC).
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
17.
In the Article IV discussions, the staff underscored three core themes that had
emerged from the experience under the Stand-By Arrangement and the PRGF program:
•

High growth and rising social- and poverty-related expenditures by themselves
do not guarantee rapid poverty reduction. Poverty remains widespread and
intermediate outcome indicators do not (yet) show significant improvements.
Analysis of poverty trends is made difficult by the lack of reliable data.

•

Pakistan made major gains in macroeconomic stabilization, but these trends can
easily reverse. While inflation is still relatively low, it has picked up quickly in the
last year, and there has been pressure on international reserves.

•

Structural reforms were pursued forcefully in many areas. But energy pricing and
expansion of the tax net have proved politically difficult. It will take a strong
sustained effort to enhance the capacity of local governments to improve social
services delivery.

18.
With these themes in mind, the discussions focused on how to maintain and
possibly accelerate economic growth, while ensuring that this translates into a lasting
reduction in poverty. Also central to the discussions was the need to maintain
macroeconomic stability and further reduce external vulnerabilities.

- 16 -

A. Macroeconomic Prospects and Vulnerabilities
19.
The Pakistani authorities aim to further accelerate the rate of economic growth
to 8 percent annually by 2007/08 (MEFP, paragraph 15). This is ambitious, but appropriate
in light of the strong current performance and the experience in Pakistan that only growth of
over 6 percent reduces poverty significantly.6 The authorities recognize that higher growth
will require first and foremost the continuation of sound economic policies and marketoriented structural reforms, as envisaged in the PRSP.
20.
Achieving such high rates of growth will require a substantial increase in private
and public investment, and a major improvement in factor productivity. Higher
investment in turn will require increased saving, both domestic and foreign. Given the need
to further reduce Pakistan’s debt burden and with the current account moving into a deficit,
higher foreign saving should ideally come through foreign direct investment (FDI). However,
international investors often have a perception of poor security in Pakistan, and this may
affect FDI flows. Domestic investors

21.
Higher rates of growth and less poverty will be difficult to achieve without a
sizable improvement in productivity in agriculture. Agriculture still accounts for almost
one quarter of Pakistan’s economy and poverty incidence is much higher in rural areas. In the
coming years, major investments are planned to improve the availability of water, which
could remove a key constraint to agricultural growth.

7

See Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IMF Country Report No. 04/24).

A cross-country analysis exploring differences in growth rates among low and middle income countries finds
that weak human capital indicators are an important constraint to growth in Pakistan (see the accompanying
Selected Issues paper (refer to www.imf.org)).

- 17 -

22.
Even with somewhat lower-than-targeted rates of growth, progress toward
achieving public debt sustainability should be possible. Historically, Pakistan has
experienced average growth rates of almost 5 percent annually. With an average annual
growth rate of 6 percent in the coming years (the baseline scenario in Annex I), and
maintaining a budget deficit (excluding grants) of about 3 percent of GDP, Pakistan’s debt
indicators would improve substantially in the future.
23.
Although several risks remain, Pakistan is now much better placed to cope with
potential shocks than at any time in the past decade. The main risks include domestic or
regional instability, adverse weather conditions, and a weaker-than-envisaged external
environment, including possibly because of the end of the textile quota system. The
continuation of sizable grants and nontax revenues is not assured. Also, strong
macroeconomic outcomes have led to domestic political pressures for more accommodating
policies. Stress tests, however, indicate that even under considerably worse scenarios,
Pakistan would still make progress toward further reducing the debt burden, albeit at a
slower pace.
B. Fiscal Policy
24.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy aims to balance the need for
higher levels of social and investment spending with reducing the debt burden. These
twin goals imply increased efforts to raise revenues and social spending, while maintaining
an overall deficit (excluding grants) of about 3 percent of GDP. With 6 percent economic
growth, this would result in a decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to about 50 percent by
2008/09, consistent with the path set out in the PRSP and the draft Fiscal Responsibility
Law, which is expected to be approved soon. CBR revenues are targeted to increase
gradually by 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 4–5 years, owing mainly to
administrative measures. This, combined with a reduction in transfers to state-owned
enterprises, allows for further increases in social and development spending in the period up
to 2008/09.
25.
The staff supports the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy, although it
could be more ambitious on tax revenues. Higher revenue targets should be feasible in
light of ongoing efforts to strengthen revenue administration and the potential to widen the
tax net further (see below). This would give the government the option of increasing social
spending beyond the level envisaged in the PRSP, provided the capacity of local
governments can be strengthened to absorb the additional funds. Meanwhile, the authorities’
strategy involves a substantial reduction in energy subsidies over the coming years, which
will depend on allowing electricity tariffs to cover costs.
26.
The 2004/05 budget is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term strategy and
the prospects for meeting this year’s fiscal targets are good (MEFP, paragraphs 17–19).
A 15 percent wage and pension increase and much lower-than-programmed petroleum levies,
as oil price increases are not being passed on to consumers, resulted in a gap compared to the
program, but this will be offset by higher-than-budgeted tax and nontax revenues. The main

- 18 -

downside risk to the budget comes from the possibility that international oil prices will be
higher than assumed in the latest World Economic Outlook and that the power sector may
require higher subsidies because of a lower-than-expected availability of hydro energy and
higher oil prices. This would need to be offset elsewhere within the expenditure envelope, or
by higher nontax revenues, which are still estimated conservatively. The staff urged the
authorities to start passing on the higher oil prices to consumers promptly, as it is not certain
when international oil prices will come down. The authorities are considering this issue and
expect an adjustment to take place in the next few weeks.
C. Monetary and External Policies
27.
The SBP’s monetary policy is geared to both control inflation and support
growth. In addition, exchange market intervention is targeted at maintaining competitiveness
and limiting fluctuations of the exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee. During the past few
years, ample slack in the economy combined with a strong demand for money permitted the
SBP to keep interest rates low and support economic growth, while inflation remained very
low. Inflation—including core inflation—started to pick up, however, in the second half of
2003, signaling that monetary conditions had gradually become too loose (MEFP,
paragraph 6).
28.
The SBP has stepped up its efforts to stem inflation. The SBP started to raise
interest rates in October 2003, but it initially did so in very small steps, in order not to choke
off the economic recovery. The SBP felt that inflation was largely the result of supply-side
factors and not easy monetary conditions, so that a tightening would not be effective.8
However, as inflation continued to trend upwards, the SBP started to tighten monetary policy
more forcefully in September 2004 (MEFP, paragraph 21). With this, the SBP aims to reduce
12-month inflation to below 5 percent by June 2005, implying an annual average rate of
inflation of about 7 percent for 2004/05.
29.
The staff welcomes the SBP’s more aggressive monetary stance. While annual
average inflation is still in single digits, the staff believes that the increase in inflation could
fuel inflation expectations. If left unchecked, a harsher tightening will be required later on,
with more adverse effects on growth. While inflation appears to have leveled off in the last
three months, the staff urges the SBP to tighten monetary policy more forcefully. More
generally, the staff recommends the SBP to focus monetary policy primarily on curbing
inflation, as it is currently pursuing too many objectives.

8

While modeling inflation is difficult in Pakistan, an empirical study in the accompanying Selected Issues paper
(refer to www.imf.org) suggests that rapid private sector credit growth is associated with higher inflation.

- 19 -

30.
A tighter monetary stance should also alleviate pressures on the exchange rate
and reduce the need for exchange market intervention. The SBP has allowed some
greater nominal exchange rate flexibility in recent years, while trying to limit volatility in the
market. It has also monitored closely Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate with a view to
maintaining competitiveness. This approach has contributed to the recovery of confidence in
the Pakistani rupee, export-led growth, and strong foreign exchange reserves. The staff noted
that if substantial pressures were to arise in the foreign exchange market, additional exchange
rate flexibility could relieve pressures on monetary policy.
31.
The current level of the real exchange rate is appropriate. Assuming a broadly
unchanged real exchange rate, progress will continue to be made toward achieving external
sustainability. The staff projects that exports and imports will continue to grow strongly, with
the current account shifting into a small deficit. Exports will benefit from the expanding
world economy and possibly from the end of the textile quota system, while imports will
increase due to strong domestic demand. External competitiveness will need to be monitored
closely, though, in view of the uncertainties related to the removal of the textile quotas. The
SBP is projected to accumulate reserves for 2004/05 as a whole, but at a slower pace than in
the past few years. The program remains fully financed (Table 12).
32.
The government has pursued an active public debt management policy. The
objectives have been to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and the share of interest payments in
government expenditures, while also reducing external vulnerability and, more recently,
re-establishing a presence in international capital markets. A tighter fiscal policy and debt
relief have been key to achieving these goals, but early repayment of relatively expensive
foreign debts, swapping fixed-interest obligations for floating ones, and an increased reliance
on short-term TBs have helped to reduce the interest cost. This has, however, resulted in
additional interest rate risk. The staff acknowledged that Pakistan will rely increasingly on
international capital markets and therefore needs to keep a presence in these markets. The
staff observed that local debt markets currently provide a cheaper funding source compared
to prevailing Eurobond yields and urges that the overall borrowing strategy also strive to
limit interest and exchange rate risks, and that the further issuance of Eurobonds (and Islamic
bonds) be considered carefully.9 The staff urges the authorities to finalize the remaining
rescheduling agreements with Paris Club and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors, consistent
with the December 2001 Paris Club agreement.

accompanying Selected Issues paper (refer to www.imf.org).

D. Structural Policies
Fiscal reforms
33.
Raising the share of tax revenues to GDP will be critical to realizing the fiscal
strategy (Table 13). By making the tax regime more taxpayer-friendly and improving
governance in this area, the authorities hope to further stimulate growth and thus raise
additional revenues. While the staff supports

34.
Revenue collection will continue to be strengthened through the CBR reform
project. Efforts are directed at bringing more taxpayers under the tax net and improving
compliance of existing taxpayers. Key elements are the shift to a functional organization that
relies on self-assessment and risk-based auditing, to minimize and streamline interaction
between taxpayers and officials, and thus to reduce corruption.
35.
Devolution is a key element of the fiscal strategy. As part of the devolution
process, the main responsibility for the provision of key social services, including health
care, education, and water supply and sanitation, now rests with provincial and local
governments. For service delivery to improve, political devolution now needs to be followed
up by administrative and financial devolution, to ensure that the provincial and local
governments have the administrative and financial means to carry out their increased
responsibilities. In this context, the staff hopes that an agreement can be reached soon on a
new National Finance Commission award that would transfer a greater share of the divisible
pool of taxes to provinces, with the expectation that the additional resources will be passed
on to local governments through the Provincial Finance Commission mechanism. Local
governments will also need to receive full authority over their civil servants from provincial
governments. Measures are also being taken to strengthen fiscal reporting and eventually
introduce a medium-term budget framework (MEFP, paragraph 24).
Financial reforms
36.
Financial sector reforms have resulted in a more efficient and resilient banking
system that is better placed to channel domestic savings to their most productive use.
About 75 percent of the banking sector is now privately owned. The government still has the

- 21 -

majority share in the country’s largest bank—the National Bank of Pakistan—and minority
stakes in some smaller banks, which it may wish to divest. The recent Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) (IMF Country Report No. 04/215) found that financial
soundness indicators have greatly improved in recent years (Table 14). It also found good
compliance with international supervisory standards. The authorities agreed with the findings
of the FSSA and its recommendations.

end-2005, with an increase to
PRs 1.5 billion by end-2004 as an intermediate step. The sharp rise in equity and housing
prices is another indicator that the financial sector is heating up, though price-earnings ratios
do not yet appear to be excessively high. With the phased introduction of margin financing
over the next year, replacing badla10 financing, the stock market should become less
vulnerable to speculative exuberance. The reform process will now need to focus on nonbank
financial services (insurance and pensions) to strengthen domestic savings. A draft antimoney laundering (AML) law will be submitted to parliament in the near term. The SBP,
meanwhile, has strengthened its AML and Combating Terrorist Financing (CFT) regulations,
tightening requirements for record keeping and reporting of suspicious transactions. The
assessment of the AML/CFT framework by the Asia Pacific Group has been postponed until
the new AML legislation has been passed.
Trade policy
38.
Pakistan continues to liberalize its trade regime, while working to reduce trade
barriers with major partners.11 Currently, the maximum tariff rate is 25 percent and the
number of slabs has been reduced to four (5, 10, 20, and 25 percent). With the 2004/05

- 22 -

budget, selective tariffs on capital goods were lowered, and the average customs duty was
reduced to 14.9 percent. In April 2004, a cooperation agreement between Pakistan and the
European Union (EU) came into force, providing an overall framework for economic
cooperation. Pakistan is to lose Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status for clothing
exports to the EU at the beginning of 2005. However, the EU has announced a general
overhaul of its GSP policy for 2006 and there is a possibility that Pakistan could regain its
status under the new policy. Following the Trade and Investment Agreement signed last year
by the United States and Pakistan, bilateral trade talks are proceeding. Pakistan’s long-term
objective is to achieve a bilateral free trade area with the United States and to achieve GSP
status in the short run.
39.
At the end of 2004, the global system of bilateral quotas in textiles will expire,
leading to changes in global trade patterns. Pakistan is vulnerable to such shifts because
the share of clothes and textiles in total exports exceeds 70 percent. Nevertheless, based on a
number of studies, Pakistan is in a group of countries that is expected to gain from the
removal of quotas, though a short-term negative impact on prices could be experienced.12
Enterprise reforms and investment climate
40.
Following through on power sector reforms will be crucial to reduce the sector’s
drain on the budget.13 With the unbundling of WAPDA and the establishment of a regional
tariff and subsidy policy, crucial steps have been taken to improve efficiency in the power
sector. But the authorities will now need to complete power sector reforms, with the
assistance of the World Bank, by strengthening governance and accountability—including
through privatization—setting economically sound tariffs, and reducing costs—through a
greater use of natural gas and reducing technical losses. Plans for the privatization of KESC,
the Faisalabad Electric Supply Corporation, the Jamshoro generation company, and the Kot
Addu Power Company are at an advanced stage (MEFP, paragraph 26).
41.
The authorities will continue to deregulate the economy so as to reduce the cost
of doing business in Pakistan. A recent World Bank analysis found that it is easier to
enforce contracts or to start up a new business in Pakistan than elsewhere in the region—the
time for a business start-up has been cut in half to 24 days in 2003—but that labor laws are
more restrictive, making it more difficult to hire and fire staff than elsewhere in the region.
The authorities are currently working on a major rationalization of industrial and commercial
labor laws. Meanwhile, independent regulatory agencies have been established for the
electricity and the oil and gas sector, while the government’s deregulation policy for the

Performance of two other state-owned enterprises, Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel Mills,
has also improved, while less progress has been made in turning around Pakistan Railways. For details on these
companies, see the accompanying Selected Issues paper (refer to www.imf.org).

telecommunications sector provides for an open licensing regime, both for fixed-line and
cellular services. The authorities plan to divest remaining state assets through strategic sales
and public offerings.
E. Statistical Issues
42.
The authorities are working on further improvements in Pakistan’s statistics,
with a view to subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. The staff
believes that data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance and program monitoring
purposes (see Appendix III). The lack of recent poverty indicators, however, hampers the
tailoring of expenditures to better achieve policy objectives. Improvements in some statistical
practices and databases—particularly in the national accounts and government finance
statistics, and to a lesser extent in monetary statistics—are being made. A Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, combined with a Detailed Assessments
Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework, is expected to be finalized shortly, pending
finalization of the authorities’ response.
V. FUND RELATIONS
43.
Pakistan will not seek a successor arrangement once the current PRGF
arrangement expires in December 2004. Instead, Pakistan will rely on domestic and
international capital markets to meet its financing needs, complemented by continued support
from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and bilateral donors.
44.
The staff’s position is that PPM would not be warranted for Pakistan, even
under the proposed framework for extending PPM to PRGF resources,14 because:
•

The outstanding combined PRGF/GRA resources at end-2004 will be only
modestly over 100 percent of quota. This takes into account the authorities’
commitment not to draw the final tranche under the PRGF arrangement, leaving
projected outstanding resources at 117 percent of quota (Table 15).

•

Pakistan’s external position has strengthened considerably and the external
outlook is favorable (Table 16). The public debt burden, though still high, has been
significantly reduced, external reserves are at comfortable levels, and access to
international capital markets has been regained. In the staff’s opinion, PPM is not
required for the purpose of safeguarding Fund resources. The authorities announced
as early as June 2003 that the country would not seek another Fund arrangement and
instead would move to a standard Article IV surveillance relationship.

14

The Executive Board agreed on March 31, 2004 to extend PPM to include outstanding use of PRGF
resources. A Board paper implementing this decision will be circulated to the Board shortly. The analysis in this
staff report is in anticipation of the new policy.

- 24 -

•

The authorities remain committed to maintaining a close dialogue with Fund
staff. In addition to the annual Article IV consultation discussions, staff will field a
visit to prepare an assessment of the economy to be presented at the Pakistan
Development Forum, which will also be issued to the Executive Board. The added
benefits of PPM in providing an update to the Executive Board in between Article IV
consultations and in providing a signal to donors would be limited.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

45.
Pakistan’s economic performance and prospects are now more favorable than at
any time in the past decade. The economy has recovered strongly from the crisis of the late
1990s. Tighter macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have resulted in a stronger
external position, a lower public debt burden, renewed access to international capital
markets, and a revival in growth, albeit accompanied lately by some increase in inflation.
External support has played a part in Pakistan’s recovery, but the increase in national saving
in response to effective and strongly owned government policies has been the key. The
recovery has been remarkably resilient to regional and domestic political turmoil.
46.
Pakistan’s strong recent macroeconomic performance should continue in the
short term. Broad-based growth of over 6 percent is likely to be maintained in 2004/05. The
main risks relate to water availability, which could affect the agricultural and energy sectors.
Because of strong domestic demand, the external current account is projected to shift to a
small deficit in 2004/05 and foreign exchange reserves are not projected to increase
significantly. Monetary policy should continue to be tightened, but more forcefully. The
fiscal policy stance in 2004/05 is appropriate, ensuring both a reduction in the public debt
burden and an increase in social and development spending, though high oil prices represent
an important risk to the budget.
47.
While the immediate outlook is good, Pakistan faces major economic and social
challenges in the medium term. Poverty is relatively high and social indicators are weak,
with little evidence of a strong improving trend recently. Per capita social spending is low
and the public debt burden, though reduced, is high. The infrastructure is weak in many
areas. There is still some way to go toward creating a modern institutional structure and
improving governance.
48.
The government has targeted economic growth to continue accelerating and
reach 8 percent per annum in 4–5 years. This is an ambitious but appropriate target in
light of the need to reduce poverty. The removal of quotas on textile and clothes imports by
industrial countries and South Asian trade integration could both boost growth, if Pakistan
continues to advance structural reforms. In particular, the increase in investment and
productivity needed to achieve and sustain 8 percent growth will require a favorable external
environment and a further improvement in the investment climate and governance, including
through continuing privatization and trade liberalization. The development of infrastructure,

- 25 -

especially irrigation systems to accelerate productivity growth in agriculture, will also be
important.
49.
While focusing on growth, macroeconomic stability should not be taken for
granted. There is some risk that fiscal and monetary policies could be relaxed to support
growth, as is already the case with monetary policy to some extent. Strong popular pressures
for lower energy prices and public sector wage increases are also evident. Against these
pressures, the authorities need to protect the strong external position and macroeconomic
stability, which are preconditions for strong growth.
50.
The staff supports Pakistan’s medium-term fiscal strategy. With a gradual
increase in tax revenues, the government should be able to increase per capita social and
development spending, while further reducing the debt burden in terms of GDP. To tackle
poverty over the medium term, the government will need to provide for at least the increase
in social spending envisaged in the PRSP, while strengthening local institutions. The fiscal
strategy also involves a substantial reduction in energy subsidies, which should be possible
with the completion of power sector reforms, assuming pressures to reduce tariffs are
avoided. The targeted 1 percentage point of GDP increase in the revenue ratio between
2003/04 and 2007/08 should be seen as a minimum in view of the need to increase social and
development spending. The fiscal reform strategy should be reinforced by the early approval
of the fiscal responsibility law.
51.
Revenue mobilization needs to be strengthened. Despite the recent reforms, the tax
effort remains modest in Pakistan. The administrative reforms envisaged by the CBR,
especially moving toward a functional organizational structure, should help to enhance tax
efficiency, as well as improving the tax climate and governance. However, expanding
taxation gradually into the agricultural and service sectors would bring greater yields, as
would efforts to reduce evasion.
52.
Devolution of key social functions to local governments has major implications
for fiscal management. These reforms have the potential of substantially improving service
delivery, but local governments need to receive full administrative authority. Expeditious
agreement on a new National Finance Commission award could help to facilitate financial
management at the regional and local level.
53.
Financial reforms have resulted in a more efficient and resilient financial system.
The authorities should continue their reform strategy and follow up on FSSA
recommendations. In particular, strengthening of the pension and insurance systems should be
pursued and the authorities should consider divestment of remaining public ownership of
commercial banks. There is also a need to broaden access to financial services to underserved
segments of the population. The SBP, which has made considerable strides in strengthening
its supervision capacity, needs to ensure that rapid private credit growth does not weaken
banks’ balance sheets.

- 26 -

54.
Based on current policies, prospects for achieving external debt sustainability
are good. Key indicators of external indebtedness are projected to decline significantly in the
next several years. Nevertheless, Pakistan remains vulnerable, with still a substantial external
debt burden and some dependence on external nontax revenues and grants. This reinforces
the need to implement the fiscal strategy effectively, while maintaining cautious monetary
and flexible exchange rate policies. Accessing of international capital markets should be
consistent with an overall borrowing strategy geared inter alia toward reducing interest and
exchange rate vulnerabilities.
55.
The authorities’ exchange rate policy has served the country well. It has
contributed to the recovery of confidence in the Pakistani rupee, strong export growth, and
high foreign exchange reserves. The level of the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate,
but external competitiveness needs to be monitored closely in view of the uncertainties
facing Pakistan.
56.
Pakistan maintains an exchange restriction on payments for current
international transactions that should be lifted. Under this restriction, advance payments
for certain imports are limited to 50 percent (see Appendix I). Staff only learned that this
restriction is subject to Fund approval in the context of a temporary intensification (see
below). Staff is discussing with the authorities options to remove this restriction which seems
unnecessary in light of the strong external position, but is not proposing approval at this
stage given that the authorities have not committed to a timetable for lifting the restriction.
57.
Pakistan is nearing the successful completion of its arrangement under the
PRGF. The program is broadly on track. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June
2004 were met. However, four structural performance criteria were breached. Nevertheless,
after some delay, an electricity subsidy policy has been announced. Staff concurs with the
government’s decision not to notify the recent tariff determination which would have led to
increased subsidies to the power utilities. However, the government needs to work closely
with the regulator to ensure that a revised tariff determination based on the cost recovery
principle is issued soon. In addition, while five new tax exemptions were granted, offsetting
measures have been taken and the revenue target for 2004/05 (July–June) has been raised by
0.2 percent of GDP. Moreover, the exchange restrictions were reversed within a few days of
implementation. In light of these corrective actions, the staff recommends approval of the
requested waivers and the completion of the ninth review.
58.
In light of Pakistan’s progress toward external viability, management
recommends that Pakistan should not be subject to PPM. Outstanding combined
PRGF/GRA resources at end-December 2004 will not be substantially above 100 percent of
quota given that Pakistan will not draw the final tranche under the PRGF arrangement.
Moreover, the external position has strengthened considerably in recent years and the
outlook is quite favorable, some recent pressures notwithstanding. Also, the authorities are
committed to keeping a close dialogue with the Fund on developments and policies.

- 27 -

59.
Pakistan’s statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring
purposes, but further improvements are needed in the monetary, fiscal, and especially the
social areas.
60.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Pakistan be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

A. Nonfinancial Relations
VII.

Exchange System

Prior to mid-1998, Pakistan implemented a fixed exchange rate system with periodic step
devaluation to compensate for the inflation differential with major trading partners. On
July 21, 1998, a dual exchange system was introduced consisting of a fixed official exchange
rate at PRs 46 per $1 and a floating interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). Under this
system, all authorized transactions were effectively conducted at the so-called “composite
rate” which was the weighted average of the FIBR and the official exchange rate. On
May 19, 1999, the official exchange rate was eliminated and the exchange rate system
unified, with all international transactions conducted at the FIBR. As of July 15, 2004, the
FIBR was PRs 58.15 per $1. Pakistan’s exchange regime is classified as managed floating
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Pakistan maintains a minor exchange
restriction on payments for current international transactions subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, Section 2a, resulting from limitations on advance payments for certain imports.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Islamabad in August 2002. The
staff report (IMF Country Report No. 02/246) was discussed by the Executive Board on
November 1, 2002.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

In accordance with the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) was subject to a full safeguards assessment under the Stand-By Arrangement that
expired on September 30, 2001. This assessment, which included a safeguards mission to the
SBP, was completed on February 13, 2001. The staff’s findings and recommendations were
reported in IMF Country Report No. 01/58, Appendix IV. The authorities have implemented
all of the recommended remedial measures that were included under SBA conditionality, and
no new critical vulnerabilities have been identified under Pakistan’s current PRGF
arrangement, which was approved on December 6, 2001 and is scheduled to expire on
December 5, 2004.

Partnership in Pakistan’s development strategy
1.
The government of Pakistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PSRP) for 2002/03
to 2007/08,1 completed in December 2003, constitutes a broad-based strategy for addressing
poverty, including human development, governance, and vulnerability, and builds on the
economic program first articulated in the fall of 1999 and further elaborated in the I-PRSP of
2001. The Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), discussed by the Board of the Fund on
March 8, 2004 and the Board of the World Bank on March 11, 2004, endorsed the PRSP and
indicated it provides a good policy framework for the implementation of a reform program
which can accelerate progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
2.
The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue with Pakistan on macroeconomic
policies including overall fiscal and monetary policy. In addition to macroeconomic targets,
the Fund has established structural performance criteria relating to reforms in the areas of tax
policy and administration, power sector reform, and public expenditure management. As
outlined more fully below, the World Bank has complemented the Fund’s work through
support to structural reforms in the social sectors and support of the growth agenda through
deregulation of key sectors, such as power, oil and gas, and banking reforms whose
performance have a strong bearing on growth and public finances.
World Bank Group Strategy
3.
The objective of the World Bank Group’s assistance strategy is to help Pakistan
reduce poverty through support of the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The World
Bank Group’s program priorities are focused on the reforms to (a) strengthen
macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (b) improve the business
environment for growth; and (c) improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender
equity policies. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the World Bank’s
Board of Executive Directors on June 11, 2002. A CAS Progress Report, which was
presented to the Board on April 20, 2004, confirms that the strategy set out in the 2002 CAS
remains valid in light of the full PRSP.
4.
The World Bank works closely with the Fund and the government on structural
reforms underpinning macroeconomic stability. In this context, the World Bank’s lending
program has featured structural adjustment lending to support the government’s actions in
the areas of improving public expenditure management and supporting reforms of tax
administration, safe and sound banking, efficient public utilities, and structural fiscal and

governance reforms. The World Bank has also approved structural adjustment credits for two
provinces (Sindh and North West Frontier Province (NWFP)) supporting provincial reform
strategies to improve resource management and strengthen provision of public services by
local governments and communities. Further structural adjustment lending is planned,
including follow-on provincial adjustment credits and a Poverty Reduction Support Credit.
5.
The World Bank Group’s support to strengthening the investment climate includes a
combination of analytical work and financial assistance targeted to reforms in key sectors.
The World Bank Group continues to perform analytical work to support the ongoing
liberalization and modernization of trade, industrial, business, and labor regulations.
6.
In the social sectors, the World Bank Group’s assistance is geared toward support to
the implementation of the Education Sector Reform (ESR) Strategy and the government’s
priority of strengthening public health programs and maternal and child health and family
planning. Accordingly, the World Bank is focusing on: (a) programmatic support to the
National Education Sector Reform Strategy; (b) support to the National Education
Assessment System; (c) a program of analytical work to underpin the policy dialogue during
the implementation of the ESR; and (d) province-based support to implementing the ESR
within the fiscal and economic reforms of Sindh, NWFP, and an Education Sector
Adjustment Credit for Punjab. In FY 2003, World Bank Group assistance to health sector
reforms also included the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project and Partnership for Polio
Eradication Project.
7.
Supporting the rural sector through community-based infrastructure projects
(particularly for water supply and sanitation services) and the increased availability of
micro-credit have been part of the World Bank Group’s strategy to reduce and mitigate risks
for Pakistan’s poor. The World Bank will continue to pilot new approaches, and also help
scale up those which have proven effective such as the Community Infrastructure and
Services Project (CIP) and the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF). Follow-on PPAF
and CIP projects were approved in FY 2004.
8.
IBRD and IDA have approved 85 loans and 122 credits to Pakistan since 1952,
totaling $7,025.3 million and $7,891.9 million, respectively. Since 1999, Bank lending has
totaled $2,992.8 million (see Table 1), with $800 million approved in fiscal year 2002,
$297.2 million in 2003, and $781.2 million in 2004. As of September 30, 2004, there were
170 outstanding IBRD and IDA loans and credits representing a total obligation of 8,465.1
million. The World Bank active portfolio in Pakistan consisted of 18 lending operations with
a total commitment of $1,450 million of which $898 million is undisbursed.

Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
9.
As part of its overall assistance to Pakistan—through lending, country analytic work,
and technical assistance—the World Bank supports policy reforms in the following areas in
collaboration with the Fund:
a.
Financial sector reforms. A major achievement of the reform process has been the
transformation of a predominantly state-owned and weak banking system into a healthier,
market-based system, owned primarily by the private sector. This has been supported by
considerable strengthening of the legal and regulatory environment, and significant
improvements in transparency, corporate governance, and credit culture. World Bank support
is being provided through implementation of two ongoing projects: the Banking Sector
Restructuring and Privatization Project and the Banking Sector Technical Assistance. A
Banking Sector Adjustment Credit is planned in FY 2005. A joint World Bank/Fund
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in FY 2004.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

b.
Power sector reforms. The Fund PRGF arrangement includes conditionality related
to energy tariff adjustments and other power sector reforms with the aim of reducing the
sector’s fiscal burden. In the context of the structural adjustment operations approved in
FY 2001 and FY 2002, the World Bank has continued to take the lead in working with the
government of Pakistan to unbundle and corporatize the state-owned Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) with the eventual aim for privatizing the generation and
distribution of electricity. The World Bank is currently working with the government on the
finalization of a comprehensive medium-term adjustment program to improve the electric
services to Pakistan's industry and households at lower cost and higher reliability.
c.
Public expenditure management. Under a policy framework agreed with the
government and the Fund, the World Bank is taking the lead in supporting implementation of
the reform program while the Fund is providing related technical assistance. World Bank
support is being provided in the context of the ongoing Pakistan Improvement of Financial
Reporting and Accounting (PIFRA) project through which the national accounting and audit
systems are being modernized. A follow-on PIFRA II project will further these efforts.
Analytical and diagnostic support is being provided in the form of a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment, which was completed in FY 2003, as well as provincial financial
accountability assessments, as appropriate. Policy measures relating to financial management
have been included as prior actions for World Bank structural adjustment lending at both the
national and provincial level.
d.
Tax policy and administration reforms. The Fund has taken the lead in supporting
tax policy reforms, providing technical assistance leading, inter alia, to the formulation of an
income tax reform package which became effective July 1, 2002. In consultation with the
Fund and the World Bank, Pakistan has also launched a program for the fundamental
restructuring of the Central Board of Revenues (CBR) in order to improve the efficiency of
tax administration. The CBR reform effort is being supported by both the World Bank and
the Fund. The structural performance criteria of the PRGF include adoption of tax policy
changes and implementation of CBR reform. A planned World Bank tax administration
reform project will support CBR reforms and is expected to be approved in FY 2005.

APPENDIX III

PAKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The staff believes that data reporting and accounting procedures are broadly adequate
for effective surveillance and program monitoring purposes. The authorities are responsive to
data requests and report to the Fund, on a routine and timely basis, monthly data on external
trade, prices, federal government expenditures and tax revenues, government bank borrowing,
and money. Moreover, the authorities provide daily data through the resident representative’s
office on international reserves, exchange rates, and the Karachi Stock Exchange index.
2.
The Pakistani authorities are strongly committed to adhering to internationally
accepted standards and good practices, as demonstrated by their participation in 2003 in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Pakistan meets the recommendations for the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of most GDDS data categories. The only exceptions are
the timeliness of the GDP and the lack of annual data on wages/earnings. For subscription to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), Pakistan will need to disseminate
(a) biweekly data on the analytical accounts of the SBP; (b) monthly transaction data on
central government operations; (c) quarterly data on the GDP, employment, unemployment,
and wages/earnings; (d) more detailed breakdown of data on central government debt;
(e) annual data on its international investment position; and (f) update and expand the
metadata on compilation and dissemination practices.
3.
The Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) recently completed a revision of the national
accounts, to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). As part of this exercise, the base year was moved from
1980/81 to 1999/2000. There remains room for further improvement. Notably, informal
economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging activities, such as in
the information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. Some of these gaps will be
identified when the results of the 1999/2000 Economic Census become available in 2004/05.
The FBS intends to carry out another rebasing for 2004/05. Meanwhile, the FBS is also
preparing the compilation of quarterly GDP data. With respect to labor market statistics, the
FBS is investigating the feasibility of compiling quarterly employment/unemployment data
and of disseminating data on wages/salaries.
4.
The FBS produces three price indices: the consumer price index (CPI), wholesale
price index (WPI), and the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on
a monthly basis. The SPI is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential
commodities that are consumed by the lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of
the CPI and WPI follow international guidelines. For prices, plans are to introduce
classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) and complete work on
development of a Producer Price Index (PPI), with base year 1999/2000.
5.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) suffered from a lack of information on
economic and functional classification of government outlays; and inadequate reporting by
provinces on their fiscal operations. The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS are
broadly based on the methodology prescribed in A Manual on Government Finance

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

Statistics, 1986 (GFSM 1986), except that the treatment of privatization proceeds resembles
the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). There
are no specific plans to migrate to the GFSM 2001 standard. The scope of GFS is budgetary
general government, which covers the bulk of general government activity, but does not
cover the activity of extra-budgetary units in central government. Classification and
sectorization systems only follow GFSM 1986 standards to a limited extent. Institutional
sectors are not explicitly defined, since only budgetary data are covered in GFS. Central and
provincial governments are distinguished, but local governments are included with the
provincial governments. The classification of expenditure departs substantially from GFSM
1986 methodology, both because the economic and functional classifications are not clearly
distinguished, and because the level of detail falls far short of what is required. The basis of
recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis, as required by the GFSM 1986 standard.
Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made
in the original period, as required by GFSM 1986. Plans for improvement of GFS are taking
place within the context of the Project for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and
Auditing (PIFRA). In the longer term, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs intends
to adopt the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001).
6.
The analytical framework for monetary statistics reflects concepts and definitions that
are based on the IMF’s Guide to Money and Banking Statistics in International Finance
Statistics of December 1984. The scope of the monetary statistics is comprehensive. The
classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by SBP’s Statistics
Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are broadly in line with the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for recording flows and stocks
is largely consistent with MFSM and the SBP will continue to adopt the MFSM in order to
further improve monetary statistics. In particular, the SBP plans to (a) disaggregate data on
nonfinancial corporations and households within the private sector; (b) collect data on
nonbank financial institutions to expand the coverage of the monetary aggregates; and
(c) disseminate the analytical accounts of the SBP within two weeks after the end of the
reference month.
7.
Pakistan’s balance of payments statistics are compiled broadly in accordance with the
concepts and definitions of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5).
However, the presentation of the balance of payments on the web and in the publications of
the SBP is still based on the BPM4. In general, the scope of the balance of payments
pertaining to residency conforms to BPM5. The exceptions include the enterprises operating
in the export processing zones and offshore banks, which are regarded as nonresidents, and
Pakistani nationals residing abroad but owning a dwelling in Pakistan, who are considered
residents. Classification and sectorization systems also follow BPM5 to some extent, while
the basis for recording transactions follows best international practices. Regarding the
external sector, the SBP plans to (a) continue the implementation of the BPM5; (b) initiate
plans to compile and publish data on the international investment position; and
(c) disseminate the metadata for the template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity on the SBP website.

ANNEX I

PAKISTAN
MEDIUM-TERM SCENARIOS
1.
Pakistan has undergone substantial adjustment in recent years, improving
economic performance and reducing vulnerabilities. A combination of a pickup in
economic growth, large primary surpluses, debt restructuring (through the Paris Club
rescheduling in 2001, additional bilateral debt cancellation, and recent prepayments of high
interest debts), declining domestic interest rates, and a number of structural reforms have
contributed to the favorable outcome.
2.
Looking ahead, the authorities are pursuing an ambitious reform agenda aimed
at accelerating economic growth. This annex examines some macroeconomic scenarios and
their implications for the sustainability of public and external debt.
Baseline Medium-Growth Scenario
3.
The baseline scenario assumes that the economy largely maintains its current
momentum in the medium term (Table 1). Economic growth slows only marginally to
6 percent per annum from 2004/05, driven by robust exports growth and consumption driven
domestic demand, with a modest increase in the investment ratio. The current account
(excluding grants) remains in a small deficit (nearly 1 percent of GDP), and external grants
continue at around ½ percent of GDP. Reserves remain at about 5½ months of imports
(Table 2).
4.
The government is assumed to support growth by prudent fiscal management.
The fiscal space created by generating modestly higher revenues, interest savings, and lower
subsidies is used to substantially increase expenditure on social and development sectors.
Thus, the overall deficit (excluding grants) is lowered to about 3 percent of GDP by 2008/09.
The reduced borrowing need and a favorable growth-interest differential lower the stock of
debt to around 53 percent of GDP by 2008/09.17
Alternative High-Growth Scenario
5.
Under the ambitious high-growth scenario envisaged by the Pakistani government,
growth accelerates, owing to a combination of structural reform and further improvements in
external and domestic factors. South Asian trade integration and more liberal trade in
clothing and textiles could provide strong growth impulses if external competitiveness
continues to improve. Substantially higher public and private investment complement strong
17

Due to the rebasing of GDP, most of the ratios presented in this analysis now appear significantly lower than
projected in the previous staff report (IMF Country Report No. 04/211), which had been based on the old
national accounts data. The estimated nominal rebased GDP is about 20 percent higher than previously reported.

- 57 -

ANNEX I

consumption demand and exports. As a result, real GDP growth picks up to 8 percent per
annum by 2007/08. Accelerated privatization of public enterprises and an overall
improvement in the business climate buoys foreign direct investment (FDI). Strong import
demand is generated by the strengthening economy, resulting in a larger current account
deficit than in the baseline (reaching 2½ percent of GDP in 2008/09). In addition to FDI,
increased official external borrowing closes the financing gap (Table 3).
6.
Successful implementation of tax reforms and increased momentum in the
economy benefit the fiscal sector. Revenues display greater buoyancy, rising by nearly
1½ percent of GDP between 2004/05 and 2008/09.18 The improved revenue performance
allows the authorities to devote additional resources to social and development spending,
which rise by more than 1½ percent of GDP, while still allowing the fiscal deficit to continue
to decline in line with the baseline projections. Although external borrowing is higher than in
the baseline, total public debt falls as a share of the higher GDP.
Alternative Low-Growth Scenario
7.
Under an alternative low-growth scenario, keeping key variables at their historical
levels over the last 10 years, GDP growth would fall back to 3.5 percent. Such performance
would mirror situations of major economic and political problems, similar to those that were
underlying causes for the subdued growth rates during the 1990s (in the 15 years before
1990, growth averaged 6 percent). In spite of the much slower growth, public and external
debt ratios would decline moderately, although more slowly than in the previous scenarios.
Sensitivity Analysis of Debt Sustainability
8.
Public debt declines substantially in all three scenarios, contingent upon a positive
growth-interest differential and continued primary surplus of about ½ percent of GDP. Under
both the baseline and alternative scenarios, gross public debt declines to around 50 percent of
GDP by 2008/09, compared to the peak of 89 percent in 2000/01 (Tables 4 and 5, Figure 1).
By contrast, the low-growth scenario would imply a slower decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio
to 60 percent in 2008/09.
9.
Bound tests indicate that the public debt path would remain on a downward trend,
even if a number of downside risks were to materialize. A lower primary balance, lower
growth, and a sharp exchange rate depreciation would affect the debt path, but the key ratios
would continue to decline over the forecast horizon.

18

World Bank and Fund staff agree that there is additional upside potential to the revenue outlook. Indeed, an
ambitious administrative reform project of the CBR will commence in 2005 with World Bank support.
Successful implementation of the project and acceleration of GDP growth could well lead to revenue ratios
higher than envisaged in the alternative scenario.

- 58 -

ANNEX I

10.
Despite the improvement to the outlook, a number of vulnerabilities remain. The
ratio of the net present value of external debt to exports (as well as revenues), while falling,
remains in a range that signals exposure to risks (Tables 6 and 7, Figure 2). Under the
baseline, the ratio of the net present value of public and publicly guaranteed external debt to
exports is projected to decline from 172 percent in 2003/04 to 128 percent by 2008/09. Under
the scenario assuming key variables at their historical averages, this ratio would decline only
marginally, to 164 percent in 2008/09. Similarly, the bound tests point to continued
vulnerabilities: while the majority of tests point to a continued reduction of the debt to
exports ratio, under two tests the ratio would exceed 200 percent in 2005/06 before declining
somewhat over the medium term.

ATTACHMENT I

November 12, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
While Pakistan exits from its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement,
the government remains committed to the economic strategy outlined in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which aims to create an enabling environment for
sustained high growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.
We held discussions with Fund staff in August/September 2004 for the ninth review under
the PRGF arrangement. The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) reviews economic developments and policy implementation through August 2004,
and discusses our policies for 2004/05 and beyond. It supplements the MEFP dated
November 22, 2001, as well as the supplementary MEFPs dated March 12, 2002, June 18,
2002, October 16, 2002, February 8, 2003, May 29, 2003, October 11, 2003, and
June 7, 2004.
All quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2004 were met. Moreover, most structural
performance criteria were met, except for: (i) the introduction or extension of tax
exemptions; (ii) the announcement of a tariff and subsidy policy for regional electricity tariff
setting; (iii) the publication of financial recovery plans for the successor companies of the
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA); and (iv) the performance criterion on
not imposing or intensifying restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The tax exemptions are intended to strengthen our business climate, and the
minor negative revenue impact has been more than offset by revenue raising measures taken
in the budget. The tariff and subsidy policy was announced in early November. However, the
financial recovery plans are further delayed because the regulator has yet to determine tariffs
consistent with the cost recovery principle. We temporarily intensified an existing, and
imposed one new restriction on advance payments of certain imports, but upon learning that
this constituted a breach of a performance criterion, we have taken remedial measures to
reinstate the status quo ante.

- 69 -

ATTACHMENT I

In light of our improved external situation, which is much better than projected, and despite
the temporary pressures in the foreign exchange market, we have decided not to draw the
tenth and final tranche under the PRGF so that these resources would become available for
other countries in need of concessional support from the Fund.
On this basis, and in view of the policies set out in the attached MEFP, the government
requests waivers for the nonobservance of the structural performance criteria listed above,
and the completion of the ninth review.
We look forward to our continued cooperation with the Fund, in the context of its normal
consultation with member countries on their economic developments and policies. In this
regard, the government will, of course, continue to provide the Fund with such information
as the Fund may request in connection with Pakistan’s progress in implementing its
economic and financial policies.
Sincerely yours,

Advisor to the Prime Minister on Finance

PAKISTAN
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Pakistan’s three-year arrangement under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) will come to an end in December 2004. With this, we will also bring to a
close a long period of financial support from the IMF. Instead, in the period ahead, Pakistan
will primarily rely on domestic and international markets to meet its financing needs,
complemented by continued support from official creditors including the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank. Indeed, we have already made a successful re-entry in the
international capital markets earlier this year.
2.
The end of IMF-supported programs, however, will not result in a shift in our
economic policies. On the contrary, the prudent fiscal and monetary policies, combined with
broad-based structural reforms, implemented in the past few years have served Pakistan well.
The country has made an impressive recovery from macroeconomic crisis to stability and a
resumption of economic growth. Fiscal and external vulnerabilities have been reduced,
through a reduction in fiscal imbalances and supported by debt relief and other assistance
provided by the international community.
3.
The task ahead is to maintain stability and further accelerate economic growth.
Strong growth will remain crucial for creating new employment opportunities and reducing
poverty. Thus, we will need to continue on the path set out in our Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) “Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty.” We will continue to
implement sound financial policies and will further advance our reform agenda to create a
vibrant market-based economy. In addition, our policies will also continue to aim to reduce
poverty through greater social inclusion, including through human development and
devolution of political and economic power.
4.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies reviews macroeconomic
performance and the implementation of structural measures in 2003/04 and sets out our
economic policies for the remainder of 2004/05. It provides an update on our policy
objectives and prospects for the current fiscal year, as well as on the actions we have already
taken or will take to help achieve these objectives.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The economy continues to gather steam. Real GDP growth accelerated to
6.4 percent in 2003/04, exceeding our target of 5.3 percent by a wide margin, and up from
5.1 percent in the preceding year. Growth has been strong across most sectors, but has been
most pronounced in the large-scale manufacturing sector. Moreover, growth is broadening
from predominantly export-led to being domestic demand-driven as well. Exports and

- 71 -

ATTACHMENT I

imports grew by 13.8 percent and 20.1 percent, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms. In
U.S. dollar terms, per capita GDP has increased from $500 in 2001/02 to $638 in 2003/04.
6.
Inflation has picked up, however. Annual average inflation in 2003/04 was
4.6 percent, marginally exceeding our 4.1 percent target. The pickup in inflation is more
visible in the twelve-month rate of inflation, which has increased from 1.9 percent in June
2003 to 9.0 percent in September 2004. To some extent, this increase in inflation reflects
special factors, notably the sharp increase in wheat prices during 2003/04 that resulted from
an unanticipated shortage in the supply of wheat, as well as an increase in the support price
of wheat. Similarly, the rise in international oil prices contributed to inflation, although the
full effect of this has not been passed on to consumer prices. Strong demand and a rapid
expansion of credit also contributed to inflation. Notably, house rents, which have a
relatively large share in the consumer price index, have increased significantly.
7.
The 2003/04 overall budget deficit remained well within its limits. The
consolidated government deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at PRs 129 billion
(2.4 percent of GDP), considerably less than the budget target of PRs 179 billion (3.3 percent
of GDP). As a result, the ratio of public debt to GDP fell to under 70 percent, down from its
peak of 89 percent in 2000/01. Revenue collection by the Central Board of Revenue (CBR)
exceeded the target by a solid margin, reaching PRs 519 billion or 9.5 percent of GDP.
Revenue performance benefited from the higher-than-expected rate of economic growth, but
also reflected the impact of our ongoing efforts to strengthen revenue administration. Socialand poverty-related expenditures, as well as development expenditures exceeded budget
projections, which is a welcome break with past trends of underutilizing resources and attests
to improved implementation capacity.
8.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has started to tighten monetary policy, slowly
but steadily, in response to rising inflation and continued strong money growth. Shortterm interest rates (six-month treasury bills) have been increased by 2.07 percentage points
since the start of 2004 to 3.73 percent in November. Broad money grew by 19.6 percent in
2003/04, while reserve money grew by 15.4 percent. Credit to the private sector continued to
grow rapidly, at almost 30 percent, reflecting the buoyant economy, low interest rates, and
ample liquidity in banks.
9.
All quantitative performance criteria under the PRGF arrangement set for
end-June 2004 were met (Table 1a). Similarly, all but two of the indicative targets for
end-March and end-June were also met. Exceptions were the end-March target for socialand poverty-related spending—which was missed by a small margin—and the end-March
ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconsessional medium- and long-term debt.
The latter ceiling was breached due to a government guarantee on a larger-than-anticipated
loan contracted by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). Given PIA’s improved
performance, the IMF’s Executive Board augmented the end-June ceiling during the
completion of the eighth review under our PRGF arrangement to accommodate this
guarantee. The shortfall in social- and poverty-related spending was more than made up by
end-June.

Further progress was made in implementing structural reform measures,
although some slippages and delays occurred (Table 2). In the area of tax policy, the
2004/05 budget removed income and sales tax exemptions and incorporated other basebroadening measures that together will yield a total of PRs 5 billion. However, some new
exemptions were introduced with the 2004/05 budget, including exemptions for: (i) income
tax on vocational and technical institutions; (ii) import duties on all agricultural machinery;
(iii) import duties on raw materials for pesticides; and (iv) import duties on commercial
aircraft and engines. In addition, the exemption for capital gains tax was extended. These
exemptions aim to remove anomalies and discriminatory practices in the tax system, as well
as promote investment. The revenue impact of these measures is estimated to be small: less
than 0.1 percent of GDP and, in any event, revenues in 2004/05 are projected to be
substantially higher than projected earlier under the program.
11.
Revenue administration was strengthened further as: (i) a pilot customs office has
been opened in the port of Karachi that will allow much faster processing and clearance;
(ii) two additional medium-taxpayers units (MTU), organized along functional lines, have
been opened; and (iii) a new large-taxpayers unit (LTU) has become operational in Lahore.
12.
In the energy sector, the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and
the Karachi Electric Supply Company (KESC) met their financial targets for 2003/04.
WAPDA benefited from a greater availability of hydro energy, while both WAPDA and
KESC realized higher production and sales volumes. The Ministry of Water and Power
issued the broad principles for the determination of regional electricity tariffs in June 2004.
These principles clarified the respective roles of the government, National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), and the power companies in the setting of tariffs. Following
this, NEPRA completed the process of determining the structural tariffs for the individual
distribution companies succeeding WAPDA. Subsequently, eight distribution companies
filed review motions with NEPRA because the tariff determinations were below cost
recovery. NEPRA’s revised determination issued in late October also fell short of the cost
recovery principle. The determination would have implied much higher-than-budgeted
government subsidies to the utilities and would have put our fiscal targets at risk. Therefore,
the government rejected the revised determination and has asked NEPRA to review its
decision again. The government’s electricity subsidy policy was announced in November and
aims to ensure that distribution companies achieve cost recovery while protecting consumers
from very high tariffs that are not viable on social and economic grounds. The policy also
sets a timetable for phasing out electricity subsidies by 2010.
13.
With the structural tariffs under review, the Financial Recovery Plans (FRPs) for the
distribution companies could not be finalized by end-July as planned. Instead, the companies
presented financial scenarios based both on the initially determined tariffs, as well as on the
tariffs aimed for in their review motions. We are confident that this will prove to have been a
useful exercise that aided the distribution companies in the review process and will allow
them to quickly finalize their FRPs once NEPRA had determined new tariffs.

In the area of financial sector reform, following the sale of Habib Bank Limited
(HBL) earlier this year, in August, Allied Bank Limited (ABL) was transferred into private
ownership through the sale of additional shares. With this, our agenda for the restructuring
and privatization of the banking sector has been almost completed, leaving only the
Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) to be divested. National Savings Schemes
(NSS) rates were adjusted on July 1, 2004, based on the new formula, to better align them
with yields on Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). To help combat money laundering, we
have issued several regulations that require inter alia reporting of suspicious transactions and
set out minimum record keeping standards to ensure compliance with Financial Task Force
recommendations. Discussions among all stakeholders continue on the drafting of the
Benami law and we expect to submit a first draft to the Cabinet in 2005.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2004/05
A. Macroeconomic Framework
15.
Economic growth in 2004/05 is forecast to reach about 6.5 percent, building on
the current momentum and provided that weather conditions remain favorable. Over the
medium term, we are aiming to further accelerate the pace of economic growth and reach
8 percent annually. This will require the steadfast implementation of sound financial policies
and structural reforms to promote investment, as discussed in our PRSP. Moreover, to
achieve such a high rate of economic growth, it will be crucial to substantially increase
productivity in the agricultural sector, which accounts for almost one quarter of Pakistan’s
output. Thus, in our policies we are placing particular emphasis on this sector, with
improving the availability of water as one of our key objectives. Furthermore, to achieve and
sustain such high economic growth, we will require strong physical infrastructure, for which
we are allocating a large sum in the federal budget.
16.
Given recent trends in inflation, annual average inflation in 2004/05 is expected
to exceed the 5 percent target. By further tightening monetary policy, together with
measures to regularize conditions in the wheat market, we aim to reduce the twelve-month
rate of inflation to 4–5 percent by June 2005, but due to the carry over of price increases in
2003/04, this implies an annual average rate of inflation for 2004/05 of about 7 percent.
B. Fiscal Policy
17.
The budget for 2004/05 adopted in June balances the need for increased social
and development spending and a further reduction of the debt burden. The 2004/05
budget limits the consolidated government overall deficit (excluding grants) to
PRs 199 billion (equivalent to 3.2 percent of GDP). Social- and poverty-related expenditures
are budgeted to reach PRs 278 billion (4.5 percent of GDP, compared to 3.8 percent of GDP
in the previous year), while the Public Sector Development Program was raised to
PRs 188 billion (3.0 percent of GDP).

- 74 -

ATTACHMENT I

18.
A few measures were taken in the context of the budget that will need to be
accommodated within the overall envelope. This includes an increase in government
wages and pensions by 15 percent—estimated to cost PRs 16 billion—and the further
reduction in petroleum development levies to insulate domestic petroleum prices from the
recent increase in international oil prices. Assuming that international oil prices will
gradually decline in line with the IMF’s World Economic Outlook projections, this measure
is estimated to result in a revenue loss of some PRs 30 billion. Offsetting these measures will
be a higher-than-budgeted collection of revenues by the CBR (PRs 10 billion), due to a
higher base in 2003/04 and a slightly higher nominal income growth this year; lower-thanbudgeted subsidies (PRs 6 billion); and higher-than-budgeted nontax revenues
(PRs 30 billion). The latter stems from higher-than-anticipated dividends from public
enterprises and other receipts. Once the current spike in oil prices has passed, we will return
petroleum development levies to the levels prevailing at the beginning of 2004 and will
resume the fortnightly adjustment of domestic petroleum prices in line with import costs.
19.
The 2004/05 budget and current nominal growth projections imply a further
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to about 64 percent. This is in line with the
path set out in the PRSP and the draft Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). The draft FRL has
already been approved by the Standing Committee on Finance of the National Assembly and
we expect parliamentary approval later this year.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
20.
Monetary policy will be tightened further to help contain inflationary pressures.
As noted above, our goal is to reduce twelve-month inflation to about 5 percent by the end of
2004/05. An increased supply of wheat will help contain further increases in food prices, but
considerable uncertainty remains about the development of oil prices. Moreover, interest
rates in international markets have begun to edge upwards and they are expected to continue
to rise in the months ahead. Thus, to avoid undue pressure on the exchange rate of the
Pakistani rupee, interest rates in Pakistan will have to rise as well. But in determining the
appropriate pace of raising interest rates, the SBP will maintain a balance between stemming
inflationary pressures, preventing an undue weakening of the exchange rate, and continuing
to support economic growth.
21.
Taking into account the lags with which monetary policy affects inflation, the
SBP has already acted to raise interest rates since August 2003. The SBP has raised
interest rates more significantly since mid-2004, reducing the gap between twelve-month
inflation and short-term interest rates (six-month treasury bills) from almost 7 percent in July
to 6 percent in September. Short-term interest rates have been increased by 1.4 percentage
points so far since mid-2004, compared to 0.4 percent in the first half of 2004. Monetary
expansion is targeted to be in line with nominal income growth. Interest rates can be expected
to increase further in the remainder of 2004/05 and the SBP stands ready to tighten further
should inflationary pressures not abate. Meanwhile, SBP operations in the foreign exchange
market will be limited to smooth short-term fluctuations, and the SBP will make every

- 75 -

ATTACHMENT I

attempt to maintain external competitiveness. While the SPB remains committed to a liberal
foreign exchange regime, on November 1, 2004, we introduced some new measures in respect
of advance payments for imports. These measures were primarily intended to remove certain
anomalies and to forestall misuse of some of the facilities by certain market participants.
However, upon realizing that parts of our new measures could constitute an intensification of
and a new restriction, and thus a breach of a performance criterion, we immediately amended
the respective new measures on November 10, 2004, thus reinstating the status quo ante for
genuine importers.
22.
All (but one) bilateral agreements with the Paris Club creditors have been signed,
with the remaining one (with the Russian Federation) expected to be concluded soon. We are
seeking comparable treatment from non-Paris Club bilateral creditors and all but three
agreements have been signed. Discussions are underway to finalize the remaining
agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Libya, and China.
D. Structural Policies
23.
We will continue to build on our efforts to expand the tax base and strengthen
revenue administration. Further steps to broaden the tax base will focus on: (i) expanding
the general sales tax to cover more services; (ii) reducing exemptions; (iii) improving
compliance of existing taxpayers; and (iv) bringing more taxpayers under the tax net.
Revenue administration is being enhanced through the CBR reform project, supported by the
World Bank. By setting up LTUs and MTUs, and moving toward a functional organization
that relies on self-assessment and risk-based auditing, revenue collection will become more
efficient and more taxpayer-friendly. With these measures we aim to gradually increase the
share of revenues collected by the CBR by 0.2–0.3 percentage point of GDP annually.
24.
Similarly, we will continue to move ahead with our agenda to improve
expenditure management. We are working to improve our fiscal reporting system through
the Project for Improvement of Fiscal Reporting and Accounting, with the help of the World
Bank. A new chart of accounts under the New Accounting Model (NAM) has been
introduced with the 2004/05 budget for the federal government. The provincial governments
are gradually moving toward producing their budgets under the NAM. Work is underway to
introduce a medium-term budget framework in two pilot ministries—the Ministry of Health
and the Ministry of Population—with the assistance of the U.K.’s Department for
International Development.
25.
Two major surveys are underway to assess progress made in improving social
indicators. A Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) started in August 2004, and a
full Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS) was launched in the same month. The
results of the CWIQ are expected to be available in time to serve as input for the 2005/06
budget discussions, but those of the PIHS—which covers a full year—will only become
available in late 2005. The results of these surveys will help us to increase the effectiveness

- 76 -

ATTACHMENT I

of social- and poverty-related spending. For the next PRSP progress report we will develop a
prioritized action plan for implementing our PRSP agenda.
26.
We will continue with the reform and divestiture of public enterprises, notably
in the power sector. With the unbundling of WAPDA and the establishment of a regional
tariff and subsidy policy, crucial steps have been taken on the road to improve efficiency in
the power sector. We will finalize the financial recovery plans for the distribution companies
as soon as NEPRA has determined tariffs that are consistent with the cost recovery principle.
We will also continue to work with the World Bank on a medium-term adjustment program
for the sector that aims to eliminate the sector’s drain on the budget. Our goal is to
increasingly transfer the sector into private ownership. In this regard, in 2004/05 we will
offer for sale KESC, the Faisalabad Electric Supply Corporation, the Jamshoro generation
company, as well as shares in the Kot Addu Power Company. Outside the power sector,
privatization plans for the near future include the sale of majority stakes in Pakistan State Oil
and National Refinery Limited.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 1, 2004
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report for the 2004 Article IV consultation and the ninth review under Pakistan’s
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility was circulated to the Board on
November 17, 2004. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Following the January 2004 summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation, a series of bilateral talks were held between Pakistani and Indian officials,
covering a range of issues, including advancing economic cooperation and fostering regional
trade. These talks are expected to continue in the period ahead.
3.
Available data indicate that economic activity continues to show strong growth.
Provisional data for the large-scale manufacturing industry show an increase in production by
14 percent in the first quarter of 2004/05, compared to the same period in the previous year.
In the agricultural sector, the cotton and rice harvests were considerably higher than in the
preceding year.
4.
Inflation slowed somewhat, with consumer prices increasing by 8.7 percent in the
12 months through October, compared to a peak of 9.3 percent in July. Nonfood, nonenergy
(core) inflation, however, continued to increase, to 7.2 percent year-on-year in October.
Wholesale price inflation, meanwhile, fell sharply from its peak of 12.8 percent year-on-year
in June, to 6.6 percent in October.
5.
The budget continues to overperform. Preliminary fiscal data for the consolidated
government through September suggest an overall budget deficit (excluding grants) in the
first quarter of PRs 25 billion, which would be considerably less than the projected deficit of
PRs 89 billion. This reflects a stronger-than-anticipated revenue performance, as well as
some underspending. Notably, both revenue collection by the Central Board of Revenue and
the receipt of nontax revenues were considerably higher than envisaged. Social- and povertyrelated spending in the first quarter of 2004/05 fell somewhat short of projections, though
these data are often revised upwards. The improved revenue position—if maintained—
mitigates the risk to the budget posed by the higher oil prices and the authorities’ decision as
yet not to pass these higher prices on to consumers. The staff, however, maintains its
recommendation to pass the higher oil prices on to consumers, not only to ensure an efficient
resource allocation, but also because higher-than-anticipated revenues could be better used to
fund additional social spending or debt reduction.
6.
The current account recorded a small surplus in the first quarter of 2004/05
(0.1 percent of GDP). Notably private transfers were higher than projected and exports
performed somewhat better as well. Gross official international reserves (including the
sinking fund), however, fell from $10.6 billion at end-June to $10.3 billion by
end-September, and further to $9.3 billion in late-November, partly reflecting efforts by the

-2-

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to alleviate recent pressures on the exchange rate, with the
Pakistani rupee depreciating by 5.5 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from end-June through
end-October. However, the Pakistani rupee reversed over half of its losses in November.
7.
Standard & Poor’s raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit ratings to B+ for foreign
currency instruments and BB for local currency instruments, on account of declining debt
indicators and sustained economic progress. The authorities plan to issue an Islamic bond
(Sukuk) in the international markets by the end of this year or early in 2005, to be followed
by Islamic bonds for the domestic market.1
8.
Monetary expansion remained strong so far in 2004/05, with preliminary data
showing broad money growing by 19.5 percent in the 12 months through October. Credit to
the private sector accelerated further, increasing by 34 percent in the 12 months through
October. The SBP raised the six-month treasury bill cut-off rates by another 19 and 50 basis
points in October and November, respectively. Although it may be too early for the increases
in interest rates in the last few months to have an impact on monetary aggregates, in the
staff’s view the continued rapid private sector credit expansion, the further increase in core
inflation, combined with the recent pressures on the exchange rate and associated loss in
international reserves, underscore the need for the SBP to tighten its monetary policy more
forcefully.
9.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, together with
the authorities’ response and the Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment
Framework, have been finalized and will be published on the Fund’s website shortly.

A sukuk is an asset-backed security that is in compliance with Islamic Sharia laws. Sukuk holders receive
regular payments from the underlying assets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation
with Pakistan
On December 1, 2004 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Pakistan.1
Background
Pakistan has successfully emerged from crisis. By 1998/99, foreign exchange reserves
had virtually run out, public debt obligations were not being met, and economic growth
had slowed to an average of below 3 percent in 1996/97–1998/99. In response, the
government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) implemented a strong
macroeconomic stabilization program in the face of a severe drought and the adverse
post-9/11 environment. These policies are now bearing fruit. Real GDP growth
accelerated to 6½ percent in 2003/04 (July–June), driven by exports, investment, and
consumption. Inflation has been contained to 4.6 percent in 2003/04, though, more
recently, 12-month inflation has accelerated, reflecting supply side factors as well as
easy monetary conditions. Foreign exchange reserves have reached 6.2 months of next
year’s imports of goods and nonfactor services.
Significant fiscal consolidation has been achieved largely by savings on interest
payments and increases in revenues. The resulting fiscal space was used to reduce
government debt while raising social- and poverty-related spending. In 2003/04, the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the December 1, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the
staff report.

-2-

budget overperformed, and the overall deficit (excluding grants) was limited to 2.4
percent of GDP. Strong revenue collection reflected the buoyant economy and
administrative efficiency gains. Support to public enterprises, and particularly power
utilities, was reduced, due to better financial performance by these entities.
The SBP has started to tighten monetary policy. Rapid growth of broad money in
2003/04 has been driven predominantly by private sector credit growth in an
environment of low interest rates and ample liquidity. In response, the SBP has raised
treasury bill cut-off rates in recent months. However, policymakers resisted market
pressures to tighten more quickly in an effort to balance their inflation and growth
objectives.
The external position remains comfortable. The current account registered a small
surplus in 2003/04, despite high imports, reflecting strong domestic demand and rising
international oil prices. The government and other entities prepaid some relatively
expensive external debt, taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate and reserve
inflows. SBP foreign exchange reserves increased to US$10.6 billion at end-June 2004.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated somewhat since the beginning of 2004,
given inflation differentials with Pakistan’s trading partners and efforts by the SBP to
smooth exchange rate volatility.
There is no clear evidence yet on poverty trends due to a lack of comparable current
data. Encouragingly, per capita GDP has grown significantly. However, real wages in
the manufacturing sector have declined by 7½ percent in real terms since 2000/01. Real
per capita health expenditure grew on average by 5 percent, and real per capita
education expenditure by 10 percent since 1999/00, albeit from low levels. This should
at a minimum establish the preconditions for sustained poverty reduction in the future.
Pakistan is still ranked low in the 2004 UNDP human development index.
Structural reforms aimed at establishing a modern economy were successful in many
areas. The banking sector is more competitive and efficient following restructuring and
privatization, as well as the strengthening of supervision and prudential regulations. The
revenue system has benefited from administrative reforms, elimination of exemptions,
as well as reductions and rationalizations of customs tariffs and tax rates. Pakistan has
liberalized its trade regime substantially in recent years, reducing tariffs and removing
nontariff barriers, and now has one of the most liberal trade regimes in South Asia.
Reforms in the power sector are advancing with the unbundling of the Water and Power
Development Authority into generation, transmission, and regional distribution
companies.
The role of the state in the economy has diminished and governance has improved.
Governance in fiscal and financial management has been strengthened, but
weaknesses remain in the energy sector, tax and local administration, and the police.
Regulatory agencies to protect the consumer and ensure stability have been established
in many areas. However, government intervention continues to be evident in the wheat
and cotton markets and in the pricing of petroleum products and electricity, which has
undermined the budget.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Pakistan has successfully recovered from the 1998/99
crisis. Growth has rebounded in 2003/04, and fiscal adjustment, supported by official
inflows and debt relief, has led to a substantial improvement in public and external debt
indicators. Reflecting strong export growth and remittances, the balance of payments
has strengthened and international reserves now cover over five months of imports.
Directors attributed Pakistan’s recovery to the steadfast implementation of sound
economic policies and broad-based structural reforms, while noting that external support
has also played a part.
Directors observed that, notwithstanding these significant achievements, poverty
remains widespread and social indicators are weak in Pakistan. Thus, they considered
that the key policy challenges for the medium term are to maintain strong economic
growth and to ensure that this is translated into a significant reduction in poverty. In this
regard, Directors supported Pakistan’s ambitious growth targets, but cautioned that
these would be realized only if the reform agenda laid out in the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper is fully implemented and external factors are favorable. In particular,
Directors emphasized the need for deepening structural reforms to improve the
investment climate and governance, including through continued privatization and trade
liberalization. At the same time, they noted the importance of enhancing human capital
and labor productivity through greater and more efficient spending on health and
education. Directors also underscored that accelerating growth will require the
continuation of sound macroeconomic policies. They encouraged the authorities to take
advantage of the current favorable conditions in pursuing these challenges.
Directors viewed Pakistan’s near-term economic outlook as positive. They thought that
broad-based growth of over 6 percent could be maintained in 2004/05, and considered
the projected shift in the external current account to a small deficit appropriate given
Pakistan’s development needs. They urged the authorities to resist any pressures for
easing financial policies.
Directors commended the authorities on the progress made with fiscal consolidation.
They noted, however, that Pakistan’s debt burden is still relatively high. In this context,
Directors viewed the fiscal policy stance in 2004/05 as appropriate, as it ensures both a
further reduction in the public debt burden and an increase in social and development
spending. The high oil prices represent an important risk to the budget, however, and
Directors stressed that the rise in international oil prices should be passed on to
domestic consumers to safeguard fiscal targets.
Directors agreed with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy. They welcomed the
planned increase in social spending, which they considered a necessary condition to
move toward the Millennium Development Goals. Directors emphasized that raising
social spending while lowering the still high debt-to-GDP ratio is possible only if the
targeted increase in the revenue ratio is realized. In this regard, Directors encouraged
the authorities to pursue more ambitious revenue targets and to expand the tax base
further into the services and agricultural sectors. Directors expressed concern about the

-4-

new tax exemptions granted in the 2004/05 budget and urged the authorities to
safeguard the integrity of the tax system, which has been strengthened over the last
years through hard-earned reforms. Directors also noted that the fiscal strategy calls for
subsidies to the energy sector to be reduced significantly. They regretted the recent
delays in implementing energy sector reforms and urged the authorities to speed up the
reform process, in close coordination with the World Bank.
Directors noted that the provincial and local governments will now have the main
responsibility for the provision of social services. This step should, however, be followed
up by administrative and financial devolution and also be supported by measures to
enhance accountability, so as to enable the lower levels of government to carry out their
increased responsibilities more effectively. In this context, and given the lack of recent
poverty data, Directors welcomed the launching of recent household surveys that are
expected to provide insights into poverty incidence and trends. They also welcomed the
authorities’ intention to deepen the poverty and social impact analysis of their policies.
Directors considered Pakistan’s prospects for achieving external debt sustainability to
be good. Key indicators of external indebtedness are projected to decline significantly
over the next several years. Nonetheless, given the still high external debt burden and
the dependence on external nontax revenues and grants, it will be crucial to limit the
budget balance, excluding grants, to about 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, as
envisaged in the fiscal strategy.
Directors expressed concern about the increase in inflation over the past year. They
welcomed the recent increase in interest rates, but urged the authorities to tighten
monetary policy promptly and more forcefully to avoid inflationary expectations
becoming entrenched. They recommended that monetary policy be focused primarily on
maintaining low inflation. Directors noted that a further tightening of monetary policy will
also alleviate recent pressures on the exchange rate. Directors considered the level of
the real exchange rate to be broadly appropriate, but noted that external
competitiveness needs to be monitored closely in view of the uncertainties facing
Pakistan, particularly stemming from the removal of quotas on textile and clothes
imports by industrial countries. Directors emphasized that competition-enhancing
structural reforms are the most effective approach to maintaining Pakistan’s
competitiveness.
Directors were of the view that financial reforms have resulted in a more efficient and
resilient financial system. However, they cautioned that banking supervision needs to be
vigilant to ensure that rapid private sector credit growth does not weaken banks’ balance
sheets. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their reform strategy and follow
up on recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment, including
strengthening the pension and insurance system. Moreover, Directors urged the
authorities to divest remaining public ownership of commercial banks. Directors looked
forward to the early passage of new anti-money laundering legislation in line with
international standards.

-5-

Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the quality, timeliness, and
reporting of data and Pakistan’s participation in the General Data Dissemination
System. They looked forward to further steps to address weaknesses that hamper the
analysis of economic and social developments to further improve Pakistan’s statistics,
with a view to subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with Pakistan is also available.

IMF Executive Board Completes Final Review Under Pakistan's PRGF Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the ninth and
final review under Pakistan’s three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. While completion of this review enables the release of the equivalent of
SDR 172.3 million (about US$262 million), the Pakistan authorities have already stated that they
will not draw the final tranche available under the arrangement, and that they will not seek a
successor arrangement once the current PRGF arrangement expires in December 2004.
In completing the final review of the arrangement, the Executive Board also approved Pakistan’s
request for waivers for the nonobservance of three structural performance criteria and of a
continuous performance criterion against the imposition or intensification of exchange
restrictions.
Total disbursements under the PRGF arrangement approved on December 6, 2001
(see Press Release No. 01/51) have amounted to the equivalent of SDR 861.4 million
(about US$1.31 billion). The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries.
PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and are payable over 10 years with
a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Pakistan’s economic performance,
Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“During Pakistan’s three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility

(PRGF), the country has made a strong recovery from the economic crisis of the late 1990s.
Tighter macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have resulted in a stronger external
position, a lower public debt burden, renewed access to international capital markets, and a
revival in growth, albeit accompanied lately by some increase in inflation. External support has
played a part in Pakistan’s recovery, but the turnaround has been primarily due to the
implementation of strongly owned government policies.
“Executive Directors commended Pakistan on the successful completion of its arrangement
under the PRGF. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision not to draw the final tranche,
given Pakistan’s improved economic situation, so that these resources become available for other
countries in need of concessional support from the Fund. The authorities have indicated that they

-2-

do not wish to seek a successor arrangement following the expiration of the current arrangement.
Instead, Pakistan will rely on domestic and international capital markets to meet its financing
needs, complemented by continued support from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
and bilateral donors. The Fund will maintain a dialogue with the authorities on economic and
financial developments and policies in the context of the Fund’s normal consultations with
member countries.
“Pakistan continues to face major challenges in trying to meet its Millennium Development
Goals. Social indicators remain weak. To achieve a significant and lasting reduction in poverty,
strong, non-inflationary growth will need to be maintained, but the authorities will also need to
ensure that growth will benefit the poor. Maintaining high rates of economic growth will require
the continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, with monetary policy focusing
on maintaining low inflation and avoiding the entrenchment of inflationary expectations, as well
as structural reforms. A continued fiscal effort will be needed to reduce the public debt burden
further, while increasing funding for social spending, consistent with Pakistan’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper. The authorities will furthermore need to ensure that provincial and
local governments have the administrative and financial means to carry out their increased
responsibilities for the delivery of key public services, including health care and education,”
Mr. Carstens said.

Statement Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Pakistan
December 1, 2004

Key Points:


Having achieved macroeconomic stability and respectable expansion largely as a
result of “homemade” adjustment and reform efforts, the economy is now poised for
accelerated growth rates and poverty reduction;



Potential risks to the program highlighted by staff will be mitigated through steadfast
implementation of sound policies and reforms;



The fiscal program aims to balance the need for increased social and development
spending with a further reduction in the debt burden, and monetary policy aims at an
appropriate balance between controlling inflation, supporting growth, and stemming
excessive exchange rate fluctuations;



Poverty and social impact analysis will be deepened to improve the effectiveness of
economic and social intervention policies;



Pakistan will not draw the final tranche of the PRGF arrangement in order to free
concessional resources for the benefit of more needy countries; and



The authorities will maintain close dialogue with the Fund in the context of the
surveillance mechanism.

Background
As described well by staff, Pakistan has come a long way since the 1998/99 crisis when only
moderate rates of growth could be achieved, international reserves had been depleted, and
sustained macroeconomic stability was difficult to attain. Prudent economic management in
the context of a Fund-supported arrangement has turned the economy around. The country is
now positioned to achieve sustained high growth, accelerate poverty reduction, be able to
compete with its regional peers, and to exit from Fund financial support.
Since then, progress continues to permeate all areas of the economy. As a priority,
macroeconomic situation has been stabilized. While strong external support contributed to
this outcome, as illustrated in Box 1 of the staff report, to a large extent, policies that led to
stability were “homemade” and the result of a strong domestic commitment and adjustment
effort. Fiscal consolidation has taken hold through revenue and expenditure reforms,
contributing to entrenched macroeconomic stability. The strengthened fiscal position was
also helped by higher grants as well as improved non-tax revenue and lower borrowing costs,
resulting from improved macroeconomic policies and financial reforms, thus creating space

-2for private sector activity. Despite two years of severe drought and the September 11 shock,
the economy attained growth rates that compare favorably with earlier years. The external
position improved significantly with strong donor support and large inflow of remittances—a
reflection of enhanced confidence in the economy—while the rupee strengthened and
reserves rose substantially.
Wide-ranging reforms have increased resilience of the economy. In the financial sector,
reforms allowed the flow of private capital and expertise into the sector, and reinforced
supervision enhanced competition and efficiency. The trade and exchange system has been
liberalized further to minimize distortions, improve allocative efficiency, and reduce
incentives for corruption and rent seeking. State intervention in the economy was reduced to
allow the private sector to spearhead growth, while the regulatory framework for parastatals
has been reinforced to improve their efficiency and protect consumers. Governance reforms
are aimed at strengthening transparency and accountability in public resource management,
including at decentralized level of government. Social- and poverty-related spending has
increased. The Prime Minister’s retention of his erstwhile finance portfolio is evidence of the
authorities’ commitment to financial discipline as well as to policy and reform continuity.
Recent economic developments
Implementation of the PRGF-supported program remains on course, with quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June observed. Most structural
performance criteria were met, while action has been taken to correct those that were missed,
or to mitigate their negative effects, and, on that score, the authorities request their waiver.
Real GDP growth accelerated to 6.4 percent in 2003/04. However, propelled by higher
wheat and energy prices and rapid expansion of credit to support growth, inflation exceeded
the target. The current account surplus was also lower than projected as higher imports more
than offset larger private transfers. The increase in imports that has widened the trade deficit
and narrowed current account surplus in FY 2004 is primarily due to 45 percent growth in
imports of capital goods and 41 percent expansion in imports of raw materials for capital
goods. This contributed to 17 percent growth in large scale manufacturing that in turn led to
6.4 percent of GDP growth rate. The authorities believe that this is a virtuous cycle that was
needed by Pakistan to get back on the high growth path. Despite a somewhat weaker capital
account, reserves increased to $10.6 billion at end-June, equivalent to six months of import
cover.
An improving fiscal performance was better than projected, driven by strong revenue
collection—reflecting the buoyant economy and improved efficiency—and lower spending.
As a result, domestic debt fell below 70 percent of GDP from its peak of 89 percent in
2000/01. Social- and poverty-related spending as well as development expenditure exceeded
projections. In response to rising inflation and strong monetary growth, the State Bank of
Pakistan has recently tightened policy by increasing short-term interest rates. It is worth
noting that, after a long period of stagnation, Pakistan recorded an increase in investment rate
by 22 percent. This was possible because of the expansion in private sector credit from the
banking system which was broad-based and shared by corporate sector, SMEs, agriculture
and household sector for consumer financing. The backward and forward linkages to

-3production and services were quite strong and the growth rate would have been stifled in
absence of this domestic demand stimulated by the private sector credit. Inflationary
consequences of this rapid private sector credit growth have been contained as the demand
for credit by the public sector has been curtailed in the last two years through reduction in
fiscal deficit and net retirement of debt by the public sector enterprises. The government
borrowing in FY 2004 has risen for a one off prepayment of ADB loan of US$1.17 billion.
Further progress was made in implementing structural reforms. In the important energy
sector, the restructuring plan was completed with the unbundling of the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) into separate generation, transmission, and distribution
companies. Encouragingly, the two power utilities exceeded their projected financial
performance for 2003/04. Broad principles were issued for the determination of regional
electricity tariffs in June, although the final cost-recovery structural tariff remains to be
completed. The Financial Recovery Plans (FRPs) for the distribution companies were
delayed pending determination of the structural tariffs. The government announced an
electricity subsidy policy in November aimed at ensuring cost recovery while providing
consumer protection. A timetable has been set for phasing out subsidies by 2010.
Significant steps were taken in the 2004/05 Budget to remove income and sales tax
exemptions and broaden the tax base, although some new exemptions with minor budgetary
impact were introduced aimed at addressing anomalies and discriminatory practices. To
further strengthen governance, discussions are held among stakeholders on the drafting of the
Benami legislation, which is expected to be submitted to Cabinet in 2005. In the financial
sector, the restructuring and privatization agenda has been almost completed following the
sale of Habbib Bank Limited (HBL) in August and the transfer of Allied Bank Limited
(ABL) into private ownership through the sale of additional shares, leaving only the National
Bank of Pakistan under major government ownership. The authorities are taking anti-money
laundering measures seriously and have issued regulations that require reporting of
suspicious transactions and set out minimum records-keeping standards.
Policies going forward
Building on the steady progress made in the past several years, the strategy going forward
aims at sustaining macroeconomic stability, further accelerating growth, and reducing
poverty. A steadfast implementation of sound financial policies and market-oriented
structural reforms is considered critical to fulfilling these tasks. In 2004/05, growth is
projected to reach 6.5 percent, building on the current momentum and assuming favorable
weather conditions. Over the medium term, it will be necessary to reach growth rates of
around 8.0 percent in order to achieve the desired trend in poverty reduction. Average
inflation is expected to increase to 7.0 percent mainly reflecting food, particularly wheat
price increases in 2004/05, before dropping to 4.0 percent over the medium term as tighter
monetary policy and measures to regularize conditions in the wheat market take hold.
Available evidence suggests that efforts at containing inflation through government
successive importation of wheat and tightening monetary policy have been successful in
reducing the momentum of CPI increases.

-4The analysis in the Selected Issues paper (SIP) demonstrates that achieving higher rates of
growth that would match the performance of South-East Asian countries would require, as a
priority, higher investment, including in human capital. In that regard, the authorities intend
to attract higher foreign savings, preferably in the form of FDI, to supplement domestic
savings and investment. Spending on education and health will increase in order to enhance
human capital and labor productivity. The importance of improving the quality of the
country’s institutional framework, which the SIP confirms to be an important driver of
growth, is well recognized. In that connection, governance and the legal and regulatory
framework will be strengthened. A sizable improvement in productivity in the agricultural
sector is also crucial to accelerated growth and poverty reduction, given the size of the sector
and the higher poverty incidence in the rural areas. On that score, the sector is receiving
strong attention, including through improvement of water availability, in order to address a
key constraint to agricultural growth. The development of physical infrastructure is also
receiving large budgetary allocations, given its importance for growth.
The fiscal strategy for 2004/05 and the medium term aims to balance the need for increased
social and development spending with a further reduction in the debt burden in line with the
path set out in the PRSP and the draft Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). The overall fiscal
deficit will be limited to around 3.0 percent of GDP over the medium term, while the public
debt-to-GDP ratio will decline to about 50 percent by 2008/09. The Central Board of
Revenue (CBR) reform project, supported by the World Bank, aims to move to a functional
organization that relies on self-assessment and risk-based auditing in order to render revenue
collection more efficient and taxpayer-friendly.
While monetary policy will be directed to achieve the inflation targets in the PRSP,
supporting growth and stemming excessive exchange rate fluctuation are important
objectives and, as staff suggest, the SBP will strive to achieve an appropriate balance
between them. Analysis of the SIP on inflation forecasting and the prospect of inflation
targeting in Pakistan provide useful policy guidance. The authorities also take note of and
intend to take appropriate action regarding the role of private sector credit growth in inflation
trends as well as the potential risks for banks’ balance sheets. Financial sector reforms have
significantly increased private sector participation and improved efficiency and resilience of
the banking system as well as financial intermediation, as confirmed by the recent FSSA. The
authorities will ensure that banking supervision remains in compliance with international
standards. As noted in the staff report, Pakistan’s exchange rate policy has served it well,
contributing to strong export growth, high reserves, and increased confidence in the rupee.
The authorities will limit intervention to smoothing excessive exchange rate fluctuations and
will ensure that the exchange rate continues to be market-determined and to safeguard
Pakistan’s external competitiveness.
Structural reforms aim at fostering growth, long-term macroeconomic sustainability, and
accelerated poverty reduction. Building on the strong improvements in the financial
performance of major public sector enterprises (PSEs), as confirmed by the SIP study, reform
and divestiture of PSEs, particularly in the power sector, will continue. The goal is to
gradually transfer the sector into private ownership and, in that connection, major companies
will be offered for sale in 2004/05. Furthermore, majority stakes will be sold in Pakistan

-5State Oil and National Refinery Limited. Work on its medium-term adjustment program,
supported by the World Bank, will aim at increasing efficiency and reducing the drain on the
budget.
Pakistan continues to liberalize its trade regime—including lowering tariff rates and customs
duties and reducing tariff bands—in furtherance of regional trade integration, increased
efficiency, larger export markets, and expanding consumer choices. Pakistan needs to
position itself to offset possible loss of preferential status for clothing and textiles to the EU
in early-2005. The SIP highlights potential benefits of increasing trade with India, which is
receiving attention in the context of a prospective South-Asian Free Trade Area.
The authorities recognize the need to deepen the poverty and social impact analysis of their
policies. In this context, comprehensive surveys have been launched recently, which are
expected to provide greater insight into poverty incidence, geographical distribution, and
trends to assist in better targeting and enhancing effectiveness of poverty-related spending
and other social interventions. The strategy to continue to reduce poverty with greater social
inclusion, notably through devolution of political and economic power. In this regard,
provincial and local governments will have the responsibility of provision of key social
services. Efforts to strengthen political empowerment will be buttressed by administrative
and financial devolution to enable the lower levels of government to carry out their increased
responsibilities more effectively.
The authorities acknowledge the potential risks highlighted by staff and consider the best
mitigating response is to remain firmly committed to policy continuity and to implement
sound policies that sustain stability and achieve high growth, while strengthening the
economy’s resilience. Staff’s analysis confirms that the public debt declines substantially
under alternative growth scenarios, while stress tests indicate robustness to a number of
downside risks. Nevertheless, the authorities intend to remain vigilant and take whatever
steps necessary to stay the course. Noting staff suggestions in the SIP, the authorities intend
to pursue a prudent debt management policy, including through balancing the costs of
borrowing from domestic and international debt markets. They will also finalize the
remaining rescheduling agreements with Paris Club and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors,
while continuing to seek grant financing from other official creditors.
Conclusion
Considering Pakistan’s improved external position and the need to free concessional
resources for the benefit of more needy countries, the authorities have decided not to draw
the final tranche of the PRGF arrangement. In the period ahead, they intend to access
domestic and international markets, complemented by support from official creditors, to meet
Pakistan’s financing needs. Already, Pakistan successfully re-entered the international capital
markets. While exiting from the PRGF arrangement, the authorities remain committed to
implementing sound policies and strong reforms in line with the PRSP to ensure sustained
high growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Close collaboration and dialogue with the
Fund will be maintained in the context of the surveillance mechanism, vital to sustaining the
quality of policies and programs and in signaling to donors and financial markets. Pakistan

-6continues to count on the international community to support its economic development
efforts and progress toward the MDGs.
As always, my authorities look forward to the Board discussion of this review and express
their gratitude for the hard work of the staff as well as for the advice and support of
management and the Executive Board.
