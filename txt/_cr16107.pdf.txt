IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Hungary
On April 22, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Hungary.
The Hungarian economy has been growing at a robust pace over the past few years helped by
supportive macroeconomic policies, a favorable external environment, and high utilization of
EU funds. Driven by strong domestic demand, output expanded by 2.9 percent in 2015.
External demand was also robust thus helping maintain a sizable current account surplus.
Unemployment declined sharply, despite a rise in participation rate, reflecting solid
employment growth in the private sector, but also continued expansion of the public works
programs. Inflationary pressures have been subdued and inflation expectations appear
anchored around the lower end of the National Bank of Hungary’s (MNB) inflation target
(2 percent).
Private sector credit continued to contract, non-performing loans, while declining, remain
high, and bank profitability has been recovering. Steps were taken to resolve legacy NPLs,
including the establishment of an asset management company and the enactment of the
Personal Insolvency Law.
Vulnerabilities continued to decline thanks to large and persistent current account surpluses,
and the FX-loan conversion along with MNB’s self-financing program. While many of the
recent measures have reduced vulnerabilities, they have also shifted risks to the public sector
and to the MNB. Moreover, debt levels remain high and the associated large financing needs
together with still sizable reliance on nonresident financing, and a highly negative IIP
continue to pose risks. At the same time, the role of the state in the economy has been
increasing including through acquisition of stakes in the banking and energy sectors.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The 2015 fiscal deficit came in below target, as revenues were propelled by accelerating
economic activity, tax administration improvements, and one-off revenues, and were only
partially offset by higher expenditures. Public debt declined to 75.3 percent of GDP from
76.2 percent in 2014. For 2016, the deficit is projected to meet the 2 percent of GDP target,
implying a structural fiscal relaxation of about 1 percentage point of GDP and the debt ratio
is expected to decline to 74.25 percent of GDP.
Comforted by subdued inflationary pressures, low risk premia, and a negative output gap, the
MNB resumed its easing cycle in March 2015, and cut the policy rate by 75 basis points in
five equal steps to 1.35 percent in July 2015. With inflation projected to remain very low in
the monetary policy horizon, the MNB cut the policy rate further to 1.20 percent in March
2016. Moreover, several refinements of the traditional and unconventional monetary
instruments have been introduced to strengthen the transmission channel, reduce
vulnerabilities, and promote lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring
cheap government financing.
Going forward, output growth is projected to decelerate to 2.3 percent this year. Private
consumption will remain robust reflecting higher disposable income and employment, while
favorable terms-of-trade will underpin a further increase in the current account surplus.
Headline inflation is expected to remain low on account of low import prices and a still
negative—albeit closing—output gap. Over the medium-term, growth prospects remain
subdued reflecting an adverse business climate, which continues to weigh on private
investment, including from abroad; and weaknesses in the labor market as reflected in still
low labor participation, particularly among women and low-skilled workers.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Hungary’s favorable economic performance, including strong
economic growth, a decline in unemployment and continued reduction in external
vulnerabilities. They noted, however, that still elevated debt levels and financing needs leave
the economy prone to shocks and medium-term growth prospects appear subdued. Moreover,
the overall strategy has expanded the role of the state in the economy and shifted risks to the
public sector. Against this background, Directors underscored the need for policy actions to
further reduce vulnerabilities and boost medium-term, private sector-led growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal discipline and advocated
growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to help build policy space, reduce fiscal risks, and firmly
place public debt on a declining path. They noted that priority should be given to improving
the composition and efficiency of public spending, broadening the tax base and rationalizing

Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

the tax system. These reforms would allow a further reduction in sectoral taxes and higher
infrastructure spending.
Directors noted that monetary policy has been appropriately accommodative. They agreed
that monetary easing may be required if downside risks to inflation and growth materialize,
unless external financing conditions worsen unexpectedly. Directors underscored the need to
maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves to support financial stability.
Directors welcomed steps to improve financial intermediation, including by reducing the tax
burden on banks. They noted that efforts to clean up banks’ balance sheets should be
complemented with increased focus on addressing impediments to credit demand. Directors
encouraged the authorities to follow through with their commitment to reduce state presence
in the banking sector. They also noted that additional measures to promote lending should
consider risks and be time-bound. Directors welcomed the start of operations of the asset
management company for commercial real estate, but underscored the need to ensure that the
transfer of assets is done on a voluntary basis and at market-related prices. They also
emphasized the need to further strengthen the company’s governance structure and keep its
operations fully transparent.
Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms to improve the business climate and
increase potential growth. They called for efforts to reduce the regulatory burden, enhance
policy predictability, and limit state involvement in the economy. Directors underscored the
importance of upgrading labor skills, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and
increasing the efficiency of EU funds utilization to boost competiveness. Directors welcomed
progress on improving the labor market, but saw scope for additional reforms to increase
labor force participation and address skill mismatches.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 6, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Supportive macroeconomic policies over the past few years, a favorable
external environment, and high utilization of EU funds have contributed to a strong
growth rebound and a welcome drop in unemployment. There has also been a
continuous decline in vulnerabilities, which has underpinned Hungary’s financial stability
during bouts of global market volatility. Still, debt levels and associated financing needs
remain elevated, thus leaving the economy prone to shocks. At the same time, a weak
business environment, low productivity, and labor market problems weigh on Hungary’s
medium-term growth prospects. While the overall strategy has been successful in
maintaining strong growth in the near term, it has also expanded the role of the state in
the economy and shifted risks to the public sector.
Policy recommendations. Policies should aim at supporting strong, sustained, private
sector-led growth while further reducing vulnerabilities.


Fiscal policy. Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation would help build policy space,
reduce fiscal risks, and firmly put public debt on a downward path. The consolidation
strategy should rely on durable expenditure retrenchment and a rationalization of
the tax system.



Monetary policy. Monetary policy may have to ease further if downside risks to
activity and inflation materialize. Adequate reserves are necessary to support
financial stability.



Financial sector. Reviving private credit requires increased focus on addressing
impediments to credit demand. Additional measures to promote lending should
properly consider the risks and be time-bound. The operations of the asset
management company should be kept fully transparent and its governance structure
be strengthened. The role of the state in the banking sector should be limited.



Structural reforms. Adopt policies to improve the business environment, enhance
competitiveness, and address challenges in the labor market. Enhance policy
predictability and limit the state’s involvement in the economy to help strengthen
confidence and support private investment.

Robust growth has been accompanied by a sharp reduction in vulnerabilities, but
challenges remain. Hungary endured a prolonged period of stagnation in the aftermath of the
global crisis, largely attributed to significant deleveraging, fiscal consolidation, and weak external
demand. Over the past three years, supportive macroeconomic policies, along with a favorable
external environment—low global interest rates and low commodity prices—and high utilization of
EU funds, contributed to a strong growth rebound and a welcome drop in unemployment. At the

above the EU average. These policies
also expanded the state’s role in the economy and shifted risks to the public sector. Also, many
initiatives in the financial sector have reduced vulnerabilities, but have shifted risk to the central
bank. Moreover, frequent and unpredictable policy changes and a still-high level of sectoral taxes
weaken the business climate, and along with low productivity and labor market problems weigh on
prospects for private investment. This clouds Hungary’s medium-term prospects and call for a
strategy to comprehensively address obstacles to stronger growth.

including to the MNB.
8.
Banking sector soundness indicators have been improving, although lending remains
subdued. The loan-to-deposit ratio has declined sharply and permitted a further reduction of
foreign funding. On average, liquidity is ample and the capital adequacy ratio is comfortable. After
large losses in 2014, profitability is recovering. The NPL ratios have declined, although some of the
improvement for household loans is temporary. Loans issued after the crisis typically have lower NPL
ratios but initiatives to reduce the legacy NPL stock are also helping, including the new Personal
Bankruptcy Law and the asset management company for commercial real estate (MARK) (Annex II).
Macro-prudential measures for new loans were tightened effective January 2015, but have not yet
been binding. Finally, state ownership in the banking system has increased with the acquisition of
Budapest Bank, but the purchase of a stake in Erste’s Hungarian subsidiary has been delayed.
9.
External vulnerabilities have declined substantially, but external stability concerns
remain. Large and persistent current account surpluses, and cross-border deleveraging have
contributed to a substantial decline in gross external debt and an improvement in the international
investment position (IIP). The FX-loan conversion along with MNB’s self-financing program have
further reduced external vulnerabilities: e.g., the share of FX-denominated public debt dropped from
52 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2015. Markets responded by pushing five-year credit default
swap (CDS) rates and bond yields lower. However, gross external financing needs of 20 percent of
GDP, a still-sizable reliance on non-resident funding of domestic public debt (26 percent), and a
highly negative IIP (-79 percent) continue to raise concerns, especially at the current juncture of
elevated levels of risk aversion.

The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but non-price indicators
suggest that Hungary faces competitiveness challenges. The EBA methodology yields mixed
results with a negative current account norm (Box 2). However, to further improve Hungary’s
external position and its IIP, there is a need to maintain current account surpluses over the medium
term. While price indicators do not point to competitiveness problems, Hungary’s export market
share had stagnated until recently compared to its peers; and low FDI weighs on future export
performance. Finally, Hungary’s ranking in the global competitiveness index has slipped, with the
business and regulatory environment providing a drag.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2016. Private consumption will remain
robust on the heels of higher disposable income and employment, but the projected slowdown in
EU fund absorption will weigh on growth. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at
around 2 percent. Favorable terms-of-trade will underpin a further improvement in the current
account, which will remain in surplus over the medium term, albeit declining due to a slowdown in
deleveraging and an aging population, thus contributing to a sharp IIP decline. Headline inflation
will remain low in 2016 on account of low import prices and a still negative—albeit closing—output
gap, and reach the 3 percent target in late-2018 as the output gap closes and energy prices recover
(Box 3).

12.
The balance of risks—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—is tilted to the
downside. A sharp deterioration in global or emerging market risk perceptions could lead to capital
outflows with adverse effects on government financing and private balance sheets. Further, weak
external demand, notably from the euro area but also indirectly from China and other emerging
markets, would weigh on exports. An escalation of the refugee crisis in Europe could impact trade
and economic activity. On the domestic front, policy uncertainty and continued expansion of the
state’s role in the economy could adversely affect confidence and investment prospects. Upside risks
are associated with persistently lower energy prices, which would reduce production costs and boost
purchasing power, while initiatives to boost housing construction and stimulate credit could
increase near-term growth.
13.
While broadly agreeing on the near-term outlook, the authorities were more
optimistic about Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects and the balance of risks. They
shared staff’s assessment that GDP growth would decelerate this year but were more sanguine
about growth prospects over the medium-term citing the continued improvement in fundamentals,
which helped Hungary regain market trust, as evidenced by the historically low sovereign CDS
spreads. Nevertheless, they concurred that despite recent improvement, vulnerabilities—particularly
ones stemming from the elevated public debt level and associated large financing needs—remain
high. The authorities viewed the risks to the outlook broadly balanced arguing that the sharp
reduction in external vulnerabilities had reduced the likelihood of capital outflows as evidenced by
the very limited impact of the recent bouts of global market volatility on Hungarian assets. Finally,
they agreed that lower import prices could boost consumption and investment more than expected,
and that deterioration in the external environment represented a downside risk to exports.

POLICY AGENDA
Discussions focused on the need to further reduce vulnerabilities and to transition to growth driven by
a vibrant private sector. On the policy mix, staff advocated for a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to
help build buffers and provide space for greater private-sector activity, and accommodative monetary
policy to support growth and external adjustment. Staff called for structural policies to improve the
investment climate, enhance competitiveness, and address weaknesses in the labor market.
Such a policy mix would increase Hungary’s medium-term growth potential, as structural reforms
advance and the budget quality improves. Increased market confidence and enhanced competitiveness
would lift private investment, including from abroad. Labor market reforms would increase
participation, particularly that of women and the low-skilled, also supporting higher growth. Under this
strategy, growth could accelerate to more than 3 percent over the medium term, the investment ratio
could reach pre-crisis levels, and the public debt ratio could fall gradually to around 60 percent.

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Fiscal policy is turning expansionary. Staff projects the 2016 headline deficit to meet the
government’s target of 2 percent. The budget relies on sizeable one-off revenues from land sales

and also includes various tax reduction measures: a 1 percentage point reduction in the personal
income tax (PIT) rate, a cut in the VAT rate on pork products and on new housing construction,
higher tax allowances for families with two children, and a welcome reduction in the bank levy.
Moreover, a new open-ended housing support scheme,2 and public works and career model
programs will increase expenditure. On the other hand, significant savings will materialize in the
interest bill. All in all, the envisaged fiscal stance implies a structural relaxation of about
1 percentage point of GDP.
15.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal plans face a number of risks and would leave
public debt elevated. The government targets a reduction in the deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP by
2019, underpinned by savings from the social benefits reform, containment of health and education
costs, and discretionary spending freezes. However, besides the intention to further reduce the bank
levy and reform public administration,

staff’s baseline scenario, the structural
deficit would hover at around 2 percent of GDP over the medium term. The public debt ratio would
decline to just below 70 percent and be exposed to considerable risks, particularly from lower GDP
growth, higher interest rates, and growing contingent liabilities (Annex V).3
16.
Decisive fiscal action—encompassing moderate expenditure-based adjustment and a
rebalancing of the budget—is needed to put public debt on a firmly downward path, help
reduce fiscal risks, and provide more space for increased private-sector activity. Staff
recommended a moderate average annual structural fiscal tightening of about ⅓ percent of GDP
during 2016–21 complemented with growth-enhancing reforms consistent with gradually reducing
public debt to below 60 percent of GDP by 2022.4 With the tax burden above the EU average and

public spending of 50 percent of GDP, consolidation efforts should be focused on streamlining
public expenditure while rationalizing the tax system in a growth-friendly manner. Specifically:


Staff welcomed the reduction in the bank levy, along with the commitment for further
reductions, and ongoing efforts to improve tax administration. However, the continued shifting
of items to the lower VAT rate complicates administration and introduces new distortions in a
system that remains burdened by sectoral taxes. Staff thus recommended broadening the tax
base by reducing exemptions and preferential regimes; and further cutting remaining sectoral
taxes.



There is a need for lowering the tax wedge, which is among the highest in the region particularly
for low-income earners. While the PIT rate cut this year aims at addressing this issue, more
targeted instruments, such as progressive in-work tax credits could be more cost effective with a
potentially higher impact on employment.



Staff reiterated its long-standing recommendations to eliminate generalized subsidies, improve
the efficiency of SOEs, increase the efficiency of public spending in health and education, and
rationalize the relatively-high and increasing wage bill. The authorities’ intention to downsize
public administration is welcome but needs to be complemented by a public expenditure review
clearly identifying government priorities regarding the provision of public services.

Finally, staff recommended close monitoring of the housing support program to ensure it is
appropriately targeted, time-bound, and eliminates loopholes for abuse. The authorities should
stand ready to modify the eligibility criteria and the program’s parameters, if necessary.

17.
The authorities emphasized their strong commitment to reduce public debt and
adhere to the national and European fiscal rules. They highlighted Hungary’s significant progress,
compared with other EU countries, in reducing debt. While agreeing that the current high debt level

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

remains a source of vulnerability, they underscored the need for fiscal policy to strike the right
balance between debt reduction and supporting growth. They reiterated their commitment to a
gradual reduction in debt, in line with European fiscal rules, and added that remaining fiscal space
should be mainly devoted to addressing infrastructure needs.
18.
There was agreement on the need for a growth-friendly rebalancing of the budget but
differences in views arose on the most appropriate policy instruments. The authorities
reiterated their preference to further reduce the PIT, if fiscal space allows. They highlighted the
positive outcomes of the social security cuts on employment of vulnerable groups. Given limited
fiscal space, they did not plan to reduce sectoral taxes (other than the bank levy) or streamline the
multiple VAT rates in the near-term. They noted that the lower VAT rates for some items are
considered a policy tool to support vulnerable groups who disproportionately consume such
products, and could significantly improve tax compliance.

B. Monetary Policy
19.
Monetary policy has been appropriately accommodative, but may have to ease further
if downside risks to activity and inflation materialize. An uncertain external environment, oil
price dynamics, highly-accommodative monetary conditions in the euro area, and the negative,
albeit closing, output gap call for continued accommodation, as long as inflationary pressures
remain subdued. Should inflation fail to pick up as projected and/or downside risks to activity
threaten to materialize, monetary easing should be the primary line of defense, especially if fiscal
policy is tightened as recommended by staff. On the other hand, should wage increases continue to
outpace productivity gains, the output gap closes faster than expected in light of the ongoing fiscal
easing, further monetary easing should be put on hold. Finally, if the downside risks materialize with
large capital outflows, monetary tightening may be needed if the exchange rate overshoots and
inflation threatens to durably rise above target.
20.
The use of unconventional monetary policy instruments has eased the monetary
stance more than indicated by the base rate cuts. The MNB is of the view that the reduction of
vulnerabilities has effectively eased the monetary policy stance. Staff noted that although many of
these measures have indeed reduced risks, part of the risks have been shifted between balance
sheets. For instance, while the FX risk of households has largely been eliminated, most of the
refinancing is now at variable interest rates, making households sensitive to domestic interest rate
hikes. Official reserves are now lower, even if still broadly adequate, while the self-financing program
has increased bank-sovereign links. Moreover, part of the self-financing program for the
government as well as part of the new initiative to promote bank lending mean that the MNB
accepts interest rate risk by issuing interest rate swaps. While this may be sensible in circumstances
where the private sector is very risk averse, it becomes less appropriate as activity and inflation
begin to normalize.
21.
MNB officials hinted that, subject to inflation developments, it is more likely to ease
using unconventional instruments than lowering of the base rate. They noted that the pausing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

HUNGARY

in the easing cycle in July 2015 was warranted on the basis of already accommodative monetary
conditions, the absence of underlying deflationary pressures, and substantial uncertainty about the
impact of the many recent unconventional measures. In their view, further easing could include
additional unconventional measures, while keeping the policy rate at the current rate, given that the
base rate deflated with inflation expectations is already negative. Subsequent to the mission, and in
the backdrop of a downward revision in inflation projections and further easing by the ECB, MNB cut
the policy rate by 15 basis points to 1.20 percent.
22.
Staff welcomed MNB’s commitment to maintain adequate reserves thus helping
safeguard financial stability. Reserves are broadly adequate at 114 percent of the IMF’s reserve
adequacy metric and above the standard rulesof-thumb. Although reserves would fall in 2016–
17, as MNB would provide FX liquidity to help
banks close their open FX position that
emerged from the loan conversion, they would
remain within the Fund’s adequacy range, albeit
close to the lower bound. The authorities noted
that the envisaged decline will be accompanied
by a reduction in short-term external debt,
keeping reserves above the adequacy range in
the medium term. There was agreement on the importance of maintaining adequate reserve
coverage because of still elevated risks and volatile global conditions.

C. Financial Sector
23.
Although banks are on average very liquid and well-capitalized, bank lending to the
private sector remains subdued. Indeed, the willingness of banks to lend has tightened since the
crisis. MNB officials noted that relatively high costs and legacy NPLs also impede banks’ willingness
to lend. While these factors play a role, market observers and staff see the lack of new bank lending
primarily driven by still insufficient demand from borrowers with credible projects. This could be a
reflection of volatile external demand, relatively-low potential growth, a weak business climate,
sudden regulatory changes, and uncertainty regarding the future landscape of the banking sector.
24.
Additional measures to promote lending should properly consider the risks and be
time bound. Staff argued that the MNB should not share credit risk from banks’ lending and thus
welcomed the expiration of FGS+, while recommending not to lower risk-weights for certain more
risky lending. Instead, consideration should be given to further reduce the perils and costs of debt
recovery by refining the insolvency legislation and its implementation.
25.
Staff supported efforts to resolve legacy NPLs, but emphasized the importance of
keeping the operations of MARK fully transparent. The recently enacted Personal Insolvency Law
is a good step toward resolving household NPLs, and it is encouraging that improvements to make
the procedures less cumbersome are already under way. While welcoming the beginning of

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

operations of MARK, which would entail the transfer of assets on a voluntary basis and at marketrelated prices, staff urged the authorities to further strengthen MARK’s governance structure in line
with IMF technical assistance recommendations. To this end, staff welcomed considerations to
transition to private sector funding and also, when a track record has been established, to revisit the
ownership structure.
26.
Improving financial intermediation should also entail lower state presence in the
banking sector. The authorities noted that the recent expansion in state ownership of banks was
necessitated by market failure as some foreign parent banks had decided to exit Hungary. They
reiterated their commitment though to improve banks’ operating environment and to privatize the
restructured MKB Bank and later Budapest Bank. Staff welcomed this commitment and stressed the
importance of lifting uncertainty regarding the banking sector landscape, including by letting the
number of credit institutions be market determined.

D. Structural Policies
27.
There was agreement on the need to raise potential growth. Potential growth is
currently estimated at 1½ percent and, as investment increases, is projected to reach 2 percent over
the medium term—still below that of regional peers. In staff’s view, this reflects an adverse business
climate—on account of, among other, frequent and unpredictable policy changes and a still-high
level of sectoral taxes; low productivity; and continued weaknesses in the labor market. Specifically,

labor participation and employment rates are still low, particularly among the low-skilled, a group
that faces substantially higher unemployment. Further, while the increase in the female labor
participation to 62¼ percent (2015) is welcome, it still remains well-below the EU-average of
66½ percent (2014). Hungary also faces demographic headwinds, with the proportion of the
working age population projected to fall substantially. Finally, the expanding role of the state in the
economy could adversely affect investment prospects. In fact, the sizeable gap between Hungary’s
post-crisis and “optimal” investment rates suggests scope for boosting investment (Box 4).
28.

Staff noted that priority should be given to reforms, with an increased role for the

private sector, as unconventional policy measures are phased out.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

HUNGARY



Business environment: Staff called for steps to increase investment and promote private-sector
activity, including by improving transparency and predictability of policymaking, strengthening
anti-corruption efforts, easing the regulatory burden, and limiting the state’s role in the
economy. Enhancing the ease of paying taxes; streamlining the tax system; further improving tax
compliance; and perseverance on tackling VAT fraud would all go a long way to support directly
or indirectly investment and growth. The framework for anti-money laundering and combating
the financing of terrorism could complement efforts to detect instances of corruption and VAT
fraud.



Competitiveness: Given the importance of non-price factors in boosting Hungary’s
competitiveness, staff called for measures to move up the value chain, increase export
diversification, and improve productivity in the labor and services markets, including by
upgrading labor skills and improving the efficiency of SOEs. Focus should be on boosting
innovation and R&D, further enhancing vocational training, and promoting entrepreneurship.
Efficient EU fund utilization would also be important to maximize their growth impact (Annex III).



Labor market: Renewed efforts will be needed to further increase labor force participation,
particularly for the young, old, and the low-skilled. Staff also reiterated its previous
recommendations (e.g., reshuffling spending on family benefits to provide affordable child care,
and reducing the gender wage gap) to further boost female labor participation. In addition,
there is a need to upgrade labor force skills, address skill mismatches, and increase employment
of low-skilled. To this end, staff argued that active labor market policies should entail
strengthened training components and enhanced job-matching services, while tax-benefit
systems should be reformed (Annex IV).

29.
The authorities were confident that recent policy measures boded well for higher
potential growth over the medium-term. They agreed on the need to increase competitiveness,
enhance productivity, improve the quality of education, and foster innovation and R&D—as
elaborated in the most recent MNB Growth Report. As for the state’s increasing role in the economy,
they considered that temporary and necessary to address various market failures. They further
argued that in the energy sector, the overall strategy aims at securing and diversifying energy supply
with a view to enhance competitiveness. The authorities saw scope for improving the efficiency of
EU funds utilization and underscored that the next programming period would entail greater
private-sector participation. They felt confident that ongoing labor market reforms aimed at
addressing both supply and demand side barriers would continue to yield results. They stressed that
the public works scheme has been instrumental in activating and providing temporary jobs for the
low-skilled, and highlighted on-going efforts to promote the transition of those workers to the
primary labor market.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Hungarian economy is performing very well and its vulnerability to shocks has
continued to decline substantially. Supportive macroeconomic policies over the past three years,

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

along with a favorable external environment and high utilization of EU funds have contributed to a
strong growth rebound and a welcome drop in unemployment. The economy’s vulnerability to
shocks has declined substantially thanks to persistent current account surpluses, a sharp reduction
in external debt, especially FX-denominated, and improved market sentiment.
31.
While these developments are welcome, more needs to be done to further reduce
vulnerabilities and to transition to private sector-led growth. Still-elevated debt levels, high
financing needs, and subdued medium-term growth prospects make the economy prone to shocks.
Moreover, although the overall strategy has been successful in maintaining strong growth in the
near term, it has also expanded the role of the state in the economy and shifted risks to the public
sector. The improved economic conditions provide an opportune time to further reduce
vulnerabilities and unlock Hungary’s untapped growth potential. To this end, priority should be
given to: gradual, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, revival of private credit by addressing
impediments to credit demand, and structural reforms to improve the business environment,
enhance competitiveness, and address labor market challenges.
32.
Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation would help build policy space, reduce fiscal risks,
and firmly place public debt on a downward path. The recent reduction in the public debt ratio is
welcome, but, going forward, stronger fiscal consolidation efforts along with ambitious growthfriendly fiscal reforms would be needed. Those could include the rationalization of the wage bill as
part of a well-articulated public administration reform, an increase in the efficiency of public
spending on health and education, and the elimination of generalized subsidies. These reforms,
along with measures to broaden the tax base, would free up fiscal space for further reduction in
sectoral taxes and for higher infrastructure spending.
33.
Monetary policy has been appropriately accommodative, but may have to ease further
if downside risks to growth and/or inflation materialize. Easy monetary conditions have
supported domestic demand in the context of subdued inflationary pressures. Going forward, stable
inflation expectations, the dynamics of oil prices, and the negative, albeit closing, output gap call for
continued accommodation as long as inflationary pressures remain subdued. If inflation fails to pick
up as projected or downside risks to activity threaten to materialize, monetary easing should be the
primary line of defense. On the other hand, should a sharp deterioration in risk perception result in
large capital outflows, some intervention in exchange markets to smooth excess volatility along with
monetary tightening could be needed. Adequate international reserves are necessary to support
financial stability.
34.
Efforts to clean up balance sheets should be complemented by increased focus on
addressing impediments to credit demand. Despite on average strong bank capital positions,
recovering profitability, and ample liquidity positions, and an increase in lending to SMEs through
the FGS, bank lending to the private sector has continued to contract. Additional measures to
promote lending should properly consider the risks and be time-bound. While the beginning of
operations of MARK is welcome, it is important to ensure that the transfer of assets is done on a
voluntary basis and market-related prices, and that MARK’s governance structure is further
strengthened. Last but not least, improving financial intermediation will necessitate addressing
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

HUNGARY

impediments to credit demand, including enhancing the business climate, other measures to
increase potential growth, and removing uncertainty regarding the landscape of the banking sector.
To this end, the authorities should stick to their commitment to reduce the state’s presence in this
sector over time.
35.
Sustained progress on wide-ranging structural reforms would be key to unleashing
Hungary’s full growth potential. Medium-term growth is constrained by low productivity, a
challenging business environment, and weaknesses in the labor market. Easing the regulatory
burden, enhancing policy predictability, improving the ease of paying taxes, and limiting state
involvement in the economy would help improve the environment for private-sector led growth. The
economy’s competitiveness could be enhanced by moving up the value chain, upgrading skills,
boosting innovation and R&D, promoting entrepreneurship, and improving the efficiency of EU
funds usage. Finally, the labor market could be further improved by addressing skills mismatches,
strengthening training and enhancing job-matching services, and taking further steps to increase
female labor participation.
36.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10
percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks at the time of discussions with the authorities.

Box 1. The Recent Refugee Crisis
The number of asylum seekers arriving in Hungary in 2015 was unprecedented. It reached almost
174,400—representing close to 14 percent of all first-time asylum seeker applications in the EU—the largest
share following that of Germany. Relative to its population, in 2015, Hungary received the largest number of
asylum applications in the EU. Syrians accounted for close to 37 percent of all first-time asylum applications,
followed by applicants from Afghanistan at 26 percent.

Asylum Seekers, 2015
(First-time asylum applications, per 1000 inhabitatnt)

Sources: Eurostat and Fund staff calculations.

Hungary is a transit point to other European countries, particularly Germany, Austria, and Sweden.
Refugees typically make their way to other destinations quickly and before completion of the asylum
application process. The rising numbers of arrivals required an expansion of capacities in reception facilities.
Due to their transit nature, migrant inflows are not expected to have an impact on labor market conditions.
The fiscal cost of the refugee crisis has increased substantially. In 2015, the government allocated
HUF 83.9 billion (about ¼ percent of GDP) to cover security and humanitarian expenses. Of this, about
HUF 45.7 billion was spent in 2015, with the majority of spending directed to strengthening border control
and security. Future fiscal costs will critically depend on the number of new arrivals, which is highly
uncertain—but the remaining amount of the initial allocation would be expected to be spent in 2016.

Box 2. External Sustainability and Competitiveness
Current account: Hungary’s current account surplus increased to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015 from 2percent
in 2014, reflecting a moderate improvement in the terms-of-trade, and is expected to remain in surplus over
the medium-term.
Foreign assets and liabilities: Several measures have helped reduce external vulnerabilities significantly.
The IIP stood at -79 percent of GDP in 2015 and is projected to decline to -38 percent in 2021. However,
external debt and gross financing needs are still high—109 and 20 percent of GDP, respectively.
Reserve adequacy: Reserves were broadly adequate at 114 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric at
end-2015 and above the standard rules of-thumb of three months coverage of prospective imports, as well
as 100 percent of short-term debt.
Staff’s assessment is that Hungary’s real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. EBA estimates have low explanatory power and yield mixed results. Specifically, the Real
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) approach reveals an overvaluation of the exchange rate by 30.7 percent. In
contrast, the External Sustainability approach finds the REER undervalued by 10 percent and the Current
Account Balance approach suggests that Hungary’s REER also appears to be undervalued. However, in staff’s
view, although the latter approach is based on various fundamentals, it does not adequately capture the
need for savings to remain elevated to help reduce Hungary’s still-large external liabilities. Thus, the currentaccount norm would need to be adjusted upward consistent with the need to strengthen Hungary’s balance
sheet. Unit labor costs and a positive trade balance do not point to pressures on the exchange rate.
However, non-price indicators suggest that Hungary faces competitiveness challenges. Since 2011/12,
Hungary’s ranking in the Global Competitiveness Report slipped by 15 places with the institutional
framework and labor market efficiency providing a drag on competitiveness. On the domestic front,
continued government interference in the economy could have adverse confidence effects, undermine
competitiveness, and hurt investment.
Export performance has been strong recently, but more efforts are needed to diversify exports and
boost foreign direct investment. The foreign investment environment played an important role in
promoting exports during 2003–06, but its contribution has gradually declined. Medium-term FDI inflows
are projected to remain significantly below
their historical average at the same time when
Hungary’s incremental capital-output ratio is
relatively high. A broader look at export
performance shows that Hungary’s export
market share had stagnated compared to
peers during 2008–14. Shift-share analysis
shows that the drop in trading partners’
demand for machinery and transport
equipment emerges as a key factor behind
that stagnation in exports. However, with the
coming on line of new automobile capacity,
pertinent exports have exhibited robust
growth. Nevertheless, the trade dependency on Germany, together with concentration of exports in the
knowledge-intensive industries such as machinery and transport equipment, suggests the need for
diversification of markets and products.

Box 3. Potential Growth
Potential output is estimated using four methods: the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, the multivariate filter
(MVF1), the multivariate filter with financial frictions (MVF2), and the production function approach (PF).1 The
MVF1 approach models potential output in relation to actual
GDP, unemployment and inflation. The MVF2 approach takes
Potential Growth Estimates
(Percent)
into account financial cycles and capacity utilization. The PF
5.0
5.0
approach employs a Cobb-Douglas production function and
3.0
3.0
removes cyclical factors pertaining to capital and labor—using
1.0
1.0
capacity utilization, the NAIRU, and average hours worked—and
-1.0
-1.0
thus, the remaining residual captures the ‘structural’ component
-3.0
-3.0
of total factor productivity (TFP).
PF

These estimates suggest that although the output gap has
been closing rapidly, it is on average still negative. The
divergence of results between the MVF2 approach and the rest
could be explained by Hungary’s post-crisis credit-less
recovery—with the labor market showing signs of tightness and
capacity utilization being high, but credit still contracting. These
findings suggest that the financial cycle is still lagging behind
the business cycle, in part reflecting still-impaired private sector
balance sheets and financial intermediation. Lastly, it is
important to bear in mind that significant uncertainty surrounds
these estimates.

Different underlying factors have been contributing to the
evolution of potential growth. The deceleration during the
crisis was largely due to decreased contributions of labor and
TFP, while the acceleration since 2012 was driven by an
increased contribution of labor and capital. TFP remains a drag
on potential growth, possibly suggesting that factors, such as
the weak business climate and high regulatory burden weigh on
growth. That said, TFP estimates are obtained as a “residual”
and thus are, by definition, difficult to explain.

Hungary’s potential growth decelerated sharply during the
global financial crisis but has accelerated subsequently. It
accelerated from an average of–½ percent during 2009–10 to
an average of 1½ percent in 2014. Moreover, since the crisis,
estimates based on the MVF2 have been higher than those by
other methods, suggesting that house prices and credit have
been particularly low relative to potential levels.

Box 4. Is the Post-Crisis Decline in Investment Permanent? 1
In the aftermath of the crisis, investment rates fell in most
EU countries, with steeper declines in new member states.
Despite the subsequent recovery and easing of financial
conditions, private investment rates remain below precrisis levels.
To examine whether investment rates have undershot
their equilibrium levels, the neo-classical (Ramsey-CassKoopmans) growth model is calibrated for EU countries,
using national accounts data and European Commission’s
estimates of capital stocks and TFP.2 In this model, an
economy converges to its steady-state equilibrium, in
which consumption is maximized, the saving/investment
rate is constant at its “golden-rule” value, and income,
consumption, and capital all grow at a fixed rate equal to
the sum of the exogenous growth rates of the labor force
and labor-augmenting productivity. The model implies
that the investment rate would fall monotonically toward
the “golden-rule”, as the economy converges to its steady
state. As such, the closed-economy, “golden-rule”
saving/investment can be interpreted as a lower bound
for the investment rate in Hungary along its path of
convergence to euro area income levels.
Estimation results suggest that Hungary’s average
investment rate had been higher than its closed-economy
steady-state value before the crisis. This could be a sign
that the economy was converging from above to the
“golden rule”, but could also be an artifact of overinvestment in specific sectors. The latter interpretation
finds support in the fact that the decline in investment
was to a large degree concentrated in construction.
In the post-crisis period, Hungary’s investment rate
appears to have undershot the “golden rule”, thus
suggesting scope for boosting investment. EU funds have
contributed toward this goal, but the weak business
climate seems to have limited the private-sector
contribution.

1/ The decline in NPLs in 2015 is due to the settlement of unilateral interest hikes and exchange rate margins deemed unfair by the

actual debt servicing.

Annex I. Response to Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have actively engaged in a policy dialogue with the Fund and implemented a
number of its recommendations, but some policies deviated from previous IMF advice.
Key recommendations
Implement a growth-friendly fiscal
adjustment to sustainably reduce the
public debt-to-GDP ratio.

Implemented policies
The 2015 fiscal deficit came in below target and
the public debt ratio declined moderately.
However, the budget composition remains a
concern, as sectoral taxes and the public wage
bill are still high, while allocations to health and
education are inadequate.

Adopt a cautious monetary easing if
disinflationary pressures persist.

The MNB resumed the easing cycle in March
2015 and cut the policy rate by 75 basis points in
five equal steps to 1.35 percent in July 2015. In
March 2016, the MNB cut the policy rate further
to 1.20 percent. Refinements to the monetary
policy instruments were implemented to
strengthen the transmission mechanism, provide
cheap funding for SMEs, ensure cheap financing
for the government, and reduce vulnerabilities.

Reduce external vulnerabilities.

The FX mortgage conversion has significantly
reduced households’ exposure to exchange rate
risk. The MNB’s self-financing program has
helped reduce reliance on non-residents funding
and on FX-denominated public debt.

Restore financial intermediation—
including by reducing the tax burden and
facilitating a faster balance sheet cleanup.
Limit the role of the state in the banking
system.

Initiatives to reduce NPLs are proceeding,
including the setup of an asset management
company and the new Personal Bankruptcy Law.
The bank levy was reduced in 2016 and further
reductions are expected. However, state
ownership of banks has increased.

Address weaknesses in the labor market,
enhance competitiveness, and improve the
business climate, including by limiting the
state’s role in the economy.

Affordable child-care facilities, flexible child-care
services, and flexible employment opportunities
are gradually expanding to help increase female
labor participation. The public works scheme
continued to expand to support the activation
and employment of disadvantaged groups,
particularly the low-skilled and long-term
unemployed. The role of the state in the
economy remained high.

Note 2: Lending includes FGS-funded loans.
2.
NFCs have continued to repair their balance sheets. Construction and market services
were the worst sectors affected by the global recession.3 While NFCs on average have been
reducing their debt (unconsolidated loans and issued securities), it is still high compared to
peers. However, they have also managed to build up deposits with the domestic banks (17.8
percent of GDP at end-2015 compared to 14.5 percent at end-2009).
3.
Domestic bank lending to NFCs has remained subdued (-12.2 percent y-o-y, end2015), but this is masked by two distinct factors as well as some one-off factors. First, large
reputable companies have substituted domestic bank lending with less expensive foreign
funding.4 The MNB estimates that loans from abroad account for almost 59 percent of their total
debt (end-June 2015), compared to around 43½ percent at end-2009. Secondly, bank lending to
the more risky SMEs has increased—3.6 percent (y-o-y, end-2015)—mainly due to the Funding
for Growth Scheme. One-off factors include write-offs by MKB Bank, which is under resolution.

1

This refers to the old definition of NPLs (90 days overdue). Since end-2014, the MNB has also reported the new
and broader EU definition, which includes loans where the debtor will not be able to repay all his debt without
realizing the collateral. At end-June 2015, the old NPL ratio for NFC loans was 14 percent, but the new stood at
24 percent. The new definition mainly affects project loans.
2

In 2010, out-of-court guidelines for distressed companies were adopted, but have reportedly rarely been used.
In 2012, the bankruptcy legislation was amended with a view to facilitate mutual agreements. In 2014, some oneoff effects helped, including MKB bank moved under resolution.

See Box 5 in Regional Economic Issues, May 2015, European Department, International Monetary Fund.

NFC bank loans are highly concentrated. According to the MNB (Financial Stability Report, November 2015,
page 23): “… over half of the [corporate] loan stock belongs to less than 1 per cent of the loan contracts.”

In November 2014, an asset management company (MARK) was established as a
fully-owned subsidiary of the MNB and funded by almost €1 billion to purchase nonperforming commercial real estate loans from banks. Operations began on March 21, 2016,
after DGCOMP (February 10, 2016) felt assured that any transaction would be (i) voluntary and
(ii) based on market prices, using a rule-based approach, hence avoiding state-aid issues. During
its 10 year time horizon, MARK will sell these assets for profit. MARK is not envisaged to become
a developer, but will improve assets based on a case-by-case cost-benefit analysis. The MNB has
taken measures to encourage banks to use MARK.5 The MNB has hinted that it is open to seek
external funding on market terms and to pursue a broader ownership structure at a later stage.6
Fund staff has encouraged the authorities to be transparent and strengthen the governance
structure in line with IMF technical assistance recommendations.7

5

In October 2015, the MNB decided to introduce a systemic risk buffer, effective January 2017, with a view to
encourage banks to eliminate their large non-performing project loans. The buffer will depend on the share of
problematic project exposures relatively to the domestic pillar I capital requirement of a bank. The additional
capital buffer will range from 0 to 2 percentage points.
6

According to Ingves et al. (“Issues in the Establishment of Asset Management Companies,” IMF PDP/04/3), it is
preferable that an asset management company not be set-up as a unit within a central bank or a subsidiary
thereof.

MCM has provided technical assistance ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=42858.0 and

real estate prices in selected areas, and the
conversion of foreign currency denominated loans have all contributed to lower risks.
Nevertheless, households are still repaying more than they borrow from banks. Effective
January 1, 2015, a payment-to-income ratio was introduced and the loan-to-value ratio
strengthened with a view to prevent future excesses. These ratios have not yet been binding.
6.
The conversion of foreign-currency denominated mortgages in Q1:2015, and car
and personal loans in Q4:2015, has significantly reduced the exchange rate risk of
households. The share of foreign currency denominated lending to households has declined
from 52.8 percent at end-2014 to below 1 percent at end-2015. Since the MNB largely provided
the banks with the FX at market prices, when the decision on mortgage conversion was taken, it
did, in principle, not affect banks’ profitability. The bank losses of the much smaller conversion of
FX denominated car and personal loans (about 242,000 contracts) at a preferential exchange rate
is estimated to have cost HUF 31 billion. It will be shared between banks and the government,
since banks can deduct these losses from their future profits.

8

Several measures have previously been introduced to alleviate indebted households, as discussed in past Staff
Reports. In 2011, early repayment of foreign currency denominated mortgages was facilitated. In 2012, 5-year
exchange rate caps were made available, and conversion of non-performing mortgages was encouraged. The
2014 Settlement Act required compensation for past unilateral contract modifications and use of bid-ask spreads
by banks when calculating the disbursement and repayments for loans disbursed after May 1, 2004 and not
terminated before July 26, 2009. The Fair Banking Act restricts unilateral interest rate and cost hikes, regulates
information to be provided to borrowers, and permits borrowers to terminate contracts under certain conditions.
These losses were assumed by banks and adversely affected their 2014 profits.
9

The old definition of NPLs (90 days overdue) is used. Since end-2014, the MNB has also reported the new and
broader EU definition. It includes loans where the debtor will not be able to repay the debt without realizing the
collateral. At end-June 2015, the old NPL ratio for household loans was 16 percent, but the new was 22 percent.

7.
In 2015, the budget allocation to the asset management agency for nonperforming residential loans of vulnerable households (NAFA) was increased. NAFA was
established in 2011, and began operations in mid-2012. It purchases residences of vulnerable
and delinquent households, while taking into account social aspects. For instance, initially
debtors had to have at least one child and receive certain social benefits. The debtor can remain
in the residence provided the agreed rent is paid. Initially, resources were granted to cover 5,000
households, which later have been increased to 25,000, and 35,000 in 2015.
8.
The new Personal Insolvency Law is a step in the right direction to reduce the
uncertainty and costs of resolving debt of natural persons as well as to offer them a
second chance, but its effectiveness is yet to be tested. The first phase became effective
September 2, 2015, and applies to households whose dwelling would be subject to enforcement
and sale,10 while other over-indebted persons will be covered effective October 1, 2016. This
phasing is intended to give priority to those in most need and to reduce the administrative
challenges. The procedures are complex and consideration is being given to streamline them and
later, as experience is gained, to review the law.
9.
Natural persons with debt between HUF 2 and 60 million (about €6,500 to almost
€200,000) can under certain circumstances apply.11 They can initiate out-of-court debt
settlement, under the coordination of the main creditor. In this case, the “Family Bankruptcy
Services” check the legal conditions, and register the initiation and the settlement agreement in
the official register. In the out-of-court procedure, the parties are free to reach any agreement,
including in terms of repayment period. Debtors will usually be allowed to keep the ownership of
their primary residence, provided it does not exceed a reasonable size and value. If an agreement
cannot be reached within 120 days (90 days if there is only one creditor), the court decides
whether to pursue the first phase of the “in-court” procedure, which is a kind of mediation at the
court; or the second phase of the “in-court” procedure, where the court decides. In case of the
latter, a minimum recovery is guaranteed by the law for all creditors. The repayment plan then
covers five years, whereupon the remaining debt is discharged, but the period can be extended
by up to two years in exceptional cases. If the repayment plan is not observed, creditors may ask
the court to terminate the debt resolution procedure and such termination will annul the
agreement on the repayment plan. A debtor cannot file again before 10 years after the
termination of the procedure.
10

Although the inability of households to service their debt is a major social problem, it seems that frequent
moratoriums on evictions may also have contributed to moral hazard problems. See “Comprehensive Analysis of
the Non-Performing Household Mortgage Portfolio Using Micro-Level Data, MNB Occasional Papers Special Issue,
2015, by Bálint Dancsik et al.
11

Such settlement may not be initiated if the debtor has significant public debt, properties are locked due to
criminal proceedings, the debtor is assessed to have unlimited responsibility due to unlawful treatment of joint
stock, and there is a legal dispute among debtors. Other requirements include: overdue debt must exceed HUF
0.5 million (approximately €1,600); be over 90 days overdue; total debt must exceed the combined value of assets
and income for the next five years, but debt may not exceed twice the value of assets and projected income
during the settlement period; at least 80 percent of the debt is not disputed by the debtor; and there are no
more than five creditors. Socially disadvantaged debtors whose insolvency may not be restored may sell their
property to NAFA, while other more complicated cases go directly to court.

Annex III. EU Structural and Investment Funds
1.
EU’s Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) allocation for Hungary—the highest in
the region—over two program periods amounts to 45 percent of 2015 GDP.1 Hungary has
the third largest allocation in absolute terms (€47 billion) after Poland and the Czech Republic;
and second after Estonia in per capita terms (€4,700). The main objectives of these funds are to
promote convergence, regional competitiveness and employment. The allocations come from
three funds with specific objectives

investment (Figure 3), which together with the private investment projects amounted to about a
third of the total investments in 2015.
4.
The rate of absorption is uneven with a significant acceleration toward the end of
the program period. Grants that are not drawn within the pertinent deadlines (i.e., 2015 for the
2007–13 program period) are lost for the recipients. In 2015, Hungary is estimated to have
absorbed almost 20 percent of all ESIF funds available for the past program period, resulting in
the expected inflow of about 5¾ percent of GDP, of which 3½ percent of GDP were received in
2015. Many countries in the region followed similar patterns: Czech Republic and Slovakia have
even more back-loaded absorption with preliminary figures suggesting an increase of 21 and 25
percent of available funds, respectively, in 2015 (Figure 4), while Poland has had a smoother
absorption during the program period.4
5.
The rushed spending of EU funds may compromise their efficacy and could
adversely affect the fiscal position.5 Latest payment data indicate that Hungary is likely to
reach almost a 100 percent absorption rate for the 2007–13 program period. This is ensured by
an “oversubscription” practice.6 At the same time, while EU funds supported growth in the short
4

The Hungarian State Audit Office speculates that the smoother and higher Polish absorption ratio at end-2014
can be due to: (i) larger share of funds being used for, typically bigger and well-prepared, transport projects (40.6
percent of total funds in Poland compared to 25.6 percent in Hungary); and (ii) integrated centralized
management, monitoring and implementation of the use of EU funds. See Report on Hungary’s Absorption of EU
Funds during the 2007-2013 Program Period, August 2015, Hungarian State Audit Office, Budapest (Only available
in Hungarian)

Efficient use of EU structural and cohesion funds has for long remained a challenge for EU member states. See,
for instance, Fiscal Transfers and Economic Convergence in the EU: An Analysis of Absorption Problems and
an Evaluation of the Literature by Yves Hervé and Robert Holzmann, 1998, Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft, BadenBaden.

6

In order to ensure full utilization of EU grants, Hungary "oversubscribes" the amount available. Based on past
experience, about 5–6 percent of the submitted invoices will typically be rejected in subsequent checks. If the
grants are “oversubscribed,” they can in some cases be rolled over into the next program period (2014–20).

term, by focusing on “shovel-ready” projects, market observers have noted that their impact on
potential output could likely have been higher, if the projects were better prioritized. Hastened
absorption could have also caused more irregularities in project certification by the EC, resulting
in potential additional fiscal costs, since the EC will not reimburse these costs.7 The Hungarian
government has been in talks with the EC regarding the reimbursement of around HUF 500
billion (approximately 1½ percent of GDP) of EU funding.

started. The final decisions on competing projects are made, after careful consideration, by the
Office of the Prime Minister. In contrast to the previous program period, where roughly 70/30
percent was allocated to the public/private sector, it will be 60/40 in the current program period.
Furthermore, slightly more will be allocated to research and development.

The projected slowdown in absorption in 2016 is subject to downside risks. The
government has taken measures to boost absorption in the first years of the 2014–20 program
period by announcing that all tenders of this period should be finalized by mid-2017. But, the
shift in administrative focus, absorption fatigue, as well as the limited pool of potential projects
pose risks to these plans. The Hungarian National Bank projects that EU grants (without
agricultural subsidies) could decline by over HUF 1000 billion (about 3 percent of GDP) from

In some cases, however, these grants could be re-directed to other projects. Irregularities of absorption of EU
funds are in many EU countries related to poor procurement practices. In November 2015, a new Hungarian

A number of additional measures could improve the efficiency of investment
spending. The utilization of EU funds could be enhanced through better planning of public
investment, costing and prioritization of public investment plans,9 employing a standard
methodology for cost-benefit analysis and project appraisal, taking account of potential risks to
the project, and having a central review process of major projects, and more efficient and open

Annex IV. The Impact of Labor Cost Reduction on Employment
of Vulnerable Groups
A.

Introduction

1.
The literature provides ample evidence that a reduction in the tax wedge has a
positive effect on employment and recommends targeted social security contribution
(SSC) cuts as a cost efficient solution. The precise employment effects differ across countries,
depending on the degree of competition in labor and product markets and on the elasticities of
demand and supply in these markets, as well as on labor market institutions. Although acrossthe-board tax cuts can be very costly for the budget,1 tax cuts targeted to the groups with higher
elasticity of labor supply could help boost employment while containing fiscal costs. Since the
crisis, a number of EU countries have introduced cuts in employer SSC targeted to elderly, young,
low-paid and female workers with a varying degree of effectiveness.
2.
A number of lessons can be learned from the experience of countries that have cut
SSC rates. The success of these measures crucially depends on minimizing new distortions and
scope for employment substitution. Therefore, targeting the low-skilled and youth groups
regardless of employment status, employee size or contract type, has proven to be more
effective than targeting narrowly-defined groups, such as long-term unemployed, disadvantaged
groups from specific regions, or “new hires” that are particularly difficult to monitor and lead to
large substitution effects (problems of definition, manipulation stemming from re-characterizing
existing workers as new workers, and enforcement). Also a phased reduction of employer SSC
according to wage level has been shown to be effective when targeting the low–paid as it
prevents the creation of a “low-pay” trap. Good communication and limited paperwork are other
key components of the successful implementation.2
3.
Hungary implemented targeted reductions in the social security contributions three
years ago. Under the Job Protection Action Plan (JPAP), effective January 2013, employer’s SSC
were permanently cut in half for employees under 25 and over 55 years old, as well as employees
working in elementary occupations. Additionally, a 100 percent cut was introduced for the longterm unemployed re-entering the labor market, those returning to work after child-care leave,
and career starters for the first two years of employment, followed by a 50 percent cut in the
third year.3 This annex discusses the comparative developments in labor market conditions for
the targeted groups.

1

Estimates show that a 1 percentage point cut is, on average, associated with a revenue loss of 0.3-0.5 percent of
GDP (Fiscal Monitor, April 2014).
2

See April 2014 Fiscal Monitor for more recommendations on the design of targeted SSC cuts.

3

Since July 2015, the government extended the eligibility to agricultural workers between the ages of 25 and 55,
which may affect a further 30,000-35,000 employees.

Labor market performance in Hungary has been strong. Over the last three years,
overall labor market conditions have improved significantly on the back of robust domestic and
external demand and supportive economic policies, including the expansion of the public works
program. The overall unemployment rate dropped from 11 percent at end-2012 to 6.2 percent in
2015:Q4, below pre-crisis levels; and labor force participation increased by 4.9 percentage points
to 69.1 percent. Thus, to assess the impact of targeted tax cuts on employment and separate it

true that the public works program was
responsible for about 40 percent of the
growth, youth employment outside of public works was still two times higher than that of a nontargeted group (Figure 3). In absolute terms, unemployment has declined the most for lowskilled young workers, shrinking from 52 percent to 26 percent; while for high-skilled young
employees it was reduced in half to 10 percent. Older workers have also benefitted from the tax
cuts: employment of those above 55 years old was growing significantly faster than that of a
non-targeted group (Figure 4 panel 2). The unemployment rate of older workers has declined
but to a lesser degree compared with the young and low skilled due to a sharp rise in
participation rate of this group (9.5 percentage points since end-2012).

The improvement in labor market conditions for low-skilled middle-age workers
was driven by the expansion of public works program.4 Unemployment for the low-skilled
25–54 years old has declined from 23 percent at end-2012 to 16 percent in 2015:Q4, while the
participation rate of this group increased by 8 percentage points to 71 percent during the same
period. Cumulative employment growth since end-2012 was 19.2 percent; however, most of it
was due to the expansion of public works from 92,000 to 230,000 employees, adding 78,600 new
low-skill jobs. Outside the public works program, cumulative employment growth was
significantly lower than the comparators group, at 3.1 percent.

introduction of tax cuts.

Policy Considerations

8.
Preliminary findings from labor market developments in targeted groups in
Hungary are in line with previous findings for other countries. Ex-post evaluations found that
targeting based on broad characteristics (the low-paid, the young) rather than on specific
employment status (long-term unemployed, new hires, employer size) is more effective as it
avoids stigmatizing certain job seekers and minimizes the scope for substitution effects5 . Also,
women’s participation in the labor force is influenced by a number of additional factors,
including the availability of affordable childcare, use of flexible work arrangements, and cultural
preferences. In line with these findings, targeted tax cuts introduced in Hungary seem to have
been more effective in generating employment for the young and the elderly, while the impact
on female and long-term unemployed has been less pronounced. Moreover, the employment
impact on the low-skilled is biased by the influence of public works program.

9.
Current policies could be refined to improve their cost efficiency. The implemented
measures target a very wide range of employees by international comparison: around 25 percent
of the work force is eligible for a SSC cut under the JPAP. The authorities estimate the short-term
fiscal costs (i.e., the reduction in the wage costs in the private sector) at 0.4 percent of GDP
annually.6 The net costs could be lower due to the increase in employment but the medium-term
fiscal cost could be higher depending on the balances of the social security funds. In order to
increase cost effectiveness, eligibility could be narrowed to the groups for which tax cuts had a
high impact on employment, while the saved resources could be redirected towards additional
labor market measures, such as higher spending on active labor market policies.
10.
A set of complementary measures could be considered to address the remaining
weaknesses in the labor market. The tax wage for low-income earners remains high even after
the SSC cuts, and unemployment levels for the young and low-skilled are almost three times
higher than the average unemployment rate. A number of measures could be considered to
further promote employment in vulnerable groups, including introducing differentiated
minimum wages, broadening the definition of eligible skilled workers from the currently narrowly
defined group. This should be accompanied by additional supply-side measures, such as better
monitoring of the disability system and the eligibility criteria for unemployment and social
benefits. Moreover, demand-pull measures, including apprenticeship programs and vocational
education, and strengthened training components could help boost employment. For the longterm unemployed, labor market policies providing training and placement services to these
groups have shown to be a more effective instrument than the tax cuts. For the young, better
skills matching through improved cooperation between the universities and employers could
also have high payoffs.

Annex V. Hungary: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Hungary’s high public and external debt and financing needs, together with still heavy, though
declining, reliance on nonresident funding, remain important sources of vulnerability. Under the
baseline scenario, public debt is projected to decline but will remain around 70 percent of GDP
while gross financing needs are forecast to decline to around 11 percent of GDP. Public debt
sustainability is subject to considerable risks, particularly from lower GDP growth. External debt is
expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the government continuing to make net
repayments. The projected downward path is sensitive mainly to current account shocks.
In the absence of credible fiscal reforms, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would decline
modestly to just below 70 percent of GDP over the medium-term. The baseline scenario
comprises a primary surplus of around 1 percent of GDP; the effective interest rate declining in
2016 and 2017 and gradually rising afterwards in line with global WEO assumptions, a decline in
the share of short-term debt in line with the authorities’ debt strategy; and medium-term output
growth at 2 percent. The scenario also assumes that financial markets remain accessible and
there are no significant interest rate spikes.
Risks from the public debt profile are declining; however, the debt level and financing
needs remain elevated. The share of public debt held by non-residents and that denominated
in foreign currency declined last year due to the “self-financing” program and are expected to
decline further in the medium-term.1 Notwithstanding these welcome developments, with the
public debt stock at 75.3 percent of GDP and gross financing needs at around 20 percent of GDP,
Hungary remains vulnerable to negative shocks. Possible shocks include an increase in sovereign
spreads through contagion effects from other emerging economies, exchange rate depreciation,
reduced appetite by international investors, and an increase in global interest rates in line with
U.S. monetary policy normalization. On the domestic front, risks include possible shocks to the
debt trajectory from growing contingent liabilities of the state, as well as deterioration in the
primary fiscal balance from expenditure overruns, inefficient SOEs, and delays in the public
administration reform. Based on historical volatility, probabilistic analysis of debt dynamics
indicates that public debt could enter an increasing trajectory with a probability of 20 percent.
Hungary’s external debt has declined in recent years but remains high. Gross external debt
has declined from its peak of 149 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 109 percent by end-2015. The
improvement reflects heavy bank deleveraging that began during the global financial crisis and
continued till recently, and the FX household loan conversion. Intra-company loans related to FDI
remain broadly stable, amounting to about 24 percent of gross debt throughout this period,
although they have been trending upward in recent years from 25 percent of gross debt in 2013
1

The self-financing program so far did not have any adverse impact on the average debt maturity or effective
interest rates. Debt maturity increased slightly in 2015 due to the smaller share of T-bill issuance, while domestic
interest rates remain at historical lows at levels close to yields on Hungarian Eurobonds.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

to 31 percent in 2015. Going forward, external debt is expected to continue to decline, with all
sectors except for the government continuing to make net repayments. The FX conversion and
MNB’s self-financing program (to reduce the stock of HUF-denominated securities held by
nonresidents) are expected to keep external debt on a declining path over the medium term.
External debt remains sustainable under a range of shocks. Staff analysis shows that external
debt is particularly vulnerable to current account shocks, and to a lesser extent, to a growth
shock. An adverse permanent current account (growth) shock of ½ standard deviation of their
historical variation would add about 14 (7) percentage points of GDP to external debt; while a
one-time real depreciation of 30 percent would add 7 percentage points of GDP to external debt.

Change in gross public sector debt

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) was finalized on January 28, 2009.
The assessment found that the central bank had a relatively strong safeguards framework in place.
The MNB’s control environment was well established, and the audit and financial reporting practices
adhered to international standards. The assessment recommended measures to improve the process
of program data reporting to the Fund and to strengthen audit oversight, especially over the central
bank’s basic tasks. In recent years the central bank law was subject to numerous changes. Going

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

forward, it is critical to avoid undue changes to the MNB’s legal framework and to ensure that the
law continues to support MNB’s operational and legal independence.
Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The Hungarian forint is classified as floating, effective November 1, 2008. Hungary has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions except for those maintained solely
for the preservation of national or international security and that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Effective February 27, 2012, the MNB
discontinued the program of foreign exchange sale tenders, which involved multiple exchange rates
for spot transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
Hungary is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV Board discussion took place on
March 27, 2015. The associated Executive Board assessment is available at

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance


General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.



Government Finance Statistics: Data reporting on fiscal accounting needs to be improved
further. The monthly cash-basis accounts of the central government prepared by the Ministry of
National Economy do not reflect the GFS presentation and provide no information on financing.
This complicates staff’s ability to analyze trends and to appropriately anticipate the impact on
general government accounts. Data on revenue and expenditure arrears as well as that on local
government revenues and expenditures, and financial statements of state-owned enterprises has
been readily provided by the authorities upon request, but provision of this data on an
automatic basis would facilitate the monitoring of obligations on an accrual basis and allow for
closer regular monitoring of the general government.

Data Standards and Quality


Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May, 1996.

Statement by Szilard Benk, Alternate Executive Director for Hungary
April 22, 2016
Since the last Article IV consultation, the Hungarian economy has continued to grow on a
balanced path. The economic rebalancing has been backed by prudent and supportive policies
that have led to a strengthening external balance, stable fiscal balance, and gradually declining
public debt, and consequently, to substantially declining vulnerabilities.
Economic developments and outlook
The economy has been growing at a robust pace, at a rate close to 3 percent in 2015. Growth has
been driven both by domestic demand and net exports. The current account has continued to
widen as exports accelerated further, partly on the back of the favorable external environment
and new production lines, while the terms of trade also improved, mainly due to lower
commodity prices. Unemployment continued to decline below pre-crisis levels on the account of
the accelerating private sector job creation and continuing public works, and despite the
increasing labor force participation. Headline inflation remained suppressed by the falling oil
prices and the still-negative output gap.
Going forward, the growth momentum is expected to continue, temporarily restrained somewhat
by the weaker inflow of EU funds. Household consumption and domestic demand will continue
to accelerate on the back of favorable income developments, repaired household balance sheets,
and increased consumer confidence, as well as the pickup in housing investment and lending. On
the corporate side, the Growth-Supporting Program will stimulate lending and investment.
Nevertheless, despite the solid employment growth, nominal wages are expected to increase only
gradually as inflation expectations remain contained.
A number of government measures are further supporting growth from 2016 onward. The
extended Family Housing Support Program (CSOK) and the VAT reduction on dwellings will
add to the investment activity of the private sector. The Irinyi Plan, the new industrial strategy in
line with the reindustrialization policy of the European Union, focuses on promoting innovation
and key enabling technologies, also supporting more productive sectors with higher value added.
The tax reductions and allowances generate additional income for households and corporations.
The substantial cut in the banking tax also promotes the pick-up of credit supply and supports
financial stability.
The authorities assess the risks around the outlook as more balanced than in staff’s view.
External vulnerabilities are considerably lessening as the share of FX-denominated bonds have
significantly dropped and the nonresident holdings of public debt has been on a firmly declining
trend, also aided by the self-financing program; the composition of the foreign investor base
shifted towards more stable, real money players; and the foreign liabilities of the banks have

2
been reduced substantially by the large scale and timely conversion of the Swiss franc-dominated
household FX loans.
Fiscal Policy and Debt
The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a declining trend since 2011, moderating to 75.3
percent by the end of 2015, notwithstanding the one-off items related to asset purchases and the
need to pre-finance some EU-related projects. The composition of the debt has been shifting to a
more healthy structure, with a firmly declining share of FX-denominated securities, owing to the
debt financing strategy to refinance maturing FX debt with domestic currency-denominated debt
(except a small issuance in renminbi in April 2016). In addition, the central bank’s self-financing
program shifted the incentive of holding government securities from non-resident investors to the
domestic banks, thus aiding the decline of non-resident holdings of public debt. Domestic
households increased further their bond holdings as well.
The authorities are committed to conducting prudent fiscal policies compatible with sustainable
debt reduction, and to adhering to national and European fiscal rules. Fiscal discipline and
rigorous budget execution, coupled with revenue over-performance, ensured that the 2012, 2013,
2014, and also the 2015 deficits over-performed relative to the initial targets. The 2015 deficit
stood at 1.9 percent on the background of the good macro performance, and improvements in tax
administration and tax compliance. The installation of online cash registers and the electronic
trade and transport control system proved to be especially helpful in increasing VAT collection,
fostering the whitening of the economy and tackling fraud.
The 2016 budget targets a 2.0 percent deficit. It incorporates a series of measures that strike the
right balance between the efforts to reduce debt further and support growth: a 1-percentage point
reduction in the personal income tax rate, higher tax allowance for families with two children,
halving the bank levy, and a support scheme for new housing investments. The budget plans for
2017 will continue to follow a strategy with adhering to a declining public debt, while
rationalizing and prioritizing public expenditure to leave space for high-return spending on
investment in infrastructure and in human capital.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy has been accommodative. After pausing the easing cycle in July 2015, the
central bank (MNB) again cut the policy rate by 15 basis points to 1.20 percent in its March
meeting, and narrowed the interest rate corridor in an asymmetric way, and unprecedentedly
reduced the overnight deposit rate into negative territories. Amid the historically low level of
inflation expectations, the MNB stands ready to use every instrument at its disposal to contain
second-round inflationary effects, and to continue with interest rate cuts if necessary.

3
After announcing the Self-Financing Program in 2014, the MNB gradually transformed its
monetary policy framework over the course of the past two years, with a view to channeling the
liquidity of domestic banks to the sovereign bond and private sector securities markets. This
included introducing the three-month deposit rate as the new monetary policy tool, phasing out
the two-week central bank bill and converting it into two-week deposit, an asymmetric interest
rate corridor, changing the system of reserve requirements, and the offering of 3-, 5-, and 10-year
interest rate swaps.
The Self-Financing Program has been successful in contributing to the reduction of the external
vulnerabilities of the economy. The FX-denominated share of government debt declined from its
peak of about 50 percent, to around 30 percent. The share of domestic banks holding government
securities now outweighs the share of non-resident holdings. The sovereign yields at the longer
end of the yield curve declined to levels identical to those of peer countries with substantially
higher sovereign ratings. The program has been unique in its achievement of reducing external
vulnerabilities, while at the same time easing the monetary conditions.
The current level of international reserves is adequate by a variety of metrics, and is staying
within a comfortable range even after gradually supplying the banking sector with the necessary
foreign exchange for the conversion of FX-based mortgage loans. There is no compelling
evidence showing that the exchange rate is misaligned.
Financial Sector
The capital positions of the banks are strong and liquidity is ample in the system. The
profitability of banks has returned to normal levels. Last year, the government signed a
memorandum of understanding with the EBRD, committing to a set of measures intended to
increase the profitability and lending capacity of the banking sector. These steps are already
tangible or evolving: the levy on credit institution was significantly reduced and is envisaged to
be reduced further next year, the contract regarding the sale of the MKB Bank has been signed,
and there is intention to privatize the majority equity stakes of Budapest Bank.
A series of measures are further enhancing the resolution framework of non-performing loans. In
the household segment, the new Personal Insolvency Law is expected to bear fruit in the coming
period. Further allocations to the asset management agency for impaired mortgages, and the
recent lifting of the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions are currently strengthening the
resolution framework of housing loans. Concerning the corporate segment, the MNB, also
building on the Fund’s technical assistance recommendations, established an asset management
company (MARK) with the aim of serving as a voluntary and market-based option for the banks
for removing distressed commercial real estate assets from their balance sheets. MARK has just
started the voluntary registration period after concluding the negotiations with the European
Commission on the implementation of the asset acquisition methodology, ensuring that any

4
transaction would be voluntary and based on market prices without any state aid. The MNB’s
objective is that in the medium-term MARK would operate entirely by market sources.
To enable the banking system to be more supportive of economic growth, in 2013, the MNB
launched the Funding for Growth Scheme, aiming to provide liquidity to credit institutions at a
preferential rate to alleviate disruptions in lending and to reverse the vicious credit squeeze/low
growth cycle. Limited in size and time, the program is being phased out this year. It has been
substituted by the Growth-Supporting Program launched in 2015, which intends to facilitate
banks’ return to market-based lending and assists bank lending to the small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) with a series of tools.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are continuing with the structural transformations and supply-side measures,
intended to address structural bottlenecks and raise Hungary’s potential growth. Focusing on
promoting private sector activity and improving the business environment, a series of regulatory
and administrative changes have been implemented, as follows.
The reorganization of the tax authority towards a more customer-friendly system is under way.
The act on the rules of taxation will be recodified in order to make the operations of the tax
authority more transparent and decrease the administrative burden of taxpayers, on overall
fundamentally changing the relationship between the taxpayers and the tax authority.
Building on the success of previous measures to whiten the economy and promote VAT tax
compliance (e.g. online cash registers, Electronic Public Road Trade Control System), additional
measures will follow. The mandatory system of online cash registers will be extended to some
segments of the service sector. In 2017, an online electronic invoicing system will be introduced
to provide real-time data on the invoicing. The government will encourage the use of debit cards
by supporting the extension of the number of POS terminals installed with retailers.
More investment funding will be directed for the development of the local economy, especially
industrial parks for SMEs, within the framework of the Modern Cities Program.
The public administration reform is under way. It seeks to streamline the government
administration agencies and create more efficient structures. The forthcoming review of the civil
servants’ compensation system will enhance the merit-based nature of the system while
containing the wage bill.
The labor market policies are focused on boosting both labor supply and labor demand. The Job
Protection Act reduced the tax wedge in a targeted manner for disadvantaged groups with the
lowest productivity but with the highest responsiveness to incentives to join the labor market,
such as the low-skilled, young, old, long-term unemployed, returning mothers, and career

5
starters. Its results are already reflected in the continuously rising labor force participation
alongside the declining unemployment. The increasing labor force also reflects the transition
towards a work-based social security system in which the long-term unemployed have access to
public works, facilitating their return to the primary labor market.
Final Remarks
The authorities thank staff for the thorough and constructive discussions during the Article IV
mission, and for their valuable advice on macroeconomic policies. They remain committed to
prudent policies, focusing their strategy on promoting growth, sustainable debt reduction,
increasing labor participation, improving competitiveness, and reducing financial vulnerabilities.
