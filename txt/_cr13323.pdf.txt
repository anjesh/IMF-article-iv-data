STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 5, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Thai economy has shown an impressive resilience to shocks and staged a
strong recovery in 2012. However, growth slowed significantly in the first half of 2013
on account of the expiration of some domestic stimulus programs that were taken
in 2012 in the wake of the flood disaster and weak external demand. The economy is
being supported by strong fundamentals and expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies. The government is seeking to shift public expenditure from boosting domestic
consumption to infrastructure investment. Volatile capital flows have presented a
challenge to macroeconomic policy.
Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to recover in the second half of the year, but at
a more gradual pace than in the past, with low inflation. The global economy presents
downside risks from a possible slowdown in EM growth and capital flow volatility. In
addition, the impact of unwinding policies to boost consumption may be larger than
anticipated, while public investment projects might be delayed. Labor skills mismatches
and infrastructure bottlenecks are holding back potential growth.
Policy recommendations. With solid macroeconomic conditions, the key challenge is
to foster higher inclusive growth with stability. Key recommendations are:


Creating fiscal space for priority spending and gradually rebuilding policy
buffers to prepare for adverse shocks. The government’s commitment to fiscal
discipline would be buttressed by strengthening the medium-term fiscal
framework.



Allowing the exchange rate to continue to move flexibly in line with
fundamentals and respond with a mix of macroeconomic policies and, if needed,
capital flow measures to deal with capital flow surges.



While the banking sector remains sound, the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for specialized and non-bank institutions needs to be strengthened.



Planned infrastructure investments should be implemented to enhance
competitiveness and promote inclusive growth.

BACKGROUND
1.
The Thai economy has shown an impressive resilience to shocks. In recent years,
Thailand has been exposed to large shocks, including the global financial crisis (GFC), supply-chain
disruptions following the tsunami in Japan, and devastating floods in late 2011. The economy’s
resilience has been underpinned by solid economic fundamentals, including a track record of
growth, stability and fiscal discipline, healthy balance sheets of commercial banks and corporations,
high international reserves, and a moderate level of public debt.
2.
The government is seeking to diversify the drivers of economic growth. The authorities
have pursued redistribution policies to boost domestic consumption, while attempting to maintain
the dynamism of the export sector. They have also prepared an ambitious infrastructure program to
lower logistics costs and further integration in the Mekong Region and with southern China, as well
as to boost the economy’s resilience to floods.
3.
Volatile capital flows have presented challenges to macroeconomic policy. Starting
in 2012, Thailand experienced a surge in capital inflows that was stronger than that experienced in
the region, and peaked in the first quarter of 2013. In the first four months of 2013, the surge led to
a sharp appreciation of the baht (7 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar), which became the
strongest performing currency in the region. Since May, flows have reversed reflecting changing
investor risk appetite owing to a weaker growth outlook and indication of a tapering of quantitative
easing policy.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A. Macroeconomic Developments
4.

The economy staged a strong recovery in 2012.



After stalling in 2011 because of the floods, real GDP grew 6.5 percent in 2012 (Figure 1).
Private consumption rose 6.7 percent reflecting pent-up demand and government measures,
including the rice pledging scheme1 and the first-car buyer scheme (Box 1). On the back of
reconstruction spending, private investment grew by 14.4 percent, while government
spending and inventory accumulation also made a significant contribution to growth.
Despite the strength of the post-flood rebound, output in Thailand remained considerably
below its pre-crisis trend—much more so than in other ASEAN economies (Appendix I).



The current account balance declined to a balanced position (from 1.7 percent in 2011),
reflecting a slowdown in trading partner growth and a boost to imports from reconstruction
needs—even as tourism receipts continued to grow at a rapid clip.



Despite two significant minimum wage hikes, core inflation declined gradually from
2¾ percent in early 2012 to under 1 percent in June 2013 (Figure 3). Increased labor costs
appear to have been partly absorbed through lower profit margins, higher labor productivity
or by cutting nonwage compensation. Headline inflation fluctuated in 2012 mirroring
movements in energy and raw food prices, but fell significantly in the first half of 2013.

1

In October 2011, the government committed to buying rice from farmers at a set price above the prevailing market
price, with the objective of improving farmers’ income. Further details on this scheme are contained in Box 2 of IMF
Country Report No 12/124, June 2012.

5.
However, growth slowed significantly in the first half of 2013. The expiration of the firstcar buyer scheme appears to have had a larger-than-expected impact on private consumption, while
exports were hurt by a slowdown in external demand and reconstruction spending had largely run
its course. One-off supply factors, including temporary power shortages and shrimp diseases,
exacerbated the impact of the broad-based weakening in demand. As a result, real GDP declined
1.7 percent (seasonally adjusted, not annualized) in the first quarter of 2013 from the previous
quarter, and another 0.3 percent in the second quarter.

B. Outlook and Risks
6.
The external environment remains challenging and domestic tailwinds are weakening.
Monetary policy remains accommodative, but falling inflation is raising real rates. Credit growth
remains strong, but has decelerated in recent months. The stock market rally has fizzled since May,
even as housing price growth continues. Business sentiment and consumer confidence have
weakened. Nonetheless, as the impact of the expiration of the first-car buyer scheme fades and the
one-off factors are reversed, the economy is expected to resume growing in the second half of 2013,
although at a slower pace than in the past, to a level of 3.0—3.5 percent in the year as a whole.
In 2014, public investment projects are expected to become a key engine of growth, boosting
growth to 5.2 percent. With growth driven by domestic demand, the current account is expected to
reach a small deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 1).
7.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, dominated by external factors.
(Appendix II). External risks deriving from an escalation of the euro area crisis or fiscal policy shocks
in the United States have diminished, but are still skewed to the downside. Slower-than-expected
growth in major emerging economies, particularly Thailand: GDP Growth

8.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of prospects and risks. They
saw the outturn in 2013Q1 as a temporary setback and expected growth momentum to resume.
They agreed that risks to the outlook are largely external and are skewed to the downside. The
Ministry of Finance felt that fiscal stimulus was essential for keeping the economy at its potential
and that domestic demand would flag in the second half of 2013, if infrastructure projects were
delayed. Growth forecasts by the Bank of Thailand and by the Ministry of Finance—released after
the mission—were broadly in line with staff projections at the time of the Article IV mission.

POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Rebuilding Fiscal Policy Buffers and Creating Fiscal Space
Background
9.
Fiscal balances weakened significantly in 2012, reflecting responses to the floods and
other stimulus measures. (Text table) The government reduced the corporate income tax (CIT) rate
from 30 percent to 23 percent in 2012, then to 20 percent in 2013. The impact of tax incentives for
first time car buyers on public finances will begin to show in 2013, and the trend of widening fiscal
deficits is likely to continue in 2013 (Figure 2).
10.
The government plans major infrastructure projects, which would be implemented offbudget. (Box 2). The projects are focused on improving the economy’s resilience to floods and
logistics efficiency, reducing reliance on oil, enhancing linkages with neighboring countries and
spreading development from Bangkok to the provinces. The overall investment package amounts to
2.4 trillion baht (about 20 percent of 2013 GDP), to be implemented over seven years.
11.
The authorities intend to balance the central government budget by 2017 and keep
the public debt below 50 percent of GDP. Some measures to reach this target have already been
taken and the Staff took them into account in fiscal baseline projections: the first car and house
buyer tax relief schemes have ended and their fiscal impact is expected to subside. In addition,
diesel excise tax cuts will be partially reversed next year. Moreover, in the coming years, the
authorities plan to consolidate on-and off-budget public investment projects, reduce unproductive
spending, revise excises, and strengthen tax collection. However, the latter plans are at this point
policy intentions, which the Staff has not taken into account in its fiscal baseline projections.

Staff Position
12.
The fiscal stimulus in 2012/13 has been helpful, but should be gradually withdrawn
once the recovery is firmly in place to create space for priority spending, and rebuild policy
buffers. Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and the devastating 2011 floods, the
expansionary fiscal policy pursued in recent years to support aggregate demand and reconstruction
was appropriate. The authorities’ intention to prioritize growth-enhancing investment projects is
welcome. As the output gap closes, the stance of fiscal policy should be gradually tightened to avoid
a further deterioration of external accounts and build policy buffers to address future shocks.
13.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline and the steps
already taken toward fiscal consolidation, although under current policies the public debt-toGDP ratio is projected to continue to rise. The authorities’ targets to balance the central
government budget by 2017 and keep public sector debt below 50 percent of GDP are appropriate.
On current policies however, the staff estimates that the central government fiscal deficit will rise to
3.4 percent of GDP in FY2013 (from 1.7 percent in FY2011) on account mainly of the lowered
corporate income tax rates and tax relief granted (including for car and home-buying, and fuel

taxes). Moreover, the deficit of the overall public sector (a broader measure of the fiscal stance,
which includes off-budget investment projects)2 is projected to rise from 1.5 percent of GDP in
FY2011, to 4.2 percent of GDP by FY2014, while the public debt ratio is projected to exceed
53 percent of GDP in FY2018. These projections are based on currently stated policies and a broadly
favorable economic environment.

14.
The authorities should consider additional measures to ensure meeting their fiscal
objectives. Possible new actions to reduce the fiscal deficit and reallocate spending to priority
sectors include further reducing generalized energy subsidies and replacing the rice pledging
scheme with budgetary transfers targeted to low-income rural households. Since savings from these
policies alone are unlikely to suffice to achieve the targets, revenue-enhancing measures should also
be considered, including raising consumption and property taxes, and widening the income tax base
through the elimination of personal income tax credits. Finally, tax administration can build on
recent improvements by strengthening compliance enforcement further.
15.
The authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline would be buttressed by strengthening
the medium-term fiscal framework. As is the case with the current definition of public debt, fiscal
deficit targets should be set on a broader public sector basis. Enhanced transparency, including on
operations of extra budgetary funds, state-owned enterprises, and Specialized Financial Institutions
(SFIs) would contribute to strengthening investor confidence. Budget preparation would benefit
from a fiscal risk statement and the budget process from enhanced transparency in fiscal data,

It is further assumed that half of the Thai 2020 projects will be privately financed (through the use of PPP and
infrastructure funds).

including implementation reports. Infrastructure projects should be included in the budget
document. In line with best international practices, consideration should be given to introducing
multiyear Parliamentary approvals of budget commitments, while annual spending plans are
disclosed and monitored (see Box 3). Such arrangements would be reinforced if they are embedded
in the planned revision of the Public Finance Act. The enactment of the new Private Investment in
State Undertaking Act (PPP Act) in April 2013 is a welcome development in view of streamlining the
project approval process and enhancing clarity on procedures for private sector participants.
Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities are confident that they will achieve their medium-term fiscal goals,
including a balanced central government budget by 2017 and keeping public debt below
50 percent of GDP. They explained that their strategy is based on three pillars: containing recurrent
spending; adjusting excises, including on sumptuary goods and fuel; and expanding the tax base
through strengthened tax administration. They noted that a number of measures have already been
taken or proposed to Parliament for next year’s

ratio.
17.
The authorities stressed the critical importance of public infrastructure projects for
inclusive growth, noting that financing them off-budget would improve implementation. They
estimate that the projects would contribute an average of 1 percent of GDP per year to the
economy during the construction phase, and that improved logistics would reduce costs by
2 percent of GDP per year. The authorities explained that similar projects were tried unsuccessfully
twice in recent years—they were crowded out by more urgent expenditure priorities during the
budget discussions or delayed owing to political transitions. In contrast, the authorities cited the
example of the off budget programs approved to address the GFC, which have been more
successfully implemented by a series of successive governments. The authorities also assured that
the project review process would include Parliament and thereby ensure full accountability and
transparency of the program’s implementation.

The stance of monetary policy is
accommodative. The policy rate was reduced in
October 2012 to counter the risk of external
demand slowdown, and then again in May 2013 to
2.5 percent to stimulate domestic demand after the
disappointing first quarter growth results, in the
context of low and declining inflation (Figure 3).

19.
Core inflation is comfortably within the
target band and risks to inflation are balanced. The implementation of large public infrastructure
projects may put pressure on production capacity and raise costs. Increases in excise taxes and in
administered prices could feed into price pressures. A global oil shock triggered by geopolitical
events remains a risk. However, the recovery of domestic demand might be weaker than anticipated.

Staff Position
20.
The accommodative stance is appropriate for the moment, but the Bank of Thailand
(BOT) should closely monitor demand and wage pressures. The interest rate cut was appropriate
given tame inflation, a slowing economy, and deteriorating external environment. Once the recovery
is entrenched and the output gap is clearly on a closing path, or if inflation starts to rise, the stance
of monetary policy should be gradually normalized. In the staff’s estimates, the fall in output in the
first half of 2013 has opened a negative output gap of about -1.2 percent (Appendix III), but the gap
is expected to close gradually over the course of this year.
21.
Monetary policy credibility is a key asset for Thailand. The inflation-targeting framework
and central bank independence have served the country well, helping to maintain macroeconomic
stability in the face of powerful shocks. In the current period of volatile capital flows and rapid shifts
in investor risk appetite, it is critical to preserve these arrangements to enjoy the benefits of policy
credibility.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities explained that the slowdown in the first quarter of 2013 and the
disappointing global recovery called for a continued accommodative stance. They saw a need
to complement fiscal policy in cushioning domestic demand and securing a firm recovery in a
benign inflationary environment. They stressed that the latest rate cut, however small, sent an
appropriate signal that monetary policy had to react to internal and external developments while
maintaining sufficient ammunition if the need arises for further actions.

The future course of monetary policy will depend on developments in Thailand and in
the global economy. The authorities made it clear that the current policy stance is accommodative,
and there is no tightening or loosening bias for the near term—the Monetary Policy Committee will
take a data-dependent approach.

C. External and Exchange Rate Assessment
Background
24.
The external position of Thailand, as measured by the international investment
position, strengthened significantly in the decade ending in 2011. The net debtor position of
the country fell from about 44 percent of GDP in 2001, to 9 percent in 2011. Much of this
improvement was due to the reduction in the debtor position of other investment and to the
increase in reserve assets. In addition, a sharp increase in Thai foreign direct investment more than
offset the increase in foreign direct investment in Thailand in the last few years—a trend that
accentuated in 2012 and is expected to continue in the coming years.

The surplus in the current account of the balance of payment fell in 2012, consistent
with a trend observed in recent years. The current account surplus has fallen sharply from its peak
in 2009 at 8¼ percent of GDP to a balanced position in 2012. The trade surplus declined to
2 percent of GDP in 2012 (from 5 percent the previous year), due to persisting global demand
headwinds and higher imports boosted by reconstruction expenditures. Export growth slowed
in 2012, mainly because of weaker global demand and some supply constraints due to the floods.
The deficit in services declined significantly on account of sharply higher tourism receipts, including
a surge of visitors from China. At the same time, the capital and financial account turned into a
surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012 (minus 1.5 percent in 2011).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Staff Position
26.
The current account balance is close to equilibrium, the Thai baht is broadly in line
with fundamentals, and Thailand’s overall competitiveness remains strong. Notwithstanding
greater exchange rate volatility in 2013—a strong appreciation of the Thai baht in the first four
months of the year was followed by the reversal of the appreciation by July—IMF staff estimates
show a fairly valued real effective exchange rate at the current level.3 Foreign direct investment,
including that to the export sector, has been buoyant and market shares of Thai exports in global
trade continue to expand. Thailand’s latest position in the Global Competitiveness Ranking rose to
27 (from 30).

27.
Thailand’s equilibrium real exchange rate is likely to appreciate over time as the
economy catches up with more advanced countries. The authorities should continue to allow the
exchange rate to move flexibly in accordance with fundamentals while encouraging hedging by the
private sector. Foreign exchange interventions, if needed, should be limited to preventing large
volatility and overshooting. At present, the level of international reserves exceeds most international
benchmarks for reserve adequacy, a condition that is projected to be sustained in the medium term.
Thus, there is no need for further precautionary reserve accumulation.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s exchange rate assessment. They
reiterated their commitment to the flexible exchange rate regime, and agreed that it would serve the
country best to let the exchange rate follow fundamentals. However, they noted that markets are
not always rational and are sometimes driven by distortions elsewhere in the world. Therefore
occasional intervention might be needed to avoid overshooting and excessive volatility.

3

EBA results, using year average data, show a zero real effective exchange rate (REER) gap for 2012, and the average
REER gap, using the CGER methodology indicate a small (3 percent) undervaluation in 2013. While the two
methodologies are not directly comparable, both indicate that the exchange rate is fairly valued.

D. Dealing with Capital Flows
Background
29.
Thailand experienced a surge in capital flows from early 2012 to mid-2013. Gross
capital inflows in 2012 reached US$42 billion (11.5 percent of GDP). Foreign direct investment (FDI)
remains the largest form of capital inflows; however, net FDI was negative for the second time
in 2012 as a result of increased outward FDI by Thai firms. Thailand’s financial account surplus
(US$11.5 billion) increased to 3.2 percent of GDP, the highest among ASEAN 5 economies. Major
contributors were net portfolio inflows and other investments. On top of foreign inflows, private
external financing by Thai residents reached almost US$20 billion in 2012. However, the entry for
errors and omissions was a large negative possibly reflecting unregistered capital outflows. Half of
capital inflows were invested in the local bond market, with the remaining half in equity, FDI and real
estate (Figure 4). Strong capital inflows continued in early 2013(Appendix V). However, since late
May, capital flows have reversed and the financial balance became negative. Net foreign portfolio
outflows during late May and early July reached US$4 billion (1.1 percent of GDP) with the major
contributions in the form of equity outflows (US$2.6 billion). Markets have calmed down in recent
weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke qualified his previous remarks in May.
30.
Large capital inflows have helped to reduce the cost of capital, contributed to rapid
growth of asset prices and have complicated macroeconomic management. Capital inflows,
combined with improved market sentiment, led the Thai baht to appreciate sharply in the first four
months of 2013 (7 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar) before reversing most of the appreciation
in the following months. Reflecting ample liquidity and the low interest rate environment, the stock
market index raised asset prices by 35 percent in 2012 and a further 12 percent during January and
late May 2013, before falling by 12 percent by early July. Property prices have also risen, most
prominently in selected areas of Bangkok and other large cities.
31.
The Thai authorities responded to the capital inflows with macroeconomic policies and
indicated their readiness to use CFMs and macroprudential measures, if needed. Publicly stated
discomfort of the authorities about the rapid baht appreciation and press reports of contingency
plans to address inflow surges changed market sentiment and initiated a reversal of portfolio
inflows, starting in mid-May. Concurrently, comments by Fed Chairman Bernanke on May 22 about
possible tapering of QE triggered a global outflow of funds from emerging markets, including
Thailand. These outflows from Thailand have continued since late May and again accelerated in early
August in line with developments in other emerging markets.

Staff Views
32.
While volatile in the short run, net capital flows are expected to be positive in the
medium term. Structural changes in portfolios of large international asset managers, Thailand’s
strong economic fundamentals, and easy monetary conditions in advanced countries are likely to
continue to fuel capital inflows, which are projected to be only partially offset by Thai direct
investment abroad and outward portfolio investments. The authorities’ medium-term strategy of
promoting greater exchange rate flexibility, gradual liberalization of capital outflows, and deepening
the capital markets is appropriate.

33.
Dealing with short-term capital flow volatility will likely require a diversified toolkit
depending on economic circumstances. Given the current level of the exchange rate, the first line
of defense should be exchange rate flexibility, with currency intervention limited to avoiding
excessive volatility and overshooting. The policy rate could also be adjusted, depending on the
cyclical position of the economy, and some macroprudential measures can be adopted to mitigate
the risk of excessive leverage in the household or banking sectors. Finally, capital flow measures can
be considered if the exchange rate had overshot and the flows remain strong. However, if capital
measures are used, it is critical that markets are adequately informed and a gradual approach is
used in order to avoid an overreaction of markets.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The surge in capital flows and sharp appreciation of the baht in the first part of 2013
had complicated policy making in Thailand. The authorities felt that the appreciation of the baht
was appropriate in the context of robust economic recovery, and would actually encourage
exporters to hedge their receipts. However, they indicated that by April there were clear signs of
exchange rate overshooting. They expressed these views publicly and agreed with the Ministry of
Finance on contingent capital flow measures to be implemented in case of continued overshooting.
These actions succeeded in stabilizing the exchange rate by late April. In successive weeks, the
appreciation began to revert when investor appetite waned as a result of a weaker growth outlook
and early indications of tapering of quantitative easing in the United States.

E. Maintaining and Strengthening Financial Sector Resilience
Background
35.
The financial sector has benefited from the recovery. Banks weathered the recent shocks
to Thailand’s economy relatively well and used the improved environment to strengthen balance
sheets. In commercial banks, the nonperforming ratio has continued to decline; capital adequacy
improved; and profitability remains strong. They are expected to meet Basel III capital and liquidity
requirements on time. There has been significant progress in strengthening the AML/CFT regime,
including by enacting legislation, which contributed to Thailand’s removal from the Financial Action
Task Force’s Public Statement. Nevertheless, Thailand should continue strengthening its AML/CFT
regime in line with the FATF standards.
36.
While the banking sector remained sound (Figure 5), financial sector vulnerabilities are
rising:


Credit expansion has continued at a rapid pace in the past two years, although it has
decelerated somewhat since early 2013. The private sector credit-to-GDP ratio and the
deviation of credit/GDP are relatively high compared with other ASEAN 5 economies, this
ratio expanded from 110 percent in 2012Q4 to 115 percent in 2013Q1. In addition, the
deviation of credit/GDP growth from trend increased from 1.2 percent in 2012Q4 to
4.7 percent in 2013Q1.



Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs) could be a source of contingent fiscal liabilities
and rising financial risk. SFIs are public banks that carry out government lending schemes.
They are supervised by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) that has delegated examination
responsibility to the BOT. SFIs operate under a regulatory framework determined by their
originating law but in general, is prudentially weaker than the one that applies to commercial
banks. Lending by SFIs has risen significantly in recent years, reaching 27 percent of total
banking credit in 2012 (up from 18 percent in 2003). Compared with commercial banks, the
quality of SFI assets tends to be weaker, they face higher funding costs and lower lending
spreads, and their credit policies are influenced by government policies. There is some
evidence that SFI interconnectedness with the rest of the financial sector has increased in
recent years through bond issuance and interbank borrowings (Figure 6).



Rising household debt raises concerns about overindebtedness. Household debt reached
78 percent of GDP in 2012, up from 63 percent in 2010, and continues to grow rapidly. While
some of the increase can be attributed to one-off factors such as reconstruction and the first
car buyer scheme, the rise in low-income household debt is a concern, given the vulnerability
of that segment of the population. Both banks and nonbank institutions, including SFIs, credit
cooperatives, credit card, and leasing, and personal loan companies have been very active in
this market.



Nonbank financial institutions are expanding and could pose risks to financial stability.
An example is the rapid expansion of credit cooperatives, which are moving away from the
traditional model, into more generalized financial services. Their assets amount to about
15 percent of GDP. In 2012, loans and assets for the Savings and Credit Cooperative group
grew by 24.7 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively, while deposits and shares grew by
0.48 percent and 11.86 percent, respectively. These institutions are becoming more
interconnected with the financial sector through the interbank market, while they also lend to
each other and invest in other financial institutions. Regulation is carried out by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives (Box 5 and Figure 6).

Staff Views
37.
There is a growing need to enlarge the BOT’s regulatory and supervisory perimeter to
include SFIs and credit cooperatives. Financial sector oversight has been proactive, but supervisory
gaps arising from the current institutional setting may limit its scope to contain risks. It is important to
strengthen the management and governance of SFIs in line with the 2008 FSAP recommendations. In
particular, current prudential regulations and disclosure requirements that apply to commercial banks
should be gradually extended to credit cooperatives and SFIs, starting with the largest institutions. This
action need not weaken the SFIs’ ability to fulfill social policies, which can continue under the current
scheme of public sector accounts that allows the pass-through of the costs of these policies to the
budget.
38.
The staff supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen prudential regulation. The
mission welcomes the BOT’s use of moral suasion to encourage banks to strengthen their risk
management policies, in particular with respect to mortgages, and to encourage banks to increase
general provisions based on the assessment of credit default risks. While recognizing the role of
nonbank financial intermediation in deepening access to financial markets, the staff cautions on
possible consequences of shifting intermediation to segments that are subject to data gaps and lessstringent regulatory standards and oversight.

39.
At this stage, there does not seem to be a pressing need to tighten macroprudential
policies, but close monitoring of credit and asset markets is warranted. There are signs that
credit growth and selected asset price growth are slowing down, although household loans remain
buoyant. Asset prices should continue to be monitored closely for evolving risks, in particular in the
consumer loans and real estate sectors.
40.
However, the authorities should explore a variety of macroprudential tools, to be used
if systemic risks increase. Judicious tightening of loan-to-value ratios or debt-to-income ratios
could be assessed, if needed. In this context, a levy on banks’ non-core foreign liabilities could
discourage reliance on foreign wholesale funding. Unremunerated reserve requirements on foreign
borrowing can have a similar effect, and provide a liquidity buffer against a sudden withdrawal of
foreign funding. Housing sector-related measures, such as LTV or DTI, may be considered for certain
types of houses or areas. At the same time, it will be critical to coordinate these policies with the
MOF.

Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities are generally satisfied with the stability of Thailand’s financial sector.
They are confident in the robustness of the banking sector, and are promoting financial sector
development and capital account liberalization to deepen financial markets and to deal with the
volatility arising from capital flows. Going forward, the authorities will continue to strengthen the
regulatory framework of the Thai financial sector through their gradual implementation of Basel III.
42.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment of the risks emanating from SFIs
and household debt and stressed their actions to address them. Both the Ministry of Finance
and the BOT remain alert to these risks and have made concerted efforts in stepping up their
supervision of these institutions. There have been changes in senior officials of selected SFIs to
strengthen their management. The authorities plan to further improve the monitoring of
vulnerabilities associated with SFIs and household debt. Moreover, the 2014 budget includes funds
to inject capital (4.5 billion baht) into two SFIs. In addition, the authorities plan to provide a clear
mandate and update the SFI legislation in order to strengthen the supervisory regime, and improve
corporate governance. They have strengthened the data collection and prudential regulation of the
providers of household loans. Thus far, the authorities do not see any imminent or potential
systemic risks arising from credit cooperatives, which they believe are of relatively small size.
However, the BOT is monitoring the systemic implications of these nonbank financial intermediaries
closely.

F. Policies for Boosting Growth and Inclusiveness
Background
43.
Thailand’s growth has been remarkable,
but large income and regional disparities
remain. Thanks to Thailand’s progress in social and
economic development, the World Bank upgraded
the country to the upper middle-income status
in 2011. Strong growth has helped reduce
dramatically the incidence of poverty, but income
inequality persists at relatively high levels. To a
large extent the inequalities reflect regional
disparities.4

44.
The National Economic and Social Development Plan seeks to boost growth and
reduce disparities. The comprehensive plan aims at enhancing competitiveness and promoting
inclusive, environment-friendly growth via augmentation of human capital, economic restructuring,
and improved management of natural resources. The infrastructure projects at the heart of this plan
will not only increase economy-wide productivity but will also improve connectivity and facilitate
development in the less advanced provinces. In addition, these plans support increased crosscountry linkages envisaged for the ASEAN Economic Community.
45.
Labor shortages present an obstacle to growth. Thailand’s population growth is slowing
as the impact of falling fertility is only partially being offset by migrant workers from neighboring
countries. As a result, the working-age population is expected to begin shrinking in the second half
of this decade, while the dependency ratio will rise. Moreover, available resources are not always
utilized in the most efficient way—nearly forty percent of the labor force is employed in lowproductivity agriculture. While the employment ratio is among the highest in Asia, more than half of
the labor force is classified as own-account workers or unpaid family workers—categories
considered as “vulnerable employment” by the International Labor Organization. A skill mismatch
has emerged, where unsatisfied demand for workers with technical skills coexists with an oversupply
of university graduates with degrees in social sciences and management.

Staff Position
46.
Improving infrastructure is key to unleashing Thailand’s growth potential. Enhancing
transportation links with neighboring countries and between regions within the country will make it
easier to move goods and factors of production. This should spur regional development and help
reduce inequality. Developing energy resources is also essential to avoid supply bottlenecks in the
future.

Report No. 12/124 for a detailed discussion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

THAILAND

47.
Raising labor productivity is indispensable for improving the standard of living. With
working-age-population growth slowing rapidly, increasing output per worker is key to sustaining
strong GDP growth (Appendix V). In addition, facilitating labor mobility to higher productivity
sectors would allow Thailand to climb the technological ladder, but each new step presents a
challenge, particularly in the environment of slow global growth and intense regional competition.
In that context, a reallocation of resources from low-productivity to high-productivity sectors in the
economy—in addition to increasing productivity in individual sectors—could play a bigger role
(Box 4). Therefore, policies such as the rice support scheme that support small-scale, lowproductivity agricultural activities may impede faster modernization of the economy.
48.
The staff sees clear merit in replacing the rice pledging scheme with budgetary
transfers targeted at low-income agricultural households. Targeted cash transfers are more
effective in supporting those households most in need and could be made conditional on schooling
and other measures to improve the labor market chances of the younger generation. Moreover,
uncertainty and lack of data concerning the rice paddy pledging scheme has eroded confidence in
Thailand’s public finance. With the pledging prices about 40 percent above market prices, it is
inevitable for the government to incur losses as long as the scheme remains unchanged. The
government has committed 410 billion baht to the revolving fund for managing the scheme, but it is
unclear how losses will be contained within the size of the fund.

Authorities’ Views
49.
The authorities stressed that their income-support programs are also positive for
productivity. The minimum wage hikes have prompted a reallocation of low value-added industries
to less developed neighboring countries, while the laid-off workers have quickly found more
productive jobs (including in the auto industry). They also triggered technological upgrades and
capital investment aimed at raising labor productivity.5 The rice pledging scheme and other policies
are helping the farmers improve their balance sheets, which could allow them to invest in new
equipment. In addition, the government is working with the farmers to diversify their production to
better benefit from higher prices in world markets.
50.
The authorities also reiterated that the key objectives of the rice pledging scheme
were to address economic inequality in the country and to help poor farmers improve their
productivity. They acknowledged the staff’s concerns about the effectiveness and transparency of
the scheme and suggested that a reduction in the pledging prices or limits on the amount of
purchase might be needed to ensure the sustainability of the policy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
The Thai economy staged a strong recovery in 2012 and, notwithstanding the
slowdown in recent months, growth is expected to recover, but at a more gradual pace than
5

in the past, with low inflation. The authorities reacted decisively to the floods in late 2011 and
with policies to support aggregate demand and actions to facilitate private investment, succeeded in
supporting a strong recovery. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, mainly from the
external sector. Political stability has strengthened in Thailand, although downside risks remain.
52.
As the output gap closes, the stance of fiscal policy should be gradually tightened to
rebuild policy buffers to address future shocks. Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis
and the devastating 2011 floods, the expansionary fiscal policy pursued in recent years was
appropriate.
53.
Staff endorses the authorities’ medium-term fiscal targets, including keeping the
public debt below 50 percent of GDP and balancing the central government budget by 2017.
Recent events have shown that the Thai economy is exposed to large shocks. Addressing potential
shocks requires policy buffers, including a low public debt level. With the ongoing recovery and new
policy priorities, the authorities have started to gradually withdraw the fiscal stimulus, although
additional actions will be needed to meet the authorities’ fiscal targets.
54.
Fiscal discipline would be buttressed by strengthening the medium-term fiscal
framework. Fiscal deficit targets should be set on a broader public sector basis, with enhanced
transparency, including on operations of extra-budgetary funds, state-owned enterprises, and SFIs.
Infrastructure projects should be included in the budget, possibly with a concurrent Parliamentary
approval of multiyear budget commitments, while annual spending plans are disclosed and
monitored.
55.
While the BOT should closely monitor demand and wage pressures, the current stance
of monetary policy is appropriate. The output gap is estimated to be negative and the monetary
stance remains accommodative. Monetary policy should be gradually normalized once the output
gap is clearly on a closing path or if inflation starts to rise. The inflation targeting regime and
independence of the central bank have served Thailand well.
56.
The external sector of the Thai economy is strong and the currency is assessed as
being fairly valued. The staff’s assessment of Thailand’s external position and exchange rate uses a
number of approaches, including recent trends in the external accounts, medium-term balance of
payments projections, and quantitative models of the current account and real effective exchange
rate. The current level of the Thai baht is viewed as consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
57.
The authorities are encouraged to allow the exchange rate to continue to move
flexibly, in combination with other policies, to address the volatility of capital inflows. The
authorities should continue with their strategy of encouraging private sector hedging by allowing
two-way exchange rate flexibility, with foreign exchange interventions, if needed, limited to
preventing excessive volatility and overshooting.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

THAILAND

58.
The financial sector has benefited from the economy’s strong recovery in 2012, but
vulnerabilities are rising. Commercial banks weathered the global financial crisis well and have
used the improved economic environment to strengthen their balance sheets. However,
vulnerabilities have risen reflecting rapid credit growth to households by weakly regulated SFIs. In
addition, the changing landscape of the financial sector—including the expansion of nonbank
financial institutions—poses a growing risk from a regulatory perspective that should be addressed.
59.
While the authorities are aware of these vulnerabilities and are taking actions,
additional efforts are needed. Tightening prudential regulations on commercial banks to take
advantage of the business cycle and strengthening the management and enhancing the mandates
of SFIs are appropriate. However, the authorities should consider extending the current regulatory
and supervisory regime of commercial banks to all deposit-taking institutions.
60.
While Thailand’s record of economic development in recent decades has been
remarkable, the authorities’ goals of strengthening inclusive growth are appropriate. ASEAN
integration has the potential to bring about productivity gains derived from economies of scale.
Infrastructure projects are aimed at lowering logistics costs, while plans to strengthen vocational
training would target shortages of skilled labor. Strengthening inclusive growth may require
replacing generalized subsidies, in particular energy and the rice pledging scheme, with programs
targeted at vulnerable groups, thereby also strengthening market confidence in the public finances.
Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and continued skills upgrading of the labor force are critical to
sustaining growth in the medium and long term.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. First Car Tax Rebate Program
In September 2011, the Cabinet approved the excise tax rebate on selected purchases of passenger
vehicles, which proved to be very popular. To qualify, the buyer had to be at least 21 years old and not
already own a car, and the car had to be manufactured domestically and not exceed a certain price and size
limits. The rebate, which amounted to about 16 percent of the cost of the car (capped at 100,000 baht) is
given one year after the purchase of the car. The program lasted until end-2012 and included about
1.25 million orders, of which 850,000 vehicles had been delivered as of April 2013. In recent months, there
had been some cancellations by buyers who could not assure financing.
The program gave a major boost to production and consumption. Private consumption rose above
trend in 2012, with higher spending on automobiles apparently not crowding out other expenditure. On the
production side, the increased demand was accommodated by expanding capacity and by utilizing it fully
(with considerable overtime), while exports stayed roughly at pre-flood levels.

The key question is what will happen in the future. The auto makers plan to increase car production
further this year with the hope that the decline in domestic sales after the rebate scheme runs out will be
minor, while export markets will be able to absorb a 50 percent increase in Thailand’s car exports. However,
these expectations might prove too optimistic given the slowdown in domestic and external demand.

Box 2. Large-Scale Infrastructure Projects in Thailand
Thailand’s national development strategy aims at economic growth rates of 4–5 percent, sustained in
the long term. Supply side bottlenecks need to be overcome to achieve this target, and the government
intends to raise significantly the share of public investment in GDP. As an integral part of its strategy, the
government is embarking on a Logistics Infrastructure Development and Investment Plan for Thailand 2013–
2020 (Thailand 2020), with the aim of moving Thailand up the value chain, enhancing productivity, and take
advantage of integration into one of the most dynamic economic growth regions. In addition, the authorities
are also planning water management projects in response to the 2011 floods.



Thailand 2020
The plan focuses on transportation infrastructure, with a strong emphasis on rail networks which
account for 83 percent of the planned expenditures. Key projects include adding second rail tracks
to existing single tracks, building a high-speed train network between major cities, replacing equipment,
and significantly enlarging Bangkok’s mass rapid transit network (from today’s 80 kilometers to 464
kilometers by 2019). Other projects include new motorways, improvements in national highways and
rural road networks, water transportation and port developments, and better customs and border
facilities. The government estimates that these investments will reduce annual logistics costs by
2 percent of GDP, lower the energy bill by about 1 percent of GDP a year, and lead to lower transport
times, improved connectivity between Bangkok and the provinces, and boost cross-border trade,
thereby consolidating Thailand’s role as the region’s connectivity and logistics hub. It should also
contribute to sustainable development and raise living standards by reducing traffic congestion in the
metropolitan Bangkok area. The government is seeking Parliamentary authorization to borrow up to
2 trillion baht (16 percent of 2013 GDP) to finance the projects, implementing them over 7 years. While
Thailand’s public finances would allow full public financing, the government is also seeking private
participation through PPPs and infrastructure funds.



Water Management Projects
These projects aim to strengthen the economy’s resilience to floods and raise productivity in the
agriculture sector. The plan foresees the restoration of the forest and ecosystem; construction of roads;
restoration and efficiency improvements of flood prevention structures; management of water
reservoirs; floodways and flood diversion channels, and agriculture and urban development. An
Emergency Decree to authorize the government to borrow 350 billion baht (3 percent of 2013 GDP) for
these projects has been issued, However disbursements have been held up by legal disputes and only
about 7 percent of the allocated financial resources have so far been used.

Box 3. Infrastructure Financing—International Best Practices


Long-term contracts, such as the ones related to infrastructure, create budgetary
challenges that are typically not resolved by basic cash budgeting. The use of commitment
appropriations—in addition to spending appropriations—can address this problem, following
international best practices in budgeting for capital spending.



Under this budgetary process, which is used in France and Germany, the budget provides
two kinds of authorizations, spending appropriations and commitment appropriations.
Spending appropriations authorize government spending in the current year. Commitment
appropriations authorize the government to commit public resources for future years. If
authorization is required before the government enters into any long-term contract, the
parliament will be informed about, and have the power to limit the future implications of
investment decisions. The presence of commitment appropriations also draws attention to the
future costs of all long-term investment projects, including PPPs.

Box 4. Sectoral Distribution of Employment and Productivity
Thailand exhibits large differences in labor productivity across sectors. Real output per worker in
manufacturing (in constant 1988 prices) is much higher than the economy-wide average, while agricultural
productivity lags considerably behind. Moreover, labor productivity has been growing much faster in
manufacturing than in the rest of the economy over the last two decades. Differences are less dramatic when
movements in relative prices are taken into account, because the prices of agricultural products have been
growing much faster than those of manufactured goods since 2000. Still the ratio of manufacturing value
added per worker to that in agriculture has been in the range of 7 to 9 over the last ten years.

Despite the big differences, the movement of resources from low to high productivity sectors has
been limited. The share of workers employed in the agricultural sector has been broadly stable since 2004,
and the manufacturing share has declined by one percentage point. As a result, the increase in economywide productivity in the last eight years has been achieved exclusively through productivity growth within
individual sectors (primarily manufacturing). On the contrary, the reallocation of labor between sectors has
made a negative contribution (as the employment share of less productive sectors has increased).

Box 5. Changing Financial Landscape and Regulatory Challenges
The financial landscape is changing. The financial sector in Thailand is large, with assets near 261 percent
of GDP. Banks assets account for 129 percent of GDP, higher than in Indonesia and the Philippines.
A comparison between bank assets and financial sector assets to GDP ratios shows that growth in nonbank
financial assets has outpaced that of banking sector assets since 2008. A further comparison between the
share of credit by other depository corporations and other financial corporations further underpins the
growing role of other financial corporations, including credit card, leasing companies and personal finance
companies. Finally, the interconnectedness among financial institutions on both the domestic and external
fronts has been rising. For instance, other depository corporations have become net borrowers from other
financial corporations and from abroad since early 2008, with total liabilities amounting to about 6 percent
of GDP at end-2012.
The rapid evolution of the Thai financial sector is creating new challenges for the current regulatory
structure. A more comprehensive regulatory approach may be needed to address the challenges arising
from the changing financial landscape.

Regulatory gaps. The BOT holds no regulatory power over SFIs and nonbank financial institutions.
Responsibility for SFI regulation is with the MOF, which has delegated examination responsibility to the BOT,
and its recommendations are not binding. The legal subordination of the BOT to the MOF has the potential
to lead to interference or delays in taking needed regulatory or supervisory actions.

Information gaps. Both SFIs and nonbank financial institutions are subject to lax disclosure
requirements. The information published by SFIs is normally more aggregated and less timely than that of
commercial banks. The same is the case of credit cooperatives. In this context, there is a risk of regulatory
arbitrage, which requires the improvement of the regulatory and supervisory framework across different
types of financial institutions that accept deposits from the public.

share in 2011 partially reflects an extended data coverage on car leasing companies, credit card, and personal loans.

Appendix I. Crisis and Recovery in ASEAN-4
The trajectories of output in ASEAN-4 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand)
were similar before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), but diverged sharply in its aftermath. Indonesia
has accelerated relative to the pre-crisis trend; the Philippines has returned to the trend; and, in
Malaysia, a negative gap has opened with the trend. Thailand has not fared as well as its neighbors,
with output considerably below the trend and the gap widening. There are several reasons for this
divergence: (i) more open economies (Malaysia and Thailand) suffered larger trade shocks; (ii) countercyclical fiscal stimulus in Indonesia and the Philippines was larger and longer; (iii) idiosyncratic factors
have pushed output up in Indonesia and down in Thailand.
The four ASEAN neighbors were on similar trajectories before the GFC, but their paths
diverged dramatically in the aftermath of the crisis. The average annual growth rates for the four
economies from 2000 to 2007 were nearly identical at 5.0–5.1 percent. In contrast, post-2007
performance has varied widely reflecting

in 2012 real GDP in Indonesia was about
5 percent above the pre-crisis trend line, in the
100
Philippines 1 percent below, and in Malaysia
90
5 percent below. Thailand had the largest
80
output drop during the crisis and the slowest
70
growth after the crisis. Consequently, its real

GDP was 12 percent below trend in 2012—by

far the worst outcome among the group.
Explanations for this divergence fall into three broad categories. The first is the size of the
external shock that interacted with the countries’ characteristics. The second is the strength of policy
response. And the third group comprises various idiosyncratic factors.
The impact of the initial trade shock varied with the degree of openness. The declines in output
relative to the pre-crisis trend in each country’s trading partners (scaled by the countries’ export
shares to these partners) were nearly identical. This is not surprising since their export destinations
are broadly similar. However, when scaled by the ratio of exports to GDP for each economy, the
gaps become much smaller for less open economies. One can take these gaps as a proxy for the size
of the trade shock. With unitary elasticity of exports with respect to partner GDP and in the absence
of other influences and offsets, real GDP should have declined proportionately to the decline in
trading partners, with the coefficient of proportionality equal to the export ratio. Interestingly, in
Malaysia and the Philippines the domestic GDP gap is quite close to that in trading partners scaled
by the degree of export dependence. On the other hand, Indonesia has clearly done much better
and Thailand considerably worse than what one would expect based on the size of the trade shocks.

Hence, the degree of trade openness is an important, but only partial explanation of cross-country
differences in post-crisis performance.6

Monetary, financial, and exchange rate policies were broadly similar. In the early stages of the
crisis the shock was largely financial. Capital outflows put pressure on the exchange rates. The
authorities allowed considerable depreciation, particularly large in Indonesia and the Philippines. At
the same time, they leaned against the wind, intervening in foreign exchange markets and raising
policy rates. Malaysia was the only country that did not raise the policy rate in 2008, but it spent the
most reserves. As financial pressures subsided and the demand shock (both external and domestic)
became the main concern, the policy rates were lowered significantly in all four countries in
late 2009 and early 2010, all moving to historically low levels. The difference from the pre-crisis rate
was the largest in Indonesia and Thailand, while Malaysia had the least easing and was the first to
start normalizing rates. All countries except Thailand took a variety of steps to maintain liquidity
provision (e.g., by lowering reserve requirements; Indonesia and the Philippines also undertook
foreign exchange liquidity injections). All four supported their financial systems (e.g., via increases in
deposit insurance limits). It is difficult to compare the magnitude of these measures across countries.

It could also be noted that the financial account shock—measured as the decline or reversal in portfolio inflows—
was the largest in Malaysia and the longest-lasting in the Philippines. Indonesia experienced the smallest decline, and
on an annual basis the inflows remained positive.

It does appear, however, that Indonesia provided the most support to exporters via depreciation
and was the most aggressive in both conventional and unconventional monetary easing, but these
outcomes reflect not only policy choices, but also exogenous pressures.
Fiscal policy reaction differed considerably among the four countries. Initially they all
responded with a significant loosening of the fiscal stance, as measured by the decline in the ratio of
the cyclically adjusted general government primary balance to potential GDP in 2009. On that
measure, the fiscal impulse ranged from 1.2 percentage points in Malaysia to 1.9 percentage points
in Indonesia. However, Thailand and particularly

In addition to the real and financial shocks associated with the global financial crisis the
ASEAN countries were subject to various other external and domestic influences. Indonesia
and Thailand present particular interest in view of the fact that their output trajectories deviate the
most from what could be attributed to the crisis.

Part of the increase in the deficit in 2009 and the decrease in 2010 was due to commodity price movements, but

Thailand. A considerable part of that surge was foreign investment in the commodity sector
(prompted, of course, by buoyant prices in addition to an improved business environment),
which slowed but did not stop during the crisis.

In Thailand, on the other hand, investment growth slowed after 2005. More broadly, while the
other three countries were accelerating right before the crisis hit, with output about one percent
above trend in 2007, Thailand was already slowing. Even though the reasons are difficult to
pinpoint exactly, political uncertainty and, at times, turmoil that took a toll on private sector
confidence is likely among them. In addition, in 2011 Thailand suffered from two major shocks
that delayed its recovery further. In the first half of the year Japan was broadsided by a
devastating earthquake and tsunami. Among Japan’s trading partners, Thailand was affected
disproportionately because of the integration of its auto industry with that of Japan. And, in the
second half of the year, Thailand itself was hit by its worst floods in half a century, lasting for
nearly half a year, resulting in major destruction of life and property, and bringing production to
a halt in many parts of the country.

Appendix III. Estimating the Output Gap
Using a variety of univariate and multivariate approaches, we estimate that the output gap was around
-1½ percent in the second quarter of 2013. This negative number likely overstates somewhat the cyclical
weakness of the economy since the slowdown was exacerbated by several one-off factors.

as well as in the late 2011 flood period.

2009

A variety of techniques can be used to assess the cyclical state of the economy. Common
methodologies for estimating the output gap fall into two broad categories. The first consists of
univariate filters, which extract trend behavior from the GDP series. The traditional Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter and two frequency filters are used in this analysis. The second group comprises multivariate models,
which postulate a relationship between the output gap and a number of observable variables based on
economic theory.

Various frequency filters have recently gained popularity. They have been developed to isolate the
business cycle, which they do by cutting off very long-term and very short-term movements in output. In
other words, they filter out not only trends, but also noise. The resulting series is smooth and may serve
as a better representation of underlying processes that monetary policy should pay attention to. On the
other hand, the residual is quite noisy and should not be equated with trend. In the case of Thailand, two
popular filters are applied—Baxter-King (BK) and Christiano-Fitzgerald (CF),9 with the standard choice of
the typical length of the business cycle from 6 to 32 quarters. As with the HP filter, data is complemented
with staff projections.10

9

A symmetric version of the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter is used.

10

This is essential because these methods cannot yield estimates at or near the end of the sample.

Over past years, the estimates produced by
different univariate filters move broadly
together, but considerable disparities
emerge at times. The BF and HP gaps tend to
move closely together, except the latter is
noisier. Large differences between them arise
only during very sharp movements in output
that are reversed quickly, which the BK filter
smoothes over. This is particularly salient during
the end-2011 floods.11 Most of the time the CF
filter produces numbers similar to those coming
from the BK filter.

Sources: IMF, World Economic Outlook; and IMF staff calculations.

Multivariate filters (MVF) allow the incorporation of additional information. They treat potential
output and the output gap as latent variables that have certain relationships with observables. One of
those observables is real GDP, but the set can also include inflation, unemployment, capacity utilization,
and other variables. For example, the output gap affects inflation via a Phillips curve and is linked to the
unemployment rate via Okun’s Law. The postulated relationships need to be estimated. The framework
admits considerable flexibility in the specification of the underlying model.
A filter developed at the IMF and used widely by country desks is applied to Thailand.12 It uses
quarterly observations on seasonally adjusted real GDP, core inflation (quarter-on-quarter), the
unemployment rate and the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing. The parameters are estimated
using Bayesian techniques. Given that the Thai economy underwent considerable structural
transformation (including the introduction of inflation targeting) after the Asian crisis, the estimation
period runs from 2000Q1 to 2013Q2.
The multivariate filter yields output gap
estimates close to those obtained with the
HP filter. The only significant, sustained
divergence arose in the mid-2000s, with the
MVF gap on average one percentage point
higher than the HP gap between 2004
and 2006, probably reflecting the rising inflation
rate in that period.

In that period the economy was hit by a large, temporary supply shock, affecting primarily 2011Q4. While it is

common to associate a negative output gap with excess capacity, clearly one should not interpret the late-2011
episode as a period of deficient demand.

approaches. The HP filter separates short-term
movements in output from long-term trends. Hence, most of the sharp increases (as in 2012Q4) or
decreases (as in 2013Q1) in GDP will show in changes in the output gap rather than potential GDP. On
the other hand, frequency filters see through short-term volatility. For them, the upswing in 2012Q4 and
the downswing in 2013Q1 were too abrupt to be associated with the business cycle, so they treat these
movements to a large extent as reversible noise. Finally, for the MVF the output gap is a latent variable
that affects not only output, but also inflation, unemployment, and capacity utilization. A fairly low
unemployment rate and high capacity utilization in the most recent quarters may have pulled up the
estimates of the output gap, although tame inflation should have worked in the opposite direction.13
HP filter is used for the numerical estimate of the output gap, but information obtained through
other approaches is also considered. It is a simple, robust method that has been widely used for many
years. Unlike frequency filters, it produces a smooth trend and allocates noise to the cycle, supporting the
interpretation of the trend as potential output and deviation from trend as the output gap. The MVF
might not be robust to changes in the structure of the economy, in model specification, or in priors on
parameter values. It is also subject to the end-of-sample problem, which is particularly relevant given our
focus on the current situation. Hence, the point estimate for the output gap is obtained from the HP
filter, yielding the output gap of -1.6 percent in 2013Q2. At the same time, the frequency filters suggest
that the economy’s cyclical position was somewhat stronger that this number implies and that output
was likely pushed down by temporary factors.

13

The fact that the MVF sample only covered data through 2013Q2 while the HP filter was run on numbers that
included near-term projections may also account for the differences between them near the end of the data sample.

Appendix IV. Potential Growth
Potential growth has slowed from close to 5 percent in the mid-2000s to about 3 percent in recent
years, primarily because of a decline in TFP growth. Going forward, strong investment and more
efficient use of resources should allow potential growth to rebound to about 4¾ percent. Even faster
growth is within reach if private capital accumulation, infrastructure development, education and
training, and the reallocation of resources to more productive uses accelerate.
The production function approach is used to analyze past performance and project future
growth. This approach allows one to decompose past trend and cyclical movements in real GDP
into trend and cyclical movements of factors of production. It also helps make projections of
potential growth building on available forecasts of employment, human capital development,
investment, and productivity growth.
A production function combines three fundamental factors of production—physical capital,
raw labor, and human capital—as well as technology. The production function approach is built
on the following equation (assuming Cobb-Douglas technology):

Y  AK   HL 

1

where Y is real GDP, K is the stock of physical capital, L is employment, H is an index of human
capital, and A is total factor productivity (TFP). H and L are combined to form a human-capital
augmented labor index. Ideally, capital input should be measured via capital services rather than
capital stock, but the former number is not available for Thailand. Hence a standard assumption is
made that capital services are proportional to capital stock. The parameter α is a technology
parameter. Under certain conditions—including perfect competition in factor markets—it also
represents the capital share in the national income. Given that the assumption of perfect
competition is unlikely to apply, a standard value of 0.33 is used.
We use the following data (all series are annual, starting in 1980 and ending in 2012):


Output. Real GDP at constant 1988 prices from the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB).



Capital. Net capital stock at constant 1988 prices, for the total economy, from NESDB, 19802011. For 2012, it is calculated based on gross investment for 2012 and a depreciation rate
of 5.7 percent (in line with latest depreciation figures). Capital stock data pertain to year-end.
Year-average stock is approximated by the average of adjacent end-year figures



Labor. Total employment (annual average) from the National Statistical Office.



Human capital. The estimate of H is based on the Barro and Lee dataset on educational
attainment, converted into an index using Mincerian coefficients. Data are available at 5-year
frequency, with the latest in 2010. For other years, linear interpolation (before 2010) or
extrapolation (after 2010) is used.



Total factor productivity. It is computed using the Cobb-Douglas formula, where A is the only
unknown. Given that it is calculated as a residual, this number will pick up any fluctuations in
real GDP not explained by changes in factors of production.

The HP filter is used to estimate trends in real GDP and production function components. The
smoothing parameter is set to 6.25 since for annual series this value is compatible with the standard
parameter of 1600 in quarterly series employed in the filtering approaches (Appendix III). The figure
below shows the growth rates of real GDP and its components as well as their trends.
Trend growth rates have undergone considerable changes over time. Growth accelerated
dramatically in the late 1980s as Thailand joined the ranks of Asian “tigers.” After the Asian financial
crisis there was a dramatic decline in the growth rate of physical capital, a noticeable one in the
growth rate of TFP, and some drop in employment growth.
Over the last decade, changes in TFP growth explain most of the variability in potential
growth. Employment growth has been slowing gradually in line with changing demographics, while
capital stock growth has been broadly stable during last five years after accelerating through the
mid-2000s. Thus most of the ups and downs in output growth are accounted for by TFP. Of course,
measured productivity could have declined because the intensity of factor use went down. Indeed,
the rate of capacity utilization dropped dramatically at the onset of the global financial crisis and
also during the floods. The number of hours worked per employee most likely fell as well as in line

with experiences in most other countries, but there is no direct evidence of that. In addition, some
workers may have moved into less productive occupations (such as unpaid family work or selfemployment). And the bulk of those who actually lost their jobs could be migrants not picked up by
labor statistics.
The latest trend numbers for production
function components paint a fairly bleak
picture. In particular, trend capital
accumulation is near the lowest level in 30
years with the exception of the aftermath of
the Asian financial crisis. TFP growth is
rebounding from stalling during the global
financial crisis, but is still very low from a
historical perspective. As a result, trend GDP
growth registered a lackluster 3.2 percent
in 2012.

However, there are reasons to expect stronger growth of production potential going forward.
Granted, one cannot anticipate a bigger contribution from the labor side—the employment rate is
already very high, and population growth is slowing.14 Also, the education level cannot be increased
dramatically over several years. On the other hand, there are reasons to expect stronger
contributions from physical investment and from TFP.
Physical capital contribution should increase. Gross fixed investment has been highly volatile in
Thailand, with periods of optimism punctuated by episodes of political instability, external shocks,
and natural disasters. Going forward, investment is projected to grow robustly, yielding the growth
rates of fixed capital at around 4½ percent, which would contribute about 1½ percentage points per
year to GDP growth—considerably higher than the estimated trend. Should investment plans be
scaled up, physical capital will grow even more.
TFP growth should also be higher than what the HP filter suggests, although it is hard to tell
how much higher. The filter has a well-known end-of-sample problem, and the trend estimate has
been influenced by a series of negative shocks in the last few years. One can hope that TFP growth
could bounce back to the rates close to 2 percent that prevailed in a few years before the onset of
the global financial crisis, particularly given that TFP and physical capital growth rates tend to be
positively correlated, although a somewhat lower rate is probably more realistic.
Potential growth could be close to 5 percent in the future. Combining the contributions of
capital (1½ p.p.) and human-capital augmented labor (1½ p.p.) with TFP growth of 1¾ percent
yields a potential growth estimate of 4¾ percent. With more investment and somewhat higher TFP
growth, even rates above 5 percent are within reach. Key to reaching higher potential growth are
increasing private and public investment, enhancing human capital, and faster reallocation of
resources toward more productive sectors of the economy (see Box 4).
14

Migration from neighboring countries could boost the labor supply.

Amid the global liquidity expansion and
asset reallocation, capital flows surged
despite much volatility. Capital flows first
peaked in 2006–07 before the global financial
crisis, then experienced a sharp slump
during 2007–08, and resumed since the
second and third quarters of 2009. The flows
consisted primarily of portfolio investment
and cross-border bank flows.

Asset reallocation by real money holders
may also contribute to capital flows. A
1 percentage point reallocation of global
equity and debt securities held by G4 real
money investors, which amounts to about
$57 trillion, would result in additional portfolio
flows to EM of $570 billion. This would be
larger than the record annual portfolio flows
to emerging markets of $424 billion recorded
in 2007. Countries receiving a larger share of
these flows relative to the size of their markets
could face significant challenges, although the
potential pressure would be mitigated by the
likely gradual nature of such a portfolio
reallocation.

Global Liquidity Expansion

2003Q3

Thailand saw a surge in capital inflows
since 2012 amid global liquidity expansion
and asset reallocation by investors. The
global liquidity cycle started in 2003 and
accelerated from the second half of 2007
when country authorities began to undertake
unprecedented liquidity-easing measures to
mitigate the effects of the crisis. The
aggregated money supply and reserve money
in the G4 in 2013Q1 amounted to
US$35 trillion and 10 trillion, respectively. The
abundant global liquidity underpins capital
inflows to emerging economies.

Against the background of increasing
capital flows across the world, capital flows
to Asia have surged since 2010, following
two previous episodes in the early 1990s and
the early 2000s respectively. In the current
episode, capital flows in 2012–13 have
surpassed previous peaks.

would be larger than the record

Compared with other waves of inflows, the current episode is characterized by a
predominance of volatile portfolio inflows. The shift toward portfolio flows could be
structural in nature and imply continued volatility. During 2005-12, portfolio inflows
accounted on average for almost 25 percent of total net inflows, and net direct investment is
still the major component of capital inflows, accounting for nearly 55 percent. However,
in 2012, net portfolio inflows and other investments accounted for 43 percent and
106 percent, respectively, more than offsetting net FDI outflows (-49 percent of net inflows).

Net capital inflows to Thailand amounted to about US$ 10 billion in 2012, accounting for
2.8 percent of GDP. The net capital inflows to Thailand during 2005-12 amounted to US$

Appendix VI. Thailand––Public and External Debt
Sustainability
A.

Public Debt Sustainability

Thailand’s public debt has started to rise again in FY2012. Since the early 2000s, it has been on a
downward trend in percent of GDP except for a sharp increase in FY2009, but the trend reversed in
FY2012 and is expected to continue in FY2013 and beyond under the current policies. Low GDP
growth, lower government revenue from fuel excise tax cut, as well as additional borrowing for water
management projects and government guarantee for SOE borrowing to implement the rice price
guarantee scheme have pushed up the public debt in FY2012. Announced revenue policy (CIT cut,
tax incentive for first-time car buyers) will further reduce government revenue in FY2013, and current
expenditure will stay at around the level of FY2012. While some measures to improve fiscal balance
are proposed in the FY2014 budget (increases in fuel, alcohol, and tobacco excise tax, reduction in
the Village Fund spending, and containment of medical costs for government employees), the saving
from these measures are not enough to stabilize the public debt trajectory. Under these
assumptions, the public debt path would be on upward trend, with the ratio to GDP reaching
52 percent at the end of projection period. Within the overall public debt, direct government debt
would increase by 4 percentage points from FY2013 to FY2018, while the public enterprise debt
would increase by 1 percentage point during the same period.
This profile is relatively resilient to interest rate shocks and exchange rate shocks. With the
stable interest rates in the past and very little debt owed externally, shocks to interest and exchange
rates make only modest differences to the medium-term forecast.
A more sizable impact would come from shocks to the primary balance, or a combination
shock. If the primary balance records an average deficit of 3½ percent of GDP over the forecast
horizon, instead of averaging 2½ percent as assumed, then by 2018 the debt/GDP ratio would be
6 percentage points higher than in the baseline. A combined shock, in which the real interest rate,
growth rate, and primary balance are permanently worse than under the baseline by one quarter
standard deviation, would also increase the debt/GDP ratio by 6 percentage points.
A contingent liabilities shock would generate a large deviation from the baseline. That is, if
10 percent of GDP in contingent liabilities are brought on budget in 2014, then even by 2018 the
debt-to-GDP ratio would still remain 9 percentage points higher than in the baseline.
The most significant risk to the debt outlook comes from a potential slowdown in growth.
Under the baseline scenario, growth is forecast to average around 5 percent over the medium term,
higher than the historical average by 1 percent. But if growth proved lower than assumed by onehalf a standard deviation, then the growth rate would average just 3 percent as the standard
deviation of growth in Thailand is relatively high. This, in turn, would push up the debt/GDP ratio by
12 percentage points.
These scenarios suggest proactive actions are needed for Thailand’s public debt path to be
sustainable and resilient to shocks.

B.

External Debt Sustainability

Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain low and stable over the medium term. External
debt amounted to $133 billion at the end of 2012 (36.4 percent of GDP), up by $29 billion
from the previous year. The increase over 2012 came from short-term borrowing by other depository
corporations. Short-term debt outstanding increased, while long-term debt also rose marginally.
Going forward, Thailand’s external debt is expected to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than
national income, thus declining from 36.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to 34.1 percent by 2018.
External debt trajectories appear broadly stable under macroeconomic shocks based on
historical levels. The shock levels in the stress tests are based on 10-year historical standard
deviations, and thus represent “plausible,” rather than “extraordinary” permanent shocks (see
Figure A2 for the shock values). Under such plausible scenarios, a slowdown in the economic growth
rate or a rise in the external interest rate does not cause a large deviation in the external debt
outlook for Thailand. A permanent one-half standard deviation shock to the non-interest current
account balance has a relatively larger impact, raising external debt by 11 percentage points above
the baseline by 2018 to 34 percent of GDP. Similarly, a combination of shocks such that the external
interest rate, the non-interest current account balance, and economic growth all deviate from the
baseline by a one-quarter standard deviation; external debt would rise by 6 percentage points from
the baseline by the end of the medium term to 30 percent of GDP.
A large depreciation of the real exchange rate would have a larger impact on external debt. A
real depreciation of 30 percent in 2013, which is equivalent to about a 32 percent nominal
depreciation, would simultaneously raise the debt ratio by about 20 percentage points. However, this
analysis excludes the adjustment that trade flows would have if such a depreciation were to occur,
such as a sharp improvement in the current account that would––after the initial rise––bring the debt
ratio back down significantly over the medium term.
Overall, Thailand’s external debt remains stable under all reasonable stress scenarios.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
After more than a decade when the baht was effectively pegged closely to the U.S. dollar through a
basket of currencies, the exchange rate regime was changed on July 2, 1997. Both the de jure and de
facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating.
Last Article IV Consultation:
At the conclusion of the 2012 Article IV consultations, Executive Directors observed that Thailand
has made a remarkable comeback from the effects of the global crisis and the supply disruption
from the natural disaster in Japan. They welcomed the authorities’ forceful policy response that
enabled a sharp rebound in the economy at the first quarter of 2012. They discussed the challenges
in securing the recovery from the flood, enhancing macroeconomic stability despite the elevated
external risks. They supported the government’s plan to gradually scale back the fiscal. Directors
noted that, with the economy recovering rapidly, capital inflows could complicate policymaking.
They broadly agreed that, in such circumstances, the exchange rate should be allowed to serve as a
buffer. For the medium term, Directors supported the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda aimed at
strengthening infrastructure and developing the financial sector to help restore economic dynamism
and raise growth potential. At the same time, they called for swift action to mitigate risks from
government-owned specialized financial institutions by improving their risk assessment standards,
strengthening supervision, defining their role more clearly and subjected them to the same levy as
commercial banks.
Recent Technical Assistance:
STA: A TA mission on national account statistics took place in October 2012, a TA mission on
government finance statistics in December 2012 and a TA mission on consumer/producer prices in
November 2012.
FAD: A mission on tax administration as part of public financial management took place in April
2013.
LEG: Several LEG missions took place during 2012–13 to produce a national AML/CFT strategy for
Thailand, as part of a three- to five-year strategic partnership to improve Thailand’s AML/CFT
regime.
MCM: A mission on monetary and foreign exchange policy took place in February – March 2013 and
a mission on financial stability analysis including stress testing and early warning system back to
back with macro prudential workshop took place in April 2013.

1/ Includes private sector loans.

Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, Thailand has received about
$6.41 billion for 93 loans as of the end of June 2013 (see table) Thailand did not borrow from
ADB for almost a decade following the Asian financial crisis. However, Thailand resumed
borrowing from ADB in 2009 for the GMS Highway Expansion Project, and in 2010 for the
Capital Markets Development Program. An investment grant was provided in response to the
2011 floods. ADB’s active technical assistance (TA) portfolio comprises 9 projects totaling
$6.9 million, mainly in the areas of transport development, capital markets development and
access to finance, and water resources management.1
ADB’s partnership with Thailand—as reflected in the country partnership strategy (CPS), 2007–11—
focuses on knowledge support, advisory services and institutional strengthening for more inclusive
economic growth, improving infrastructure, promoting private and financial sector development,
strengthening environmental management, and enhancing regional cooperation. A large and
growing part of ADB’s work concerns nonsovereign operations, and the promotion of public–private
partnerships (PPPs). ADB is preparing a new country partnership strategy for Thailand, 2013–16.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities have continued to
improve the quality and coverage of data, but dissemination of additional data would enhance the
basis for macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the fiscal sector.
National accounts: The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) compiles
annual and quarterly GDP estimates using both the production and expenditure approaches. The
annual GDP volume measures are derived at previous year’s prices and as chain-linked indices with
2002 as the reference year. Quarterly national accounts estimates are still compiled using a fixed
base year (1998). The NESDB plans to introduce new quarterly GDP current price and chain-linked
volume estimates in 2013.
Price statistics: The Bureau of Trade and Economic Indexes (BTEI) compiles and disseminates a
monthly consumer price index with weights based on expenditure data collected from households
during the 2011 Socio-Economic Survey. Index coverage is restricted to middle-income urban
households only. In addition to the headline CPI, the BTEI publishes aggregate indexes for the
low-income and rural populations.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). Data are contributed to both the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics. However, general
government fiscal data are only provided annually and more timely publication is desirable. In
addition, GFSM 2001-based data are not available for the state enterprises, so the public sector
balance is imperfectly calculated in GFSM 2001-basis. Given the growing importance of state
enterprises having timely data on their operations is desirable for more effective surveillance.
General government debt, including an amortization schedule, is not available either, and is
desirable for more effective surveillance.
Monetary statistics: The authorities submit the Standardized Reporting Forms (SRFs) for
monetary statistics on a timely basis.
Balance of payments: The authorities started publishing balance of payments statistics under
BPM6 in September 2011. The historical data goes back to 2005, and a longer historical time series
is desirable for analysis. The methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains
adequate, but errors and omissions ranging from 0.2 percent of GDP to -1.4 percent of GDP, both
under BPM5 and BPM6, point to weaknesses in data collection. IIP data are collected quarterly and
publicly available only on an annual basis. The last observation available is 2012. Data on external
debt and debt service have significantly improved since the introduction of a quarterly survey of
private nonbank external debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Thailand
On September 20, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Thailand.1
In 2012, Thailand’s economy rebounded strongly from the devastating floods, with real GDP
growing by 6.5 percent. Private consumption rose 6.7 percent, reflecting pent-up demand and
government measures, including the rice pledging scheme, where the government committed to
buying rice from farmers at a set price above the prevailing market price, and the first-car buyer
scheme. On the back of reconstruction spending, private investment grew by 14.4 percent, while
government spending and inventory accumulation also made a significant contribution to growth.
However, growth slowed significantly in early 2013. The expiration of the first-car buyer scheme
appears to have had a larger-than-expected impact on private consumption, while exports were
adversely affected by a slowdown in external demand. Real GDP was reported to have declined
1.7 percent (seasonally adjusted, not annualized) in the first quarter of 2013 from the previous
quarter, and another 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
The external environment remains challenging and domestic tailwinds are weakening. Credit
growth remains strong, but has decelerated in recent months. The stock market rally has fizzled
since May, even as housing price growth continues. Business sentiment remains robust while
consumer confidence has weakened. In this context, real GDP growth is projected to slow
down to 3.0–3.5 percent in 2013. Next year, public investment projects are expected to become
a key engine of growth, boosting growth to 5.2 percent. With growth driven by domestic
demand, the current account surplus is expected to reach a small deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2014.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, dominated by external factors. External risks
deriving from an escalation of the euro area crisis or fiscal policy shocks in the United States
have diminished, but are still skewed to the downside. Slower-than-expected growth in major
emerging economies, particularly China, would also have a considerable impact because of trade
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

linkages. The unwinding of monetary policy stimulus in the United States may trigger further
capital flow reversal from emerging markets. Domestically, the impact of the unwinding of
various government policies on private consumption may be larger than anticipated. Finally,
political stability has strengthened, but remains a downside risk.
The government is seeking to diversify the drivers of economic growth. The authorities have
pursued redistribution policies to boost domestic consumption, while attempting to maintain the
dynamism of the export sector. They have also prepared an ambitious infrastructure program to
lower logistics costs and further integration in the Mekong Region and with southern China, as
well as to boost the economy’s resilience to floods.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Director noted that skillful macroeconomic management, as well as the strong
fundamentals of the Thai economy—including low inflation, healthy balance sheets of
commercial banks and corporations, high international reserves, and a moderate level of public
debt—have blunted the impact of recent severe shocks and are underpinning a recovery. Against
this background, Directors concurred that the current stance of fiscal and monetary policies
remains broadly appropriate. Looking ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere in
their efforts to rebuild fiscal buffers, strengthen financial stability, and promote more inclusive
growth.
Directors considered that a gradual return to fiscal consolidation will broaden the room for policy
maneuver over the medium term and create space for priority spending. They noted, however,
that the achievement of the authorities’ targets may require additional measures and would
benefit from a stronger medium-term fiscal framework. Against this background, Directors
supported expanding investment in infrastructure and education, and replacing generalized
subsidies with targeted income support for vulnerable groups.
Directors considered that the currently accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate.
Nonetheless, they encouraged the authorities to stand ready to normalize the policy stance if
inflationary pressures re-emerge. Directors also observed that capital flow volatility has
presented challenges to macroeconomic management. They agreed that Thailand’s strong
international reserve position, together with exchange rate flexibility and macroprudential and
capital flow measures as appropriate, will help address such volatility going forward.
Directors welcomed the progress in developing the non-bank financial sector, which should
boost financial inclusion and facilitate investment. They also agreed that policy actions to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for non-bank and specialized financial
institutions are essential to safeguard the soundness of the financial system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ aim to promote more inclusive growth. Highlighting the
need to enhance labor productivity, they endorsed plans to boost workers’ skills to address skills
mismatches and labor shortages. They also supported plans to expand infrastructure to lower
transportation costs, promote commerce, and boost long-term growth.

Statement by Mr. Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Thailand
and Ms. Nithiwadee Soontornpoch, Advisor to Executive Director
September 20, 2013
1.
On behalf of the Thai authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to staff
for the 2013 Article IV Consultation. This year’s discussion focused on various policy
approaches to support economic growth, and various measures to secure a sustained recovery
back to growth potential. Nonetheless, there have been several developments since the
mission concluded, and thus, we would like to provide the Board a summary of the
authorities’ view on recent economic developments as well as our responses to the staff
assessment, additional information of the Thai economy and the various challenges.
Updates on the Thai Economy and Near-Term Outlook
2.
The authorities echo the staff’s assessment on the resilience of Thai economy in the
last few years despite being exposed to various shocks including global financial crisis
(GFC), supply disruption from natural disaster in Japan and the historical flood of the
country in 2011. The government has successfully adjusted its macroeconomic policies to
focus on stimulating domestic demand while at the same time supporting exports. As a result,
the Thai economy recorded a sharp recovery in 2012 with real GDP growth at 6.5 percent.
3.
Nevertheless, the Thai economy in the first half of 2013 decelerated from the latter
half of the previous year. Sources of the slowdown can be traced to various temporal factors;
the expiration of fiscal stimulus packages, and the slower-than-expected export growth
together with some supply-side constraints. In this light, the upcoming official growth
forecasts for the year are likely to be adjusted in accordance with these developments.
4.
Growth in the second half of 2013, however, is expected to gradually recover on the
back of exports in tandem with the positive trajectory of G3 economies and improved private
sector sentiments from greater clarity in the government’s large-scale investment plans. This
infrastructure spending would not only provide an additional boost to the recovery, but also
induce the crowding-in of private investments. Additionally, these key drivers will continue
to be underpinned by accommodative financial conditions as well as favorable employment
conditions and income of non-agricultural sectors.
5.
That being said, the authorities are especially mindful of several downside risks to
Thailand’s economic outlook. These include (i) the supply constraints in some industries that
may hinder exporters’ competitiveness and limit Thailand’s ability to reap the full benefit of
the ongoing global recovery, (ii) the delayed implementation of government infrastructure
projects, and (iii) the increasing household debt that may dampen private consumption. The
authorities will continue to closely monitor these risks and remain vigilant to take necessary
actions where appropriate.
6.
While my authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment on the set of risk factors to
the economy, they have a slightly more optimistic view on the prospect of the government’s
infrastructure investment plans that could support the growth momentum going forward.

Given such differences in the underlying assumptions, downward revision of official growth
figures for 2013 may differ from the staff’s latest projection.
Monetary Policy
7.
With regard to monetary policy, my authorities share the staff’s view that the current
accommodative stance is appropriate and supportive of a stable growth path. The interest rate
cut in May 2013 was intended to cushion against downside risks of domestic demand as both
inflation and inflation expectations remain subdued and well-anchored, with core inflation
projected to remain close to the lower bound of the target range of 0.5 to 3.0 percent
throughout 2013. This condition allows monetary policy to be able to complement fiscal
policies in supporting domestic spending and safeguarding growth, while at the same time
maintaining price and financial stability.
8.
Given the current growth momentum, the policy path towards normalization could be
less steep. Any change in policy stance would have to be state-contingent and warranted by
an optimal balance between the policy’s effectiveness and cost of financial instability as well
as the need to maintain policy space for future uncertainties.
Capital Flows and Exchange Rate Policy
9.
Thailand continues to witness volatile capital flows with several periods of large
influx and rapid outflows from portfolio investment. The recent episode of capital flow
reversals could be attributed to a temporary reaction to the uncertainties surrounding the
Fed’s QE tapering. As a result, Thailand’s portfolio investment has turned from net inflows
with large influx during the first quarter of 2013, to net outflows at the end of August.
10.
The excessive exchange rate volatilities were caused by sharp swings in global
financial market sentiment despite sound economic fundamentals. Although the appreciation
trend of the Thai baht was in line with the economic fundamental and would actually
encourage local businesses to adjust, excessive short-term fluctuation could threaten
businesses’ viability and complicate policy decision. Although corrections in the market have
generally been observed, the risk of temporary disorderly movements in the future caused by
global uncertainties cannot be ruled out and may prompt the authorities to respond as
necessary.
11.
During the period of large capital inflows, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has managed
market volatilities by deploying various measures, mainly through exchange rate flexibility
as well as verbal and limited actual interventions. At this current juncture however, the
authorities’ attention has shifted to containing the adverse impacts of potentially sharp capital
reversals. The stock of international reserves, which currently stands at 168.8 billion USD1,
would serve as an important buffer. This, in combination with sound economic fundamentals
and flexibility in the authorities’ policy framework, would help to cushion the economy from
adverse external shocks.

Fiscal Policy
12.
For fiscal policy, the key message shared by both the authorities and staff is that the
large-scale public investment projects are key to unlock supply constraints and shore up
confidence. These projects have shifted the focus of earlier consumption-led initiatives
towards longer-term investments. The multi-year investment expenditure of
2 trillion baht, almost 20 percent of GDP, in infrastructure projects would not only play an
important role in supporting domestic demand in the next seven years, but also crowd-in
private investments which would elevate the economy’s growth path in the long run.
13.
The authorities are also mindful of the potential build-up of public debt from the
large-scale infrastructure investments in addition to other possible fiscal measures down the
road. The authorities recognize the importance of fiscal discipline and the need to preserve
fiscal space for economic uncertainties in the period ahead. On this note, the fiscal agencies
aim to achieve a balanced budget by Fiscal Year 2017 and maintain public debt at a level not
exceeding 50 percent of GDP.
14.
In this regard, the efficiency of revenue collection and expenditure measures has been
prioritized. On expenditure, the authorities have been more conservative in their formulation
and implementation of fiscal measures as exemplified by the gradual removal of energy
subsidies. Fiscal spending would also be shifted towards specific sectors, such as social
security and public health programmes, to better target individuals in need. For the rice
pledging scheme, the authorities are carefully reviewing its operational design. The latest
development was to cap the maximum value of rice pledged by each household to help limit
fiscal costs. Meanwhile, a tax reform, which includes a plan to expand the tax base and the
recent revision of personal income tax structure, would broaden the coverage of tax payers in
the long run.
15.
In conjunction with the recent slowdown, the government has recently announced an
additional policy package to help boost private sector confidence. With long-run fiscal
sustainability in mind, the package therefore contains mostly measures aimed at facilitating
investments such as tax incentives for the tourism industry as well as measures to support
investment in agricultural product processing and eco-car industries.
Financial Sector
16.
Regarding the financial sector, my authorities share staff’s continued concerns over
the potential risks emanating from SFIs especially given their growing importance in
domestic financing. The current institutional arrangement allows the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) and the BOT to concertedly address the issue by stepping up the supervision of these
institutions. The MOF has been on track in steering SFIs’ operation to serve their intended
objectives and improve their corporate governance and accounting standards. Nonetheless,
the authorities see the need to appropriately pace the strengthening of prudential regulations
and supervisions of SFIs in order to retain their ability to operate as the government’s arm in
promoting financial access and growth inclusiveness.
17.
The authorities also acknowledge staff’s concern on the increase in
interconnectedness of nonbank financial institutions, especially credit cooperatives, to the

financial sector. Despite their moderate share in the total assets of the financial system, the
authorities and their respective supervisory bodies are watchful on potential risks stemming
from these institutions. The process has been underway for the relevant authorities to
enhance their overall regulatory standard and risk management.
18.
In terms of toolkit for addressing financial stability concerns, the BOT has previously
made use of prudential measures ranging from LTV to debt service ratios and the tightening
of credit underwriting standards. Recently, the BOT has also initiated a targeted examination
on housing loans and has used moral suasion to encourage more cautious lending behavior by
commercial banks. The authorities acknowledge the staff’s position on the potential merits of
levies on foreign borrowing as an additional liquidity buffer against sudden withdrawals.
However, its practical benefits are limited in the context of Thailand as the share of foreign
borrowings constitutes a mere 8.8 percent of commercial banks’ total liabilities and its use
may impair investors’ confidence in the long run.
Policies for Promoting Potential Growth and Income Distribution
19.
The authorities view that the structural reform policies underway will play a pivotal
role to overcome the country’s middle income trap. Significant progress has been made in the
large-scale investment plans to uplift the country’s potential growth through enhanced trade
linkages and logistics upgrades. In addition, the authorities are in the process of redesigning
the generalized subsidy schemes to better serve specific target groups and lessen the degree
of price distortion in the market.
20.
The authorities appreciate staff’s commitment to further investigate the ongoing
issues in the Thai labor market, and share the view that labor productivity enhancement
remains a critical component of the government’s overall policy mix. To alleviate the skill
mismatch and shortages in the labor market, the government has put in place various
measures, including tax incentives, to encourage the private sector to train and develop
workers’ skills. The implementation of the nationwide minimum wage hikes could continue
to induce the enhancement of labor productivity and firms’ production process.
Final Remarks
21.
To conclude, my authorities are committed to safeguarding the Thai economy and
financial system against short-term shocks while maintaining monetary and fiscal prudence.
In parallel, the implementation of structural reform measures is essential in securing growth
momentum in the longer run. The authorities also see the necessity in nurturing a favorable
environment for the private sector. Their sustained investments would bring about broadbased productivity enhancements and unlock supply constraints to allow Thailand to
maximize benefits from prospective global recovery.
22.
Finally, the authorities would like to thank staff for their effort in producing this
comprehensive assessment on the recent economic and financial developments in Thailand as
well as policy recommendations. Looking ahead, the authorities deem that maintaining a
two-way communication and collaboration between the authorities and the Fund remains a
vital part of improving the Fund’s effectiveness in its surveillance role.
