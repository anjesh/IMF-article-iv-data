Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the PRGF were held in
Kinshasa during November 9–23, 2004, February 15–22, 2005, and May 24–31, 2005 by staff teams
comprising Messrs. Briançon (head), Ben Ltaifa, Gons, Hartley (all AFR), Ioannou (PDR), Mati and
Williams (both FAD), and Kouwenaar (Senior Resident Representative). Mr. Guétat, Advisor to the
Executive Director for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), also participated in policy meetings.

•

The review, which is based on the end-September 2004 test date, has been delayed due to macroeconomic
slippages and noncomplying disbursements made to the DRC (www.imf.org, August 9, 2005). Three out
of 11 quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2004 were not met because of increased
security expenditure and weak spending procedures. The structural performance criterion was not met, but
the measure was implemented in January 2005.

•

The team met with the Vice Presidents for Economic and Financial Affairs and for Social and Cultural
Affairs, the Ministers of Finance, Budget, Political and Security Affaires, Economy, Planning, Mining,
Energy, Education, and Health the Governor of the Central Bank, the President of the National Assembly,
members of the General Accounting Office, representatives of the business community, and donors.

•

On June 12, 2002, the Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the PRGF in the amount
of SDR 580 million (108.8 percent of quota), with disbursements totaling SDR 526.7 million so far. An
additional SDR 26.7 million would be disbursed at the completion of this review. The arrangement was
extended to October 31, 2005 on June 7, 2005 and the authorities are requesting a further extension until
March 31, 2006 to complete the last review.

•

In July 2003, the DRC qualified for US$6.3 billion in debt relief in net present value (NPV) terms when it
reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. It could reach the completion point in the
second half of 2006, one year after the anticipated completion of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), the preparation of which is proceeding broadly as planned. The authorities are requesting an
additional annual tranche of IMF interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

•

The DRC maintains a floating exchange rate regime. The DRC has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The DRC maintains one
identified exchange restriction and one identified multiple currency practice subject to the provision of
Article VIII. Summaries of the DRC’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are presented in
Appendices II and III, respectively.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Since 2001, the DRC has experienced a significant turnaround under difficult
circumstances. Per capita income has improved, inflation has dropped and the
exchange rate has remained relatively stable while the transition government has
made progress in reunifying the country and strengthening public institutions.

•

Performance under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) has been uneven since mid-2004. Real GDP growth was
close to 7 percent, but inflation surged and the Congo franc depreciated in late 2004
and early 2005. The authorities, have, however, taken steps in the first half of 2005 to
address the shortcomings, which have in turn stabilized the macroeconomic situation.
This bodes well for the implementation of the program for the rest of the year.

•

The fiscal outcome was mixed in 2004. The overall objective was met, but the
composition of expenditure did not improve as envisaged with low levels of spending
for public investment and social sectors partly offset by money-financed
overspending for security and political institutions.

•

Following rapid money expansion in the second half of 2004, the Central Bank of
the Congo (BCC) has tightened monetary policy in 2005. This has led to an
appreciation of the exchange rate and the stabilization of consumer prices since May.

•

Implementation of structural reforms was slow in 2004. With the approaching
elections and security tensions, the transition government had difficulty reaching a
broad consensus on essential reforms. However, progress in key areas is essential to
maintain high and sustainable growth, in particular in reforming the mining and
forestry sectors and public enterprises.

•

Corruption remains a major obstacle to improvement in public resource
management and the business climate. Although legislation has been adopted to
intensify the fight against corruption, renewed impetus is needed to rebuild
institutions, strengthen budget procedures and reporting, improve transparency in tax
administration, and pursue the auditing and restructuring of public enterprises.

•

The most important risks to the program for the rest of 2005 relate to insecurity
and social tensions. Bringing the political transition process to a successful
conclusion is key and will require coordinated efforts to tackle simultaneously
political, economic, and security challenges. In that context, accommodative fiscal
and monetary policies on the eve of the elections remains a major risk. Insufficient
external financial support could also jeopardize the transition process.

-5-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Decades of mismanagement and a civil war during 1998–2001 led to a drop in per
capita GDP in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from US$250 in 1960 to
US$100 in 2001. These events had a severe impact on the whole Central African region
because of the DRC’s size and geographical location.
2.
Since 2001, the country has experienced a significant turnaround. After the
signing of a power-sharing agreement (Accord global et inclusif) in December 2002, a
transition government of national unity was formed in June 2003, charged with holding
elections before two years. However, the transition period was extended by six months in
June 2005 to give the authorities more time to prepare for the elections. The transition
government has made progress in reunifying the country and strengthening public
institutions. In addition, an integrated army and a police force are being created and the
implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) program,
which should reduce the size of the army by at least one-half, is proceeding albeit with some
delays. An international committee has been monitoring the transition process.1
3.
The Executive Board approved an arrangement under the PRGF in support of the
Government Economic Program (PEG) in June 2002 following the clearance of arrears to the
Fund (SDR 403.9 million). The program seeks to help reunify the country, rebuild the
economy’s infrastructure and institutions, stabilize the macroeconomic situation, revive
growth so as to reduce widespread poverty, improve governance, and combat entrenched
corruption.
4.
Many of the objectives of the PRGF-supported program have been met over the
last three years. Economic activity started to recover in 2002, after declining for 13 years,
inflation declined from 511 percent at end-2000 to 4 percent at end-2003, and the external
current account deficit narrowed (Table 3). Important structural measures have been
implemented, including the liberalization of most prices and the adoption of new investment,
forestry, and mining codes. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to rebuild institutions,
including at the level of the provinces, enforce laws and procedures, improve public resource
management, fight poverty, and combat corruption.
5.
The main lessons from the Fund’s involvement in the DRC have been that
(a) cohesive policy implementation and full ownership of the program at the highest political
level is essential; (b) maintaining peace and security is a precondition for macroeconomic

d’Accompagnement de la Transition (CIAT)) is presided by the head of the United Nations
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and comprises

Commission, and the African Union.

stability and growth; (c) improvements in institutions and governance are crucial for creating
an environment that is conducive to private-sector led growth and reducing poverty; and (d)
timely and well coordinated donor support is essential for rebuilding the economy, improving
social conditions, and alleviating poverty.
6.
The authorities have broadly heeded the Fund’s policy advice offered in the
context of surveillance and the PRGF-supported program over the past three years. The
focus has been on fiscal consolidation, monetary control, liberal exchange and trade regimes,
and improved governance, especially in the management of public resources, including the
country’s abundant natural resources (Box 1). However, implementation was sometimes
slowed by the difficulties of reaching a consensus within the transition government,
especially on issues that could potentially affect the fragile balance of power among political
parties.
7.
At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation in March 2003, Executive
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made and emphasized that lasting
peace was crucial for the economic reconstruction and development of the DRC. When
concluding the fourth review under the PRGF on July 12, 2004, Directors welcomed the
continued implementation of the program. They cautioned, however, that major challenges
remain, including demobilizing combatants, holding free and open elections, rehabilitating
administrative capacity in the reunified provinces, and implementing an effective
decentralization law. They stressed the need for the international community to continue to
assist the authorities in their efforts.
Box 1: Past Fund Policy Advice and Government’s Response
The authorities have been broadly receptive to the Fund’s past policy advice in the following areas:
(a) unification of multiple exchange rates, (b) liberalization of prices, (c) full implementation of new
expenditure procedures and budget classification, (d) undertaking civil service reform and the reform of
the pay systems, (e) creation of a Large Taxpayers Unit, and tariff and tax reforms, (f) adoption of
investment, mining, and forestry codes, and (g) undertaking an audit of the diamond sector.
Progress in the following areas is still required: (a) containing nonpriority expenditure and increasing
poverty reduction outlays, (b) improving tax administration and reducing exemptions, (c) building up
foreign reserves, (d) restructuring public enterprises, (e) fighting corruption, and (f) strengthening central
bank independence.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
8.
The political and security situation has remained difficult. The more active
involvement of the UN troops in the east has succeeded in containing the activities of militias
although widespread human rights violations continue. Last February’s announcement that
the Rwandese rebels in the DRC were ready to end their armed struggle could also reduce
tensions once the decision is effective. Militias, rebel and other armed groups remain active

-7-

in the illegal exploitation of minerals in the east and violations of the UN Security Council
arms embargo by all main parties continue.
9.
Delays in completing the political transition process have led to political and
social tensions, which may undermine macroeconomic stability. The presidential,
legislative, and local elections have been postponed to early 2006 because of delays in
adopting key laws and the complexities of organizing elections in a country as vast as the
DRC. Elections are to be preceded in November 2005 by a referendum on the draft
constitution approved by the National Assembly in May (see Box 2).
Box 2. The Draft Constitution, Decentralization, and Fiscal Implications
The draft constitution—adopted by the National Assembly on May 13, 2005—grants provinces broad powers.
This reflects the population’s desire for greater control over their destiny, given the dismal record with
centralized government over the past 40 years. However, the devolution of government resources and
responsibilities, if implemented rapidly, could jeopardize macroeconomic stability, and make public resource
management much more difficult, given existing weaknesses in budgetary control and transparency.
Main budget provisions for the provinces under the draft constitution
• Provinces have full responsibilities for their budget, including the ability to borrow locally, with limited
oversight from the central government.
• Provinces receive 40 percent of central government revenue collected locally. An additional 10 percent
of government revenue would be transferred to an autonomous agency (caisse de péréquation) that will
undertake projects to ensure an even development across provinces.
• Provinces will be responsible for designing and implementing programs for primary and secondary
education, health, agriculture, forestry, mining, energy, and manufacturing that are consistent with national
norms.
Potential risks
• Setting the rate of budgetary transfers in the constitution rather than in a budget law may result in excessive
institutional rigidity. The high level of transfers needs to be accompanied by transfers of responsibilities to
avoid jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.
• Weak provincial administration represents a risk for public resource management and may further delay
implementation of poverty-reducing programs in some provinces.
• The lack of oversight by the central government of local government budgets may lead to fiscal
imbalances, inconsistencies between subnational and national budgets, as well as disruption in the design of
macroeconomic policy.
Program implications
The constitution is to be ratified by referendum in November 2005 and hence will not affect the 2005 program.
However, it is uncertain how and when the constitution will be fully implemented, as no timeframe has been
set. A gradual application of the sections of the constitution concerning the devolution of resources and
responsibilities would allow for a buildup of financial management capacities in the provinces and so reduce the
risks to the economy.

Excluding official transfers, the current account deficit widened from 9.8 percent of GDP in
2003 to 12.1 percent in 2004.

The increase in trade also reflects a broadening of the coverage of statistics following the
reunification of the country.

Improved external competitiveness
seems to have had a positive impact
on exports (Figure 1). The real effective
exchange rate depreciated by 19 percent
during 2002–04, although at times it
exhibited some volatility. The country
also benefited from the sharp increase in
the world market prices of commodities,
with the terms of trade strengthening by
more than 20 percent over the same
period.

was overspending for security and political
institutions. In addition, the implementation of the
fiscal reform agenda slowed down due to
institutional rigidities, including the government’s
and the National Assembly’s slow decisionmaking processes. (MEFP, paras. 9-10). So, in
spite of relatively high growth, progress toward
reaching the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) has been limited. To some extent, this
reflects weak implementation capacity and a
focus on maintaining political stability and
security in a post-conflict environment.

A higher-than-anticipated expansion in the monetary aggregates in 2004 led to
the depreciation of the Congo franc and a surge in inflation. Through mid-2004, the
demand for the Congo franc was high because of the reunification, the economic recovery,
and rising market confidence. The situation, however, deteriorated in the second half of the
year, as rising insecurity and political tensions led to fiscal slippages, money creation, and a
loss of confidence. This translated into an increase in preference for U.S. dollar deposits,
with the share in total bank deposits rising from 85 percent to 93 percent between June 2004
and April 2005 and a depreciation of the Congo franc from CGF 391 to CGF 515 per U.S.
dollar over that period.

To correct the slippages, the authorities took measures in December 2004 and

In addition, the Central Bank of
the Congo (BCC) tightened monetary
policy. It raised in steps the discount and the
central bank bill rates from 6 percent in
October 2004 to 65 percent in March 2005.
Nevertheless, the Congo franc continued to
depreciate, reflecting weaknesses in the
monetary policy transmission mechanism;
banks’ difficulties in attracting deposits,
given their fragile financial position; and
the banks reluctance to hold BCC bills,
largely because, in the past, they had
experienced difficulties with reimbursement
(Figure 3).

B. Structural Policies
18.
The implementation of structural reforms was slow in 2004 (MEFP, paras. 13–
15). In particular, rising insecurity and political tensions made it difficult for the government
to reach a broad consensus on reforms, including over sharing control of public enterprises.
Against this background, the completion of the strategic audit of the Public Enterprise
Council (Conseil Supérieur du Portefeuille (CSP)) and a draft reorganization plan for the

- 11 -

petroleum distribution company (COHYDRO) were completed in July 2005—both structural
benchmarks for end-June 2004. A firm was selected in July 2005 to audit the parastatal
diamond mining enterprise MIBA, although the launch of the bidding process—a structural
performance criterion for end-September 2004—was delayed to January 2005 because the
anticipated external assistance did not materialize.
19.
There has been some progress in restructuring of the banking system, but much
remains to be done (Box 3, and MEFP, para. 35). In August 2004, the BCC issued a broad
road map for restructuring the BCC and the commercial banks, strengthening the financial
system, and developing a legal framework for microfinance institutions. The road map is
consistent with the BCC’s action plan, which aims at strengthening its operations, accounting
system, and management capabilities, and was prepared with Fund technical assistance. A
study on the BCC’s recapitalization also makes recommendations to deal with the large
losses incurred by the central bank due to the revaluation of its foreign exchange accounts,
high operating costs, and low earnings. As regards commercial banks, nine of them are being
liquidated, while five of the nine banks in operation are implementing restructuring plans.
Box 3. Banking Sector Issues
• Financial intermediation in the DRC remains low. This is due to the commercial banks’ fragile
financial position, low public confidence, and a very large informal sector that mostly uses cash. Bank
credit to the economy amounted to 1.5 percent of GDP while bank deposits were less than 5 percent of
GDP in 2004. Almost 90 percent of loans are short term, and some 85 percent are denominated in U.S.
dollars. Domestic long-term financial resources are limited. Dollarization of the economy has
increased with deposits denominated in foreign currency representing more than 90 percent of total
deposits in early 2005, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The interbank market is narrow as banks are
reluctant to lend to each other and prefer to rely on the BCC for their financing.
• Fund and World Bank staffs have helped to restructure the banking sector since 2001, with five
banks under a restructuring regime, and nine others placed under liquidation. Four banks are operating
without a restructuring plan, including one new bank that opened in 2004.

• The soundness of the banking system is still fragile, although it has improved over the past year.
All banks, except one, meet the minimum paid-in capital requirement. The number of institutions
meeting the solvency ratios has increased, but two banks are below the 10 percent requirement, and
one bank has a negative ratio. Banks’ profits are still low due to the narrow asset base and the
volatility of earnings.

C. Performance Under the PRGF-Supported Program Since March 2004
20.
Three out of 11 quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2004 were
not observed. Rising security and political tensions, as well as weak budget procedures, led
to an increase in current spending and breaches of the ceilings on the BCC’s net domestic
assets (by 0.6 percent of GDP) and net bank credit to the government (by 0.2 percent of
GDP). As indicated above, the government has corrected those slippages by tightening
monetary and fiscal policies. As a result, the exchange rate and consumer prices have
progressively stabilized since May 2005. In addition, the continuous performance criterion
on extrabudgetary spending was breached with outlays amounting to 0.01 percent of GDP in
the second half of 2004. To address this issue, the authorities have strengthened spending
procedures with the computerization of all steps in the process, from spending commitments
to payments. The end-2004 benchmarks on the ceilings on the BCC’s net domestic assets and
net bank credit to the government, and on the floor for the BCC’s net foreign assets were also
not observed. As indicated in para. 18, the structural performance criterion for endSeptember 2004 concerning the launch of bids for the selection of an international firm to
audit the diamond mining company MIBA was not met, but the measure was taken in
January 2005.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Outlook
21.
The challenge for the Democratic Republic of the Congo is to create an
environment that is conducive to private sector-led growth and one that capitalizes on
the country’s large resource endowment and potential. To that end, the authorities’
medium-term program aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability; increasing production
efficiency; developing public institutions and capacity; instituting policies to strengthen the
rule of the law and the judiciary; and investing in the social sectors to reduce poverty.
22.
The macroeconomic framework for 2005–08 envisages (i) an average real GDP
growth rate of 7 percent, implying an average increase in per capita income of 4 percent;
(ii) a decline in inflation to 5 percent from 2006 onward; and (iii) a gradual buildup in gross
international reserves to about 9 weeks of non-aid-related imports. (Tables 3 and 6).
23.
The discussions focused on policies to restore macroeconomic stability and
remove impediments to growth and poverty reduction. Discussions on the program for
the rest of 2005 were also finalized. The challenges arising from the political transition
process provided background to the discussions, including the preparation and holding of
general elections, the implementation of the DDR program, and the creation of integrated
military and police forces.
24.
The authorities emphasized that their continuing priority was to consolidate
progress made so far, in particular the containment of inflation. They were keenly aware
that the easing of fiscal and monetary policies in 2004 had led to a loss of public confidence,
pressure on the exchange rate, higher inflation, and a lower-than-desired buildup of

- 13 -

international reserves. The authorities stressed, however, that the increase in military
spending in the second half of 2004 was unavoidable because of the threats on the eastern
border. They also indicated that an audit of security outlays had started.
25.
While acknowledging the seriousness of the problems faced, the staff noted that
the authorities had no alternative but to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to preserve
macroeconomic stability. It emphasized that much more needed to be done to strengthen
budget execution, contain current expenditure, observe spending priorities, and improve
capacity to implement poverty-reducing projects and fight corruption. Staff also urged the
authorities to contain money-financed government spending, especially since the political
transition process called for a substantial increase in government spending in 2005, thereby
increasing the burden on monetary policy to control inflation.
B. Macroeconomic Objectives and Policies for 2005
26.
The following macroeconomic objectives were established for 2005: (i) real GDP
growth of 6.6 percent; (ii) end-of period inflation of 23 percent; and (iii) an increase in gross
international reserves to 7 weeks of non-aid-related imports.
Fiscal policy and institutional reforms of public finance
27.
To contain inflation and stabilize the exchange rate, the government indicated its
determination to tighten the underlying fiscal balance.4 The authorities will therefore seek
to achieve an underlying fiscal surplus equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP, compared with a
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004. At the same time, spending for the political transition
process and the restructuring of the economy, which is largely foreign financed,5 would
cause the overall fiscal deficit, on a cash basis,6 to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP
to 2.2 percent in 2005.
28.
Total government revenue is projected to increase by 1.1 percentage points of
GDP to 10.7 percent. This is due to increased tax collection in reunified provinces, the
impact in 2005 of tax reforms implemented since 2003, payment to the government of tax
and fees previously collected by autonomous agencies, and higher tax and royalty payments
4

The underlying fiscal balance excludes all foreign grants, external interest payments,
foreign-financed investment projects, and foreign-financed spending for the restructuring of
the economy and the political transition.
5

This includes outlays for the preparation of the elections (3.2 percent of GDP); the
demobilization of about 100,000 soldiers (0.7 percent of GDP); the restructuring of the army
(1 percent of GDP); the repayment of the domestic debt (0.6 percent of GDP); and the
retirement of civil servants who are beyond the retirement age (0.7 percent of GDP).

by petroleum producers (MEFP, paras. 21 and 25). Results in the first four months of 2005
are in line with the projections for the year.
29.
Total government expenditure, excluding exceptional outlays, is to increase by
2.3 percentage points of GDP to 17.7 percent. This is due largely to an increase in capital
spending (by 4.1 percent of GDP), driven by a sharp increase in budgeted foreign-financed
projects, especially for infrastructure, including hydroelectricity and poverty-reducing
programs.7 At the same time, savings of about 2 percentage points of GDP are expected to
arise from a reduction in other current expenditure, particularly military spending. Results for
the first four months of 2005 are slightly below the objective for the year, partly because of
low poverty-reducing spending.
30.
A key aspect of the program for 2005 is to strengthen the management of the
civil service so that wages can be increased without aggravating the fiscal deficit (MEFP,
para. 23).8 To keep the wage bill close to 3.6 percent of GDP (compared with the 4.1 percent
of GDP in the 2005 budget) while increasing benefits, the authorities are committed to
removing ghost workers from the payroll by implementing the results of the census of
military and civilian personnel. As a start, the results of the civil service census in Kinshasa
were largely implemented with the May payroll, and those for the military will be
implemented beginning in August (MEFP, Table 2); preliminary results suggest that the
payroll could be reduced by as much as one-third. Hence, once the payroll takes into account
the results of the census, the authorities should have room for granting benefits included in
the 2005 budget while keeping the wage bill within the ceiling agreed with the staff. A new
payroll system is also being implemented to prevent the problem of ghost workers from
reoccurring and to ensure that all public employees are actually receiving their pay.
31.
The overall fiscal deficit is to be covered by external financing, including debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and budget support from the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, and bilateral donors. As some of the budget support to be disbursed in
2005 will be used over a two-year period, it will contribute to a reduction in net credit to
government.
32.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursue far-reaching structural
fiscal reforms in 2005 (Box 4, and MEFP, paras. 25-26 and Table 1). On the revenue side,
the strategy aims at (i) broadening the tax base by addressing fraud and undervaluation, and
reducing tax exemptions; (ii) replacing the turnover tax with a value-added tax in the medium
term, and streamlining fees and other quasi-taxes; (iii) modernizing the customs and tax
agencies; (iv) applying tax rates uniformly and ensuring government control over tax
7

The program assumes that the execution rate of the investment program will be 70 percent
of the budgeted level, which may be ambitious, given the limited implementation capacities.

- 15 -

collections in all provinces; and (v) improving revenue collection from the mining and
forestry sectors. On the expenditure side, to address poorly targeted and inadequate social
spending, the authorities will (i) limit spending for defense and political institutions; (ii) use
HIPC Initiative debt relief more effectively, in particular in health and education; and
(iii) reform the civil service to contain its size and improve its efficiency.
33.
The authorities agreed with the staff that better monitoring and control of
spending and a greater diffusion of information on budget execution were key to
enhancing transparency in government operations (MEFP, para. 26 and Table 2). The
focus has been on strengthening spending procedures through their computerization so that
information on budget execution can be made available to the Council of Ministers on a
monthly basis and to the National Assembly on a quarterly basis. The Fund staff is providing
technical assistance to improve the quality, coverage, and timeliness of fiscal data. Technical
assistance to strengthen budget procedures and expenditure controls at the local level is also
being sought by the authorities, given the responsibilities granted by the draft constitution
and the very large unmet needs.
Monetary policy
34.
The BCC is committed to implementing a prudent monetary policy in the
context of the floating exchange rate regime, with the restoration of price stability as
the main objective. In view of the rapid growth in broad money in 2004 and the volatility in
demand for the Congo franc, the BCC set the target for growth in base money at 11 percent
in 2005. Such an increase is projected to lead to a 26 percent increase in broad money, given
the increased dollarization recorded since the beginning of the year. The target for base
money would be reviewed at the time as the sixth review under the program. With net bank
credit to the government declining, the expansion in broad money would leave room for
credit to the private sector to increase in line with nominal GDP.
35.
The BCC agreed to strengthen monetary policy management and to adopt a
gradual approach to interest rate adjustment (MEFP, para. 28). To improve market
confidence, the BCC’s monetary policy strategy and objectives would be communicated
regularly to the public. The BCC was also committed to increasing the auctioning of central
bank paper by ensuring that commercial banks’ excess liquidity at the central bank is
available on demand, and by promoting a greater participation of nonbanks.

- 16 -

Box 4. Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
The strategy aims at enhancing tax collection by replacing the turnover tax with a broad-based valueadded tax (VAT) by 2006, broadening the tax base, and modernizing tax administration; increasing the
share of poverty-reducing expenditure and designing an appropriate wage policy; and strengthening
public expenditure management to enhance fiscal policy effectiveness. The following measures are
envisioned in the three areas:
1.

Tax policy and administration

Taxation of the mining sector: Remove exemptions for income taxes and mining royalties granted to
state mining companies (MIBA in diamonds and GECAMINES in copper and cobalt) and create a
division in the large taxpayers unit specializing in mining taxation.
Exemptions: Cancel exemptions not allowed under the investment, mining, and forestry codes.
Stamp duties and fees: Rationalize the numerous fees and quasi-taxes that public agencies collect to
fund their operations.
Large taxpayers unit (LTU): Strengthen the unit by (i) adopting criteria to select large taxpayers;
(ii) simplifying tax payment procedures; and (iii) implementing a taxpayer identification number.
Extend reforms introduced in Kinshasa to other provinces.
Customs department: Strengthen the pilot customs office in the port of Matadi by giving the customs
department (OFIDA) sole responsibility for collecting customs duties and fees. Open similar customs
offices at other borders.
Tax centers for medium-sized enterprises: In the short term, adopt the law and regulations defining
modalities of operations of the tax offices for medium-sized enterprises. Create centers that are essential
for the establishment of a VAT.
2.

Expenditure policy

Pro-poor spending: Increase its share in total spending and use of budget appropriations (including
from enhanced HIPC Initiative savings) by improving strategy for social sectors with World Bank
assistance, strengthening procurement procedures, and reducing delays in foreign financing.
Military spending: Keep nominal amount constant, which, together with the identification of ghosts
and the demobilization of soldiers, will allow a doubling of salaries in the next three years.
Transfers to provinces: Increase transfer payments over the medium term as local administrative
capacity improves and more expenditure responsibilities are devolved to provinces.
Civil service reform: Freeze hiring until completion of the civil service census in late 2005, strengthen
controls over payroll procedures, and progressively increase civil service wages. .
Capital spending: Improve coordination among ministries and with donors to increase efficiency and
execution rate.
3.

Public expenditure management

The DRC meets 4 out of 16 HIPC/AAP indicators, with weaknesses identified in (i) the budget
preparation process, (ii) the internal control of budgetary operations, (iii) the reporting of budgetary
execution, and (iv) the quality, coverage, and timeliness of fiscal data.
Budget process and execution: In the short-term, improve regularity of budget-tracking statements
through the implementation of the new budget execution procedures from spending commitments to
payments. In due course establish a medium-term expenditure framework to allow better prioritization
of government spending.
Efficiency of government operations: Establish a double-entry accounting framework, rationalize
government accounts, strengthen government cash management at the central bank, and improve
recording of information on arrears.

- 17 -

36.
The BCC concurred that available monetary instruments may be ineffective to
deal with the liquidity impact of the high level of official foreign financing expected over
the coming year or so.9 The problem was particularly acute in light of the high dollarization
of the economy and the limited capacity of the central bank to reduce liquidity through its
indirect monetary policy instruments, central bank interest rates and treasury bills.10
Nevertheless, since the market for central bank bills was narrow, staff urged the authorities to
lean toward controlling base money growth through the sale of foreign exchange, while
ensuring that the target for international reserves was met. Any negative impact on
competitiveness of a resulting currency appreciation should be reversed once government
expenditure returns to trend in the course of 2006 (MEFP, paras. 28–29).
External policies
37.
The staff shares the authorities’ view that the current floating exchange rate
regime has served the country well and remains appropriate under the current
conditions. The staff is also of the view that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly
in line with market fundamentals.11 However, the authorities pointed out that occasional
foreign exchange intervention was beneficial for maintaining confidence in the Congo franc,
and increasing its use. The staff’s response was that confidence in the currency would
improve as policy implementation is strengthened and becomes more credible, and that
intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited to smoothing its movements.
38.
The DRC exchange rate system is largely free of restrictions. Regarding the
DRC’s obligations under Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, the DRC and Zimbabwe have yet to implement the agreement in principle to
remove the multiple currency practice arising from their bilateral payments arrangement.
Lifting the exchange rate restriction arising from the debt position of the DRC vis-à-vis
Rwanda and Burundi under the inoperative regional payments arrangement of the
Communauté Economique des Pays des Grands Lacs (CEPGL) is likely to require the
9

For more details, see Sections I and II of Selected Issues Paper.

10

In an economy where the U.S. dollar is widely used for transactions, central bank
intervention on the foreign exchange market may change the share of local currency in broad
money but not necessarily the level of broad money. Hence, large foreign currency inflows,
whether converted into local currency or not, may be inflationary. Furthermore, because of
its past history of hyperinflation, the BCC has difficulty selling central bank notes, even
when offering high interest rates, as it did recently.
11

This assessment is based on recent developments regarding competitiveness (para. 12). In
addition, export growth and an overall balance of payments position consistent with
sustainable borrowing (para. 40) are further indications that the real exchange rate seems to
be appropriate.

- 18 -

normalization of relations in the region. Accordingly, the approval of this restriction granted
by the Board until December 31, 2004 has lapsed.
39.
The DRC’s trade regime is relatively open. Further progress toward trade
liberalization is expected in the context of regional trade arrangements and economic
partnership agreements (EPAs).12 Trade preference under the Africa Growth and Opportunity
Act (AGOA) was granted to the DRC on October 31, 2003. The government has also started
the process to adhere to the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa
(OHADA).
40.
The authorities stated that they would continue to follow a prudent external debt
management policy. They would contract debt only on highly concessional terms and in
amounts consistent with debt sustainability.13 After reaching the decision point under the
HIPC Initiative, the authorities signed bilateral topping-up agreements with all Paris Club
creditors, except the United States (MEFP, para 12). The authorities have also continued
their good faith efforts to reach collaborative agreements with commercial creditors. They
have signed rescheduling agreements with 32 commercial creditors (including recently
submitted claims), and intend to continue seeking agreements with all remaining creditors by
end-2005.14
41.
The authorities are expected to service their debt to the Fund on time (Table 1).
However, there might be some risk to the Fund in the event of a sudden interruption of donor
support (see para. 51 below). The provision of HIPC assistance by the Fund and other
12

The DRC is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic
Community of Central African States (CEEAC), and the Economic Community of the Great
Lakes Countries (CEPGL). The negotiations on an EPA with the EU essentially involve
reciprocal market access during a transition period. These negotiations could become a
catalyst for the rationalization of seemingly overlapping trade agreements.

13

In 2005, foreign borrowing is estimated at 6 percent of GDP, and accounts for 34 percent
of total external financing. Over the medium term, foreign borrowing is expected to decline
to 4 percent of GDP, partly because the DRC is eligible to receive only grants from the
World Bank, while its share in total external financing will remain broadly unchanged.

14

Two creditors have requested payments of outstanding arrears. The authorities have taken
the view that they could not agree to such requests, which were not consistent with their
obligations under the Paris Club and, if accepted, could undermine program implementation.
As required under the 2003 Paris Club Agreed Minute, the authorities have submitted the
earlier agreements signed with commercial creditors to the Paris Club, which considered
their terms to be broadly comparable with its own. Additional efforts to secure debt relief
will be required at the time of the completion point.

- 19 -

creditors will ease the debt service burden. In this regard, the authorities are requesting an
additional annual tranche of interim assistance in the amount of SDR 1.132 million to cover
interest payments falling due to the Fund between August 1, 2005 and July 31, 2006.
Structural and social policies, and preparation of the PRSP
42.
The authorities indicated that they would seek to accelerate implementation of
the structural reform agenda (MEFP, paras. 33–39, and Table 4). However, they
recognized that, with the approaching elections, the transition government may find it
difficult to reach a consensus on far-reaching reforms. At end-January 2005, the authorities
submitted a draft law to the National Assembly revising the legal framework for public
enterprises and agencies, which would facilitate their restructuring, privatization, or
liquidation. Other measures include the formulation of restructuring plans for eight key
public enterprises and the completion of the reform of the mining registry.
43.
The staff, together with donors and civil society representatives, have urged the
authorities to do more to combat corruption, which is deeply ingrained and not only
undermines business and investor confidence but also is a cause of insecurity and political
instability. The authorities noted that important measures have been taken over the past
12 months and additional measures have been planned for the rest of 2005 (MEFP, para. 33).
For instance, ministers and heads of enterprises have been replaced for mismanagement.
Also, a financial intelligence unit is soon to be established following the promulgation of the
anti-money laundering law in July 2004 and the anticorruption law in March 2005. To ensure
that revenue from the mining sector contributes to sustainable development and poverty
reduction, the authorities in May 2005 committed to adhering to the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI).15 The staff urged the authorities to strengthen institutions and
procedures; make information on budget execution widely available, including to parliament
and civil society; improve transparency in tax administration, and reduce harassment of
businesses; and continue auditing public enterprises. The Fund staff is working with the
World Bank and other development partners to ensure that budget appropriations are
effectively used for their intended purpose and benefit the local population.
44.
Staff underscored the importance of accelerating progress toward achieving the
MDGs. It urged the authorities to make efficient and timely use of resources mobilized
under the HIPC Initiative, improve absorptive capacity, and enhance efficiency of
investment in social sectors. Progress in these areas is instrumental in mobilizing donor
resources and critical to meet the challenges faced by the country.16

For more details, see Section IV of Selected Issues Paper.

According to the latest estimates (2001), 80 percent of the population live in absolute
poverty with a per capita income of $0.23 per day. Information on the MDGs is limited, but
(continued)

- 20 -

45.
The preparation of the PRSP is progressing according to plan and a first draft
was circulated to development partners in March 2005. The last PRSP preparation status
report was endorsed by the Board on July 12, 2004. A second draft is to be completed shortly
and will incorporate comments from the Fund staff and other donors as well as the results
from the 1-2-3 surveys on employment, the informal sector, and household consumption,
which have been completed for Kinshasa and are expected to be completed for the provinces
by late 2005. Donors have also provided strong financial and technical support to the
authorities to ensure that the full PRSP is of high quality and is completed during the second
half of 2005 (MEFP, para. 44).
Statistical issues, administrative capacity building, and technical assistance
46.
External technical assistance covers a broad range of activities aimed at
buttressing administrative capacity and central government institutions. The Fund
provides technical assistance through resident experts in public expenditure management,
monetary policy formulation, information technology at the BCC, and macroeconomic
statistics. In addition, Fund technical assistance missions visit the DRC regularly to assist the
authorities in strengthening policy formulation, institutions, and procedures. As a result,
administrative capacities have improved, although much remains to be done, especially in the
provinces. Macroeconomic statistics are still weak, especially in the areas of national
accounts, price and production statistics, and balance of payments. The Fund’s Statistics
Department has formulated a program to address these shortcomings and the DRC
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Program monitoring
47.
To ensure the success of the program, the authorities will implement the prior
actions indicated in the MEFP, Table 5. The program will be monitored through the
quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks specified in the MEFP,
Tables 10 and 2 and in the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) that is attached
to the MEFP. Quantitative and structural performance criteria for end-September 2005 and
indicative targets for end-December 2005 have been agreed on. As the arrangement is
scheduled to expire on October 31, 2005, the authorities are also requesting an extension of
the arrangement to March 31, 2006, to accommodate the sixth and last review under the
arrangement.
C. Risks
48.
The success of the government’s strategy is subject to several downside risks.
These include (i) continued regional tensions; (ii) delays in the political process—particularly
the carrying out of national elections; (iii) policy slippages on the eve of the elections;
should become available as the authorities are conducting surveys in the context of the
preparation of the PRSP and the strategies for health and education.

- 21 -

(iv) difficulties in reaching a broad political consensus with regard to prioritization and
implementation of key reforms; (v) weaknesses in governance including widespread
corruption, which, if not addressed quickly, could hinder foreign direct investment as well as
private sector development; and (vi) weaknesses in implementation capacity to carry out
reform measures and pro-poor projects.
49.
The financing of the external imbalance is broadly consistent with debt
sustainability. The NPV of debt to exports is projected to be below the 150 percent threshold
at the time of the completion point (Box 5), because of a strong growth in exports and the
Box 5. External Debt Sustainability
Debt sustainability prospects have improved since the last review, reflecting to a large extent the sharp increase in
merchandise exports in 2004. The NPV of debt to exports ratio at the time of the completion point (expected in the
second half of 2006) is projected to fall to 75 percent, compared with 110 percent at the time of the last review, and
125 percent at the time of the decision point.
Staff estimates suggest that higher exports account for nearly 44 percent of the improvement in the NPV of debt to
exports ratio at the time of the completion point relative to the decision point projection. Lower borrowing explains
about 35 percent of the improvement, with the remainder accounted by changes in the NPV of outstanding debt at
the time of the decision point (largely the result of debt relief beyond the HIPC Initiative).

Exports

The analysis above is broadly consistent with the results of the DSA for low-income countries undertaken in the
context of the Article IV consultation. The latter shows that the NPV of debt to exports ratio at the time of the
completion point, is expected to be around 70 percent (against 75 percent using the HIPC DSA). The small variation
is due to methodological differences Appendix V. Over the medium term, the NPV of debt to exports ratio declines
modestly (to 72 percent under the HIPC DSA, and to 62 percent under the LIC DSA).
While debt sustainability over the medium term appears to be under control, vulnerabilities remain. As the analysis
in Appendix V indicates, the DRC is particularly susceptible to exogenous shocks, notably to an export shock and to
a combination of smaller shocks. The authorities should continue to closely monitor developments in this area.

- 22 -

slower-than-projected increase in foreign-financed public investment largely because of
severe capacity constraints.17 The debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries
conducted by the staff (Appendix VI) confirms this result. However, the analysis also shows
that the DRC’s debt sustainability indicators remain vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
50.
A sudden interruption of donor support could lead to a loss of confidence and a
disorderly exchange rate adjustment. While this scenario is unlikely, the low level of
reserves is a cause of concern, taking into account the country’s susceptibility to exogenous
shocks. The authorities should therefore intensify their efforts toward diversification of the
export base. Strengthening competitiveness over the medium term, through a reduction of
corruption and red-tape, should provide incentives toward the development of nontraditional
exports.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
The staff commends the authorities for the continued implementation, albeit
under more difficult circumstances, of wide-ranging macroeconomic and structural
policies under the PRGF-supported Government Economic Program (PEG). The
policies led to a remarkable turnaround in the economy over the first two years of the
program, an improvement in per capita income, a drop in inflation, and a relatively stable
exchange rate.
52.
Developments since mid-2004, however, have underscored the fragility of the
economic situation. In spite of the steady improvement in macroeconomic performance over
the past three years, market confidence in government policy remains low, against the
background of a volatile and uncertain political and security environment. Given the high
dollarization of the economy, policy slippages have rapidly translated into sharp fluctuations
in the exchange rate and inflation. The staff is, however, encouraged by the government’s
strong response to the financial slippages and its willingness to implement difficult measures
to contain fiscal expansion and bring money growth under control in the first half of 2005.
This response bodes well for the implementation of the program during the rest of the year.
53.
The rest of 2005 will be challenging since bringing the political transition process
toward a successful conclusion will require coordinated efforts to tackle simultaneously
political, economic, and security challenges. In particular, progress on the political front is
essential to maintain macroeconomic stability, reassure private investors, and ensure strong
and lasting growth. Hence, the staff hopes that the authorities and all parties involved will
proceed with the general elections as soon as possible. Sufficient and timely foreign
assistance also remains essential to ensure the implementation of the DDR program and the
creation of a professional army and police force.
17

Current estimates could differ from the results of the DSA that will be undertaken at the
completion point, as they do not account for changes in discount and exchange rates.

- 23 -

54.
The staff supports the government’s fiscal objectives for 2005. The aim is to
pursue fiscal consolidation, while increasing social spending and budget appropriations
required for the political transition. It is, therefore, essential that the authorities observe
spending limits, especially on current outlays, an area that in the past has been a source of
slippages. To achieve the 2005 revenue target, the authorities will need to accelerate tax
administration reforms, broaden the tax base, ensure that taxes are collected across all
provinces, and combat tax fraud and corruption.
55.
The staff urges a prudent and progressive transfer of resources and
responsibilities to the provinces, which is called for in the draft constitution. This needs
to be preceded by a strong push to strengthen local capacities and control mechanisms to
avoid a weakening of fiscal discipline and ensure adequate service delivery.
56.
Timely implementation of measures to increase transparency in government
spending, including the computerization and rationalization of procedures and the
tracking of poverty-related expenditure, remains critical. In particular, it is essential that
line ministries receive their budget appropriations in a timely manner. At the same time, the
staff urges the authorities to pursue civil service reform, including the completion of the civil
service census and the strengthening of payroll management, to ensure that the ceiling on the
wage bill is observed, while allowing for a progressive increase in wages, which remain very
low.
57.
The staff urges the BCC to maintain a tight monetary policy to bring inflation
down and to stabilize the exchange rate. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy,
it is also essential that the BCC strengthens monetary policy instruments and international
reserve management by implementing recommendations by Fund technical assistance. At the
same time, to increase the credibility of monetary policy, the central bank needs to improve
the transparency of its operations, including its accounts. The central bank should refrain
from intervening in the foreign exchange market except for short-term smoothing operations.
The staff considers the level of the exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
58.
The staff is of the view that the Lending into Arrears Policy should continue to
be applied. This is based on the financing assurances review conducted by staff, the good
faith efforts exerted by the authorities toward reaching collaborative agreements with
commercial creditors, and the fact that relations with commercial creditors have not
undermined the program. Staff does not recommend approval of the existing exchange
restrictions and encourages the authorities to remove these restrictions as soon as possible.
59.
The staff encourages the authorities to give renewed impetus to the
implementation of structural reforms. While recognizing that the forthcoming elections
may make reaching a broad policy consensus more difficult, progress in key areas is essential
to attract private investment and maintain the momentum for growth. Hence, particular effort
should be made to address delays in reforming the mining sector and public enterprises and
to ensure that the pace of reforms in the social sectors is sustained.

- 24 -

60.
Corruption remains deeply ingrained and is a major obstacle to the
improvement of the business climate. Decisive action from the authorities supported by the
international community will be required to tackle this difficult issue. The staff welcomes the
adoption of legislation to intensify the fight against corruption, money laundering, and the
financing of terrorism, and urges the authorities to take all necessary measures to have the
laws effectively implemented. In addition, the reform of the judiciary system should be
pursued with tenacity.
61.
The staff encourages the authorities to complete preparation of a high-quality
PRSP through a broad participatory process. Progress in preparing the document, and
formulation of the DRC’s poverty-reduction strategy should be finalized by late 2005.
Implementation of the PRSP and the observance of triggers would allow the completion
point to be reached during the second half of 2006.
62.
Program implementation will continue to face a number of risks, mostly related
to insecurity and social tensions. First, rising insecurity in the eastern provinces could turn
into a broader conflict. Second, delays in completing the political transition process could
raise uncertainty regarding the government’s intentions. Third, accommodating fiscal and
monetary policies on the eve of the elections could rekindle inflation and lead to a
depreciation of the currency. And fourth, insufficient external financial support could make it
difficult for the authorities to conduct the elections in an appropriate environment, restructure
the army and the police force, and build the country’s infrastructure.
63.
The staff recommends completion of the fifth review under the PRGF
arrangement and supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of
three quantitative performance criteria and one structural performance criterion. In
this connection, the staff notes the authorities’ overall track record in implementing
economic and financial reforms, measures taken in early 2005 to correct slippages, as well as
the strength of their program for 2005 and the medium term, particularly the steps taken to
enhance fiscal and monetary policy implementation.
64.
The authorities should be able to meet their debt service obligations to the Fund over
the medium term, although an interruption of donor support could expose the Fund to
potential risks.
65.
The staff supports the authorities’ request to extend the PRGF arrangement to
end-March 2006 to provide time to complete the sixth review. Given the existence of
adequate financing assurances, the staff supports the authorities’ request for an additional
annual tranche of interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
66.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the DRC be held in
accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on
July 15, 2002.

1/ Including interest due to the IMF.
2/ Excluding repayments to the IMF.
3/ The Naples flow rescheduling was concluded in September 2002. It provided for a rescheduling of arrears and current debt service on eligible debt during the consolidation period (July
2002–June 2005) after a cancellation of 67 percent in net present value (NPV) terms of arrears outstanding at June 30, 2002 and of current debt service during the consolidation period. In
addition, the Paris Club treatment provided for a capitalization of moratorium interest on debt that has been rescheduled. To facilitate the clearance of arrears on short-term debt and post-cutoffdate (June 30, 1983) debt, as well as the servicing of post-cutoff-date debt, the Paris Club treatment envisaged a repayment of the amounts due in accordance with a new payments schedule.
4/ At the end of 2002, arrears outstanding to Paris Club creditors had been cleared, and, accordingly, Naples flow rescheduling applies only to current debt service.
5/ Including the capitalization of moratorium interest.
6/ It takes into account the Naples flow rescheduling, the capitalization of moratorium interest, the Cologne flow rescheduling, the additional debt-service relief beyond the Cologne flow
rescheduling, the grants provided by multilateral creditors in the context of the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the impact of the stock-of-debt operation (including any additional cancellation
beyond the HIPC Initiative) at the completion point on debt service. The data also take into account the rescheduling agreements that have already been signed with some commercial creditors as
well as the impact on debt service of the accumulation of arrears to non-Paris Club creditors.
7/ The amount of HIPC assistance deposited into a special account at the central bank. For bilateral and commercial creditors, it includes the debt relief resulting from the enhanced HIPC
Initiative (excluding debt relief beyond the HIPC Initiative) following the use of all traditional debt-relief mechanisms, including a hypothetical stock-of-debt operation on Naples terms. Only
assistance based on rescheduling agreements that have been concluded are taken into account. For multilateral creditors, it includes the amount of HIPC grants that are made available for the
purpose of delivering their share of assistance under the Initiative.

Kinshasa, August 6, 2005

APPENDIX I

Translated from French

Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
On June 12, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund approved
a three-year arrangement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). This arrangement was designed to support
the Government Economic Program (PEG) for the period April 1, 2002–July 31, 2005.
By the terms of the arrangement, the government of the DRC and IMF staff have conducted
the fifth review of the program covering not only the period April 1–September 30, 2004
as required under the program, but also the six months following that period, in view of
the worsening economic situation in the second half of the year. This review, which took
place during the three IMF missions on November 9–23, 2004, February 15–22, 2005, and
May 24–31, 2005, focused on the execution of the program as well as the outlook and
the economic and financial measures to be implemented in 2005. In particular, the review has
taken into account the objectives that we have set, such as the holding of free, democratic,
and transparent elections; the implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilization, and
Reintegration program (Désarmement, Démobilisation, et Réinsertion, DDR); and the
restructuring of the army and the police force.
2.
The government remains determined to implement the policies and measures set out
in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and the memorandum on
economic and financial policies, which is attached to this letter of intent and supplements the
letters of April 13, 2002, February 4, 2003, July 3, 2003, December 10, 2003, and
June 24, 2004.
3.
In 2004, execution of the PEG was more challenging than expected because
the security problems in the eastern part of the DRC resulted in major military expenditures
during the second half third quarter and the end of the year. The government also
experienced difficulties in controlling other sovereignty expenditures during that period. This
excess spending, which was partially financed by the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC), led
to a rapid growth in the monetary base, causing a sharp depreciation of the Congo franc and a
rise in inflation over the first four months of 2005. The government is nonetheless committed
to strengthening its efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and pursue the reconstruction
of the DRC, and in this context, it shall implement all the fiscal and monetary measures and
the structural reforms described in the attached 2005 memorandum on economic and
financial policies.

- 37 -

APPENDIX I

4.
The government is determined to uphold the rule of law throughout the country, and
to ensure good governance and transparency in the conduct of public affairs at the level of
the central government, as well as the levels of the national institutions, the public
enterprises, and the eleven provinces. The government also intends to strengthen the fight
against corruption, including in government and in the natural resources sector, and to reduce
bureaucratic “red tape.” Furthermore, the government will seek to improve the management
of public enterprises, and will take all necessary legal steps to address the shortcomings
identified in the course of the audit of public enterprises by the Audit Office.
5.
The year 2005 will be marked by the holding of free, democratic, and transparent
elections for the first time in our country’s history, and hence the establishment of a
democratic and constitutional government. A roadmap has been prepared to achieve this
goal, and with the assistance of the international community we intend to follow this
roadmap in an atmosphere of calm and respect for democratic rules. As a first step, the draft
constitution was adopted by parliament on May 13, and will be put to a referendum in the
coming months.
6.
An examination of the quantitative performance criteria at end-September 2004,
which were the focus of an audit conducted by an international firm, indicates that three
performance criteria out of 11 performance criteria have not been met. The ceilings on the
BCC’s net domestic assets and net bank credit to the government, adjusted for external
assistance, were exceeded by 0.6 percent of GDP and 0.2 percent of GDP respectively.
Moreover, the continuous criterion according to which the BCC may not finance budgetary
expenditures that have not been authorized by the Finance Minister was not met, as such
spending amounted to CGF 227.5 million during the second half of 2004. The structural
performance criterion regarding the audit of the parastatal diamond enterprise (MIBA) by an
international audit firm could not be met owing to the lack of external assistance. However,
the government has decided to finance this audit from its own budget. In addition, the
implementation of the two structural benchmarks was delayed; the strategic audit of the
Public Enterprise Council (Conseil Supérieur du Portefeuille - CSP) was completed in July
2005; and the reorganization plan for the petroleum products distribution company
(COHYDRO) is being finalized. At end-December 2004, the quantitative indicators for net
external assets, the net domestic assets of the BCC, and net credit to the government,
adjusted for external assistance, were overshot.
7.
The government is determined to strengthen macroeconomic stability by
implementing the budgetary and monetary policies described in the attached memorandum.
In addition, a considerable number of reforms will be implemented in 2005, which will be
essential for maintaining a high rate of growth and reducing poverty. In view of the measures
taken and the set of policies it will implement, and in order to complete the review, the
government would like to request waivers from the IMF Executive Board with respect to the
nonobservance of the three quantitative performance criteria and the structural performance
criterion referred to above.

- 38 -

APPENDIX I

8.
The government will provide the IMF with all information requested by the Fund on
the implementation of its economic and financial program for 2005. As in the past,
the government authorizes the publication of this letter, the MEFP attached to this letter, and
the IMF staff report.
9.
The government considers that the policies and measures set out in the attached
memorandum are adequate to achieve its program objectives. The government is prepared
to take any further measures that may be necessary toward this end. Moreover,
the government pledges to consult the IMF, whether on its own initiative or upon
your request, regarding the adoption of any additional measures that may prove necessary.
10.
The authorities propose quantitative performance criteria for September 30, 2005 and
structural performance criteria up to end-September 2005 to be assessed during the sixth
program review. Therefore, the government requests that the arrangement be extended from
October 31, 2005 to March 31, 2006 in order for the sixth review to be completed before the
end of the arrangement,. The government would also like to request additional interim
assistance under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to cover
part of its debt service obligations falling due to the Fund between August 1, 2005 and July
31, 2006.
11.
The government would like to thank the international community for supporting
its stabilization and reconstruction efforts during this critical period in the history of the
DRC. The government hopes to benefit from IMF support once the current PRGF-supported
arrangement comes to an end. Accordingly, the government would like to begin discussions
with Fund staff as soon as possible concerning a medium-term program that could be
supported by a new PRGF arrangement when the current arrangement ends.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Joseph Kabila
President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies for 2005
Kinshasa, August 6, 2005

EXECUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM
1.
Since June 2004, implementation of the Government Economic Program (PEG) has
been more difficult than expected owing to security problems in the eastern provinces, which
resulted in additional military expenditures during the third quarter and toward year’s end.
The government also experienced problems with curbing other current expenditure during
this period. These additional expenditures led to a rapid increase in base money, a sharp
depreciation of the Congo franc, and the resurgence of inflation. In addition, progress in
implementing structural reforms in 2004 was delayed to allow all parties to reach consensus
within the government.
2.
To address the difficulties faced during the second half of 2004 the government took
new measures in February 2005, including a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies that
has led to a stabilization of the exchange rate and consumer prices.
3.
Despite the above-mentioned difficulties, economic growth was sustained across most
sectors in 2004. Real GDP growth is estimated at 6.8 percent (against an initial forecast of
6.3 percent), leading to an improvement in per capita income for the third consecutive year.
Inflation was below projections through July 2004, but rose sharply thereafter for the reasons
mentioned above. As a result, 12-month inflation rose to 9.2 percent at end-2004 and to
26.6 percent at end-May 2005. The consumer price index increased 18.9 percent in the first
five months of 2005, but has dropped in June.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
4.
The Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) experienced difficulties in containing broad
money growth and maintaining price stability in 2004. Indeed, money-financed budgetary
and extrabudgetary expenditures resulted in base money and broad money rising by
62 percent and 61 percent, respectively (against programmed growth rates of 26 percent and
29 percent, respectively, projected at a constant exchange rate). In order to mop up excess
liquidity, the BCC gradually increased its key interest rate from 6 percent in September 2004
to 20 percent in January 2005, to 65 percent in February, before lowering it to 40 percent at

- 40 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

end-June 2005. In addition, the BCC intervened on the foreign exchange market by selling
US$99 million between September 2004 and February 2005. Since then, the BCC has not
intervened in the foreign exchange market, except in May, when it purchased U.S. dollars to
supply banks with the equivalent of US$5.0 million in Congo francs.
5.
The measures taken by the BCC have effectively halted the growth of base money,
although they were not initially successful in stabilizing the exchange rate or inflation. The
worsening political and security situation accompanied by an easing of fiscal policy resulted
in a loss of market confidence inducing the market to take refuge in the U.S. dollar, which
explains the pressure observed in the exchange rate. Hence, the share of Congo franc deposits
in broad money declined from 7.3 percent at end-2004 to 6.5 percent at end-March 2005. In
view of the limited effectiveness of the available monetary policy instruments, the
government is cognizant of the importance of tightening fiscal policy in order to contain
money expansion.
6.
To improve the conduct of monetary policy, the BCC established in March 2005 the
Monetary Policy Monitoring Committee, whose main role is to assess economic conditions
and better anticipate the demand for Congo francs. The BCC also published a strategic
development plan aimed at strengthening its institutional and management capacity in
August 2004 and continued to implement the action plan prepared in collaboration with Fund
staff. With assistance from the National Bank of Belgium, the BCC undertook a preliminary
study on its recapitalization and another one on improving the structure of banknotes, which
currently include only small denominations.
Government finance
7.
As indicated above, the government made greater use of bank financing than
projected under the program. However, the overall deficit (on a cash basis) was less than
programmed—1.7 percent of GDP instead of 3.2 percent—principally because foreignfinanced expenditure was less than anticipated.
8.
Total revenue exceeded the target for 2004 thanks to increased taxes and royalties
collected from oil producers, in line with the rise in international oil prices, as well as a
strengthening of tax administration, and in particular of the Large Taxpayers Unit (DGE).
The level and composition of spending differed from what had been projected under the
program. Investment expenditure and poverty reduction spending were below their forecast
amounts, owing to difficulties encountered in the preparation of some projects and the
application of the new procurement procedures. Furthermore, a number of ministries
received less than their budget allocations, while payment orders issued in 2004 (in particular
for water and electricity) were executed in early 2005. In contrast, military spending and that
of political institutions were significantly larger than the program targets, mainly because of
the tensions in the eastern provinces and weaknesses in budget execution and monitoring.
Mindful of the need to enhance the transparency of military spending, the government,
through the High Defense Council, mandated an audit of the expenditures associated with

- 41 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

events in the eastern provinces during 2004, and the results will be made public by endJune 2005.
9.
Implementation of budget and tax reforms was slower than anticipated in 2004. The
law for customs tariff reform was adopted in July 2004, and the customs code was adopted
on June 21, 2005. Measures to modernize the domestic tax administration included
improvements in collection procedures and the opening of the first tax office for small- and
medium-sized enterprises. The law on the nomenclature for nontax revenue was promulgated
on July 22, 2004 and amended in March 2005 to incorporate the revenue formerly collected
by the autonomous agencies (former budgets pour ordre). The strengthening of tax
administration in the eastern provinces is starting to show results, with increasing tax revenue
being transferred to the treasury from these areas.
10.
On the expenditure side, and in accordance with the program, the government
continued to focus on strengthening budget management. As a result, the expenditure
management system, including the electronic data transfer between the BCC and the treasury,
has become operational since June 2005 (prior action). In addition, the payroll, the payment
of public debt, and externally financed expenditures have all been incorporated into the
public expenditure management system since April 2005. Furthermore, following the
publication of the circular governing the opening and functioning of government accounts
with commercial banks, more than 240 bank accounts have been closed (prior action).
Finally, all measures have been taken to produce the monthly budget monitoring reports,
which track budget execution according to the economic and administrative classifications
within 30 days after the end of the month. Starting in June 2005, these reports are forwarded
monthly to the government and quarterly to parliament (prior action).
Balance of payments
11.
In spite of a generally favorable international environment in 2004, the external
current account deficit, including grants, is estimated at 5.5 percent of GDP, compared with
3.3 percent of GDP projected under the program. Imports rose strongly due to the continued
economic recovery and the rise in investment, and this offset a surge in exports on account of
higher oil and cobalt prices in international markets and an increase in mining production
following the opening up of new mines. Overall, international gross reserves rose to the
equivalent of 5.2 weeks of imports of goods and services at end-2004, compared with
6.2 weeks envisaged in the program.
External debt
12.
The government honored in full its external debt service commitments in 2004.
Regarding debt relief, the government signed bilateral agreements on Cologne terms with all
Paris Club creditors except the United States. An extension of the deadline to December
2005 for signing all bilateral agreements has been granted by the Paris Club secretariat. The
government has signed agreements with 32 commercial creditors, and negotiations are
underway with five other creditors. The average debt relief granted to the Kinshasa Club

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

amounted to 70 percent of the stock of debt. However, two creditors are seeking payments
through the judicial courts, and new creditors are introducing old claims on the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The government and the BCC have neither contracted nor guaranteed
any nonconcessional external debt.
Other structural reforms
13.
The law on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism and the
anticorruption law were promulgated in August 2004 and March 2005, respectively. In
September 2004, the government adopted the report and action plan for the reform of the
public procurement process. The decree on the organization and operation of the Public
Procurement Reform Commission (COREMAP) was signed, and the members of this
Commission have been appointed. With assistance of the European Union and other donors,
the audit of the judicial system was completed, which will enable the government to draw up
an action plan aimed at its strengthening. Agreement was also reached on the terms and
conditions for the settlement of government debt to the private sector. The implementation of
the repayment plan will begin during the third quarter of 2005, with US$42.5 million in
financing granted by the World Bank.
14.
In the mining sector, the international bid to select an auditor for the parastatal
diamond mining company MIBA could not be held by end-September 2004 as planned
(structural performance criterion), because the anticipated foreign financing was not
available. However, the government decided to finance this audit with domestic funds.
Following an international tender offer launched in January 2005, an international consulting
firm was selected in July 2005. Similarly, the international bids to select consulting firms to
conduct the audits of SENGAMINES and CEEC18 were delayed, but will be requested in
June 2005. In addition, the restructuring of the Mining Registry (CAMI) continued, and a
provisional management committee began its work in October 2004. The one-stop window
for the delivery of mining permits reopened in March 2005 after a strengthening of its
operations. To safeguard the tax receipts generated by mining activities, the government has
selected by competitive bidding a specialized firm to ensure strict control of quantities and
prices declared at exports.
Social policy
15.
Progress made in implementing social sector reforms was satisfactory in 2004. An
initial draft of the Government Report on Health and Poverty (RESP) was finalized in
December 2004 and will serve as the basis for the preparation of the sector strategy, to be
completed by end-August 2006. In the field of education, the government finalized, in
September 2004, the Status Report on the National Education System (RESEN), which
assesses the sector’s constraints, and adopted a draft action plan for the Education for All
18

- 43 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

(EFA) Initiative. The RESEN and the EFA programs will serve as the basis for the
preparation of the overall education sector strategy, to be completed by August 2006.
GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2005
16.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework has been revised to take into account
recent developments in the domestic economy and the external environment, including the
increases in prices of oil and raw materials in the international markets. The 2005 budget,
adopted by parliament in March 2005, contains a large increase in expenditure to fund
interlinked programs and reforms tied to the political transition process. These programs
include the holding of free, democratic, and transparent elections; the implementation of the
National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) Program; and the
reintegration and reorganization of the army and the police. The budget also contains funding
for the continuation of economic reforms.
17.
To contain the inflationary pressures that could potentially result from the increase in
expenditure, the government plans to implement appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.
Accordingly, the following macroeconomic targets have been set for 2005: (a) a real GDP
growth of 6.6 percent; (b) an end-of-period annual inflation of 22.6 percent; and (c) an
external current account deficit, including grants, of 5.1 percent of GDP.
Fiscal policy
18.
The primary objective of fiscal policy in 2005 is to contribute to restoring
macroeconomic stability, while improving budgetary expenditure allocations in favor of the
social sectors and programs associated with the political transition process. This will entail
improving government revenue by strengthening tax administration and introducing tax
reforms, continuing efforts to combat corruption and fraud, and increasing the mining
sector’s contribution.
19.
Taking into account macroeconomic developments through April 2005, the
government’s fiscal objective for 2005 is to contain the budget deficit, on a cash basis and
including grants, at 2.2 percent of GDP. This entails a major effort, since the domestic fiscal
balance (on a cash basis) would have to yield a surplus equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP
compared with a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004. The fiscal objective takes into
account payment orders issued in 2004 and settled in 2005 (0.5 percent of GDP) and seeks to
reduce net bank credit to the government in order to assist the central bank in its conduct of
monetary policy.
20.
The 2005 budget will be financed with external budgetary support (2.5 percent of
GDP) and foreign financing for investment projects and exceptional outlays tied to the
political process (10.5 percent of GDP), confirmed during the Consultative Group meeting in
Kinshasa (November 2004). In particular, the 2005 budget allocations for the elections and
for the reintegration of the army and the police are based on amounts that can be either
financed with government resources or with confirmed international donor support.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

However, such budget appropriations are substantially smaller than what was initially
estimated, and, thus, should additional resources become available, the government will
submit a budget supplement to the National Assembly in which budget allocations for these
two projects will be increased.
21.
Total revenue is expected to increase from 9.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to
10.7 percent of GDP in 2005. This increase is explained by (i) the extension of all taxes and
fees to all provinces; (ii) an increase in oil revenue; (iii) the strengthening of tax
administration; and (iv) the implementation of new measures expected to generate additional
revenue amounting to CGF 12 billion per year. The latter include (a) the extension of the
tobacco tax stamps throughout the country; (b) the payment of mining royalties by all
exporters of mining products and by all mining processing industries throughout the country;
(c) the payment to the treasury of one half of the area fees collected by the Mining Registry;
(d) the signing by government of a contract on behalf of the customs office (OFIDA) with an
international preshipment inspection company (before end-June 2005); (e) the doubling of
the forestry area fee to US$0.20 per hectare effective January 1, 2005; and (f) the collection
by the tax department responsible for managing state properties (DGRAD) of levies
previously collected by autonomous agencies. With regard to the latter, interministerial
decrees enabling the DGRAD to collect the levies will be signed before mid-June 2005 (prior
action).
22.
Total government expenditure is expected to increase from 13.3 percent of GDP in
2004 to 22.1 percent of GDP in 2005, primarily as a result of increases in spending related to
the political transition process and the restructuring of the economy (4.6 percent of GDP) and
to public investment (4.1 percent of GDP). However, current expenditure (excluding interest
payments) are projected to decline. In addition, the government will increase the share of
poverty reducing expenditure, particularly by making greater use of debt relief made
available under the HIPC Initiative. Accordingly, the government will use up to 0.2 percent
of GDP of HIPC resources to finance the operating expenses of nursery, primary, secondary,
and technical schools, and has put mechanisms in place to monitor their utilization.
Conversely, the operating expenses of ministries and political institutions will be reduced by
1.7 percent of GDP from their 2004 level, in particular by cutting expenses associated with
missions, including through a 20 percent reduction in daily allowances (prior action). To
improve budget execution, the ministries will be notified of their budget appropriations on a
monthly basis and no overruns will be allowed. Centralized payments will be reduced by
0.4 percent of GDP compared with 2004 by setting a quarterly ceiling on consumption of
petroleum products for each ministry. In addition, lump-sum payments have been negotiated
with SNEL and REGIDESO for electricity and water expenses until the billing of actual
consumption is made possible by the installation of meters in all ministries, which is
expected to be completed in June 2005.
23.
Improving government personnel living standards and the strengthening of civil
service management are among the main priorities of the government. In this context, while
maintaining the wage bill at CGF 124 billion the government has introduced in the 2005
budget new allowances for civil servants and increased wages for the police by 20 percent.

- 45 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

The wage bill for the army was kept unchanged in 2005 as any pay increases are to be based
on savings realized with the implementation of the demobilization (DDR) program. The
wage appropriation for political institutions has been reduced, and takes partially into
account the cost of separation allowances for political appointees who might lose their
positions after the elections. In order to observe the ceiling on the wage bill, the government
has started applying the civil service census preliminary results for Kinshasa with the payroll
for April 2005. Accordingly, only civil servants who were identified in the census are now
paid, which could reduce their number by more than one-third. In addition, the results of the
military census in Kinshasa will be applied to the August 2005 pay (structural performance
criterion). The results of the census in the rest of the country will be applied as soon as they
become available, and in the fourth quarter of 2005, at the latest. The government will not
grant any increases in wages or benefits before applying the results of the census conducted
in the whole country to the payroll. In addition, the increase in the wage bill planned for the
social sectors will be financed with HIPC resources for an amount equivalent to 0.4 percent
of GDP.
24.
Pending the introduction of an integrated payroll management system, the
government will implement, beginning in September 2005, a simplified transitional system
that will make it possible to control civil service employment and streamline the payroll. The
government will also transfer the paymasters (comptables payeurs) to the treasury and will
ensure that verified and initialed payroll lists are returned to the accounting officers as well
as the ministries in charge of the civil service and the budget. With respect to retirements,
10,000 civil servants will retire and receive their allowances, financed by the World Bank,
beginning in August 2005. In addition, a list of the active personnel eligible for the second
phase of the retirement program will be drawn up after completion of the census. Pending the
completion of the DDR program and the integration of the army, the government will
establish an independent monitoring commission, with assistance from its external partners,
to ensure that salaries and other benefits are regularly received by military personnel.
25.
The reform of tax and customs administration will continue in 2005 (Table 1). A draft
law will be submitted to parliament in September 2005 with a view to correcting the
distortions identified in the customs tariff. The government will reduce the level of tax
exemptions, strictly limiting them to those provided by the provisions of the various codes.
Before their approval, all new exemptions will be submitted to the Council of Ministers with
a quantification of their budgetary impact. To facilitate and expedite customs clearance
procedures, a presidential decree will designate OFIDA as the sole agency intervening at the
one-stop window in Matadi and in assessing the value of imports (structural performance
criterion for end-September 2005). In this connection, OFIDA will collect all tax and fees on
imports, including those for the account of other agencies such as OCC, OGEFREM, and
ONATRA. For that purpose a manual of harmonized customs procedures will be
implemented by October 2005. The role of OCC will be strictly limited to controlling
merchandise quality, quantity, and conformity, in accordance with Article 3 of the
Ordinance-Law No. 74-013 of January 10, 1974. In addition, OFIDA will be converted into a
General Directorate of the Ministry of Finance after the adoption of the laws modifying the
status of public enterprises. Moreover, to repress fraud and corruption at the borders, the

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

government is examining the possibility of using the services of a private firm to check
customs declarations. Regarding the General Tax Directorate, the government will strengthen
the operation of the Large Taxpayers Unit and improve control of the tax base through the
generalized use of taxpayer identification numbers.
26.
The government will improve budget execution and the transparency of fiscal
management by implementing the measures mentioned in the attached Table 1. It will limit
recourse to the system of fund advances to only the cases allowed by law (for instance for the
operating expenses of schools). These advances will be renewed only after the Ministry of
Budget has received the documents justifying the use of previous advances. The Ministry of
Budget will notify ministries of the monthly commitment plan for each budget line, starting
in June 2005. In addition, only expenditures approved by the Ministry of Budget and the
Ministry of Finance will be carried out by the BCC, and at least 95 percent of all
expenditures will be processed through electronic payment orders (OPIs). In addition, all
payments undertaken by the BCC on behalf of the government will be made within 48 hours
from the receipt of the OPI, and all amounts debited from, or credited to, the account of the
treasury at the BCC will be reported to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Budget
within 48 hours (prior action). By end-July 2005, the BCC will report to the treasury the
balances of government accounts each business day.
27.
The government has received an analysis on the financial implications of the draft
law on decentralization, which was prepared with the support of International Monetary Fund
staff, and submitted it to the National Assembly. The government will ensure that any
transfer of resources be accompanied by an equivalent transfer of spending responsibilities.
For 2005, the government has continued to adhere to the current principle of decentralization
and will ensure that the provinces’ budgets remain in balance. The government intends to
draw up a list of technical assistance needs and priorities to build administrative capacities in
the provinces in 2005.
Monetary and exchange rate policies, and reform of the financial system
28.
The government will continue to support the independence of the central bank, which
has sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy. The objective will be to restore
price stability within a floating exchange rate system, and particularly to reduce 12-month
inflation to 22.6 percent by end-2005. In this context, it is projected that money supply and
base money at current exchange rate will increase by 25.6 percent and 10.7 percent,
respectively, in 2005, or by less than the growth rate of nominal GDP, given the sizable
increase in the money supply recorded in 2004. The BCC will adopt an interest rate policy
that would allow it to meet the objectives for inflation and the growth of the monetary base,
with interest rates being gradually adjusted to take into account recent economic
developments. As mentioned above, net bank credit to the government is expected to
decrease by CGF 26 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) while the gross foreign assets of the BCC
are expected to increase from 5.2 weeks of imports at end-2004 to 7.2 weeks at end-2005.
Furthermore, to enhance credibility, the BCC has widely disseminated the objectives of
monetary policy and intends to report regularly on monetary policy implementation. As

- 47 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

regards currency, the BCC will proceed with caution in issuing higher-denomination
banknotes and will conduct a public awareness campaign in this regard.
29.
To improve its operations, the BCC will continue to implement its strategic action
plan in line with the plan prepared in cooperation with the staff of the International Monetary
Fund (Table 1). To this end, it will apply the new regulatory framework for its interventions
on the foreign exchange market and irrevocably guarantee the convertibility of banks’ free
reserves into currency. The BCC will also strengthen its human and technical capacities for
the conduct of monetary policy and ensure that the information necessary for the formulation
and monitoring of monetary policy is promptly available. In that regard, the BCC will work
closely with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Budget on the preparation of the
government cash flow plan. To limit the central bank losses to the amount included in the
government budget (CGF 14 billion), the BCC will adhere to its monthly cash flow plan.
Furthermore, to eliminate the losses of the BCC, the government will adopt the strategy for
restructuring the balance sheet of the central bank before end-September 2005 (structural
performance criterion).
30.
The BCC will strengthen its supervision of financial and microfinance institutions
with a view to preventing any systemic risk of illiquidity and insolvency. In particular, it will
launch the banking supervision computer application (BSA) by end-February 2006. The
restructuring of the banking system will be continued, with five of the nine banks in
operation implementing restructuring plans. For the three state banks being liquidated, the
implementation of the social plan financed by the World Bank will be completed by endJune 2005. In July 2004, the government submitted to parliament draft laws to strengthen the
tax and regulatory framework for banks, and will seek their inclusion on the agenda for the
parliamentary session of the third quarter of 2005. The central bank will also publish a
directive barring anonymous shareholders and will define criteria for the selection of bank
shareholders. In addition, the government will introduce a legal framework for nonmutual
microfinance institutions, the draft of which will be prepared by the BCC by end-2005.
External sector
31.
Despite the expected growth of exports resulting from the solid performance of the
diamond, cobalt, and copper sectors, the trade deficit is likely to widen in 2005 owing to the
increase in imports related to public and private investment projects. Consequently, the
external current deficit will reach 5.1 percent of GDP in 2005, compared with 5.5 percent of
GDP in 2004.
32.
The government will continue to conduct a prudent debt policy. It will seek to sign all
the bilateral debt relief agreements and convince all creditors to participate in the enhanced
HIPC Initiative. The government is working with the World Bank on the repurchase of debt
vis-à-vis London Club creditors. As regards commercial debt, the government will hire an
audit firm to review the terms and conditions of all agreements signed with individual
creditors and to certify the validity of new claims before negotiating debt relief agreements
on terms similar to those of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Any borrowing contracted (or

- 48 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

guaranteed) by the public sector, including by the BCC and the decentralized administrative
entities (EADs), will observe the level of concessionality defined in the technical
memorandum of understanding. Meanwhile, the installation of the new public debt
management software, with support from external partners, will be completed by endAugust 2006.
Good governance and other structural reforms
33.
The government is very concerned by the level of corruption, which undermines
many sectors of the economy, and is determined to combat it. First, it intends to
strengthen budget procedures and increase the publication of information necessary to
monitor budget execution. Second, following promulgation of the anticorruption law in
March 2005, the authorities plan to conduct an information campaign to disseminate this law
as well as the Code of Conduct for the Civil Service. Third, it will pursue the audits of public
enterprises and financial agencies in Kinshasa and in the reunified territories. Fourth, the
government is determined to reduce fraud at the borders by strengthening controls and
streamlining procedures. Finally, the first two commercial courts are scheduled to open in the
third quarter of 2005.
34.
The government will implement a significant number of structural reforms in
2005, including those indicated in Table 1. The legal framework for the reorganization of
public enterprises has been completed, and the four draft laws on the subject were submitted
to parliament in February 2005. In addition, plans to reorganize eight key public enterprises
should be completed by end-2005. A reorganization plan for the oil distribution company
(COHYDRO) will be finalized by end-July 2005 and the financial audit will be completed by
end-August 2005. The strategic audit of the Enterprise Council (Conseil Supérieur du
Portefeuille) will be completed by end-July 2005.
35.
In the mining sector, the government will ensure that it contributes more to the
development of the economy and to government revenue. To this end, it will strictly enforce
the provisions of the Mining Code and will complete the reorganization of the Mining
Registry by end-September 2005 on the basis of the financial and organizational audits. With
regard to GECAMINES, a private firm will manage the enterprise for 18 months starting
before end-June 2005. In the diamond sector, upon conclusion of the audits of the main
enterprises in the sector, the government, with support from the international community,
will prepare a development strategy aimed at ensuring that the sector can further contribute to
growth.
36.
In the forestry sector, the government will focus on implementation of the Forestry
Code, including the reforms already decided upon (see Table 1). In particular, in line with the
Code, the government will implement the program for converting the former concessions
into sustainable development concessions. In addition, before end-July 2005, the government
will confirm by presidential decree the moratorium on awarding forestry concessions
pending the completion of the conversion process and the implementation of the concession
award procedures provided in the Forestry Code. Finally, before end-June 2005, the

- 49 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

government will publish the lists of the concessions that remain valid and those canceled for
failure to pay forest area royalties for 2003, as well as a report on the forest royalties
collected in 2003 and 2004 (prior action).
37.
Regarding the DDR program, the following actions have been initiated:
disarmament of former combatants (September 2004); establishment of a safety net for
former combatants; and the opening of orientation centers (early 2005). This should make it
possible to demobilize 50,000 former combatants in 2005.
38.
The draft of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was circulated to
civil society and to development partners in May 2005. This version defines the
government’s priorities. However, the macroeconomic framework as well as a quantified
estimate of the cost and impact of the proposed strategies have yet to be prepared. Following
the incorporation of the 1-2-3 survey in Kinshasa and the surveys on the perception of
poverty in the provinces into the paper, the final PRSP is expected to be adopted by
government in the fourth quarter of 2005 as planned, following consultations with the
development partners.
39.
The government intends to build its statistical capacities with support from the
international community, in particular the resident expert from the International Monetary
Fund. Emphasis will be placed on improving the national accounts, the balance of payments,
price indexes, and public debt management. The government will also request financial and
technical support from the international community for strengthening administrative
capacities for gathering and processing statistical information at the province level, where
such capabilities are currently extremely weak.
III. PROGRAM MONITORING, PRIOR ACTIONS, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND INDICATORS
40.
The Interministerial Committee Responsible for Monitoring Programs Concluded
with International Financial Institutions (CISPI), chaired by the Minister of Finance, and the
Interministerial Commission Responsible for Formulation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy,
chaired by the Minister of Planning, will continue to implement the measures of the
Government Economic Program and the poverty reduction strategy. The work of the two
commissions will be supported by the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee comprising
the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Budget and the Governor of the BCC, assisted by a
technical committee of the two ministries and the BCC (the technical troika), as well as the
Technical Committee for the Reforms. The Economic and Financial Commission will
continue to ensure the coordination of all programs. The government’s Letter of Intent and
the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies will be disseminated to all political
institutions, the central and provincial administrations, and civil society.
41.
To ensure the complete success of the program, the government will implement the
prior actions indicated in Table 2, and program execution will be monitored via performance
criteria for end-September 2005 and structural benchmarks up to end-September 2005
(Tables 10 and 2).

1/ Including interest due to the IMF.
2/ Excluding repayments to the IMF.
3/ The Naples flow rescheduling was concluded in September 2002. It provided for a rescheduling of arrears and current debt service on eligible debt during the consolidation
period (July 2002-June 2005) after a cancellation of 67 percent in net present value (NPV) terms of arrears outstanding at June 30, 2002 and of current debt service during the
consolidation period. In addition, the Paris Club treatment provided for a capitalization of moratorium interest on debt that has been rescheduled. To facilitate the clearance of
arrears on short-term debt and post-cutoff-date (June 30, 1983) debt, as well as the servicing of post-cutoff-date debt, the Paris Club treatment envisaged a repayment of the
amounts due in accordance with a new payments schedule.
4/ At the end of 2002, arrears outstanding to Paris Club creditors had been cleared, and, accordingly, Naples flow rescheduling applies only to current debt service.
5/ Including the capitalization of moratorium interest.
6/ It takes into account the Naples flow rescheduling, the capitalization of moratorium interest, the Cologne flow rescheduling, the additional debt-service relief beyond the
Cologne flow rescheduling, the grants provided by multilateral creditors in the context of the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the impact of the stock-of-debt operation (including any
additional cancellation beyond the HIPC Initiative) at the completion point on debt service. The data also take into account the rescheduling agreements that have already been
signed with some commercial creditors as well as the impact on debt service of the accumulation of arrears to non-Paris Club creditors.
7/ The amount of HIPC assistance deposited into a special account at the central bank. For bilateral and commercial creditors, it includes the debt relief resulting from the
enhanced HIPC Initiative (excluding debt relief beyond the HIPC Initiative) following the use of all traditional debt-relief mechanisms, including a hypothetical stock-of-debt
operation on Naples terms. Only assistance based on rescheduling agreeements that have been concluded are taken into account. For multilateral creditors, it includes the amount of
HIPC grants that are made available for the purpose of delivering their share of assistance under the Initiative.

Translated from French

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Kinshasa, August 6, 2005
1.
This memorandum covers the agreements on monitoring implementation of the
program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). It establishes the information to be reported and the
deadlines for its submission to the IMF staff for program monitoring. It defines the
quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks, as well as the structural performance
criteria and benchmarks presented in the memorandum on economic and financial policies
(MEFP) of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is
attached to the letter of August 6, 2005 to the Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund.
A.

Monitoring Program Implementation

2.
Implementation of the program covering the period April 1, 2002–March 31, 2006
will be monitored on the basis of the performance criteria and benchmarks described in the
MEFP, para. 39 and Tables 2 and 3.

B.

Definition of Quantitative Performance Criteria and Indicators

3.
The quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks described in the MEFP,
Table 3 are as follows:
(a)

floor on net foreign assets of the central bank (BCC);

(b)

ceiling on net domestic assets of the BCC;

(c)

ceiling on net bank credit to the government;

(d)

ceiling on new nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the
government, including those contracted by the decentralized autonomous entities
(EADs) or the BCC, with maturities of more than one year, except borrowing for debt
rescheduling purposes, and IMF credit;

(e)

ceiling on new nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the
government, and loans contracted by the EADs and the BCC, with maturities of one

- 63 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

year or less, except borrowing for debt rescheduling purposes, IMF credit, and normal
import credits (suppliers’ credits), excluding imports of petroleum products;
(f)

ceiling on wage arrears (including all forms of compensation except nonrecurring
bonuses) for the civil service (civilian and military);

(g)

floor on poverty reduction expenditures financed with own resources (including HIPC
resources);

The following criteria will be monitored on a continuous basis:
(h)

the BCC shall make no budgetary expenditure payment that has not been authorized
in advance by the Ministry of Finance;

(i)

the BCC shall make no purchase of Congo franc banknotes or foreign exchange in the
market at a discount (décote) against payment in bank money; and

(j)

the government shall not accumulate external payments arrears on nonreschedulable
debt, on debt service resulting from debt rescheduling agreements, and on any new
borrowing. Arrears are any late payments on the debt service beyond the grace period
(30 days after due date, unless otherwise stated).

Definitions
4.
Net foreign assets of the BCC are defined as the difference between the BCC's gross
foreign assets and all its foreign liabilities, as shown in the “BCC Balance Sheet” prepared by
the BCC. For purposes of the relevant performance criterion, the net foreign assets will be
valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rates at the end of the period, and then converted into
Congo francs at the program exchange rate: US$l = CGF 444.1; SDR 1 = CGF 687.4; and
€ 1 = CGF 605.3.
5.
The net domestic assets of the BCC are equal to the sum of the following line items,
as they appear in the BCC balance sheet, except for ‘other items, net’ which are valued in
Congo francs at the current exchange rate. For the relevant performance criterion, domestic
assets will be adjusted for the effect of the Congo francs/U.S. dollar exchange rate variation
from the programmed rate on net foreign assets and foreign exchange deposits and provisions
for imports, and on “other items, net” (revaluation) (see para 4 above):
•

net claims on the government;

•

claims on nonfinancial public enterprises;

•

claims on the nonfinancial private sector;

•

claims on banks;

•

claims on other banking and nonbank institutions; and

- 64 -

•

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

“other items, net,” defined as other assets minus other liabilities (including capital and
revaluation accounts, and liquidity management instruments (billets de trésorerie)
purchased by deposit money banks and the public).

6.
Net banking system credit to the government is defined as the sum of net claims of
the central bank and of deposit money banks on the government, as defined in the “Integrated
Monetary Survey” prepared by the BCC (excluding deposits linked to project-related
assistance; see para. 7 above), plus the BCC’s net cash deficit. Items under net bank credit to
the government are valued at the current exchange rates.
7.
One hundred percent of any surplus (shortfall) over (under) the programmed amount
of external budgetary assistance (excluding project assistance), net of debt service and
including external debt service rescheduling and relief under the HIPC initiative, that has not
been used to finance poverty-reduction expenditure, public enterprise restructuring, and
domestic debt repayment (limited to cross-arrears certified by the World Bank staff) will be
used to reduce (increase) net banking system credit to the government, and the corresponding
performance criterion will be adjusted downward (upward) accordingly. The criteria on BCC
net foreign assets and net domestic assets will be adjusted upward (downward) and
downward (upward), respectively, by the same amount. Expenditures and bank deposits
relating to the national Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) program,
elections, and domestic debt are considered projects. This adjustment does not apply to HIPC
resources, which will be deposited in a special account in the BCC.
8.
The amount to be deposited in the HIPC subaccount will be determined as follows:
(a) for bilateral and commercial creditors, as the difference between the debt service due after
possible stock treatment under the Naples terms at end-2002 and post-HIPC service due
(excluding relief beyond the HIPC Initiative), including only arrangements that have been
signed or are to be signed within the year; and (b) for multilateral creditors, as the difference
between the service due after consolidation of arrears and post-HIPC service. The transfer of
the above defined amount will be credited to the HIPC subaccount (subaccount of the
Treasury General Account in the BCC) in the same month that said relief is realized (i.e., on
the date the service on the original debt owed is due, but cancelled under the HIPC
Initiative). The procedure for using the HIPC subaccount is set out in the IMF staff report on
the HIPC decision point (www.imf.org, July 15, 2003).
9.
The wage bill owed comprises all types of remuneration for verification, payment
orders, and payment (by the treasury), payable to state officials during the month in question
(active and retired civil servants, military personnel, national police and security personnel,
diplomats, and members of political and traditional institutions), including regular
compensation and bonuses, and not including nonrecurring compensation. Under the
program, wage arrears are defined for each month as the unpaid wage bill owed to officials at
the end of the following month. For remuneration paid in the provinces, the arrears are
valuated partly on the basis of the balances of the accounts of the provincial delegated
payment authorization officers (ODs) in the Treasury General Account in the BCC. This
definition will apply starting with the January 2005 pay date.

- 65 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

10.
The definition of external debt can be found in Decision 6230-(79/140), para. 9,
revised on August 24, 2000 (Annex I).
11.
The grant element of borrowing will be calculated on the basis of currency-specific
rates based on the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRR) on the date the contract
is signed, as specified in Annex I. A loan is defined as concessional if, on the date the
contract is signed, the ratio of the present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the
reference interest rate, to its nominal value is less than 65 percent (i.e., including a grant
element of at least 35 percent).
12.

Broad money is defined as the sum of the following:

•

currency in circulation (in and outside banks);

•

deposits of banks with the BCC;

•

deposits of public enterprises with the BCC;

•

deposits of private enterprises and individuals with the BCC; and

•

deposits of other financial institutions, other than deposit money banks, with the
BCC, and;

•

foreign exchange deposits and provisions for imports.

Note: “Base money” excludes all billets de trésorerie issued by the BCC, which are
counted as other BCC liabilities, and which are included in BCC net domestic assets.
Narrow money is defined as broad money less foreign exchange deposits and provisions
for imports. For the quantitative indicator, it is valued at the program exchange rate
(see para. 4 above).

The following concepts are used in the letter of intent and the memorandum on
economic and financial policies:
(a)

Budget: annual law authorizing the government's financial operations. Transfers to
the provinces are included, but the provinces' own revenues are not covered. The
social security system is not consolidated in the budget;

(b)

Special budgets (budgets pour ordre): autonomous agencies and entities receiving
earmarked revenues that, like their expenditures, are covered in the budget. The
special budgets have been eliminated and the corresponding revenue and expenditure
have been included in the 2005 budget;

(c)

Supplementary budgets (budgets annexes) (533 in the 2004 budget): agencies and
entities similar to administrative public enterprises, which are funded primarily by
government transfers (rétrocessions) and subsidies;

- 66 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

(d)

Extrabudgetary accounts: accounts receiving government revenue not tracked by the
Treasury Management and Payment Authorization Directorate, or not included in the
supplementary budgets. The consolidation of these accounts with those that are
regularly monitored by the Treasury Management and Payment Authorization
Directorate is necessary for a complete picture of budget execution;

(e)

Poverty-reduction expenditure: “pro-poor” spending as defined in the new
nomenclature on the basis of the priorities set forth in the I-PRSP and detailed in
Annex II.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II
ANNEX I

Definition of External Debt
1.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a) As set out in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Borrowing adopted by the IMF's Executive Board on August 24, 2000, debt is
understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability created under a
contractual agreement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in
the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future points in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payment until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which
property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified
period(s) of time, which are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the arrangement, excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the
definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes
debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
(b) A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of the
present value of the loan, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal value of
the loan is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent). The
reference interest rates used in this assessment are the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year
reference interest rate published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element.
For shorter maturities, the six-month market reference rate is used.

Budget Tracking Statements
Statement 1: Main budget tracking statement. Monthly, starting in January 2005.
This statement describes expenditures according to the four phases of the expenditure
chain (commitment, verification, payment order, and payment), on the one hand, and
by type of expenditure, on the other, and cumulatively from the start of the fiscal year
(2004 Revised Classification).
This statement should also have two intermediate columns for payment authorizations
sent to the BCC and payment authorizations pending transmission to the BCC.
A specific column for automatic payments (décaissements d'office) will also be placed
next to the column for payment authorizations.
The last column of the main budget tracking statement is the “Balances Outstanding”
(Restes à Payer comptables, RAP) column, which is the difference between payment
orders signed by the responsible payment authorizing officer and actual payments by
the BCC (not the difference between payment authorizations sent to the BCC and
actual payments by the BCC).
Statement 2: Budget tracking statement by administrative classification. Monthly,
starting in January 2005.
Based on the main statement, this document will present expenditures by
administrative classification. Additionally, the statement will keep expenditures
initiated by, and earmarked for, the Offices of Ministers (Cabinets) separate from those
initiated by, and earmarked for, the administrations.
Statement 3: By type and administration.
Based on the main statement, this document will present expenditures by type and
administration.
Statement 4: Budget tracking statement, by “Major Government Functions.”
Monthly, starting in January 2005.
This document will present expenditures by major government function.
Statement 5: Budget tracking statement, “Poverty-Reducing Expenditures.”
Monthly, starting in January 2005.
Based on Statement 2, expenditures will be presented by type, with one line indicating
the share of expenditures identified as poverty-reducing expenditures.
Statement 6: Budget tracking statement by geographical distribution. Monthly,
starting in January 2005.
Based on the balances of the main statement, this document will present expenditures
by type, distinguishing between expenditures in Kinshasa and those in the provinces.
Computer tools and training permitting, separate service codes will be assigned for
Kinshasa and for each province; this will permit tracking of the distribution of
expenditures among the 11 geographical areas.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) currency is the Congo franc, which, since
May 26, 2001, has been freely floating. On December 30, 2004, the rate was US$1=Congo
francs 444.09.
Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and
4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. However, the DRC maintains measures that give rise to one
restriction and one multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit
position vis-à-vis other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with
the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL). The multiple currency practice
involves a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly basis applying to transactions through the bilateral
payments agreement (BPA) with Zimbabwe.
X. Last Article IV Consultation:
(a) Consultations with the Democratic Republic of the Congo are held in accordance with the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
(b) The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 24, 2003
(www.imf.org, 2/5/03).
XI. Safeguards Assessment
Under the IMF’s safeguards assessment policy, the BCC is subject to an assessment with respect to
the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on June 12, 2002, and is scheduled to expire on
June 11, 2005. A safeguards assessment of the BCC was completed on January 3, 2003. The
assessment concluded that substantial risks of misreporting or misuse may exist due to vulnerabilities
in the external audit mechanism, financial reporting framework, and system internal controls. Staff

APPENDIX III

Democratic Republic of the Congo:
Relations with the World Bank Group19
Introduction
1.
This annex first underscores the importance that the government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) attaches to effective partnership with external creditors,
donors, and foreign investors. It then summarizes the strategy and activities of the World
Bank Group (IDA, IFC, and MIGA) in the DRC. It concludes with a description of areas of
specific collaboration between the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.
Partnership in the DRC’s development strategy
2.
The DRC was cut off from international financial assistance from 1993 until 2001,
primarily due to economic and financial mismanagement, conflict, and war. From 1997 to
2001, the conflict and its socioeconomic impact led to over 3.8 million deaths, most of which
were due to disease and hunger, as well as to extensive destruction of infrastructure and the
collapse of institutions.
3.
When President Joseph Kabila took office following his father’s death in
January 2001, he sought to reestablish relations with international financial institutions. The
IMF responded with a staff-monitored program (SMP), covering the period June 1, 2001–
March 31, 2002, and in July 2001, IDA approved a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS),
initially underpinned by a US$50 million grant for an Emergency Early Recovery Project
(EERP).
4.
Progress toward peace and good performance under the SMP and the EERP has led to
substantial financial reengagement by multilateral and bilateral institutions. The Interim
PRSP (I-PRSP) was discussed by the IDA Board on June 11, 2002. Following clearance of
arrears to the IMF, a three-year PRGF and the HIPC preliminary document were approved,
and the I-PRSP was discussed and approved by IMF Executive Directors on June 12, 2002.
IDA’s Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), approved by the IDA Board on June 13, 2002,
became effective following arrears clearance on July 3, 2002. The Paris Club granted
significant relief on bilateral debt at its September 2002 meeting. The first review of the
PRGF was completed on March 24, 2003, at the same time as the IMF’s 2002 Article IV
consultation. The decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative was approved by IMF
Executive Directors on July 23, 2003 (at the same time as the conclusion of the second
review under the PRGF), and by IDA Executive Directors on July 24, 2003. In

reported that they had disbursed US$1.1 billion in assistance during 2004 and made pledges
in the order of US$5.7 billion in assistance over the next three to four years. The third PRGF
review was concluded by the IMF Board on March 3, 2004, and the fourth PRGF review was
concluded on July 12, 2004.
5.
The preparation of the PRSP is now a key focus of government efforts and the
object of close collaboration between IMF and IDA staffs. Following the preparation of the IPRSP in June 2002, the first and second annual Preparation Status Reports and related Joint
Staff Assessments (JSAs) have been produced, and were discussed by the IMF and IDA
Boards in July 2003 and 2004, respectively. The first draft of the PRSP was circulated among
development partners in May 2005 and included preliminary inputs from the provinces and
sectoral strategies. Community, sectoral, and thematic participatory consultations have been
completed. At the end of June 2005, the third Preparation Status Report will be available.
Poverty household surveys are currently underway in the provinces. The authorities plan to
complete preparation of the full PRSP during the last quarter of 2005.
Bank Group strategy and operations (IDA, IFC, and MIGA) 20
6.
Overall strategy. On July 31, 2001, the Executive Directors of IDA endorsed a
Transitional Support Strategy to map out Bank financial and nonfinancial support to the
DRC for the following 12–24 months, which included the EERP, the ERC, the Private Sector
Development and Competitiveness Project (PSDC), and the Emergency Multi-Sector
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRRP) (as described hereunder). A new TSS
was approved by the Board on February 26, 2004, and covers the period 2004–06.
7.
The 2004 TSS sets forth the scope and configuration of future support during the
2004–06 period. The TSS accompanies the government's efforts during the transition period,
with a particular focus on (i) social stability and security, (ii) high and shared growth,
(iii) governance and institutional strengthening, and (iv) social development. It forsees the
following projects:

20

•

FY04: Emergency Economic and Social Reunification Support Project; Southern
Africa Power Pool Project; HIV/AIDS Project; and Post-Reunification Economic
Recovery Credit.

•

FY05: Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project; Health Sector
Rehabilitation Project; Education Sector Rehabilitation Project; Emergency Living
Conditions Project; Emergency Social Action Program; and a development policy
support operation.

The Bank reopened a country office in Kinshasa, and a country manager assumed his duties in
January 2002.

Trust funds

9.
Since October 2000, the first emergency trust fund has financed the Emergency
Stabilization and Recovery Project to help communities via projects in the health, education,
food security, forestry, water supply (rural and peri-urban areas), and rural roads
rehabilitation sectors. These projects support street/abandoned children and capacity building
and assist the government in implementing its economic reform agenda by conducting a
number of key reform studies and coordinating donor assistance. IDA is administering this
US$13.54 million trust fund on behalf of Belgium, Canada, and the Netherlands. The
European Development Fund committee of the European Union has recently contributed
€ 9.5 million for capacity-building support to the DRC, which includes support to the
Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC), and selected line ministries.
2.

Grants and credits

Development policy support
10.
The Bank is providing support through policy reform operations—the Economic
Recovery Credit (ERC) and the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit (PRERC).
The ERC, approved in June 2002 in the amount of SDR 360.4 million (US$450 million
equivalent at the time of negotiations), provided support of SDR 270.7 million
(US$338 million) to the arrears-clearance process; and other balance of payments support of
SDR 57.7 million (US$72 million); support to a voluntary departures program,
SDR 20 million (US$25 million), at GECAMINES, the national copper mining company;
and support for forestry sector reforms of SDR 12 million (US$15 million). An additional
US$42 million was made available due to the appreciation of the SDR relative to the
U.S. dollar, and was used to finance key public expenditures. The operation was
satisfactorily implemented and closed in June 2003. The PRERC, approved in February 2004
in the amount of SDR 135.2 million (US$200 million equivalent at the time of negotiations),
provides balance of payments support of SDR 57.5 (US$85 million), support to civil service
retirement reform of SDR 32 (US$47.5 million), domestic debt settlement SDR 28.7 million
(US$42.5 million), and utilities billing and payment reform SDR 16.9 (US$25 million).
Conditionalities involve the adoption of adequate reform strategies plus fiduciary
arrangements to ensure that funds reach intended recipients. The utilities tranche was

- 83 -

APPENDIX III

disbursed in late 2004, and the remainder is expected to be released in 2005. The focus of the
proposed ERC III (FY06) development policy operation is on continuing to improve the
budget process, improving budget execution of pro-poor spending, implementing the civil
service management reforms, and increasing transparency on the revenue side.
Traditional investment operations
11.
The Bank is providing support through investment operations in the DRC in the areas
of (i) infrastructure rehabilitation—the Emergency Early Recovery Project (EERP), the
Emergency Multi-Sector Rehabilitation Project (EMRRP), the Emergency Economic and
Social Reunification Support Project, and the Southern Africa Power Market Project
(SAPM); (ii) demobilization and reintegration—the Emergency Demobilization and
Reintegration Project (EDRP); (iii) private sector development—the Private Sector
Development and Competitiveness Project (PSDC); and (iv) social development—
HIV/AIDS (Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Program). Implementation of projects to date is
satisfactory, except for the EDRP and Emergency Social Action Project.
12.
With respect to infrastructure rehabilitation, the EERP rehabilitated the MatadiKinshasa road and improved the security of the blood supply to prevent transmission of
HIV/AIDS. It has been fully disbursed. As of May 2005, some 80 percent of the EMRRP
funds (total credit and grant) had been committed. The Emergency Economic and Social
Reunification Support Project focuses on infrastructure rehabilitation in the reunified
provinces, and 46 percent of the credit has been disbursed. The SAPM will strengthen the
capacity of the Coordination Center of the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP) to promote
and manage electricity trade in the region; remove transmission bottlenecks; and connect
member countries to the regional grid, which will foster economic growth. The DRC
component is the largest and will enable the DRC to supply electricity to neighboring
countries. It was approved in November 2003, and implementation is in progress.
13.
With respect to demobilization and reintegration, the Emergency Demobilization
and Reintegration Project provides support to the demobilization and reintegration of
150,000 ex-combatants country-wide. The project was developed within the framework of
the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) for the Great Lakes
region, a regional partnership initiative comprising seven governments and over 40 donor
and multilateral agencies. The MDRP partners endorsed a US$100 million MDRP trust fund
grant (cofinancing) to complement IDA grant financing. Collaboration in the field between
the Bank and other donors and multilateral agencies is proceeding well, and IDA is paying
particular attention to the deepening of cooperation. Demobilization started in
February 2005. During 2005, former combatants will be disarmed, a secure payments system
will be established for them, and reintegration centers will be opened. These actions will
enable 20,000 former combatants to be demobilized in 2005.
14.
The Emergency Social Action Project, approved by the World Bank in August 2004,
will channel money to poor communities to finance socio-economic infrastructure
determined by the communities. This project is expected to become effective in July 2005.

- 84 -

APPENDIX III

15.
With respect to private sector development, the PSDC is helping reform inefficient
public enterprises and improving the investment climate to attract private investment, which
would contribute to economic growth. Looking ahead, a commercial debt-reduction project is
planned for FY06.
16.
With respect to HIV/AIDS, the Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS project, approved in
March 2004, is helping to mitigate the negative impact of HIV/AIDS on the socioeconomic
development of the DRC.

APPENDIX III

Nonlending activities
17.
For several years prior to and during the first TSS (2001), IDA assistance has also
emphasized nonlending activities and advisory services, including through trust funds and
grants, to improve the understanding of the socioeconomic context, rebuild the knowledge
base to support policy dialogue and design effective poverty-reduction strategies. FY03
activities included a Public Expenditure Review (focusing on the overall structure of
expenditures; specific issues in the health, education, and transport sectors; evaluation of the
DRC’s ability to monitor execution of poverty-related expenditures); strengthening of public
expenditure management systems; and support to the PRSP process, especially the
consultation and participatory diagnostic processes. Other FY03 activities were an update of
the poverty profile, and a Debt Sustainability Analysis for the HIPC Initiative program,
undertaken in collaboration with the IMF. For FY04, a Country Procurement Assessment
Review was undertaken. A first version of the Health Sector Country Status (CSR-Health)
report was completed in December 2004, which will feed into the PRSP. The final version of
the CSR-Health was sent to the Government on May 13, 2005. Other activities initiated in
FY04, and which continue into FY05, are the HIPC/AAP pro-poor expenditure-tracking
exercise; an Institutional Governance Review (focusing on service delivery issues); a
Forestry Sector Review; and preparation of an Agricultural Sector Review. An Education
Sector Country Status Report was completed in October 2004 and served as the basis for a
discussion of the preparation of a finance (priorities) strategy for the education sector. In
FY05, the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment was finalized; the CFAA exercise was
undertaken, and will be completed in FY06; and a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of
forestry sector reforms had been initiated, and will be completed in FY06. In FY06, a
workshop is planned for the dissemination of the Agricultural Sector Review; and
preparation for an agriculture lending project will begin.
International Finance Corporation
18.
IFC supported the cellular telephone operator Celtel with a US$7 million loan in 2002
and a further US$20 million in 2003. Currently, IFC is conducting a needs assessment of
local small and medium enterprises to help determine potential future interventions. IFC is
developing two potential mining investments, which would be among the first under the new
Mining Code. In the financial sector, IFC plans to assist banks operating in the DRC with
trade financing facilities, to help establish routine trade finance operations. IFC will work
closely with the Bank in the context of the PSDC project to help implement specific sectoral
initiatives and key investment projects. Considerable effort has already been spent in
resolving outstanding disputes in the DRC, one of which, UTEXAFRICA, a textile business,
was settled in 2002. However, two others remain on the books: SOTEXKI, a textile business
in Kisangani, in the northeast, and the Grand Hotel du Congo (formerly Inter-Continental).
MIGA
19.
MIGA can now issue guarantees for projects because the DRC has paid its initial
capital subscription in full. Several projects are under consideration, notably in the mining

- 87 -

APPENDIX III

sector. MIGA approved $13.3 million in guarantee coverage for the Dikulushi copper and
silver mine on May 3, 2005. The guarantees approved provide coverage for investments and
loans by Anvil Mining Ltd. of Canada and RMB International (Dublin) Limited of Ireland to
Anvil Mining Congo, SAR, of the DRC, against the risks of transfer restriction,
expropriation, breach of contract and war and civil disturbance. The project scope involves
open pit mining of copper and silver ores to produce a concentrate, which will be transported
to smelters in South Africa and Namibia for further processing. This is MIGA’s first
guarantee for the DRC; the latter has been a member of the agency since 2003. Moreover, the
project is the first extractive industries project to be considered and approved by the Board of
the World Bank Group, following conclusion of the Bank-sponsored Extractive Industries
Review in August 2004.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
20.
In addition to its direct assistance to the DRC, the Bank also supports policy reforms
in close collaboration with the Fund in a number of areas: donor coordination, public finance
management, decentralization, public enterprise reform, financial sector reform, governance
and anticorruption, and the PRSP process. Table 2 details areas of collaboration and areas
where the Bank and the Fund lead.

APPENDIX IV

Democratic Republic of the Congo: Progress Status of Triggers for Reaching the
Floating Completion Point
(As of June 2005)
Trigger

Status

1. PRSP

Completion of a full PRSP through a participatory
process and its implementation for one year, duly
documented in the DRC’s annual progress report, and
confirmed as satisfactory by a joint staff assessment
(JSA).

The first draft of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) was circulated to civil society and to
development partners in May 2005.
Following the incorporation of the 1-2-3 survey in
Kinshasa and the surveys on the perception of poverty
in the provinces into the paper, the final PRSP is
expected to be adopted by government in the fourth
quarter of 2005 as planned.

2. Macroeconomic stability

Continued maintenance of macroeconomic stability
after reaching the decision point, as evidenced by
satisfactory performance under a program supported
by an arrangement under the IMF’s PRGF.

The macroeconomic situation has improved since the
decision point but remains volatile as demonstrated by
large movements in exchange rate and inflation in the
first half of 2005.

3. Use of budgetary savings

Use of budgetary savings resulting from enhanced
HIPC Initiative-related debt service relief during the
interim period for poverty-related expenditures in
accordance with the I-PRSP, with supporting
documentation satisfactory to the staffs of IDA and
the IMF.

Due to weaknesses in institutional and implementation
capacity, the use of budgetary savings from the
enhanced HIPC Initiative has been lower than
programmed. The government is intensifying its
efforts to use HIPC savings to finance spending in the
areas of health and education.

4. Public expenditure management

(a) Implementation of a modernized budget-execution
system, providing information from commitment to
payment, and allowing for the monitoring of arrears;
(b) adoption and implementation of a double-entry
government accounting system and a new chart of
accounts; and (c) production of quarterly budget
execution reports using economic, administrative and
functional classifications.

(a) The budget-execution system is operational.
However, additional efforts are needed to ensure
timely and comprehensive transmission of information
to relevant parties;
(b) The double-entry system is yet to be implemented.
Progress in this area include training of staff;
(c) A new classification has been adopted. However,
the budgetary reports need further improvement.

5. Governance and service delivery in priority sectors

(a) Completion of a budget-tracking exercise on
health, education, rural development and
infrastructure expenditure, consisting of (i) monitoring
the execution of poverty-related public expenditure;
(ii) evaluation by user groups of the quality of related
public services, and (iii) evaluation by serviceproviders of constraints to effective provision; and
(b) adoption and implementation of a new
procurement code and key implementing decrees.

(a) The new budget classification allows tracking of
poverty reducing and social expenditures. However,
the budget reports produced so far are incomplete to
provide an accurate picture for evaluation purposes.
(b) The new procurement procedures have been
adopted but there has been difficulties in their
implementation.

- 91 -

Trigger
6.

Status

Social and rural sectors

Adoption of sectoral development strategies and
related implementation plans for health, education and
rural development, satisfactory to IDA.

7.

APPENDIX IV

An initial draft of the Government Report on Health
and Poverty (RESP) was finalized in December 2004.
In the field of education, the government finalized, in
September 2004, the Status Report on the National
Education System (RESEN), which assesses the
sector’s constraints, and adopted a draft action plan
for the Education for All (EFA) Initiative.

Debt Management

Installation and full activation of a computerized debtrecording system, covering public and publiclyguaranteed debt that can (a) produce monthly debtservice projections, and incorporate actual
disbursement and debt-service payment execution
data; (b) produce advance monthly debt-service
projections that will be published quarterly; and (c)
support the centralization of debt information in a
single center.

A new public debt management software (SYGADE)
has been acquired supported by external partners and
training is on-going. It is projected to become
operational by end-August 2006.

APPENDIX V

Democratic Republic of the Congo: Statistical Issues
Despite a difficult environment, the authorities have continued to produce an array of
economic and financial statistics, most of which are contained in the annual report of the
Central Bank of the Congo (BCC), which also issues a monthly statistical bulletin. Moreover,
a comprehensive set of external debt statistics is compiled by the Office de Gestion de la
Dette Publique (OGEDEP). Statistical issues related to specific sectoral areas are described
below.
Following a fact-finding mission to Kinshasa in June 2001 in real sector and government
finance statistics, STA provided technical assistance on government finance statistics in
March–April and September 2002, which was augmented by capacity-building support from
the World Bank. A STA multitopic mission visited Kinshasa in October 2003 to assess the
DRC’s economic and financial data and propose measures to improve them. A multisector
statistics advisor based in Kinshasa is providing assistance to the authorities.
On April 24, 2004, the DRC began participating in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), and its metadata (comprehensive information on statistical production,
dissemination practices, and plans for improvement) were posted to the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. The DRC’s metadata, however, need to be updated as the GDDS
requires that metadata be updated at least annually. Participation in the GDDS provides a
framework for statistical development and capacity building in macroeconomic statistics and
socio-demographic (population, health, education, and poverty) indicators.
National accounts
The national accounts are compiled in constant and current prices by the Directorate of
Research of the BCC and published on an annual basis. The compilation methodology
conforms to the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA) and is based on the balance
sheets of enterprises and the results of surveys of public and semipublic enterprises and
agencies, with most of these surveys dating from the late 1980s. The activities of the
traditional sector (including the informal sector) are also included, using extrapolation
techniques based on industry-specific data that are outdated. As a result, GDP is likely to be
underestimated. With help of the multisector statistics advisor, work is underway to introduce
a new base year (2003) and introduce the recommendations of the 1993 SNA.
Employment and unemployment
Annual data on employment in the central government are available from the Ministries of
Economy, Finance, and Budget, together with data on employment in the formal sector.
Prices
Consumer price indices are calculated for Kinshasa by the BCC, the National Statistics
Institute (INS), the Institute of Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics
Section of the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. The IESR also calculates a monthly consumer

- 93 -

APPENDIX V

price index for the Lubumbashi market. The household surveys on which these calculations
are based date back to the late 1980s and need to be updated to take account of changes in
household consumption patterns and demographic shifts.
Government accounts
The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis based on its own accounting
records of the government cash operations it executes. The treasury produces two sets of
monthly statistics based on its own records: one relates to the transactions executed through
the BCC, the other set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts
and off-budget operations. These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public
accounting system and provide insufficient details about the nature of expenditures owing to
problems in the expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce, on a
quarterly basis, expenditure data reports broken down by ministry and institution.
The ongoing improvements in tax administration and expenditure control are expected to
improve the quality and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In parallel with technical assistance in
the public expenditure management area, STA has been providing technical assistance in
government finance statistics on a peripatetic basis, producing improvements in the overall
quality of government finance statistics. Furthermore, the adoption of a simplified, doubleentry bookkeeping system for the government should significantly improve the availability of
data on government financial operations.
In 2003, the DRC reported data for the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook in the
format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, but did not so in 2004
Monetary accounts
The Directorate of Research of the BCC regularly produces timely monetary statistics.
Generally, the reliability of these statistics is now satisfactory, but some problems remain
with the sectorization of accounts.
Since the last money and banking statistics mission in June 2000, data reporting by the BCC
for publication in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) has improved; currently,
monetary data are reported to STA on a timely basis. The multisector statistics mission that
visited Kinshasa in October 2003 recommended a new chart of accounts for the BCC and the
other deposit-taking institutions, including information needed for the sectorization of
economic units and classification of financial assets.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments statistics are prepared on an annual basis, based on information on
exports and imports of large public and semipublic enterprises, the BCC’s payments records,
and a survey of residents’ foreign operations. The estimates also take account of information
on the informal sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) office, which collects these data from the

- 94 -

APPENDIX V

European Union, embassies, and nongovernmental organizations. However, the recent
multisector mission found that, due to computer problems, data have not been processed
since 1999. As a result, the balance of payments is currently compiled using data from
different sources, supplemented by estimates.
The mission suggested that the BCC implement a system of quarterly surveys of those
corporations that are authorized to hold accounts overseas. Further, the mission
recommended the reinvigoration of a working group comprising staff of the customs and
other relevant agencies to prepare quarterly foreign trade data and other measures to improve
data on services and transfers. No data are reported to STA for publication.
External and domestic debt
External and domestic debt statistics are compiled by OGEDEP and are of reasonable quality
in spite of limited computer facilities. However, data on public enterprise foreign debt and, in
particular, on cross arrears in the public sector are still of very poor quality. The World Bank
is providing assistance in the compilation of cross-arrears in the public sector and public
sector arrears with the private sector.
Public enterprise sector
There is no centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises,
although IMF missions are provided some information on the operations of individual
enterprises. Generally, data are provided on an annual basis and become available with at
least a six-month delay. As part of public enterprise reform, the World Bank is collecting
data pertaining to the sector.
Social indicators
The most consistent data sets are those assembled for the UNDP human development,
poverty, and gender-related development indices. Two multiple indicator cluster surveys
carried out between 1996 and 2001 in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) also provide important social indicators. A national household living standards
survey with the help of IDA and other institutions is planned. In addition, in the context of
the interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP), the authorities, with assistance from
the World Bank and the UNDP, have initiated work to construct a comprehensive database
for social indicators.

APPENDIX VI

Democratic Republic of the Congo: Debt Sustainability Analysis
This appendix presents the results of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for low income
countries conducted in the context of the Article IV consultation.1 The main conclusion of
the analysis is that the DRC’s debt outlook, while appearing to be manageable, is subject to
potential risks that warrant continuous vigilance.
The debt sustainability analysis is based on staff’s estimates of the outstanding stock of debt,
in conjunction with projections about new borrowing. Projections cover the period 2005–24,
and incorporate the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections at the time of the program
negotiation. Projections beyond the medium term are derived from projections made at the
time of the decision point DSA.2 The analysis is based on debt service data after debt relief.
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of debt as a percent of GDP is expected to remain
roughly unchanged over the medium term, declining gradually to about 15 percent of GDP at
the end of the projection period. As a percent of exports, the stock of debt in NPV terms will
decrease from 69 percent of exports at end-2004 to 62 percent in 2008 before rising
somewhat to 67 percent at the end of the projection period.3 Flow indicators also suggest that
the authorities should be able to meet their debt service obligations without undue difficulty.
The debt service to exports ratio is expected to rise somewhat over the medium term before
declining gradually during the remainder of the projection period. The use of alternative
scenarios could affect the debt sustainability outlook. A scenario based on less favorable
terms for new financing (the interest rate is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline)
1

The DSA was conducted by Fund staff, prior to the approval of the joint Fund-World Bank
DSA framework for low income countries. A joint Fund-Bank DSA is expected to be
undertaken in the near future.

2

Borrowing over the period 2006–10 is assumed to constitute about 4 percent of GDP. The
actual borrowing, however, could be lower given that new commitments by the World Bank
will be in the form of grants only in the coming years. Only identified borrowing is reflected
in the results of the DSA.
3

These results are broadly in line with those of the HIPC DSA. Differences in the NPV of
debt to exports ratio between the LIC DSA and the HIPC DSA are for the most part the result
of methodological differences in the calculation of the NPV of debt. The latter relies on a
loan by loan analysis using currency-specific discount rates, whereas the former uses
aggregate data and a fixed discount rate (5 percent). Differences in the NPV of debt account
for around 43 percent of the observed difference in the NPV of debt to exports ratio in 2006,
the expected time of the completion point. The use of a three-year export average (under the
HIPC methodology) explains the remainder of the difference.

- 97 -

APPENDIX VI

reveals that the NPV of debt to exports ratio could more than double, climbing to 157 percent
at the end of the projection period. A similar deterioration is evident in the NPV of debt to
GDP and debt service to export ratios.
Furthermore, various simulations suggest that debt could rise sharply in the presence of
adverse exogenous shocks. The DRC seems to be particularly vulnerable to an export shock
(Bound Test 2) and to a simultaneous occurrence of smaller shocks (Bound Test 5). An
export shock (export value at historical average minus one standard deviation) over a twoyear period (2005–06) will rapidly lead to a sharp deterioration in the NPV of debt to exports
ratio. The latter will rise to around 177 percent of exports of goods and services in 2006
before declining gradually during the remainder of the projection period. Similarly, a
combination of shocks (real GDP growth, exports, GDP deflator, current transfers, and
foreign direct investment at their historical average minus one half standard deviation) during
2005–06 results in a rapid deterioration of the NPV of debt to exports ratio to 275 percent in
2006, falling gradually to 108 percent at the end of the projection period.
In conclusion, the results of the analysis suggest that while the debt outlook for the DRC
appears to be under control, risks remain. The authorities should thus remain vigilant and
continue to monitor developments in this area closely.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 29, 2005

1.
This statement provides information obtained after the finalization of the staff report.
It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On the economic front, preliminary data for the first seven months of 2005 suggest
that real GDP growth for the year is in line with program projections. Annualized inflation
has fallen from 54 percent at end-May to 35 percent at mid-August, and the inflation
objective for the year still seems achievable. After a period of volatility in June and July, the
value of the Congo franc has been appreciating for the past three weeks, reflecting the impact
of fiscal tightening on base money, the growth of which has remained well within the
program target.
3.
Preliminary data for key aggregates indicate that the quantitative indicative targets for
end-June are likely to have been met, except for net credit to government. The latter was due
to a temporary acceleration of civil service and military wage payments at end-June, the date
at which the political transition was expected to end — it was, in the event, extended by six
months. As this process was not repeated in July, net bank credit to government fell back.
4.
Preliminary estimates indicate that fiscal performance during the first seven months
of the year was broadly in line with the program objectives. The overall fiscal balance
recorded a surplus, instead of a deficit as projected, reflecting higher government revenue
and lower government expenditure. However, the composition of expenditure remains an
issue, with outlays for poverty reduction and investment projects much less than targeted.
5.
Eight out of the nine prior actions have been fully met. The prior action on the
implementation of spending procedures from commitment to payments between the Central
Bank of the Congo and the Treasury is well-advanced with average time for payments having
been sharply shortened to two and a half days instead of two days as stipulated. Further
progress will take a little more time given the need to strengthen staffing and procedures.
However, in view of the measures taken and the authorities’ continued efforts to improve
procedures, staff considers that program objectives remain feasible and hence supports the
completion of the fifth review under the PRGF arrangement.

IMF Executive Board Completes the Fifth Review Under the Democratic Republic of the
Congo's PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$39.2 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth review
of its performance under an SDR 580 million (about US$852.1 million) Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 02/27), and a financing assurances
review.
The completion of the fifth review enables the release of an amount equivalent to
SDR 26.7 million (about US$39.2 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the
arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 553.3 million (about US$813.2 million).
The Board also approved the authorities' requests to extend the PRGF arrangement to end-March
2006 to provide time to complete the sixth review, and for additional interim assistance of an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.13 million (about US$1.7 million) under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.
In completing the PRGF review, the Board waived the nonobservance of quantitative
performance criteria pertaining to net domestic assets of the central bank, net bank credit to the
government, and the continuous performance criterion prohibiting payment of government
expenditures by the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) not authorized in advance by the Minister
of Finance, as well as of the end-September 2004 structural performance criterion on the
selection of an international firm to conduct the external audit of the mining company La Société
Minière de Bakwanga (MIBA).
Following the Executive Board's discussion on the DRC’s economic performance, on August 29,
2005, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Democratic Republic of the Congo made further progress in 2004 and 2005 and the
authorities have continued to implement wide-ranging macroeconomic and structural policies.
Economic growth remained strong, but slippages occurred under the PRGF-supported program
during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 due largely to political and social
tensions. However, the authorities remain committed to implementing a strong set of measures to
restore and consolidate macroeconomic stability.

-2“Developments since mid-2004 have highlighted the fragility of the economic and political
situation. Bringing the political transition process to a successful conclusion and improving the
security environment by completing the reform of the army and the police will be key in
restoring confidence. Against this background, the authorities are committed to accelerating the
reform process, which is essential for rebuilding the economy, achieving high and sustainable
growth, and reducing poverty.
“The authorities have established a macroeconomic framework for 2005 that is ambitious. The
medium-term fiscal strategy aims to keep the deficit at a level compatible with debt
sustainability. It focuses on mobilizing revenue and strengthening public expenditure
management by modernizing tax administration and stepping up the fight against smuggling,
fraud, and corruption. In addition, it will be important for the mining sector to contribute an
adequate share of government revenue. On the expenditure side, the priorities are to ensure that
resources for poverty reduction are effectively utilized in order to contribute to the achievement
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and that outlays for security and political
institutions are contained. Also essential is the ongoing strengthening of the civil service that will
help tighten control over the payroll.
“Restoring price stability will require tightening monetary policy, including through actions to
improve the effectiveness of monetary instruments. This needs to be accompanied by measures
to strengthen the financial position of the central bank, as well as its internal management and
control systems. Also, the strengthening of ongoing reforms in banking system supervision
would contribute to the enhancement of financial intermediation. Intervention in the foreign
exchange market should be limited to achieving the international reserve target and smoothing
out short-term volatility.
“Improvements in governance will be key for improving the business climate and investor
confidence, and for enhancing donor support. In this regard it will be important that the
authorities take all necessary steps to enforce recently adopted legislation to intensify the fight
against corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
“The authorities are committed to completing preparation of a high-quality Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) through a broad participatory process—the final version of which is
expected to be adopted in the fourth quarter of 2005—and to taking the actions required to reach
the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative by end-2006. In the meantime, every
effort should be made to reach agreements with the remaining creditors that have not provided
debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The pursuit of a prudent external debt
management policy and the securing of highly concessional foreign assistance are also necessary
to maintain debt sustainability.
“Program implementation will continue to face a number of risks, mostly related to security,
social tensions, and the potential impact of the political transition process on economic policy.
The authorities are committed to bringing the political transition process to a successful
conclusion as rapidly as possible. However, policy slippages before the elections remain a major
risk and the authorities are encouraged to take the necessary measures to achieve the program
objectives. In addition, timely external financial support will be essential for completing the
transition process.

-3“It is regrettable that misreporting has occurred, relating to nonobservance of the budgetary
expenditure performance criterion. However, since the amounts of the deviation from the
performance criterion were minor and did not undermine the objectives of the program, and also,
the government has adopted measures to prevent future deviations, the Executive Board agreed
to grant a waiver on the nonobservance,” Mr. Carstens said.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
On August 29, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.1
Background
Since 2001, the DRC has experienced a significant turnaround. After the signing of a powersharing agreement (Accord global et inclusif) in December 2002, a transition government of
national unity was formed in June 2003, charged with holding elections after two years.
The transition period was extended by six months in June 2005 to give the authorities more
time to prepare for the first free and transparent elections in over 30 years. The transition
government has made progress in reunifying the country and strengthening public institutions.
A draft constitution was adopted by parliament in May 2005 and will be submitted to a
referendum in November 2005. In addition, an integrated army and a police force are being
created and the implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR)
program is making progress.
Economic activity started to recover in 2002, after declining for 13 years, inflation declined
from 511 percent at end-2000 to 4 percent at end-2003. However, by mid-2004
macroeconomic performance started to weaken due mainly to an increase in security-related
government spending following rising tensions in the eastern provinces and outlays by political
institutions. Overall, real GDP grew by 6.8 percent in 2004; 12-month inflation fell to less than

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
5 percent by mid-2004 before rising to over 9 percent by December 2004 and further to
26 percent by end-May 2005.
The external current account deficit, including official transfers, widened by 4 percentage
points of GDP in 2004. Favorable terms of trade (due to an increase in the world market prices
of commodities) and the return of private investors resulted in large increases in exports of
cobalt, timber, crude oil, and copper. At the same time, imports of capital and consumer goods
rose rapidly with the reconstruction of the economy and with rising income. The overall
balance of payments improved when taking into account debt relief. International reserves
more than doubled to 5.2 weeks of imports and are projected to rise further to 7.2 weeks in
2005. The country has benefited from a sharp improvement in competitiveness, with the terms
of trade strengthening by more than 20 percent over the same period and the real effective
exchange rate depreciating by 19 percent during 2002-04.
Fiscal developments were mixed in 2004, with government revenue higher and expenditure
lower than programmed. Nevertheless, the composition of expenditure remained a major
issue, with spending on social and poverty-reducing projects falling well short of projections
when, at the same time, there was overspending for security and political institutions.
In addition, the implementation of the fiscal reform agenda slowed down due to institutional
rigidities, including the government’s and the National Assembly’s slow decision-making
process. So, in spite of relatively high growth, progress toward reaching the Millennium
Development Goals has been limited.
A higher-than-anticipated expansion in the monetary aggregates in 2004 led to the
depreciation of the Congo franc and a surge in inflation in the second half of the year.
To correct the slippages the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) tightened monetary policy and
eventually monetary stability was restored leading to the stabilization of consumer prices and
the appreciation of the exchange rate by mid-June 2005.
In the area of governance, the authorities increased transparency in government spending and
the tracking of poverty-related expenditure, which are key elements to monitor the use of
resources generated by debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative,
and progress was made toward the MDGs. In addition a law to combat money laundering and
the financing of terrorism was promulgated in 2005.
Important structural reforms have been implemented since 2002, but progress slowed in 2004
due to a large extent to rising insecurity and political tensions that made it difficult for the
government to reach a broad consensus on reforms.
The soundness of the banking system is still fragile, although it has improved over the past
year as its restructuring is ongoing. A plan to recapitalize the BCC has been elaborated which
deals with the losses it incurred due to the revaluation of its foreign exchange accounts, high
operating costs, and low earnings. As regards commercial banks, seven of them are being
liquidated, the five remaining in operation are implementing restructuring plans and a new
bank has started operations. Banks’ profits are still low due to the narrow asset base and the
volatility of earnings.
The DRC has made progress in obtaining debt relief. After reaching the decision point under
the HIPC Initiative, the authorities signed bilateral agreements with most Paris Club creditors.

-3–
The authorities have also continued their good faith efforts to reach collaborative agreements
with commercial creditors with which they have signed 32 rescheduling agreements, and they
intend to continue seeking agreements with all remaining creditors by end-2005.
In 2005, economic growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent and end-of-period inflation to rise
to 22.6 percent. The authorities will seek to achieve an underlying fiscal surplus (which
excludes all foreign-financed expenditure) equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP, compared with a
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004. At the same time, spending for the political transition
process and the restructuring of the economy, which is largely foreign financed, would cause
the overall fiscal deficit, on a cash basis, to increase by 0.5 percentage points of GDP to
2.2 percent in 2005. The overall fiscal deficit is to be covered by external financing, including
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and budget support from the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, and bilateral donors. The BCC will implement a prudent monetary policy in
the context of the floating exchange rate regime, which has so far been appropriate for the
country’s circumstances with the restoration of price stability as the main objective.
The main risks for the rest of 2005 relate to security and social tensions, which could worsen in
the case of further delays in the transition process. Bringing the political transition process to a
successful conclusion is key and will require coordinated efforts to tackle simultaneously
political, economic, and security challenges. Support of the international community will remain
crucial in reaching the end of the transition process.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in stabilizing the
economy and pursuing reforms in recent years, despite the difficult security and political
situation. GDP growth has been higher than anticipated, inflationary pressures have eased,
and the exchange rate remained broadly stable. In addition, important reforms were
introduced, and advances made toward national reunification.
Directors noted that economic performance was mixed during the second half of 2004 and the
first quarter of 2005. They regretted the policy slippages, which contributed to renewed
inflationary pressures, a shift away from pro-poor spending, and slow implementation of
structural reforms during this period. They were encouraged, however, by the tightening of
fiscal and monetary policies early this year, which has helped stabilize the macroeconomic
situation.
Directors noted that developments since mid-2004 underscored the fragility of the economic
situation and that confidence in government policy remained tenuous. While recognizing the
daunting challenges associated with the political and security situation, Directors encouraged
the authorities to accelerate the economic reform process, including in the area of governance,
which is essential for rebuilding the economy, achieving high and sustainable growth, and
reducing poverty. They also emphasized the importance of bringing the political transition
process to a successful conclusion and of improving security by completing reforms of the
army and the police.
Directors concurred with the authorities’ medium-term economic framework, which they found
ambitious for a country that is still at an early stage of post-conflict recovery. They supported
the fiscal strategy that aims at keeping the deficit at a level compatible with macroeconomic

-4–
stability and debt sustainability. While noting the steps taken to increase revenue, Directors
recommended that this effort be intensified in order to generate the resources required to
develop the economy and reduce poverty. To enhance tax collection, they noted that
emphasis should be placed on modernizing the tax administration, broadening the tax base,
and fighting smuggling, fraud, and corruption. Directors urged, in particular, that the
government take steps to ensure that the mining sector contributes an appropriate share of
government revenue.
Directors urged the authorities to contain overall government expenditure, since moneyfinanced outlays were the main cause of the recent surge in inflation. They emphasized the
importance of improving the composition of spending by ensuring that resources for poverty
reduction are effectively utilized in order to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals, and that outlay for security and political institutions are contained.
Directors strongly supported the strengthening of public expenditure management, which is
essential for improving transparency and enhancing the efficiency of fiscal spending. They also
welcomed the actions taken to enhance the efficiency of the civil service, and in particular, the
undertaking of the military and civilian personnel census, which is an essential step toward
improving control over the payroll, and creating room to increase wages. Directors noted the
provisions in the draft Constitution to decentralize fiscal resources and key responsibilities to
the provinces. To safeguard fiscal discipline, they urged that the pace of decentralization take
into account the institutional capacity in the provinces, and saw a role for Fund technical
assistance in this area.
Directors commended the authorities on their commitment to a prudent monetary policy in the
context of the floating exchange rate regime, with the restoration of price stability as the main
objective. They encouraged the authorities to implement the Fund’s technical assistance
recommendations regarding monetary management, including by developing the market for
central bank paper as an efficient tool to address excess liquidity. Effective liquidity
management might also require sales of foreign exchange. Directors were of the view that
intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited to achieving the target for
international reserves and smoothing out short-term volatility in the exchange rate.
Directors urged the BCC to accelerate the implementation of its action plan aimed at
strengthening its financial position, its institutional and management capacity, and the
transparency of its operations. Actions in this area should take into account the
recommendations of the safeguards assessment report, and Directors recommended that
increased independence of the central bank would also be helpful in this regard. Directors
welcomed the BCC’s commitment to enhance supervision of the commercial banks and to
strengthen the soundness of the banking system. They were of the view that commercial
banks’ restructuring was essential to improve their financial situation and enhance financial
intermediation.
Directors emphasized the crucial importance of further actions aimed at improving governance
and reducing corruption. Such actions are a key element of the strategy for improving the
business climate and investor confidence and for enhancing donor support. In this context,
Directors urged the authorities to take all necessary steps to implement recently adopted
legislation to intensify the fight against corruption, money laundering, and the financing of
terrorism. In addition, they looked forward to the authorities’ implementation of plans to

-5–
establish a financial intelligence unit and to participate in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors encouraged the authorities to complete the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
through a broad participatory process. They welcomed the draft PRSP that was circulated to
civil society and development partners, and looked forward to the final version in the fourth
quarter of this year. They urged the authorities to implement all actions necessary for the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to reach the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative by end-2006.
Directors noted progress made in finalizing negotiations on debt relief and encouraged the
authorities to reach agreement with all remaining creditors. In light of the downside risks to
exports and the terms of trade, they emphasized the need to continue to follow a prudent
external debt management policy, and to secure highly concessional foreign assistance, while
strengthening the authorities’ debt-management capacity.
Directors agreed that macroeconomic statistics still need to be improved significantly,
especially in the areas of the national accounts, price and production data, and the balance of
payments. They urged the authorities to continue their efforts to enhance the coverage and
quality of key statistics in the context of the General Data Dissemination System project.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for
Democratic Republic of the Congo
August 29, 2005

On behalf on my authorities, I would like to express our appreciation to Management and
staff for their valuable advice and support in the implementation of the economic program of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Following satisfactory implementation in 2002 and 2003, the Government Economic
Program (PEG) experienced some setbacks in 2004 on account of increased insecurity
concerns in the eastern part of the country. My authorities had to act quickly to contain the
situation which could have had a severe negative impact on the social and economic
environment. The United Nations and the international community provided an invaluable
support in this regard, for which my authorities are grateful.
The intervention of the government in the east created additional outlays, which caused some
of the program’s objectives not to be met, and the overall performance under the PRGFsupported program was lower than expected. Nonetheless, once tensions in the eastern region
eased in the last quarter of 2004, my authorities took measures to contain the macroeconomic
effects of the military action, while ensuring that structural measures are implemented albeit
with some delays.
The difficult security environment, the complexity of the political situation and the time
needed to build a consensus from all stakeholders in the preparation of the new Constitution
and the transition laws caused a delay in the transition period which was extended by 6
months. The authorities remain committed to the ongoing process of national reunification
and the completion of the transition. In this regard, they expect to complete the necessary
work for the organization of a referendum on the draft Constitution in November 2005 and
for the holding of Presidential, Parliamentary and local elections in early 2006.
My authorities remain committed to the successful implementation of their economic
program. To this end, they are requesting an extension of the arrangement supporting the
PEG until March 31, 2006 to allow for the completion of the sixth review before the end of
the arrangement. They are also requesting an additional annual tranche of interim assistance
under the HIPC Initiative to cover part of the debt service obligations falling due to the Fund
between August 1, 2005 and July 31, 2006.
Recent Developments and Performance under the Program
The DRC’s macroeconomic performance in 2004 was broadly satisfactory with output
growth higher than expected despite the troubles in the eastern part of the country. GDP in
2004 is estimated to have reached 6.8 percent against 6.3 percent in the program.
On the fiscal front, the overall objectives in 2004 were met with government revenue higher
than programmed thanks to increased oil revenues. However, as noted above, at mid-2004

-2unforeseen security expenditures caused outlays to be redirected to deal with the rising
insecurity situation, while other spending lines were reduced on account of lower than
anticipated foreign-financed expenditure. The overall expenditure target in 2004 was
nevertheless met. My authorities took measures in December 2004 and February 2005 to
tighten the fiscal stance, in order to help restore macroeconomic stability. The fiscal
measures included a cut of non priority expenditures, a freeze on civil service recruitment
and a tightening of tax collection. Preliminary data for the first four months of 2005 show
that the budget execution, on both the revenue and expenditure sides, is in accordance with
that stance.
Under the Fund-supported program, important progress has been made as regards the
implementation of monetary policy. The instruments put in place had enabled the central
bank to reduce inflation to single digits and led also to a stabilization of the exchange rate.
However, inflation accelerated in the early part of this year, in relation to the security
situation. The central bank, starting in September 2004, began to tighten monetary policy by
raising in steps the discount rates. At the same time, government expenditure was reduced
and these have helped to stabilize prices, and also led to an appreciation of the exchange rate.
The quick response of the economy to the monetary measures being taken is an indication of
the effectiveness of the monetary instruments being used, despite a very difficult
environment. The authorities expect further progress on the inflation front during the
remainder of the year and in 2006. Moreover, and in the context of the ongoing reforms
aimed at improving the coordination between the central bank and the Ministry of Finance,
the BCC implemented new spending procedures from commitment to payments. Thus,
settlements of payments order by the BCC is now done within 48 hours of their receipts.
On the external front, higher oil and cobalt international prices and increasing mining
production contributed to the increase in commodity exports in 2004. However, higher
reconstruction-related imports and interest payments on rescheduled debt resulted in a wider
than programmed external current account deficit (including grants) by 2 percentage points.
Debt management is improving. The government managed to settle all its external debt
service commitments for 2004. It also secured bilateral agreements on Cologne terms with all
Paris Club creditors but the US, and signed agreements with 32 commercial creditors while
negotiations are underway with five others. In addition, the average debt relief granted to the
Kinshasa Club amounted to 70 percent of the stock of debt. However, two creditors are
seeking payments through the judicial courts, and new creditors are introducing old claims on
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. An agreement was also reached on the terms and the
conditions for the settlement of government debt to the private sector. The implementation of
the repayment plan will begin during the third quarter of 2005.
The implementation of the reform agenda experienced delays due to the complex decisionmaking process in the country. As a result, some reforms envisaged in the program were
completed only after the scheduled dates. On fiscal reforms, the Parliament adopted the new
customs code in June 2005. The law on the nomenclature for nontax revenue was
promulgated in July 2004 and amended in March 2005 to incorporate the revenue formerly
collected by the autonomous agencies. Measures to strengthen the tax administration at the

-3central and local levels are being undertaken. Since the beginning of 2005, and to sustain its
fiscal tightening stance, my authorities pursued the strengthening of the budget management.
In particular (i) the expenditure management system has become operational since June
2005, (ii) government accounts with commercial banks that did not meet the criteria for
opening such accounts were closed; and (iii) the submission of monthly and quarterly budget
monitoring reports to the government and the parliament respectively started since June
2005. The mining taxation regime was brought in line with the new Mining Code in 2004.
This code, while specifying the royalties, taxes and fees to be paid, also provides for revenue
sharing with provincial and local governments. The authorities have also enforced strictly the
taxation laws in the forestry sector. Owners of forest concessions who had not paid their
taxes saw their contracts cancelled, and the government thus reclaimed over 120 million
acres of forestry land.
Regarding the public enterprises sector, the strategic audit of the Conseil Supérieur du
Portefeuille and a draft reorganization plan of the petroleum distribution company
(COHYDRO) were completed in July 2005 instead of September 2004. As for the audit of
the public diamond mining enterprise MIBA, the international bid to select an auditor could
not be held by end-September 2004 as planned, because the anticipated foreign financing was
not available. However, the government decided to finance this audit with domestic funds.
Following an international tender offer launched in January 2005, an international consulting
firm was selected in July 2005.
In the banking system, the central bank issued in August 2004 a broad map for restructuring
the BCC and the commercial banks, strengthening the financial system and developing a
legal framework for microfinance institutions. As regards the commercial banks, nine of
them are being liquidated and five others out of the nine banks in operation are implementing
restructuring plans. The BCC has also introduced a number of measures to strengthen
commercial banks’ operations. These include instructions on banks’ prudential ratios,
adoption of a formal framework for on-site and off-site audits, reform of the tax and legal
framework for commercial banks to make it more transparent and in line with good
international practice, and the adoption of a decree in early 2004 to facilitate the
reconstitution of equity capital.
Several steps have been taken to improve governance and transparency. In particular, the
law on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and the anticorruption
law were promulgated in August 2004 and March 2005 respectively. As regard public
procurement processes, a public procurement reform commission was established and its
members appointed. The audit of the judicial system was completed with the assistance of
the European Union and other donors. In order to enhance the transparency of military
spending, the government, through the High Defense Council, mandated an audit of the
expenditures associated with events in the eastern provinces during 2004.
Regarding the peace and reunification process, an integrated army and a police force is
being created and the implementation of the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and
Reintegration (DDR) program, which should reduce the size of the army by at least one-half,
is proceeding well.

-4In sum, and despite a difficult environment, performance under the PRGF was broadly
satisfactory with eight out of 11 quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2004
and the two structural performance criteria observed, although one structural criterion was
observed with delay. In light of the efforts to correct slippages and restore macroeconomic
stability, my authorities are requesting waivers for the missed performance criteria.
Program for the Remainder of 2005 and over the Medium-Term
The next six months will be marked by important events, which will affect significantly the
political, economic and social life of the country. The events linked to the transition process
include notably the holding of the referendum on the Constitution and elections. My
authorities are hopeful that the implementation of the DDR program and the reintegration
and reorganization of the army and the police will be completed soon. The financial impact
of those events have been taken into account in the 2005 Budget adopted in March 2005 by
the Parliament.
The program for the remainder of 2005 aims at achieving successfully the preparation and
the organization of those important events while pursuing prudent policies initiated since late
2004 in order to restore the macroeconomic stability, and speed up the pace of reforms to
foster growth and fight poverty. It is expected that the pursuit of the policies envisaged in the
program will (a) help the economy achieve real GDP growth of 6.6 percent in 2005; (b)
reduce the end-of-period annual inflation to 22.6 percent; and (c) achieve an external current
account deficit, including grants, of 5.1 percent of GDP.
In addition to helping restore macroeconomic stability and ensuring an adequate financing of
the program associated with the transition process, the objective of fiscal policy for the
second semester of 2005 is to maintain the improvement in revenue performance and
expenditure control while ensuring higher share of poverty-reduction expenditure. Higher
budgetary revenues are expected, among others, from improved tax collection in the
reunified provinces, payment to the government of tax and fees previously collected by
autonomous agencies and higher oil revenues. Total government revenue is projected to
increase by 1.1 percentage points of GDP to 10.7 percent.
On the expenditure side, my authorities will pursue the rationalization of domestic-financed
currents outlays. My authorities expect savings of around 2 percent of GDP essentially from
cuts in the operating expenses of ministries and political institutions. In that connection, there
has been a 20 percent reduction in daily allowances during missions from staff and members
of these bodies. Other measures taken relate mainly to utilities consumption. The large
increase in budgeted foreign-financed projects would lead to an overall increase of
expenditure of 2.3 points of percentage to 17.7 percent.
Fiscal reforms seek to strengthen accounting, tax and customs legislation and procedures
with notably the implementation of the VAT to replace the turnover tax in the medium term.
On the expenditure side, measures will seek to ensure a more effective use of debt relief and
the reform of the civil service.

-5Regarding particularly the latter, my Congolese authorities are fully cognizant of the need to
improve the management and the performance of the civil service to ensure a better
provision of the public services. To this end, they are of the view that, among others, a better
remuneration of civil servants is necessary. My authorities intend to raise civil wages in a
way that will not worsen the fiscal situation. Thus, as a start, they completed an audit of the
civil personnel which enabled the detection of many ghost workers and the results have been
implemented in Kinshasa in the May 2005 payroll. Based on that experience, a similar action
will be implemented later during the year for the rest of the country and as the DDR process
is completed, the authorities will determine to what extent wages could be increased. In
addition a new payroll system is being implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of ghost
workers.
The monetary policy objective will be to restore price stability within the floating exchange
rate system. In particular, with the projected reduction in central bank financing of the
government and slower growth of money supply, and an interest rate policy in accordance
with the monetary policy objective, inflation for end-2005 is set at 22.6 percent. To enhance
its credibility, the central bank has widely disseminated the objectives of monetary policy
and intends to report regularly on monetary policy implementation. It will continue to
implement its strategic action plan in line with the plan prepared in cooperation with the
Fund to improve its operations. In particular, to eliminate the losses of the BCC, the
government will adopt the strategy for restructuring the balance sheet of the central bank
before end-September 2005. The BCC will also strengthen its supervision of financial sector
notably through the continuation of the banking system restructuring and the preparation of a
draft legal framework for microfinance institutions by the end of 2005.
On the debt issue, my authorities are committed to conduct a prudent debt management
policy. In this regard, they will seek to sign all the bilateral debt relief agreements and
continue their efforts to convince all creditors to participate in the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
The government is working with the World Bank on the repurchase of debt vis-à-vis London
Club creditors. As regards commercial debt, the government will hire an audit firm to review
the terms and conditions of all agreements signed with individual creditors and to certify the
validity of new claims before negotiating debt relief agreements on terms similar to those of
the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Meanwhile, the installation of the new public debt
management software, with support from external partners, will be completed by end-August
2006.
My authorities remain committed to the reforms as demonstrated by the implementation of
the long list of prior actions taken ahead of the completion of this review. Table 1 attached
to the MEFP outlines the range of reforms that my authorities have started to implement and
will complete by year-end. Apart from the fiscal- and central bank-related reforms, efforts
will be made to complete reforms already initiated in the public enterprise sector, private
sector development, judicial system, mining sector, forestry sector and governance and
transparency with the aim to fighting corruption and removing impediments to growth and
poverty reduction. Regarding the mining sector which my authorities consider as vital for
the economic development of the country, the government will pursue the cleaning up of the
accounts of the companies through notably audits and restructuring of the public enterprises

-6concerned in order to improve their efficiency and transparency. The authorities are also
considering other steps to ensure the mining sector’s future growth and to enhance its
contribution to the economy and government revenue. However, in these efforts, the
authorities will require technical assistance from the donor community.
As regards poverty-reduction, the draft of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
was circulated to civil society and to development partners in May 2005. This version defines
the government’s priorities. However, the macroeconomic framework as well as a quantified
estimate of the cost and impact of the proposed strategies have yet to be prepared. Following
the incorporation of the 1-2-3 survey in Kinshasa and the surveys on the perception of
poverty in the provinces into the paper, the final PRSP is expected to be adopted by
government in the fourth quarter of 2005 as planned, following consultations with the
development partners and stakeholders.
Misreporting Issue
My authorities reported to the staff the occurrences of expenditures carried out for the
government by the central bank without the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance
between July 2003 – July 2005. In particular some of these expenditures occurred during the
period preceding the completion of the third and the fourth review of the current
arrangement. At that time, my authorities indicated wrongly to the staff that there were no
such expenditures. In fact, the implementation of a computerized expenditure system as well
as the improvement of the accounting system of the central bank at the same time led to the
non accounting of some financial transactions, including those indicated above. The urgent
nature of these expenditures – to avoid a disruption in the functioning of the civil service – is
the main reason for their occurrences. Given the small amounts involved in these
expenditures and actions taken promptly after their discovery, to ensure that such
expenditures do not reoccur in the future, I would appreciate Directors’ support for the
Managing Director’s recommendation to grant waivers on the nonobservances of the
continuous budgetary expenditure performance criterion at the time of the third and the
fourth review. For the same reasons, I am requesting Directors’ support for my authorities’
request for waiver for the nonobservance of the same continuous budgetary expenditure
performance criterion in the second semester of 2004.

Conclusion
I would like to reiterate the commitment of my authorities to macroeconomic stability,
economic reforms and peace consolidation. However in face of the exceptional event that
occurred in the second part of 2004, it is my authorities’ view that the situation in the east
was very urgent and needed to be dealt with. Accordingly, as they could not afford tensions
to intensify and spread, they devoted the necessary means to ensure that security is
reestablished in the eastern region of the country. My authorities have since taken measures
to reverse the negative macroeconomic effects of their action. Six months later, the
macroeconomic situation has been stabilized thanks to the tightening of fiscal and monetary
policies. Nevertheless, my Congolese authorities are aware that prudence in policy

-7implementation is still necessary, and intend to maintain such a stance. The DRC is still
recovering from the civil conflict and much needs to be done. External assistance has been
critical in the transition phase to peace, and will be much more needed in the coming months
and years to consolidate the progress achieved so far. My DRC authorities are very thankful
for the ongoing support they are receiving from the international community, and they are
hopeful that as they consolidate the peace process and develop their economy, they can
continue to rely on this assistance, including from the Fund.
