INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with
the Republic of Lithuania
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde and Aasim Husain
July 6, 2010
Context: Lithuania is benefiting from the global recovery, with higher exports playing a crucial
role in stabilizing the economy. However, domestic demand will remain subdued amid high
unemployment, falling incomes, and weak credit prospects. Confidence in the banking system was
maintained while sizeable fiscal adjustment was rewarded with continued market access, providing
crucial support to Lithuania’s long-standing currency board arrangement.
Challenges: While much has been achieved, the crisis has left three key policy challenges. The
fiscal deficit remains high and public debt is growing rapidly, leaving Lithuania reliant on external
financing. Meanwhile, deteriorating asset quality is a challenge for the financial sector. Growth
needs to rebalance towards exports to sustain the recovery. The consultation focused on the
policies to address these challenges which would also enhance prospects for euro adoption.
Authorities’ response: The authorities agreed that further fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure
sustainable public finances, and that the adjustment to meet the 3 percent of GDP Maastricht
deficit criterion by 2012 should be broad-based. While acknowledging staff’s assessment of
remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector from less well provisioned banks and lower
prospective profits, they emphasized the system is sound and better equipped to deal with new
challenges due to higher capital and liquidity ratios. Various structural reforms are underway and
increased EU funds absorption is being targeted at programs that create jobs and promote growth.
Previous IMF advice: Policy formulation and implementation is characterized by a high degree of
ownership, and has generally been consistent with Executive Board recommendations. The fiscal
adjustment implemented in 2009 and 2010, was consistent with that envisaged in the last
Article IV consultation, but financial sector recommendations on purchase and assumption
frameworks, semi-annual audits, and preemptive increases in capital based on enhanced stress tests
exercises, were viewed as operationally difficult to implement. The authorities also benefited from
Fund technical cooperation on bank resolution, tax policy, social benefits reform, corporate and
household bankruptcy frameworks.
Mission team: Ms. Purfield (Head), Messrs. Miniane, Vacher (all EUR), Cortavarria-Checkley
(MCM), Piris (SPR) and Kangur (FAD). Staff met with Prime Minister Kubilius, Finance
Minister Simonyte, Central Bank Governor Sarkinas, other senior officials, and representatives of
Parliament, the private sector, and civil society. Mr. Bartkus (OED) also participated in meetings.

I. CONTEXT: LITHUANIA’S ONGOING RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS
A. Recent Economic and Policy Developments
1.
Lithuania experienced a severe output decline in 2009. The economy started
contracting in the third quarter of 2008 as a reversal in capital flows led to a collapse of
domestic demand and the global
recession caused exports to fall.

A rapid internal adjustment played a crucial role in stabilizing the economy, but
unemployment has risen sharply (Tables 1–3):


The current account adjusted rapidly. It moved by around 19 percentage points of
GDP to a surplus of nearly 4 percent of GDP end-2009 as the collapse in domestic
demand caused imports to contract more than exports. This alleviated external
financing needs and helped maintain reserves amid net capital outflows that
amounted to 7.2 percent of GDP (Figure 2). Despite deleveraging in the private
sector, the external debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 87 percent of GDP. Strong export trends
continued in the first months of 2010, with imports showing signs of recovery (partly
due to energy imports after the closure of Ignalina). Government debt issuance has

Wages have fallen fast. Average gross
earnings have fallen by 12.4 percent from pre-crisis peaks, but in sectors such as
construction and real estate services, labor costs are down 20–25 percent.
Unemployment had reached 18.1 percent by end Q1 2010, with high levels of youth
and long-term unemployment an increasing concern.

inflation has fallen to 0.2 percent in
April 2010 despite a 33 percent increase
in electricity prices after Ignalina’s
closure and a VAT rate increase in
fall 2009. Core prices have been falling
for over a year.

A large consolidation contained the deterioration in the fiscal deficit and
safeguarded market financing (Tables 4 and 5). The authorities implemented measures
worth about 10 percent of GDP (staff’s estimates of meaures’ yields) in the 2009–10 budgets
that were appropriately expenditure-led given the legacy of spending increases in the boom.1
The initial focus on broad-based cuts gave way to more targeted and progressive reductions
in wage, pension and benefit levels that were agreed with social partners. About 40 percent
of the consolidation in the 2009 and 2010 budgets is temporary (wage cuts are set to expire at
the end of 2010 and pension cuts in 2011), and the April 2010 constitutional court decision
on pensions could unwind 0.6 percent of GDP in the adjustment.2 Steps to increase VAT and
excise rates and broaden their base played a complementary role in the adjustment. Overall,
by end-2009, the fiscal deficit was contained to 8.9 percent of GDP (ESA 95 basis) with the
early adjustment rewarded with access to international bond markets at declining cost. While
still low by emerging market standards, the public debt burden—at 33 percent of GDP
end-March 2010—is more than double its 2008 level. The improvement in the deficit
continued in the first months of 2010, amid better revenues and containment of expenditure
(Figure 3).

pension cuts be compensated when the economy recovers, though the amount and timing of compensation are

The financial sector weathered the crisis but faces sizeable non-performing loans
(NPLs). To preserve financial stability, reserve requirements were lowered, the deposit
insurance coverage raised, liquidity support procedures streamlined, and the 2009 Financial
Stability Law was adopted. Banks improved their liquidity positions, with subsidiaries of
international banks benefiting from parent support at the height of the global turmoil. Asset
quality has suffered, with the level of non-performing loans (defined as past due more than
60 days plus impaired loans) rising almost four-fold from end-2008 to March 2010 and banks
making large losses in 2009 (Figure 4). However, capital and liquidity indicators improved to
15 percent and 45 percent, respectively by end-March 2010 (Table 6). Provisions increased
to cover 7½ percent of gross loans but the ratio of provisions to NPLs at almost 40 percent of
NPLs, is still lower than most international comparators. Credit to the private sector is down
9.7 percent from its peak while parent bank funding (net of capital injections) fell by an
estimated 8.5 percent in 2009, reflecting in part lower loan demand (Box 1). The
loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen to below 150 percent while interbank rates have returned to
pre-crisis levels, although as before, transactions at longer maturities are limited.

Box 1. Credit Contraction and Deleveraging1/
Post-crisis deleveraging can be protracted, delaying the recovery in credit. Recent studies indicate
that countries with (i) high bank credit growth prior to the crisis, (ii) suffering from a stronger demand
contraction after the Lehman brothers shock, (iii) with high financial integration with respect to the rest
of the world, and (iv) with weaker countercyclical monetary policy response experienced on average
lower growth rates of bank credit post crisis.2/ Because the contraction in nominal GDP was large in
Lithuania in 2009, the ratio of credit-to-GDP will only decrease in 2010.
The contraction in credit in Lithuania started in December 2008 reflecting the legacy of a strong
credit boom and lack of demand. By end-2009, the nominal stock of credit to the private sector
declined by 8 percent from its November 2008 peak, the fastest pace in Emerging Europe. As a
proportion of GDP, the stock of credit grew particularly rapidly and late in the international cycle—
with implications for the subsequent deterioration in asset quality. Audited data suggest banks have
adjusted their lending patterns but some banks have maintained or even increased their gross loan
exposure to sectors such as construction, real estate, or transportation. Overall, quantifying the
contributions of demand and supply factors is challenging. Lending surveys suggest lower demand
played an important role in explaining the decline in credit, with evidence of potential supply effects
more mixed.
Short term risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside. Banks are more liquid (the deposit base
has stabilized and broad money is increasing), while investment might pick up in 2010, supported by
exports. However, new loans to households and corporates remain at very low levels, with few signs of
improvement. Downside risks include: high real interest rates, a further deterioration in asset quality,
low consumer demand if unemployment and wages deteriorate further, delays in recapitalization, and a
feeble recovery in asset and collateral prices.

B. Near-Term Outlook
6.
Exports and inventories are expected to lead the recovery in 2010 (Text Table).
Staff projects that real GDP will grow by 2 percent in 2010, with the recovery dependent on
exports that are forecast to grow by about 9 percent in real terms. Stronger external demand
and the higher absorption of EU funds will help private consumption and gross fixed capital
formation expand during 2010 on a quarter-on-quarter basis—though not on a year-on-year
basis due to strong base effects. Moreover, the large decline in inventories in 2009 creates the
potential for a large contribution in the 2010 forecast, were inventories to stabilize. Growth in
domestic demand will however be modest, hampered by high unemployment, falling
incomes, and weak credit

13
reserves are expected to rise. Despite deleveraging, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to peak only this year, at close to 90 percent, before declining over the medium
term. Still, the external debt dynamics remain particularly sensitive to shocks. (Appendix 1).
8.

Risks to the near-term outlook are broadly balanced, although tail risks remain.



On the upside, global demand could be stronger than expected. The recent
depreciation of the euro, if it persists, could stimulate net exports to non-EU trading
partners, more than offsetting the adverse effect of energy prices. The impetus to
domestic demand provided by exports and EU funds could also be stronger but would
contribute to narrowing the current account surplus. At 40 percent of GDP, household
debt remains low relative to other EU countries suggesting deleveraging may be less
prolonged.



On the downside, uncertainty in international markets remains a source of risk, while
poor asset quality in banks could hamper the recovery. Prolonged stress in Southern
Europe could impact trading partner growth, and risk tensions in financial markets
with possible implications for Lithuania’s sovereign financing costs that have so far
declined. In an extreme event where markets would freeze as in the fall of 2008, the
government could rely on its deposits that currently cover 5 months of expected cash
requirements, and on domestic debt issues as it did in early 2009. Direct financial
linkages to Southern European countries are limited, as is the exposure of the Nordic
parent banks who supported their subsidiaries through 2009. Further deleveraging
could take place, however, if conditions on wholesale funding markets become
difficult. A shock to growth, or to the current account, stemming from lower growth
in trading partners could also push external debt on an upward trajectory. Beside the
external risks, pressures on the banking system from poor asset quality or problems in
weaker banks, heavier debt burdens arising from further deflationary pressure, and a
weaker supply of credit could hamper the recovery, although the comparatively lower
debt burden and high degree of openness may alleviate some deflationary pressure.

14
II. THE ROAD AHEAD
9.
Restoring fiscal sustainability and ensuring financial stability are the
authorities’ key economic objectives. This supports the long standing currency board
arrangement (CBA) and conditions for successful Euro adoption. The latter, would allow an
orderly exit from the CBA, eliminate currency risks and reduce liquidity risk, a consideration
given the high degree of euroization (over 70 percent of bank assets but just one-third of
deposits). Realizing the ambitious 2014 timeline for euro adoption will require addressing
three key challenges: putting the public finances back on a sustainable footing, safeguarding
the health of the financial system, and rebalancing the economy towards tradables to foster
more balanced growth and job creation.
A. Securing a Sustainable and Equitable Fiscal Consolidation
10.
High deficits and rising debt are generating vulnerabilities. Despite economic
growth and recent adjustment measures, the deficit is only expected to decline to 7¾ percent
of GDP in 2010, reflecting the role of exports and inventories (both lightly taxed bases) in
driving the recovery. The modest revenue gains are also partly offset by increased transfers
for social assistance, support to job creation schemes, and compliance problems that have
both reduced excise collections and given rise to municipal government arrears. The arrears
reflect lower personal income tax revenues due to continued rise in unemployment and fall in
wages. Beyond 2010, if no new measures are taken, deficits would rise to 9-10 percent of
GDP, reflecting rising debt service costs, EU co-financing requirements, the expiration of
temporary measures, and full reinstatement of transfers to Pillar II pensions. Public debt
would breach the 60 percent Maastricht ceiling as early as 2013. Coupled with rising rollover
needs, the government’s gross financing need would reach 20 percent of GDP by 2015 while
the public debt burden would remain very vulnerable to lower growth outturns (Appendix 1).

11.
Additional fiscal consolidation is needed to secure sound public finances. The
convergence program (CP) targets reducing the deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 and to
3 percent by 2012. While ambitious, this timeframe is appropriate as a more gradual

15
adjustment risks undermining market confidence as well as the euro adoption goal. More
importantly, achieving these targets would substantially lower public debt and financing
needs, while saving up to 1⅓ percent of GDP in interest costs over the medium term.
Extending measures due to expire by 2011 (2½ percent of GDP) is a necessary start, but not
enough. Some 5½ percent of GDP in additional measures—about half the consolidation
achieved to date—is required. Economic growth cannot substitute for this consolidation: in
the unlikely event that growth returns to its pre-crisis levels, the adjustment need would still
amount to 3 percent of GDP.
12.
A balanced consolidation will require insuring the sustainability of the social
insurance system and broadening the tax base. Given the size of adjustment already
implemented, and the need for additional consolidation, a broad package of expenditure and
revenue measures is required to sustainably reduce the deficit (Box 2). While many options
are available, a broad-based package would help avoid further cuts in core public services
generate resources pending gains from slower yielding structural reforms, while helping to
reduce the impact on the poor. Quickly announcing concrete proposals would underpin the
credibility of the fiscal targets and market confidence, especially ahead of the municipal and
parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012.

Reform of the social security system should be assigned the highest priority
(Box 3). The social security agency’s (Sodra) deficit is forecast to reach 3½ percent of GDP
in 2010, with almost half due to pensions and the rest reflecting rapidly increasing—and
extremely generous by EU standards—parental benefits. Options for consolidating the latter
include limiting the duration of benefits, introducing a benefit cap, lowering the replacement
ratio, and eliminating duplicate payments. Tighter certification of sickness and disability
benefits would also yield savings over time.

Restoring the financial viability in the pension system calls for far reaching
reforms. Increasing the retirement age and linking it to longevity will start addressing
aging-related pressures. To reduce future liabilities and increase the link between
contributions and benefits, it will also be necessary to rely more heavily on a mandatory
funded system with the basic social

payments, and the poorest pensioners would be shielded by the income tax allowance. It

18
would also bring those on higher incomes that contribute to the funded pillars and those with
multiple or working pensions more fully into the tax net.
15.
Exploiting new revenue sources and closing existing tax loopholes would
broaden the adjustment effort (Box 4). As a proportion of GDP, the overall tax burden is
comparatively low, and wealth taxes are less than 25 percent of the EU average. A
broad-based real estate tax on individual property at a low rate, and an annual registration
fee on cars would yield substantial revenue. It would also limit the need for increases in
profits or income taxes that could deter investment or job creation, while placing the burden
of adjustment on wealthier households. Gradually phasing out the tax relief on mortgage
interest payments and corporate tax incentives would reduce the bias towards debt finance
and broaden the tax base. Meanwhile, there is scope to improve VAT compliance where the
gap to EU benchmarks is high. Tax administration would also be strengthened through the
introduction of mandatory income tax declarations and life-style surveys.
16.
Structural reforms in the education and health sectors will also generate savings
over the longer-term. Implementation of the World Bank recommendations to change
financing formulae to ensure student-teacher ratios evolve in-line with the declining
population will generate savings of over 1.3 percent of current GDP by 2020. With health
costs set to increase by about 4 percent of GDP by 2050, encouraging consolidation within
the dense hospital network and a greater reliance on primary care, out-patient services, and
patient copayments would promote efficiency. On-going reforms in the procurement of
pharmaceutical and other services should also help reduce the cost of health-related inputs.
17.
Improvements to the fiscal framework would support consolidation. A more
comprehensive reporting of contingent liabilities and tax expenditures is needed, as is a better
monitoring and control of municipal arrears and finances. Formal mid-year budget reviews
would also enhance the responsiveness of policies. Once the debt burden has been anchored
at a sustainable level, changes to the fiscal rule to prevent pro-cyclical spending in good
times, as set out in the authorities’ convergence program, would allow fiscal policy to play a
more effective stabilizing role in the management of economic cycles.
18.
The authorities are strongly committed to meeting their fiscal deficit targets.
They aim to design an ambitious adjustment package, comprising a few large reforms rather
than a series of smaller measures. The various options that staff outlined are being
considered, including the possibility of a greater reliance on funded pensions. This could be
accompanied by a more gradual reinstatement of transfers to the second pillar to help
compensate Sodra for the associated revenue loss, and by a possible VAT rate increase to
fund the basic pension. The authorities are seeking broad political support for such a package
and are actively seeking to explain the benefits of various measures, including new tax
instruments. They are keen to avoid recourse to further wage and pension or across-the-board
cuts that would harm the recovery, deepen deflation, and disproportionally impact the poor.

19
Box 3. Options for Social Insurance System Reform.
Social security system (Sodra) finances have deteriorated substantially. Contributions have fallen sharply
as wages in the economy adjust to their new level after the boom. However, the large benefit increases
granted in the boom leave Sodra’s spending far in excess of its revenues. Steps are needed to align benefits
with resources and to restore the long-term viability of the pension system.
Non-pension benefits. Exceed their earmarked contributions and incentives across unemployment,
sickness and maternity/paternity benefit systems are not well-aligned:



Maternity/paternity benefits are generous by EU standards. Payments are 120 percent the average
economy-wide wage, increasingly benefit the better-off, and risk reducing female labor supply.



Sickness benefits are still prone to moral hazard notwithstanding recent increases in the share paid by
employers. Increasing employer coverage from 2 to 7 days and stricter monitoring would better align
incentives.



Unemployment benefits fail to provide adequate income support. In the medium term, replacement
rates should be increased once fiscal space emerges.

Ensuring the long-term viability of the pension system. The current system is facing rising liabilities due
to implicit and explicit entitlements that are not covered by contributions. To ensure long-term viability:



Increasing the retirement age and linking it to the dependency ratio will help address the impact of
aging and migration pressures.



The pension system could rely more heavily on the funded component to reduce future liabilities—
provided ways are found to compensate Sodra for the income lost in the transition.



The basic minimum pension could be more efficiently funded by the budget given the government’s
ability to raise resources through sources which are broader and less distortive than contributions.



Employers’ social security contributions on behalf of employees escape the tax net. Taxing them at
either the contributions or benefit stage would remove a double-tax benefit.



Social insurance beneficiaries accrue entitlements without paying equivalent contributions and the
pension formula overcompensates recent earnings. Rescaling the wage conversion parameters and
automatic indexation to wage trends would make the system less discretionary.

such revenue. Given the distribution of
housing values in Lithuania, generating such a yield would require a low-rate tax imposed on a
broad-base. Exempting primary residences would significantly erode the base, duplicate the
capital gains exemption, and favor middle and high income earners.



Introducing an annual motor vehicle license fee, scaled according to engine size, would serve as a
green tax besides taxing wealth, and fall more heavily on high income earners. Other countries
typically generate about ½ percent of GDP from such fees.

Removing tax loopholes. While many tax exemptions have been abolished, those remaining are not
compatible with the corporate tax code and enterprises still enjoy generous exemptions.



The income tax codes provide many exemptions for property income, while asset price gains are
not captured by the capitals gain tax. Personal income tax allowances for children combined with
maternity/paternity benefits appear generous.



Abolishing the zero corporate income tax in free-economic zones would help preclude leakage via
transfer pricing. Incentives, like the reduced rate for small enterprises, have proved ineffective in
other countries and could be reconsidered.

Tax compliance. There is indicative evidence of a
large and pro-cyclical shadow economy.
Strengthening tax compliance would maximize the
gain from tax reforms.

B. Enhancing Financial Stability: Promoting Loss Recognition and Capitalization
19.
The overall banking system is sound but the outlook will continue to be
challenging. The high level of unemployment will entail an increasing share of households
facing financial distress with implications for credit risk, while the level of corporate
bankruptcies has risen sharply (up by 45 percent in 2009). Thus, even under current
expectations of modest recovery, NPLs could rise further, albeit at a declining pace, peaking
at about 23 percent in 2010 according to BoL simulations under baseline stress test scenarios.
Still, the banking system reports high capital levels—with Tier I capital accounting for two
thirds of total capital—that leaves system-wide capital levels more resilient to potential
shocks. BoL stress tests suggest that even under a severely adverse scenario which would
result in NPLs exceeding 30 percent by 2011, the system-wide CAR would remain above the
regulatory 8 percent minimum.

capital). The CAR of these banks had risen to 12 percent by end-March 2010. NPLs in these
banks, in part explained by a heavier involvement in corporate credit, accounted for almost
30 percent of gross loans and the coverage of loan-loss provisions was just over 15 percent
(4 percent of gross loans). This suggests a greater reliance on collateral to mitigate potential
losses, at a time when collateral is particularly difficult to value and realize given the sharp
correction and limited activity in asset markets. Moreover, some of these banks have
recently resumed lending, including to distressed sectors such as construction or real estate.

Addressing these
challenges will require a more forward looking approach. To proactively ensure bank
viability, especially from less capitalized and provisioned institutions, the BoL should
request banks to provide forward-looking business plans under a common stress scenario.
The plans would show each bank’s capacity to meet minimum prudential standards
(including solvency and liquidity), and generate reasonable level of cash income (before loan
provisioning) over a 24-month period. Should some banks show financial weaknesses, a
restructuring plan would accordingly be required. Staff also recommends an independent
professional assessment of the consistency of collateral valuation across institutions to
identify areas for further improvement, especially considering shortcomings in collateral

24
foreclosure due to market illiquidity and the reported rise in fraudulent bankruptcies. Moving
to a semi-annual audit schedule for two years, and rotating external auditing teams within
firms as early as feasible would also enhance the incentives for more timely recognition of
loan losses.
23.
Given the high level of nonperforming loans, ongoing efforts to fine-tune the
legal framework to facilitate voluntary debt restructuring are essential. Efforts
underway to strengthen the corporate bankruptcy law, and introduce a personal bankruptcy
act are welcome. Corporate debt restructuring procedures could be enhanced by addressing
legal and institutional shortcomings for the treatment of fraudulent bankruptcies, clarifying
the roles of courts and bankruptcy administrators and training sufficient staff, and granting
senior creditor status to new financing. Restructuring efforts should continue to be based on a
voluntary approach. Mandatory moratoriums on debt payments risk increasing the level of
non-performing loans in the banking system and delaying the recovery of solvent borrowers.
24.
In line with global initiatives, steps to enhance contingency planning and
resolution frameworks should continue. The by-laws for the 2009 Financial Stability Law
are now awaiting European Commission approval. Earlier IMF recommendations to expand
the resolution tool-kit to allow a purchase and assumption transaction and the creation of
bridge banks are pending on-going discussions at the EU-level. Beyond appropriate legal
tools, it is important to run regular crisis drills to identify weaknesses and bottlenecks in
crisis management, communication, intervention, and resolution procedures. In this regard,
staff welcomes Lithuania’s forthcoming participation in the Nordic Baltic Cross Border
Crisis Group and the recent MOU on crisis planning that set outs the rules and procedures
governing the exchange of information between the Ministry of Finance, BoL and Financial
Securities Regulator.
25.
The authorities saw the banking system as a whole as well equipped to deal with
new challenges given high capital and liquidity ratios, but views differed on the risks
posed by less-capitalized and provisioned institutions. They observed that the stricter
definition of NPLs in Lithuania should be taken into account when comparing provisioning
coverage levels across countries. The supervisory department stressed its ongoing efforts to
ensure banks’ inject additional capital if needed under specific time-bound plans following
annual on-site inspections, as well as the requirement that banks prepare stress test scenarios
to identify capital shortages (although these use banks’ own assumptions). The authorities
acknowledged the dispersion of soundness indicators across banks. The fact that some banks
had lower levels of provisioning than others was viewed by the supervisory department as the
consequence of higher collateral requirements in particular on corporate credit. Moreover,
collateral valuations were deemed conservative, validated by auditors and cross-checked by
the supervisor’s in-house expert. The supervisor viewed semi-annual audits and the rotation
of audit teams as risking an increase in the regulatory burden and cost on banks and
stretching audit firms’ human resource capacity.

estimated rate was 6 percent). Given this, real
GDP would only recover its pre-crisis levels in 2014/15. With the output gap only closing
then, inflation pressures will remain muted while the gradual recovery in domestic demand
slowly reduces the current account surplus.
27.
Amid improving competitiveness indicators, Lithuania’s export prospects
appear promising (Box 5). Lithuania was able to contain costs in the tradable sector during
the boom, despite wage and price inflation in non-tradable sectors. This helped more than
double Lithuania’s share of global exports over the decade, including in relatively high
value-added sectors. To date, the export recovery has been brisk which, combined with steep
adjustment in wage costs during the crisis, suggest competitiveness is improving. At this
juncture, overvaluation does not appear to present a significant policy challenge, with CGER
overvaluation estimates at modest levels. Moreover, CGER is based on the CPI rather than
the manufacturing-ULC REER, which is more relevant for competitiveness and which rose
less during the boom.

26
Box 5. Competitiveness1/
Competitiveness was not seriously eroded during the boom and ongoing wage declines help allay concerns
that internal costs are too high.
Lithuania’s CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 15 percent between 2000 and
October 2008, driven firstly by nominal exchange rate changes and then, in the second half of the decade, by
rising wage and price inflation in non-tradable sectors. The REER appreciated a further 8 percent in the
following six months as floating rate partner currencies depreciated sharply (notably Russia and Poland).
While this has since partially reversed, deflation has not yet had an impact, and the closure of Ignalina will
delay the correction further by raising energy prices.

Economy-wide unit labor cost-based REER measures have appreciated by about 40 percent between the first

relative to trade partners actually fell between 2000 and 2008 and its export market share more than doubled,
with gains particularly marked in some high valued-added areas such as capital goods.

Recent wage declines have been most pronounced in sectors such as construction or real estate services, but
even in manufacturing labor costs have fallen by some 10 percent. This bodes well for the country’s future
competitiveness.

28.
The high level of unemployment calls for decisive policy action. Proposals in
parliament to expand fixed-term contracts, ease dismissal requirements and allow greater
flexibility in overtime will, if implemented, further increase labor market flexibility and
encourage firms to hire earlier in the recovery. Plans to support job creation via EU funds
and by lowering social contributions for one year to 7.7 percent on first time hires could help
alleviate youth unemployment and bolster employment more generally. However, enhancing
coordination across government agencies and easing administrative and procurement
bottlenecks will help realize the ambitious targets for EU fund absorption.
29.
Wide-ranging efforts to improve the business climate could promote new
investment. The administrative and reporting burden on firms will be eased, by inter alia
clustering and then merging the 76 public agencies tasked with supervising firms’ operations.
The government is proactively seeking to boost FDI, and its efforts have resulted in a number
of high profile investments. Reform of state-owned enterprises through the disinvestment of
non-core activities and the attraction of strategic investors could reinforce this effort.
30.
The authorities see structural reform as essential to sustain the recovery. They
are optimistic that on-going efforts to improve the business climate and enhance flexibility in
the labor code will make Lithuania a more attractive investment destination. Increased
absorption of EU funds is key to their efforts to create jobs and promote investment.
Measures are being taken to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the EU funds’
administration system, to strengthen administrative capacities of the institutions managing
EU funds programs and to provide technical support for beneficiaries in preparing and
implementing projects. The authorities viewed any estimates of the remaining overvaluation
of the exchange rate as lacking significance particularly given the uncertainty surrounding
such estimates. The gains in world market share and recovery in exports this year, combined
with the on-going wage adjustment suggest in their view that exchange rate competitiveness
is not a significant policy challenge.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy is recovering supported by a determined policy response and the
global upturn. The authorities’ decisive financial sector and fiscal policies helped Lithuania
to weather the crisis and generate conditions for recovery. Staff expects real GDP to grow
modestly in 2010, with broadly balanced risks around the forecast. Looking ahead, medium
term growth is expected to be lower than in the boom, with real GDP only recovering its
pre-crisis levels in 2014/15.
32.
Further fiscal consolidation is needed to place deficits and debt on a sustainable
path. The debt burden could break the Maastricht ceiling as early as 2013, if no new
measures are taken. Some 5½ percent of GDP in additional effort is required suggesting a
comprehensive package of expenditure and revenue measures will be needed. Early
announcement of specific measures would underpin the credibility of the fiscal targets. Given
the large adjustment to date, there is a need to strike a balance between a broadening of the

28
tax base to yield greater revenues on one side, and insuring the sustainability of the social
insurance system on the other, in ways that protect the most vulnerable.
33.
Tackling the deficit in the social security system and expanding the revenue
base would achieve adjustment in a sustainable, pro-growth, and equitable manner.
Sodra’s deficit is large, reflecting in roughly equal measure overly generous parental benefits
and an unsustainable pension system. Reducing parental benefits to EU standards—along
with a comprehensive pension reform that raises the retirement age, moves to a more funded
system, and provides adequate funding of the minimum basic pension—would sustainably
reduce Sodra’s deficit. Exploiting new revenue sources, such as a real estate tax on personal
property and annual car tax, would help raise revenue in the least distortionary way. It would
also ensure the wealthier bear a greater share of the adjustment burden. There is also
substantial scope to bolster revenues over time by enhancing tax compliance.
34.
The banking system has weathered the crisis but challenges remain. Capital and
liquidity indicators have improved but the level of non-performing loans is high. Audited
accounts suggest the effort to provision for expected losses has been uneven across the
system, while banks’ capital and capacity to generate cash income will likely remain under
pressure.
35.
A more forward looking approach would increase incentives to recognize losses
and increase provisions and capital across the system. Regulators should continue to
closely monitor the sufficiency of banks’ loan loss provisions and request banks increase
their capital as needed under a strict timeframe. Requiring banks to prepare forward-looking
business plans under a common stress scenario would help assess their viability. This effort
should be complemented with an independent professional assessment of the consistency of
collateral valuation across institutions, a semi-annual audit schedule, and rotation of external
auditing teams within audit firms. To ensure the recovery of viable borrowers and the
adequate protection of creditors, on-going reforms to strengthen the legal framework for
voluntary debt restructuring is key and should remain the preferred procedure.
36.
A sustained recovery also hinges on the ability of the economy to rebalance
towards tradables. Prospects for the export sector are encouraging. During the boom years,
Lithuania was able to contain costs in the export sector and gain world market share, despite
rapid wage and price inflation in non-tradables. This, combined with a significant fall in
wage costs in the downturn, is supporting competitiveness and staff considers than any
residual overvaluation is modest.
37.
The rising level of unemployment is a growing social and economic challenge,
making it imperative to advance with structural reforms. Recent packages to support
employment generation through increased absorption of EU funds are welcome, as are the
new proposals to further enhance labor market flexibility. Steps to improve the business
climate and the performance of state-owned enterprises could help stimulate investment.
38.
It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the regular 12-month
cycle.

1/ Without foreign bank branches.
2/ Total profits (losses) after tax. Interim quarterly results are annualised.
3/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans with payments on which are overdue more than 60 days. Until 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
4/ Non-performing loans are defined as the sum of the impaired loans and those non-impaired loans that are overdue more than 60 days. New series not comparable to the previous ones.
5/ Data as of the end of period.
6/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in Litai within the last quarter of the period.
7/ Specific provisions include provisions against general portfolio risk until end-2004. From end-2005, due to the change in definition of NPLs, specific provisions are not directly attributable to the NPLs.
Therefore, the ratio may turn negative.
8/ Specific provisions include allowances for both individually and collectively assessed loans.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) was subject to
and completed a safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, (the SBA
was approved on August 30, 2001 and expired on March 29, 2003) on December 10, 2001.
The assessment identified certain weaknesses and proposed appropriate recommendations as
reported in EBS/01/211. The BOL has implemented these recommendations.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Lithuania is the litas. From April 1, 1994 to February 1, 2002, the litas was
pegged to the U.S. dollar at LTL 4 per U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement. Since
February 2, 2002 the litas has been pegged to the euro at LTL 3.4528 per euro. Lithuania
joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, and ERM II on June 28, 2004. Lithuania
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payment and transfers for
current international transactions except for those maintained solely for the preservation of

3
national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Lithuania is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on August 7, 2009. The Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2009/pn09104.htm and the staff report and other
mission documents at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=23437.0
XII.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

An FSAP Update mission was completed on November 19, 2007. Fiscal and statistics
ROSCs were completed in November 2002 and December 2002, respectively.
XII.

Technical Assistance:

The table on the following page summarizes the technical assistance missions provided by
the Fund to Lithuania since 2000.
XIII. Resident Representative: Mark Allen (stationed in Warsaw, Poland).
XIV. Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism:
The money laundering prevention framework is based on the amended Law on the
Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, Resolutions of the
Government, and Prevention Guidelines for credit institutions confirmed by a Resolution of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania. In 2006, MONEYVAL evaluated
Lithuania’s AML/CFT framework and concluded that the system was quite sound while
suggesting improvements in the implementation of AML/CFT measures. An amended Law
on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing was adopted in January 2008.
It transposes the Third Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Directive
2005/60/EC and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC laying down implementing measures for
Directive 2005/60/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 relating to information on the
payer accompanying transfers of funds. It also incorporates the previous law's provisions that
transpose Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 on controls of cash entering or leaving the
European Community as well as 40+9 FATF recommendations.

APPENDIX II: LITHUANIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS

Lithuania graduated from World Bank financing in Fall 2006, and became an IDA donor
during the IDA 15 replenishment. The last Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was launched
at the time of Lithuania's accession to the EU in May 2004. The CPS supported capacitybuilding for the public sector, sustaining growth through an improved business environment
as well as rural development, and reducing social vulnerability. All Bank-financed projects
under the last CPS have closed. The last two closed in December 2008—the Klaipeda Port
Project which enhanced the efficiency and safety of the Klaipeda port operations, and the
Vilnius Heat Demand Management Project (financed by a grant from the Global
Environment Facility) which contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the
Vilnius District Heating system.
Following graduation, Lithuania maintained an active dialogue with the Bank and made use
of the Bank’s post-graduation TA which expired in fiscal 2009. The Bank provided technical
assistance to the Government of Lithuania on strengthening support to rural regions to assist
the implementation of the EU's rural development programs. The Lithuanian authorities
requested use of Bank-financed technical assistance to assist the Ministry of Education and
Science in producing and absorbing innovation, research and development to compete more
effectively in the European market. Bank engagement has also included the development of a
public private partnership framework as well as the development of the consumer protection
and pension annuities as part of a region-wide diagnostic review.
More recently, in response to the global crisis, the Bank delivered a number of analytical
works to support the Government of Lithuania’s efforts to manage the economic downturn. A
rapid-response public expenditure review of the social sectors was prepared in May 2009 to
help the government prepare the 2010 budget and protect vulnerable citizens through the
social safety net. The report recommends fiscal consolidation and reforms that would
generate immediate fiscal savings while making social sector spending more efficient and
equitable. This work was followed by related technical assistance to help the Ministry of
Health identify options to reduce pharmaceutical expenditure. In addition, the Bank prepared
a Financial Sector Vulnerability Assessment in early 2010 focusing on the overall credit
portfolio and liquidity condition of banks as well as the regulatory framework and
institutional measures and the role of bank supervisors.

APPENDIX III. LITHUANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and
its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various
websites through the Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC
data module was published in November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled using both
the production and expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to
be more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical
discrepancies between these two estimates are shown separately in the published figures as
the discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. The annual and the
quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000. In
general, good data sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national
accounts, but measuring activity in the current volatile environment is proving very
challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain in measuring the economic activity of the
informal sector. These estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic activity using
fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006. A further update of the size of the informal sector is expected to be released
in late 2010-early 2011.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is
calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.

7
Public Finance
Data on the central government budget execution are available at a monthly and quarterly
frequency, although these data are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project
is expected to improve fiscal data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to
clarify the treatment of public health care providers and of EU transactions, and the
consolidation procedure for government operations. A new classification, incorporating the
GFSM2001 was approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF has been reporting to STA
general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis (except for local
governments, which are still on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). In addition, the MoF has been reporting quarterly and monthly
data in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in the IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line
with the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following
Lithuania’s accession to the European Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for
compiling and reporting monetary data reflecting the ECB regulations and ESA 95 on
sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
External Sector
The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment position
(IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on
balance of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular
basis. Balance of payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the
format recommended in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly
data correspond to several key balance of payments components, compiled on the basis of a
sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some nonfinancial private
sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked
to the Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in
the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Dissemination of Statistics
The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of publications,
including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:

8

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Lithuania
On July, 06, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
A determined policy response helped Lithuania weather the crisis. The country experienced a
severe output decline in 2009 as a reversal in capital flows led to a collapse of domestic
demand and the global recession caused exports to fall. Output dropped by 14.8 percent
in 2009 and by 20 percent from peak to trough. The adjustment of the economy has been
large and swift. The current account swung from a sizeable double-digit deficit to a surplus of
nearly 4 percent of GDP in 2009. Inflation quickly ebbed, with core prices now falling for over a
year. Wages have also declined sharply and unemployment rose to very high levels.
A large fiscal consolidation with measures worth about 10 percent of GDP in the 2009–10
budgets contained the fiscal deficit to 8.9 percent of GDP in 2009. The early and sizeable
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
fiscal adjustment was rewarded with access to international bond markets at declining cost.
Still, the public debt burden has doubled, reaching 33 percent of GDP at end-March 2010. In
the financial sector, capital and liquidity indicators have improved aided by new capital
injections. However, asset quality has suffered. The non-performing loan ratio rose almost
four-fold from end-2008 to 19.2 percent by end-March 2010. Provisions in the system
increased to about 40 percent of the non-performing loan stock but banks are making large
losses and credit is contracting.
Lithuania is now benefitting from the global recovery. Recent data are encouraging, with signs
that an economic recovery is starting to take hold. In 2010, real GDP is expected to grow by
2 percent on the back of an export-led recovery. Deflation in core CPI is expected to persist,
although higher energy and food prices will leave headline inflation close to zero. Over the
medium term, domestic demand is likely to remain subdued amid high unemployment, falling
incomes, and weak credit prospects. As such, a return to pre-crisis growth rates is unlikely and
real GDP is only expected to recover its pre-crisis levels in 2014/15.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their decisive fiscal and financial sector
policies during the crisis, which helped stabilize the economy and generate a recovery.
Notwithstanding encouraging signs, the Lithuanian economy faces important challenges of
high fiscal deficits and rapidly growing public debt as well as a high stock of non-performing
bank loans. In addition, growth needs to rebalance towards exports. Addressing these
challenges will sustain the recovery and facilitate euro adoption.
Directors commended the large fiscal consolidation implemented in the 2009 and 2010
budgets. Nevertheless, further consolidation is critical to maintain confidence, reduce
borrowing needs, and place debt on a sustainable path. Directors recommended a timely
announcement of a package of specific expenditure and revenue measures so as to underpin
the credibility of the consolidation path and ensure that it is achieved in a sustainable, growthfriendly, and equitable manner.
Directors emphasized that far-reaching reform of the social insurance system will be
necessary to tackle its large deficit. They saw scope to reduce generous social benefits and
restore the viability of the pension system by increasing the retirement age and gradually
moving towards a mandatory funded system, while ensuring adequate funding for the
minimum basic pension. Expenditure adjustment will need to be complemented with revenue
enhancing measures as part of a broad-based package. In particular, it will be important to
exploit new, less distortive revenue sources, such as wealth taxes and to strengthen tax
compliance.
Directors noted that, overall the financial sector had weathered the crisis well, with both
liquidity and capital indicators improving despite rising levels of non-performing loans. They

3
cautioned however that some banks are not as well provisioned and capitalized, and also face
pressure on interest rate margins. Directors considered it important that banks be subjected to
forward-looking stress tests to ensure their viability. They commended the ongoing efforts to
fine-tune the legal framework to facilitate voluntary debt restructuring and cautioned against
mandatory moratoriums on debt payments that risk increasing the level of non-performing
loans in the banking system.
Directors emphasized that export performance would be key to future growth. They noted that
Lithuania’s success in preserving cost competitiveness during the boom was supported also
by adjustment and on-going decline in wages. This has contributed to the credibility of the
currency board arrangement as an anchor for macroeconomic policy. Directors nevertheless
emphasized that continued progress in structural reforms was needed to reorient the economy
towards tradeables as a source of growth.
Directors stressed that high and rising levels of unemployment call for decisive action. They
supported the plans to enhance labor market flexibility and proposals in parliament to expand
fixed-term contracts, ease dismissal requirements, and allow greater flexibility in overtime.
Effective use of European Union funds to support job creation will be crucial. Directors also
welcomed initiatives to improve the business climate and attract foreign direct investment.
These initiatives, coupled with ongoing structural reforms, would enhance medium-term growth
prospects.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Per Callesen, Executive Director for the Republic of Lithuania and
Mr. Rimtautas Bartkus, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 6, 2010

The Lithuanian authorities extend high appreciation to Ms. Purfield and her team for their
distinguished cooperation and well-written report. The authorities highly value staff’s
assessment of the country’s economic and financial policies and their professional advice,
which they take into account when considering policy options.
Economic outlook
Lithuania experienced sharp output contraction in 2009 as the global financial and economic
crisis deepened the cyclical economic downturn. Domestic demand plunged due to
undergoing internal adjustment after a period of excessive growth in the non-tradable sector,
whereas exports were negatively affected by the global recession. Private consumption
shrank reflecting reduced economic sentiment, tighter credit conditions, and lower household
disposable income. Investment fell on account of the increased economic uncertainty,
changed financial conditions, and deterioration in the real estate market.
The economy started to show clear signs of stabilization in the second half of 2009 and
modest recovery is on the way in 2010. Positive quarterly output growth was recorded for the
last two quarters of 2009. Although this welcomed trend was temporarily interrupted in the
first quarter of 2010, in large part due to the impact of the closure of the Ignalina Nuclear
Power Plant (INPP), it is expected to resume as early as from the next quarter. Exports staged
a strong recovery, as the external demand has improved, and were 17.2 percent higher for the
first four months of 2010, compared with the same period a year ago. Confidence indicators
strengthened markedly, retail sales stabilized and lately started to increase, housing prices are
bottoming-out as well. Increased absorption of the EU structural funds shall further support
economic recovery and re-orientation towards the tradable sector. The authorities project the
economy to expand by 0.5–1.6 percent this year, with more pronounced real GDP growth
(about 3 percent) expected in 2011.
Substantial external adjustment occurred in 2009 and the current account reversed from a
large deficit into surplus. Changes in the current account were mostly driven by considerably
lower trade deficit and higher EU related current transfers. The authorities project the current
account balance to remain positive (1.5 percent of GDP) in 2010 and turn slightly negative
in 2011–12 to -0.6 and -1.3 percent of GDP, respectively.
Lithuania maintained external competitiveness, which is best illustrated by the developments
in export market shares. Export market shares temporary contracted in the first half of 2009
as currencies in some of the export markets experienced steep depreciation, but fully

2
recovered later on and reached, or even exceeded, the level of 2007–08. The Lithuanian
industries reacted to changed internal and external economic conditions by re-orientating
from domestic demand and successfully finding new export markets. The fastest recovery
has been observed in the manufacturing sectors, having higher intensity to modern
technologies. Lithuania more than doubled its share in global exports over the last decade
and its tradable sector already comprises a high share of GDP (about 40 percent).
Fiscal consolidation and structural expenditure reforms
In response to the worsening revenue outlook and increasing expenditure pressures, the
authorities implemented ambitious fiscal consolidation in 2009–10. Forceful policy
measures, amounting to 12 percent of GDP, helped to contain deterioration in public finances
and limited accumulation of debt. By facilitating orderly adjustment in the economy it also
provided necessary support to the credibility of the currency board. Convincing consolidation
measures helped to enhance market confidence, as has been demonstrated by the successful
issuance of government bonds during periods of heightened market uncertainty, also by
general narrowing of spreads, CDS risk premiums and improved outlook for sovereign credit
ratings in early 2010.
The authorities carefully considered the design of measures being implemented, with
particular emphasis given to their quality and social sensitiveness. Approximately 1/5 of the
measures undertaken were revenue increasing, with the rest falling on expenditures. Most
important revenue measures were the abolishment of reduced VAT rates and a general rate
increase, also changes to excises. These measures have lower impact on the tradable sector
and therefore could be seen as contributing to economic reorientation. After initial cuts more
targeted and progressive cuts in the public sector wages, pensions, and social benefits
followed. Some of the cuts, for example in parental benefits, were reversing previous
unsustainable increases in the level of benefits. While part of the measures implemented are
considered to be temporary, such as reduced transfers to private pension funds (Pillar II) and,
to some extent, wage and pension cuts, they will be extended until permanent solutions are
found.
Increased absorption of the EU structural funds plays an important non-deficit increasing
role in stimulating the Lithuanian economy. The absorption of EU funds was almost 5 times
higher in 2009, compared with 2008, and is expected to reach its peak in 2010–11. A signed
loan agreement with the European Investment Bank provides additional EUR 1.1 billion
available for national co-financing of the EU supported investment projects in the public
sector, thereby reducing domestic financing constrains.
The authorities are fully aware that despite substantial measures already implemented,
further consolidation efforts will be needed to meet their 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit
target by 2012 and to stabilize debt at a sustainable low level. The authorities are strongly

3
committed to undertake further measures to tackle the remaining challenges and recognize
that the most important challenges are in the social sector. The authorities are already well
advanced in implementing comprehensive efficiency-enhancing structural expenditure
reforms in education and health care sectors, whereas the reform of the social security and
pension system is under way. Initial guidelines of the public administration reform were also
introduced to society. The authorities are confident that successful implementation of these
reform plans will put the economy on a stronger footing and will contribute to its
competitiveness.
In June, the government approved the concept of comprehensive social security and pension
system reform, which discusses proposals to enhance efficiency and long term sustainability
of the social security and pension system, while maintaining an adequate level of benefits. It
is expected to reach an agreement on the key reform measures through 2010. Proposals for
the pension system reform seek to address aging related challenges, increase transparency
and predictability of the system, reduce its vulnerability, and provide better incentives for the
participants. The most important measures include strengthening the link between
contributions and benefits, amending indexation rules and simplifying the pension formula,
eliminating duplicate payments, and making clearer delineation between funded part of the
system and basic social pension, with the latter being financed from the budget.
The first phase of the reform has already started as the government submitted a package of
proposals to the parliament that foresee gradual increase in the retirement age starting
from 2012, elimination of some duplicate payments, further extension of previously
introduced cuts in the public sector wages and reduction in the level of sickness benefit. It is
also proposed to cap generous parental benefits, while providing more flexibility to choose
the duration of the benefit. Reduced transfers to Pillar II will remain in place as an interim
measure until a generally improving economic situation and implemented reform measures
will reduce tensions in the pension system to an acceptable level.
The authorities are also considering revenue enhancing measures proposed by staff and
measures to strengthen the fiscal framework. Based on the guidelines prepared by the
Ministry of Finance, the authorities started public discussions with social partners on the
feasibility and timing of the possible broad-based real estate tax to natural persons. The
authorities also stepped up efforts to enhance tax administration and compliance. Conceptual
proposals to strengthen the budget planning and execution framework have been drafted by
the authorities. It is proposed to introduce fiscal stance and impulse indicators in the
budgetary planning process, also binding rules for anti-inflationary fiscal policy, taking into
account the assessment of the output gap. Expenditure execution framework should be
enhanced by more stringent expenditure evaluation criteria, improved cost-benefit analysis,
and strategic planning.

4
Monetary and financial sector issues
Lithuania’s financial system weathered the impact from the global financial crisis and is well
positioned to withstand further potential shocks. Lithuania benefited from deep financial
integration in the Nordic-Baltic region, with strong presence of reputable Scandinavian
banks, holding 80 percent of the total banking system assets, contributing to systemic
stability. Banks operating in Lithuania follow a more conservative retail-banking business
model and supervision of credit institutions is in line with international standards, as has been
so noted in the 2007 FSAP update. The risk of debt overhang as an impediment to economic
recovery and reorientation towards the tradable sector is comparably lower in Lithuania,
given, by regional standards, low private sector indebtedness (68 percent of GDP). The
currency board arrangement provided an additional source of stability during the times of
heightened global uncertainty and remains an important monetary anchor. The authorities see
an eventual introduction of the euro as the most credible exit strategy from the currency
board and plan their policies in accordance with this objective.
Deterioration of asset quality in the financial institutions mirrors sizeable output contraction
and ongoing restructuring in the economy, however despite rapid increase in NPLs all
financial institutions were able to absorb incurring losses and none have requested support
from the state. The largest shock to the banking system has already been absorbed and the
level of NPLs is expected to start stabilizing in the second half of 2010 as the economic
growth strengthens. Although the 2010 data indicate that the quality of loan portfolio has
been still slightly decreasing, stabilization is getting noticeable. The level of NPLs itself to a
large extent could be explained by the structure of the loan portfolio and stricter definition of
the non-performing loan category in Lithuania, compared with other countries.
Stability in the banking system as a whole and in individual institutions has improved, since
banks have strengthened their capital base and risk management. Last year, the loan
portfolio in the banking sector was reassessed conservatively and historically large
provisions were made by banks. Notwithstanding large credit losses incurred by banks, the
compliance with prudential requirements as well as the resilience to shocks has been
improving. Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios of the banking system has reached one of
the highest levels in recent years, respectively 15.1 and 45.1 percent (compared with 8 and
30 percent prudential requirements). Developments in deposits also reflect confidence in the
banking system. Despite substantially lower interest rates, deposits increased to previously
unseen highs, allowing banks to reduce dependence on parent bank funding and increasing
liquidity in domestic banks.
The Bank of Lithuania has been monitoring the situation in the banking system closely, with
particular emphasis given to the developments in asset quality and banks’ shock absorption
capacity. Stress-testing has been enhanced and its frequency increased. Banks were asked to
update stress-tests semi-annually, with unified stress-testing scenarios being prepared. The

5
contingency and business plans of banks are carefully evaluated based on the stress-testing
results and banks will be asked to adjust their business plans if the results of a unified stresstesting will so require. The results of stress-tests carried out this May showed that the capital
buffers in the banking system are sufficient to absorb credit losses even under the worst-case
scenarios. However, in the worst-case scenario some individual banks would require
additional capital injection. The banks plan to increase their capital already this year. The
authorities will continue to monitor liquidity, capital adequacy and credit risks closely and
will request banks to inject additional capital if needed. Based on the capital strengthening
measures currently being implemented and planned for the nearest future, banks will manage
to ensure sufficient level of capital without the need for support from the state.
Going forward supervisors will further concentrate their efforts on strengthening the risk
management processes in credit institutions. The Bank of Lithuania paid particular attention
to risk management and strengthening of capital basis. The Bank of Lithuania has already
approved the legal act based on which banks will have to additionally assess their liquidity
situation and to ensure sufficient liquidity buffers as well as to evaluate the liquidity
counterbalance capacity in order to withstand a liquidity stress in a short, medium and long
timeframe. In 2010, new requirements for calculating capital adequacy ratio will enter into
effect, which should ensure better assessment of banks capital for covering the risks. New
legal acts have been drafted to supplement limitations and management of the concentration
risk. Every year, the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is carried out, and a
close assessment is made to evaluate whether banks properly ensure risk management and
have sufficient capital to cover it. An SREP for banks that belong to foreign banking groups
is performed in cooperation with the foreign supervisory authorities, what allows to assess
risks and management methods for the overall banking group.
Additional efforts were undertaken by the authorities to enhance operational preparedness
for crisis prevention and management. Contingency planning has been strengthened by
adopting the Financial Crises Prevention and Management Plan, which has clarified the role
of relevant institutions in crisis prevention and management, enhanced information exchange
and established a Crisis Management and Prevention Commission. The crisis resolution
framework was further improved by the acceptance of the Financial Stability Law, which
defined measures for possible state support and intervention in the financial institutions.
More recently, operational by-laws were drafted to support the implementation of the
Financial Stability Law and await approval by the European Commission. Cross-border
cooperation with the home supervisors of foreign banks operating in Lithuania has been
strengthened by signing multiple Memorandums of Understanding, enhancing cooperation in
information exchange, jointly participating in the supervisory colleges, and carrying out joint
on-site inspections.
The authorities are also putting efforts to facilitate orderly debt restructuring in the private
sector. The existing legal framework for corporate restructuring and bankruptcy shall be

strengthened, with the aim to provide more flexibility, while strengthening prevention of
fraudulent bankruptcies and securing creditors' rights. Based on the technical assistance
provided by the Fund, the framework for natural persons’ bankruptcy is also under
preparation.
