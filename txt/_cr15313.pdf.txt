IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On November 9, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Mexico.
Mexico has faced a complex global environment over the last year, characterized by a rise in
global financial market volatility and the collapse of oil prices. Nonetheless, the economy has
continued to grow at a moderate pace, and capital outflow pressures have been limited. The
flexible exchange rate has helped the economy adjust to external shocks, while inflation has
remained low and stable. The Mexican peso has depreciated by 16 percent in real effective terms
in the last twelve months. Mexico is implementing a broad range of structural reforms, which
should help lift potential growth over the medium term.
The economy is projected to grow by 2.25 percent this year. Construction activity has moderated
after a strong rebound in the second half of last year. Manufacturing and services remain the
main driver of growth, although weaker-than-expected U.S. demand affected manufacturing
exports in early 2015. A fall in domestic oil production continues to be a drag on growth. Real
GDP growth is expected to accelerate modestly to 2.5 percent in 2016, supported by
strengthening external demand. Lower electricity prices and the real depreciation of the peso
should boost Mexico’s manufacturing production and exports, with positive spillovers to
domestic demand.
Inflation remains close to the target and medium-term inflation expectations are anchored. Yearon-year headline inflation dropped below the target in early 2015 on account of lower
telecommunication service prices, smaller adjustment in administered fuel prices, and the
reversal of effects related to last year’s tax hikes on some food items. The exchange rate passthrough has been very limited so far. Real wage growth has been broadly in line with
productivity growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The policy mix has shifted to a gradual fiscal tightening. The public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) is projected to decline to 4.1 percent of GDP this year (from 4.6 percent in
2014). The sharp decline in oil revenues has been offset by higher-than-expected fuel excises and
income taxes (related to the 2013 tax reform) and by the oil-price hedge of oil export receipts. At
the same time, monetary policy conditions remain very accommodative. The Bank of Mexico
has maintained the policy rate at 3 percent since June last year. The Foreign Exchange
Commission has reactivated two foreign exchange intervention schemes, with the goal of
increasing liquidity and reducing volatility in exchange rate markets.
Commercial bank credit growth has strengthened to 10 percent in the first half of 2015. The
improvement has been broad-based across sectors. Bank balance sheets remain strong, with
capital levels well in excess of requirements and low non-performing loans. Corporate and
household balance sheets are also reasonably healthy, despite some increase in corporate
borrowing in foreign currency in recent years.
Implementation of the key structural reforms is broadly on track. The telecommunications
reform has led to a decline in service prices, and the opening of the sector has already attracted
foreign direct investment. The latest auction of oil fields under the energy reform was very
successful. The financial reform has strengthened consumer protection and led to increased
competition in the banking sector.
The external sector position remains broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 2.25 percent in
2015, reflecting a reduction in the hydrocarbons trade balance. The 2015 cyclically-adjusted
current account balance is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that, despite unfavorable external conditions, the Mexican economy
continues to grow steadily while financial stability has been well safeguarded. However, given
Mexico’s open capital account, substantial external risks weigh on the outlook, notably
weaker-than-expected growth in its major trading partners and key emerging market economies,
and a potential resurgence of global financial market volatility. Directors considered that
Mexico’s strong fundamentals and credible policy frameworks will help the economy weather
shocks, while the Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the Fund has provided additional
insurance against tail risks. Meanwhile, steadfast implementation of the structural reform agenda,

alongside progress in improving security and the rule of law, should help lift potential growth in
the medium term.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to gradually consolidate public
finances and set the ratio of public debt to GDP on a downward trajectory. They welcomed the
targeted reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and the proposed reform of fuel
excise taxes aimed at reducing carbon emissions and stabilizing tax revenues over the medium
term. Directors encouraged the authorities to also eliminate inefficient electricity subsidies while
protecting vulnerable households through targeted transfers.
Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to enhance fiscal discipline and accountability, while at the
same time retaining sufficient flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. They supported
the proposed fiscal responsibility framework for state and local governments, stressing that
capacity building at the local government level is key to its success. Directors also recommended
that the authorities explore possible initiatives to further strengthen the Fiscal Responsibility Law
over time, including considerations of a long-term nominal anchor and tighter exceptional
circumstance clauses, as well as institutional enhancements to better inform the debate on fiscal
issues.
Directors considered that the accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate for
the near term in light of the remaining slack in the economy and the absence of wage and price
pressures. However, they called on the authorities to stand ready to tighten the monetary stance if
the exchange rate pass-through to inflation intensifies and second-round effects emerge.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that the external position is in line with economic
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. They emphasized that the flexible exchange rate
should continue to be the main absorber of external shocks. While recognizing that the
temporary foreign exchange intervention schemes have helped enhance market liquidity and
reduce volatility, they encouraged the authorities to limit the use of international reserves to
periods of disorderly market conditions and to gradually rebuild them once pressures on asset
prices subside.
Directors noted that the financial sector remains sound and that financial reforms have
progressed well. They underlined the importance of close monitoring of corporate leverage,
further strengthening the judicial process of contract enforcement, and improving access to
finance while maintaining high credit standards especially at development banks.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 26, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: Mexico has navigated successfully a complex external environment,
characterized by falling commodity prices, a sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar, and
heightened volatility in international financial markets. The economy is projected to
grow at 2¼ percent in 2015, with inflation close to the target. Looking ahead, growth
should be supported by strengthening external demand and by the implementation of
the structural reforms. The main risks are negative surprises to U.S. growth, a renewed
surge in capital flow volatility, or a further decline in domestic oil production.
Macroeconomic Policies: Macroeconomic policies remain focused on maintaining
strong fundamentals and safeguarding financial stability. The authorities are committed
to a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit over 2015–18, which would set the ratio of
public debt to GDP on a downward path in the medium term. The accommodative
stance of monetary policy has supported growth, while inflation remains low and stable.
Continued steady and transparent implementation of structural reforms is critical to
boost potential growth.
Advice from Previous Article IV Consultations: Consistent with past Fund advice, the
authorities maintained commitment to the fiscal consolidation path over 2015–18, and
identified specific measures to achieve it. The approved structural reforms are also in line
with past staff advice, and implementation is broadly on track. A number of
recommendations from the last FSAP report have been implemented, including
strengthening of consolidated supervision and improving the legal bankruptcy
framework. An FSAP update is scheduled for 2016.

CONTEXT
1.
Mexico has faced a complex global environment over the last year. International oil
prices declined by more than 50 percent since mid-2014. The drop in oil prices has had a limited
impact on the current account as Mexico has a broadly balanced trade in hydrocarbons. However, it
increased the fiscal consolidation burden and might affect prospects for private investment in the oil
sector in the medium term. In addition, emerging market asset prices were hit by a rise in global
financial volatility and a portfolio shift away from emerging markets. As a consequence, the Mexican
peso has depreciated sharply against the US dollar since mid-2014, prompting the Foreign Exchange
Commission to put in place a rules-based foreign exchange intervention program. Despite the
increase in asset price volatility, economic activity continues to grow at a steady pace, and inflation
remains low and stable.
2.
In the context of high financial market volatility, policies in Mexico remain focused on
maintaining strong fundamentals and safeguarding financial stability. The flexible exchange
rate has helped the economy adjust to external shocks. The authorities have reiterated their
commitment to reduce public sector deficits and stabilize public debt. Continued implementation of
a broad range of structural reforms would help lift potential growth over the medium term.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. Growth is projected to reach
2¼ percent in 2015. Economic activity has been slower than expected in the first half of the year.
Manufacturing continues to expand, although exports have been affected by weaker-than-expected
U.S. demand, reflecting in part weather-related factors and port strikes early in the year.
Construction activity has moderated after a strong rebound in the second half of 2014. Domestic
crude oil production has continued to decline, subtracting about ¼ percentage point from growth
in 2015 (Figure 1).
4.
Inflation pressures remain contained, despite the sharp peso depreciation. The drop in
year-on-year inflation since early 2015 has been due in part to a one-off decline in
telecommunication service prices, lower adjustment in administered fuel prices, and the reversal of
the effect of tax hikes on some food items in 2014.1 Quarterly annualized seasonally-adjusted
headline and core inflation rates have been very close to the 3-percent target since April. The
exchange rate pass-through has been very limited so far, and inflation expectations remain
anchored. Real wage growth is broadly in line with productivity growth (Figure 2).

The price of gasoline and diesel were increased by 1.9 percent in January 2015—compared to around 11 percent in
2014—with no additional adjustments expected in 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

5.
The mix of policies has shifted toward a gradual fiscal tightening, with monetary
policy remaining accommodative. The Bank of Mexico has maintained the policy rate at 3 percent
since June last year. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is projected to decline to
4.1 percent of GDP this year (from 4.6 percent in 2014, Table 2). Based on fiscal trends in the first
eight months, the target is achievable, although it will require compression of spending in the
remainder of the year. The sharp decline in oil revenues has been offset by higher-than-expected
fuel excises and income taxes (related to the 2013 tax reform), and by the oil-price hedge.2
6.
Asset prices in Mexico have been affected by the rise in volatility in global financial
markets. The peso had depreciated by 30 percent against the U.S. dollar, and by 15 percent in real
effective terms between mid-2014 and September. Foreign exchange bid-ask spreads and stock
market volatility have increased to levels last seen during the euro area sovereign debt crisis in
November 2011 and the taper tantrum, respectively. In response, the Foreign Exchange Commission
reactivated two foreign exchange intervention schemes intended to increase liquidity and reduce
volatility in exchange rate markets.3 In contrast, the local-currency sovereign bond market showed
few effects of the turbulence: the long end of the domestic-currency yield curve has shifted up only
modestly. Total non-resident ownership of sovereign debt has been broadly stable since the end of
2014, though there has been a decline in non-resident holdings of short-term paper (Figure 3).
Portfolio capital inflows moderated, but stayed positive in the first half of the year. Higher frequency
partial data from ETFs and mutual funds suggest that outflow pressures intensified in July and
August, and corporate bond issuance in foreign currency trailed off in the third quarter (Figure 4).

Mexico’s government insures its net export oil receipts by purchasing put options at a strike price equal to the oil
price assumed in the budget. The income from the hedge is expected to amount to ½ percent of GDP in 2015.
3

The first scheme, activated last December, is a minimum price FX auction of US$200 million triggered when the
exchange rate depreciates by 1.5 percent vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar with respect to the previous day (the threshold has
been 1 percent since July 30, 2015). The second scheme, in place since March 2015, is a preannounced daily FX
auction (initially of US$52 million, raised to US$200 million since July 30) with no minimum price. The two schemes
will be active through the end of November. Both intervention modalities have been used in the past.

7.
The external sector position remains broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The current account deficit is projected to widen to
2¼ percent in 2015, reflecting a reduction in the hydrocarbons trade balance. Mexico has turned
into a small net importer of hydrocarbons in value terms as a result of declining oil production. The
2015 cyclically-adjusted current account balance is broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies. The currency depreciation reflects in part an overshooting
related to the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis emerging market currencies in 2015, and
to a smaller extent, prospects for lower-than-expected investment in the oil sector. 4 The real
effective exchange rate is assessed by staff to be moderately undervalued (3–12 percent), and the
undervaluation is expected to be temporary (Box 1).

The real effective exchange rate has depreciated by
about 15 percent by September 2015 relative to its average 2014 value. The depreciation reflects
to a large extent a temporary overshooting related to the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar
against emerging market currencies, heightened volatility of the prices of risky assets, and
increased hedging activities by corporations and non-resident investors in the local currency bond
market. To a smaller extent, the depreciation reflects some deterioration in fundamentals.1 In
staff’s view, the real effective exchange rate is undervalued by about 3–12 percent. This is
consistent with the results from real effective exchange rate levels approach, which finds an
undervaluation of 8 percent (Annex II). As the undervaluation is expected to be temporary, it does
not call for changes in policies.
____________
1

The lower path of oil prices is likely to lead to lower-than-expected oil investment and production over the
medium term, with negative effects on growth. A decline in oil prices also has a small negative effect on the
current account balance because Mexico exports crude oil and imports refined petroleum products. The price of
refined oil is less sensitive to global oil prices because of the fixed cost of refining. Staff estimates suggest that a
10 percent decline in crude oil prices reduce the oil trade balance by about 0.05 percentage point of GDP, all else
equal.
4

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the highly liquid market for the Mexican peso is often used for hedging other
emerging market currency exposures; therefore, movements of the currency during periods of market stress may be
unrelated to fundamentals. Staff analysis of the taper tantrum found that the peso was one of the most affected
emerging market currencies in the initial phase of the episode; it rebounded at a later stage, when investors started
to differentiate on the basis of fundamentals (see Box 1 in Mexico: Arrangements Under the Flexible Credit Line,
November 2014).

Box 1. External Sector Assessment (concluded)
Mexico’s net international investment liability position stood at 33 percent of GDP at end-2014.
Gross liabilities were 75.6 percent of GDP, dominated by portfolio liabilities (37 percent of GDP)
and FDI (26.3 percent of GDP). External assets stood at 42.6 percent of GDP in 2015.
Mexico remains committed to a floating exchange rate, although the authorities’ framework
allows for the occasional use of foreign exchange intervention to prevent disorderly market
conditions. The current level of foreign exchange reserves remains adequate according to
standard measures, although the 2015 FX intervention has led to a decline in the level of gross
reserves from US$195.7 billion at end-2014 to US$182 billion in September 2015 (Figure 9 and
Table 6).

average rate by 1.1 percent).5 Bank balance sheets remain strong, with capital levels well in excess of
requirements and low non-performing loans. Overall, the banking system has the capacity to
continue supporting steady credit expansion going forward.
9.
Implementation of the key structural reforms is broadly on track. Last year, Mexico
completed the legislative process underpinning important reforms in the areas of energy,
telecommunications, anti-trust, labor market, education, and the financial sector. The focus has now
shifted to implementation. The telecommunications reform has led to a decline in service prices, and
the opening of the sector has already attracted foreign direct investment. The second auction of oil
fields under the energy reform was successful, as the contract terms were adjusted by the
government after a somewhat disappointing result from the first auction. Future rounds would
feature deep water oil fields, which have higher exploration and production costs, and the outcome
could be more sensitive to the outlook for oil prices.
5

For 2015, the projected increase in the ratio of bank credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP is
¾ percentage point, while the increase in total (bank and non-bank) credit to GDP is 0.9 percentage point, in line
with trend credit growth. Credit gaps in the chart are computed as percentage-point deviations from an HP-filtered
credit-to-GDP ratio (with a smoothing coefficient of 1600) over the sample period 1995–2015.

moderate drag on growth.7
Box 2. Trade and Financial Spillovers to Mexico
Mexico has close trade and financial ties to the global economy, and especially with the United
States. The U.S. is by far the largest recipient of Mexico’s manufacturing and agricultural exports,
and is also the main source of portfolio and foreign direct investment flows to Mexico, explaining
the close correlation of the business cycles of the two economies. Focusing on financial linkages,
international investors held about half of total government debt in mid-2015 (including
36 percent of local currency government bonds), as well as a large share of corporate bond debt.
A structural Bayesian VAR is estimated to quantify the contribution of external spillovers to
Mexico’s output growth. The external variables in the system are U.S. real GDP growth, the 10-year
U.S. Treasury bond rate, and the J.P. Morgan emerging market bond spread (see Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter 2 for more details).

6

Staff estimates suggest that a 10 percent depreciation of real effective exchange rate leads to 3 percent real growth
in non-oil exports over the next two years. A staff study finds that a 10 percent decline in electricity costs increases
manufacturing output by 3 percent (Selected Issues Paper 2014). Electricity prices for industrial users have declined
by 24 percent year-on year by July 2015, which should boost activity over the next two year by about 1.2 percentage
points of GDP (cumulative).
7

Staff analysis suggests that the fiscal consolidation would subtract around ½ to 1 percentage point from growth
next year. The estimated average fiscal multiplier over the business cycle is 0.6–0.7 (see Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 1). However, this impact would be largely offset by the positive effects of lower electricity prices and the real
depreciation on manufacturing activity.

Box 2. Trade and Financial Spillovers to Mexico (concluded)
External factors explained a significant fraction of the decline in output during the financial crisis
and the rebound after the crisis. However, the growth weakness in 2013–14 has been explained
mainly by domestic factors (possible explanatory factors include the contraction in the
construction sector in 2013, initial uncertainty relating to the tax reform and the simultaneous
adoption of a number of structural reforms more generally, and a steady decline in domestic oil
production). More recently, the negative contribution of external factors to growth has increased,
reflecting tighter global financial conditions.
The results confirm that both real and financial spillovers are important. One percentage point
increase in U.S. growth (1.8 standard deviations) raises Mexico’s growth by about 1 percentage
point. Meanwhile, 100 basis points increase in the EMBI spread (2.2 standard deviations) reduces
Mexico growth by 0.7 percentage points. In a separate analysis, the paper finds that a rise in U.S.
bond yields that is not accompanied by higher U.S. growth has a negative effect on Mexico’s
output.

Credit conditions are expected to tighten somewhat, but remain broadly supportive of
growth. Strong liquidity buffers would allow corporations to continue to invest even under
moderately tighter external financial conditions. In addition, bank balance sheets have space to
accommodate stronger credit demand. The annual growth rate of real bank credit over the medium
term is projected to be around 8 to 9 percent, reflecting continued financial deepening. Domestic
debt issuance is also holding up. Staff analysis finds that even in a downside risk scenario,
encompassing a further depreciation of the currency, an increase in funding costs, and a decline in
earnings, the large majority of corporations would remain solvent (Box 3). However, if such negative
shocks materialize, economic activity may be affected as firms are likely to invest less and banks may
reduce credit supply.

Box 3. Macrofinancial Linkages: Sectoral Balance Sheet Analysis
Corporations appear to be resilient to financial shocks due to low debt levels, natural and financial
hedges, and large liquidity buffers. However, large negative shocks could lead them to reduce
investment. Banks rely mostly on domestic deposit funding, and have sufficient capital buffers to
continue to expand lending at a steady rate in the baseline scenario, or to withstand negative
growth shocks in a tail risk scenario. The public sector is the most exposed to a change in global risk
sentiment, although a favorable debt composition—with long maturities and a large share of debt
denominated in domestic currency—should reduce vulnerabilities.
Households have very low debt. Mortgage and consumer loans amount to 10 and 5 percent of
GDP respectively, and are denominated in local currency. Households hold significant positive net
financial assets (in addition to non-financial assets). House prices have been broadly stable in real
terms since 2008, and there are no signs of a real estate bubble.

Corporate debt is also relatively low, although leverage has increased in recent years. Gross
corporate debt was around 32 percent of GDP in 2014, of which about 40 percent is in foreign
currency (a third of total corporate debt is owed by the public-owned PEMEX and CFE, so private
corporate debt is only about 20 percent of

Box 3. Macrofinancial Linkages: Sectoral Balance Sheet Analysis (continued)
Corporate Stress Tests: Financial and Growth Implications
Non-financial firms appear to be resilient to financial shocks. Stress tests on listed firms
(based on end-2014 balance sheet data), presented in the Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 3, show
that a combination of 30 percent exchange rate depreciation, 30 percent increase in interest
expense, and 20 percent decline in earnings would reduce debt servicing capacity, but the large
majority of firms would remain solvent. Abstracting from any hedging (financial or natural), the
median interest coverage ratio (ICR) would decline from 3.7 in 2014 to 1.9, while the median debtto-equity ratio would increase due to valuation effects. Assuming that firms with an ICR below
1.5 default on bank loans with 15 percent probability, banks’ NPLs would increase by
1.5 percentage points. Bank capital buffers are sufficiently strong to absorb such a shock. The
authorities’ own analysis of corporate sector resilience has produced similar results.
Overall, the assumed combination of shocks could lower real GDP growth by about
¼ percent. As leverage increases after the shock, some corporations are likely to reduce
investment. Based on cross-country estimates of the response of corporate investment to changes
in leverage, the above shocks could lower real GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points (the decline
in investment rates could be higher if the shocks are magnified by a sudden stop phenomenon in
which corporates are unable to roll over debt). Furthermore, a tightening of bank credit could
cause an additional decline in growth of about 0.2 percent (based on staff’s empirical estimates of
the response of bank credit to shocks to capital).
Commercial Banks’ Balance Sheets
The commercial banking system remains well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Commercial
banks’ capital adequacy ratios are close to 16 percent, well in excess of regulatory requirements
and among the highest in emerging economies. Mexico adopted the Basel III capital rules in 2013,
and the Basel Committee has assessed Mexico as compliant earlier this year. Formal liquidity
coverage ratio (LCR) minimum requirements have been in place since January this year (they are
being phased in gradually over 5 years and have been set initially at 60 percent).
The average LCR of the banking system stood at 170 percent at the end of 2014, though some
smaller banks have lower liquidity ratios and will have to increase reliance on longer-term
financing to meet the required LCR ratio in the medium term. Non-performing remain low at
3.3 percent of total loans, and are fully provisioned. Domestic deposits are the main source of
funding. Commercial banks’ external debt liabilities amount only to 1.5 percent of GDP
(3.3 percent of total liabilities), which reduces vulnerability to external liquidity shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MEXICO

Box 3. Macrofinancial Linkages: Sectoral Balance Sheet Analysis (concluded)
Banks are resilient to credit, liquidity, and market risks. A stress test conducted by the bank
supervisory authority (CNBV) finds that even under a significant increase in long-term rates,
valuation losses will be limited and banks will remain well capitalized. In addition, there are a
number of prudential regulations in place to limit foreign-exchange risks, including caps on net
foreign-currency open positions (at 15 percent of capital) and strict liquidity requirements to
ensure adequate resources in case of temporary liquidity shocks. Credit risks also appear to be
contained. The most recent stress tests, conducted by CNBV and the Bank of Mexico, show that
the banking system would remain in good financial health even in the unlikely scenario of a sharp
decline of economic growth and a significant increase in interest rates (Financial Stability Council,
Annual Financial Stability Report, March 2015 and Bank of Mexico Financial Stability Report,
October 2014).
Linkages Across Sectors
Inter-sectoral balance sheet linkages show that contagion risks are contained. The main
potential vulnerability is the significant net liability position of the public sector and of nonfinancial corporations vis-à-vis the rest of the world (22 percent of GDP each). A shock to the risk
preferences of non-resident investors, which leads them to reduce holdings of Mexican assets,
could be a key channel of transmission of global shocks to Mexico. However, this risk is mitigated
by several factors. First, the external liabilities of corporations are largely in the form of equity—
private non-financial corporates’ gross external debt is only 8.9 percent of GDP (Table 6). Second,
about 75 percent of public debt is denominated in pesos, so the foreign-currency liabilities of the
public sector are relatively small, limiting vulnerability to exchange-rate changes. Finally, the
central bank has boosted its reserves in recent years (to about 16 percent of GDP), and Mexico
has a US$70 billion credit line with the IMF, which should help guard against a tail event of large
capital outflows. The external and public debt sustainability analyses suggest that debt would
remain sustainable under plausible stress scenarios.

The structural reforms should raise potential growth in the medium term. Staff
estimates that the reforms would boost growth to about 3–3½ percent over the medium term
through higher investment, improved access to finance, and a rise in productivity.8 Some benefits of
the reforms are already visible: private investment in natural gas pipelines, electricity generation, and
telecommunications has picked up, and the financial reform has helped spur competition in the
banking sector. Progress in improving security and the rule of law will be important to allow Mexico
to realize the full potential of the structural reforms. The current account deficit is projected to
deteriorate in the first few years of implementation of the reforms as imports of machinery and
equipment pick up, but should narrow gradually in the longer term as oil production and exports
increase.
13.

The outlook is subject to substantial risks:



Weaker-than-expected trade partner growth. Slower-than-expected recovery in U.S. growth, and
particularly in U.S. manufacturing production, is the main external risk to Mexico’s outlook. It
could be triggered by a weaker-than-expected impact of lower oil prices on U.S. aggregate
demand, the dampening effect of slow global growth and the strong dollar, or a disorderly
market reaction to liftoff.



A surge in global financial market volatility. This

to 2014. A protracted period of high volatility
could affect funding costs and access to finance. If this risk materializes, firms are likely to reduce
the pace of investment and production. As discussed in the 2014 FCL report, a tail risk scenario
of sharp capital outflows would also heighten rollover risks in the large government bond
market. The Flexible Credit Line is intended as insurance against tail risks.



A lower-than-projected path for oil prices or domestic oil production. A further drop in global oil
prices, or a failure of PEMEX to stabilize oil production—the main domestic risk—could increase
further the fiscal consolidation burden and affect private investment in the oil sector. More

Potential growth has been around 2½ percent historically. Staff estimates of medium-term potential growth have

generally, slower-than-expected implementation of the structural reforms could lead to lower
medium-term growth.
14.
The authorities share staff’s view on the near-term outlook and the main risks. They
project that growth in 2016 would be in the range of 2½ to 3.6 percent, and view continued
volatility in financial markets and shocks to U.S. growth as the main risks. The authorities remain
more optimistic about the medium-term boost to activity related to the reforms, and believe that
growth could reach 4–5 percent by 2018–20.
15.
Staff and the authorities agreed that Mexico’s positive growth outlook and credible
policy frameworks increase its resilience and ability to deal with financial market stress.
Mexico’s medium-term growth prospects remain more favorable than those of other emerging
markets. Monetary policy remains guided by a credible inflation-targeting regime while fiscal policy
remains committed to ensuring sustainable debt levels. In addition, Mexico’s deep and liquid
financial markets allow foreign investors to hedge exchange rate risk. Altogether, Mexico should
remain an attractive destination for foreign direct investment and long-term portfolio flows in the
future. These factors have contributed to broadly stable long-term yields on domestic-currency
government bonds despite the recent increase in global financial market volatility.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
16.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a gradual fiscal consolidation, which is
critical to maintain confidence in the strength of public finances. The 2016 budget maintained
the commitment expressed in last year’s budget document to reduce the PSBR by about
½ percentage point per year from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2½ percent of GDP in 2018,
despite a significant decline in oil prices and a downside revision of the oil production path. This
deficit path will initially stabilize the ratio of public debt to GDP at around 52 percent of GDP, and
then set it on a downward path in the medium term (Table 2 and Figure 8). Delivering on these fiscal
commitments would be important to restore fiscal buffers, and continue to maintain investor
confidence and keep financing costs low.
17.
The fiscal consolidation effort relies both on expenditure and revenue measures. A rise
in non-oil tax revenues due to the 2013 tax reform and higher fuel excises have largely offset the
4 percentage points of GDP decline in oil revenues over the last two years.9 Starting in 2016, the
consolidation relies mostly on expenditure rationalization. The 2016 budget envisages a decline of
public spending of 1 percentage point of GDP next year, with further reductions of about
9

The path of oil production has been revised significantly down over the medium term (relative to the 2015 budget),
reflecting a persistently lower production path for Pemex and a slower pace of private investment in exploration and
production. As a result, oil revenues would remain permanently lower, rising modestly in the coming years with the
projected recovery in oil prices.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

¾ percentage point in the medium term, equally split between current and capital spending. By
2018, the ratio of expenditure to GDP is projected to return to its 2007–08 level. The 2016 budget
also includes temporary tax incentives for investment, which should help support domestic demand
next year.
18.
The decline in public investment is expected to be compensated by increased reliance
on public-private partnerships. The state-owned oil company (Pemex) is bearing the brunt of the
fall in public capital spending, and it is expected to rely increasingly on production and exploration
partnerships with private companies. Public enterprises, including Pemex, will also be able to
securitize assets and use equity financing for some of its operations, which is welcome, as long as
the operations are recorded transparently in the public accounts. More generally, public-private
partnerships (PPPs) would play a bigger role going forward, including in infrastructure development.
Staff noted that, based on international experience, successful PPPs require thorough evaluation and
good governance structures to minimize fiscal risks and contingent fiscal liabilities.
19.
Staff strongly endorsed the authorities’ proposal to allow gasoline and diesel prices to
move more closely in line with international prices, and to fix the excise taxes per liter of fuel.
The current variable excise tax is the difference between the regulated domestic price of gasoline
and an international benchmark price.10 The proposal to fix fuel excises per unit of fuel is in line with
staff’s recommendation to increase carbon taxes in Mexico to levels commensurate with the
negative health and environmental externalities associated with fossil fuel use. The proposed tax
levels for gasoline and diesel are close to the optimal levels based on staff’s analysis (Box 4). In
addition to helping reduce Mexico’s carbon emissions, this measure will help stabilize tax revenues
in the medium term relative to the current scheme of variable excises.

As of 2014, Mexico had the lowest carbon
taxes on fossil fuels among OECD
countries. Mexico has a system of
administered fuel prices, with an implicit
subsidy (or tax) arising when the domestic
price differs from international prices.
Between 2006 and 2014, the system resulted
in a positive subsidy to domestic consumers.
The government has gradually reduced the
subsidy in recent years by raising prices at a
double-digit rate through the end of 2014.

Under the current regime, the difference could be positive or negative, resulting in a tax or a subsidy, depending
on relative price movements.

20.
Staff pointed out that the current low fuel prices provide a window of opportunity to
eliminate inefficient electricity subsidies, while protecting vulnerable households. Electricity
subsidies are projected to decline from ½ percent of GDP in 2014 to about ¼ percent of GDP in
2015, reflecting the decline in oil and natural gas prices. Staff encourages the authorities to
eliminate these non-targeted subsidies permanently, while compensating low income households
through existing well-targeted cash transfer programs. The authorities agreed that a gradual
replacement of these subsidies with more targeted support could be desirable in the medium term.
They noted that the overall energy subsidies have already declined substantially with the phasing
out of gasoline and diesel subsidies in recent years, and emphasized that the policy focus now is the
approval and implementation of the fuel excises, which would eliminate fuel subsidies permanently.

21.
Staff proposed several enhancements to the fiscal framework to enhance its role as a
commitment device for fiscal discipline. The 2014 amendments to the fiscal responsibility law
(FRL) improved the fiscal framework in several dimensions, but it commits to a specific PSBR target
only one year ahead and has no long-term nominal anchor. In addition, the exceptional
circumstances clause can be invoked even under mild negative shocks (see Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 5).


First, the fiscal responsibility law could be modified to include an explicit ceiling for the PSBR,
corresponding to a desirable path for the public debt. For example, the law could specify a fixed
ceiling of 2.5 percent of GDP for 2019 and beyond.11 In addition, the use of the exceptional
circumstances clause should be explicitly limited to cases of large output or oil price shocks to
help constrain discretion. When these clauses are invoked, the fiscal framework should define
explicit rules to bring the PSBR below the ceiling. The authorities argued that public finances are
going through a structural change due to the energy reform. In their view, it would be
appropriate to wait until the transition is over, and there is greater certainty about the mediumterm growth potential, before tightening the parameters of the fiscal responsibility law.



Staff also pointed out that international experience suggests that the creation of a non-partisan
expert fiscal council can inform the public debate of fiscal issues, and improve accountability and
fiscal discipline, by providing an objective evaluation of fiscal policy. The authorities noted that
the Congressional Center for the Study of Public Finances (CEFP) already executes some of the
typical functions of a fiscal council. They agreed that it would be desirable to strengthen the role
of the CEFP in assessing fiscal policy by ensuring that it has non-partisan professional staff and a
formal mandate to assess the sustainability of fiscal policy.

22.
The proposed fiscal responsibility framework for local and municipal governments is
in line with best international practices. A recent constitutional reform and secondary
legislation—currently in Congress—have introduced a set of rules to ensure fiscal sustainability at
the local government level (see Box 5). However, implementation challenges will be significant
particularly in terms of capacity building at the local government level. On a separate issue, staff
noted that the proposed education infrastructure bonds, backed by future transfers from the federal
to the local governments, are a fiscal liability of the states and therefore should be recorded as
public debt according to international accounting standards.

11

This recommendation is in the spirit of the original fiscal responsibility law, which set a zero deficit as the target;
however, the definition of the “traditional” budget balance has changed over time, eroding its role as a nominal
anchor. If the PSBR target is fixed at 2.5 percent after 2017, gross debt would fall to 50 percent in 2020, and would
continue to decline very gradually thereafter (assuming a constant output growth rate). A stochastic simulation
presented in the selected issues paper (which accounts for possible shocks to output growth) shows that setting the
deficit ceiling permanently to 2.5 percent of GDP would help keep debt below 50 percent of GDP with 82 percent
probability in the long term. A more ambitious ceiling of 2 percent would bring debt down faster in the baseline, and
would reduce further the risk of high debt levels even in a persistent low-growth scenario.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

Box 5. Proposed Fiscal Responsibility Framework for State and Local Governments
Constraints on debt issuance: Subnational governments can incur new debt only to finance
investment, rollover existing debt, or finance the reconstruction costs of natural disasters, subject
to local congress’ approval by two-thirds majority. The Federal government will monitor
compliance with debt limits. Short-term debt is allowed only for liquidity management purposes
and cannot exceed 6 percent of total revenues. In addition, short-term debt has to be repaid three
months before the end of the local government’s term in office.
Early warning system: A publicly available early warning system will be applicable to all
subnational debt, classifying it in one of three categories: stable debt, debt under surveillance, or
high debt. The issuance of new debt is limited to 10 percent of non-earmarked revenues when
debt is stable; 5 percent of revenues when it is under surveillance; and no issuance is allowed when
it is classified as high. Subnational governments with high debt should sign an agreement with the
Federal Treasury specifying an adjustment program to return to sustainable public finances.
Federal guarantees: The Federal government can provide guarantees to subnational governments
provided that they sign an agreement with the Federal Treasury approved by local congress, and
earmark future federal transfers (under the revenue-sharing agreements) for debt repayment.
Federal guarantees cannot exceed 3.5 percent of GDP (at the aggregate level), and 100 percent of
disposable income (at the subnational level). Violation of the agreement leads to sanctions,
including non-eligibility for future guarantees.
Other fiscal discipline rules: All subnational government liabilities, including those related to
public-private partnerships, will have to be reported to a single public debt registry, which would
be published on the Federal Treasury’s website. The reported information should comply with the
Law of Public Sector Accounting. Budgets should follow a performance-based approach, with large
investment projects and public-private partnerships (PPPs) requiring a cost-benefit analysis. The
budget must include five-year projections and identify main fiscal risks and potential mitigation
measures. The law introduces a “sustainable budget balance” notion, based on specific debt limits
determined by the law. Deviations from the sustainable budget balance are permitted only under
specific adverse circumstances. In addition, the law requires subnational budgets to include a
reserve fund to cover contingencies arising from natural disasters, and future payments under
PPPs. The law also sets limits on the wage bill and arrears, and allows the use of excess revenues
only for infrastructure spending or savings. Unused earmarked revenues under federal transfers are
to be returned to the Federal Government.

inflation pressures in check. Staff noted that, in
this context, continued monetary accommodation would remain appropriate in the near term.
24.
If upside risks to inflation materialize, some tightening of the monetary stance would
be warranted. Upside risks include a more rapid closing of the output gap accompanied by
stronger wage increases, or increasing cost pressures as the effects of the commodity price decline
dissipate. Another key risk is that the exchange rate pass-through may intensify as importers seek to
restore profit margins, which could put upward pressure on wages and the prices of non-tradables,
and affect inflation expectations.12
25.
The Bank of Mexico remains committed to keeping inflation in line with the 3 percent
target. The authorities noted that they consider a number of factors in deciding on the appropriate
policy rate, including the evolution of slack in the economy, wage developments, the pass-through
from exchange rates to prices, and the relative monetary policy stance between Mexico and the
United States. They agreed that demand pressures are likely to remain subdued in the near term.
However, they noted that a rise in interest rates in the U.S. is likely to put further downward pressure
on the currency, which can lead to higher pass-through and affect inflation expectations. It might
also trigger greater capital outflows and exacerbate asset-price volatility, with negative
consequences for confidence and growth. On balance, given the strong historical correlation of the
business cycle of the two economies and financial stability considerations, they thought that moving

12

Literature estimates of pass-through effect from a 10 percent depreciation of the Mexican peso vis-a-vis the U.S.
dollar to headline inflation range from 0.2 to 0.4 after 12 months. These estimates imply that 30 percent persistent
depreciation of the peso could lead to an increase in headline inflation by 0.6 to 1.2 percentage points. The low
degree of pass-through seen so far could be partially due to the offsetting effect of cost deflation related to the
decline in commodity prices.

in step with the Fed would likely be the best strategy to preserve price and financial stability, unless
idiosyncratic domestic developments warrant a different policy stance.
26.
The flexible exchange rate should continue to play a key role in helping the economy
adjust to external shocks. The authorities’ policy framework gives a central role to exchange rate
flexibility, while allowing for temporary foreign exchange intervention to reduce excess volatility.
Deep financial markets have allowed investors to hedge foreign exchange risks, while leaving yields
on domestic currency debt instruments broadly unchanged. Going forward, the currency
depreciation would help boost manufacturing exports.13
27.
Staff encouraged the authorities to phase out the daily foreign exchange sales, and
focus the use of reserves on periods of disorderly market conditions. In the context of relatively
orderly market conditions, the daily interventions without minimum price could be phased out to
conserve policy space, while continuing to rely on other intervention modalities to reduce volatility
during periods of very low market liquidity. Further down the road, gradual reserve accumulation
should resume once pressures on asset prices subside to restore reserve buffers. The authorities
reiterated their intention to use foreign exchange interventions only on a temporary basis, and
agreed that the daily interventions scheme should be phased out once volatility subsides. They also
have additional instruments at their disposal to maintain smooth functioning of markets, such as
targeted liquidity provision and debt duration management strategies. The FCL arrangement, which
the authorities continue to treat as precautionary, remains an important complement to reserve
buffers, providing protection against tail risks.

C. Financial Sector Issues
28.
Progress in the implementation of the financial reform is welcome. The credit-to-GDP
ratio in Mexico has been rising steadily in recent years, though it remains low compared to other
emerging markets (see Box 6 and Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 7). The financial reform aims to
address some of the structural impediments to credit supply, and several measures have been
implemented so far. All credit providers are now required to report to the credit bureaus, the
process of transferring accounts between banks and refinancing mortgage loans has been made
easier, and consumer protection has been enhanced through requirements for better disclosure of
information on financial products. Staff urged the authorities to complete the implementation of a
remaining important aspect of the reform, namely that more federal courts hear mercantile matters,
which should improve the speed and efficiency of the judicial process in contract enforcement,
including the repossession of collateral.

13

Staff analysis suggests that recent intervention announcements have had a modest effect on the level and volatility
of the exchange rate. The peso appreciated by 1 to 3 percent on impact, though widening standard errors over time
make it difficult to establish whether the effect is temporary or permanent (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 6).

much lower than before the Tequila crisis. Only a fraction of small and medium-sized firms have

A history of banking crises, a large informal sector, and an inefficient legal system are the
main reasons for the low level of bank intermediation. The Mexican banking sector has had a
tumultuous history, with two major banking crises since 1980, which ended up with a significant
restructuring of the banking system. This history is likely to have had lasting effects on trust in
financial institutions, through the early 2000s, both for savers who lost deposits in the crisis of the
1980s and for borrowers, who faced difficulties due to rising interest rates in the 1990s. Difficulties
in collecting collateral have also limited the rate of expansion of bank lending. Another
explanation for the low degree of financial intermediation is the large size of the informal sector.
Finally, the level of financial education is quite low.
The 2014 financial reform aimed to address some of the impediments to credit expansion.
Its main components are: (i) shifting more mercantile matters to federal courts to ease the process
of collateral collection in case of default; (ii) improved information sharing among all credit
providers through the credit bureaus; (iii) strengthening financial education and transparency (by
establishing an entity to collect and share comparable information on bank products; and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

MEXICO

Box 6. Financial Deepening in Mexico (concluded)
(iv) supporting competition through provisions to facilitate the portability of bank accounts and
mortgages across banks. Most elements of the reform have been implemented on time, but the
important shifting of more mercantile matters to federal courts remains outstanding.
The key challenge going forward is to achieve gradual financial deepening without
jeopardizing financial stability. This will require maintaining high credit standards, and strong
regulatory oversight. The pace of credit growth in recent years has been appropriate, resulting in a
gradual increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio. Bank credit is projected to continue to grow at a
nominal rate of about 11–12 percent in the medium term, implying a rise in the credit-to-GDP
ratio of about 1 percentage points per year. Such rate of credit growth would provide a mild
boost to potential output growth (of about 0.05 percentage points per year).
29.
Development bank credit has expanded rapidly in recent years. The reform also
expanded the role of development banks in credit provision, with the goal of stimulating lending to
underserved sectors. While development banks account for only 10 percent of total loans to the
non-financial private sector, their credit to the nonfinancial private sector has increased 31 percent
year-on-year as of June. Staff cautioned that such high rates of credit expansion may strain the
capacity of development banks to evaluate credit quality. The authorities responded that
development banks are subject to the same regulatory oversight as commercial banks, that rapid
growth poses little risk given the low base, and that credit growth rates will slow down going
forward. They viewed development banks as playing an important role in improving access to
finance through programs such as guarantees for credit to small and medium enterprises, small
loans to women, and others.
30.
The non-bank financial sector remains sound. Pension funds, which are the most
important player in local financial markets with assets of about 16 percent of GDP, maintain a
conservative investment profile. The insurance sector is relatively small (6½ percent of GDP) and is
well capitalized and profitable. A Solvency II-type regime was adopted in April this year, and
insurance companies meet minimum capital requirements comfortably under the new regime. Topdown stress tests conducted by the authorities showed that market risks associated with potential
interest rate increases remain limited for both pension funds and insurance companies.

SAFEGUARDS ASSESSMENT
31.
Staff has completed the safeguards procedures for Mexico’s 2014 FCL arrangement.
The authorities provided the necessary authorization for Fund staff to communicate directly with the
Bank of Mexico’s external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) México. PwC issued an unqualified
audit opinion on the Bank of Mexico’s 2013 financial statements on April 25, 2014. Staff reviewed
the 2013 audit results and discussed these with PwC. No significant safeguards issues emerged from
the conduct of these procedures.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Mexico’s policies and policy frameworks remain very strong. The flexible exchange rate
has played a key role in helping the economy adjust to external shocks. The authorities are
committed to preserving sustainable public finances, maintaining price stability, and ensuring the
orderly functioning of financial markets. The external position is in line with economic fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.
33.
Economic activity continues to grow at a moderate rate. Real GDP is projected to grow
at 2¼ percent in 2015, strengthening to 2½ percent in 2016. The recovery of U.S. demand and the
depreciation of the peso should provide a boost to exports, with positive spillovers to domestic
demand. Over the medium term, the implementation of the structural reform agenda should boost
potential growth to 3–3½ percent. Strong implementation and further progress in improving
security and the rule of law is critical to realize the reforms’ full potential.
34.
As a highly open economy, Mexico is vulnerable to external shocks. The key external
risks are a slowdown in U.S. or global growth, and a surge in financial market volatility related to
uncertainty about the liftoff of U.S. interest rates or adverse developments in key emerging market
countries. Mexico’s strong fundamentals and positive growth outlook should help it weather well
renewed bouts of volatility. Temporary foreign exchange rate intervention and targeted liquidity
support remain useful tools to prevent disorderly market conditions. The Flexible Credit Line
provides additional insurance against tail risks.
35.
The authorities’ commitment to a gradual fiscal consolidation is welcome. Delivering
on the plan to reduce the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2018 is critical to set the ratio of public
debt to GDP on a downward trajectory and to maintain investor confidence. Staff strongly endorses
the proposed reform to fix fuel excises at levels commensurate with the negative externalities of
fossil fuel use. This reform will help Mexico achieve its commitment to reduce carbon emissions, and
will set an example for other countries. It would be also desirable to eliminate poorly targeted
electricity subsidies, while protecting vulnerable households through targeted transfers.
36.
Further enhancements to the fiscal framework could help strengthen fiscal discipline.
The 2014 Fiscal Responsibility Law has improved the fiscal framework in important ways, but some
shortcomings remain. To address these, it would be desirable to add to the FRL an explicit ceiling for
the PSBR, corresponding to a desirable path for public debt, combined with tighter exceptional
circumstance clauses and explicit rules for returning the PSBR below the ceiling following any
deviation. In addition, establishing a strong professional non-partisan fiscal council with a formal
mandate to assess the sustainability of public finances can improve accountability and help inform
the public debate.
37.
The proposed fiscal responsibility framework for state and local governments is in line
with best international practices. The framework introduces detailed rules and procedures to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

MEXICO

ensure fiscal sustainability at the state and local government level. Nonetheless, implementation
challenges will be significant particularly in terms of capacity building at the local government level.
38.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative in the near term. The current
accommodative stance is appropriate as the economy is expected to continue to operate below
potential, and wage and price pressures are contained. However, if the pass-through to inflation
intensifies, leading to second round effects, some tightening of the monetary stance would be
warranted.
39.
The flexible exchange rate should continue to be the main absorber of external
shocks. The two foreign exchange intervention schemes have helped enhance market liquidity and
reduce the risk of excess volatility. Looking ahead, the authorities should gradually phase out the
daily interventions scheme with no minimum price, and give priority to the use of reserves during
periods of market dysfunction. Gradual reserve accumulation should resume once generalized
pressures on emerging market asset prices subside.
40.
Private sector balance sheets have been resilient to financial volatility. Banks have
strong capital and liquidity buffers, and are resilient to market and credit risks. Pension and
insurance companies maintain a conservative investment profile. The balance sheets of non-financial
firms also appear to be reasonably healthy, despite some increase in leverage. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to monitor closely corporate leverage, and to require publicly-listed firms to
disclose more detailed balance sheet information, including on their derivative positions.
41.
Progress in the implementation of the financial reform is welcome. The reform has
helped increase competition among banks, strengthen consumer protection, and improve credit
data collection. Staff encourages the authorities to move ahead with the shift of more mercantile
matters to federal courts to ease legal hurdles related to collateral repossession. The more active
role of development banks in strengthening financial inclusion is welcome, though caution is
needed to avoid a relaxation of credit standards.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The assessing reserve adequacy (ARA) metric for emerging markets comprises four components reflecting potential
balance of payment drains: (i) export income, (ii) broad money, (iii) short -term debt, and (iv) other liabilities. The weight fo r
each component is based on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging markets during exchange market
pressure episodes, distinguishing between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

2/ From 2015 onwards, in line with the 2015 Income Law, gasoline and diesel excises are classified as non-oil tax revenue.
3/ For 2015, it includes estimated inflows from the oil-price hedge for 107 billion pesos.
4/ Includes pensions and social assistance benefits.

expenditure, excluding: (i) interest payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) cost of fuels for electricity generation; (iv) direct physical and financial
investment of the federal government; and expenditure by state productive enterprises and their subsidiaries.
7/ The cap on structural current spending real growth was set at 2.0 percent for 2015 and 2016.

3/ For 2015, it includes estimated inflows from the oil-price hedge for 107 billion pesos, which are treated as revenues arising from an insurance claim.
4/ Interest payments differ from official data due to adjustments to account for changes in valuation and interest rates.
5/ Includes revenue sharing between federal government and state and local governments.
6/ Includes pensions and social assistance benefits.
7/ Includes Adefas and other expenses, as well as the adjustments to the "traditional" balance not classified elsewhere.

9/ Adjusting revenue for the economic and oil-price cycles.
10/ Corresponds to the gross stock of PSBR. It is calculated as the net stock of PSBR as published by the authorities, plus adjustments (to reflect additional
public sector's liabilities not included in the headline official figures) plus public sector financial assets.
11/ Corresponds to the net stock of PSBR (i.e., gross stock net of public sector financial assets) as published by the authorities.
12/ The 2014 amendment to the FRL introduced a cap on the real growth rate of structural current spending. The latter is defined as total budgetary expenditure,
excluding: (i) interest payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) cost of fuels for electricity generation; (iv) direct physical and financial investment of the federal
government; and expenditure by state productive enterprises and their subsidiaries.

Annex II. Mexico External Sector Assessment Report
Mexico

Current
account

Background. In 2015, the current account deficit is projected to increase from 1.9 to 2.3 percent of GDP due to a
weakening hydrocarbon trade balance. The cyclically-adjusted current account deficit is estimated to be 1.7 percent of
GDP. Over the medium term, private investment related to the structural reforms is expected to rise, matched by greater
public sector savings and a gradual increase in private savings as a result of higher oil production.
Assessment. Mexico’s CA appears to be broadly in line with the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The EBA model estimates a cyclically-adjusted current account norm of -2.3 percent in 2015,
implying a positive CA gap of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015 (reflecting in part the upward influence on the CA norm of
fiscal policies of other countries). The staff assessment is similar, with a gap between 0 and 1 percent of GDP.

Real exchange
rate

Background. As of September 2015, the REER has depreciated by 15 percent relative to the average 2014 value. The
depreciation can be explained in part by temporary overshooting, reflecting the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar visà-vis most currencies and the high volatility in emerging market asset prices, and, to a lesser extent, by weaker growth
prospects related to lower-than-previously expected investment and production in the domestic oil sector. The floating
exchange rate has been a key shock absorber in an unsettled global environment.1/
Assessment. The EBA level REER regression estimates a moderate undervaluation of 8 percent in 2015, consistent with
the EBA estimate of a small positive current account gap. The index approach yields higher undervaluation (18 percent).
Staff puts less weight on the index approach as it has shown the peso to be persistently undervalued for the last 8 years.
Considering all the estimates, and the uncertainties around them, staff assesses Mexico’s real effective exchange rate to
be moderately weaker than the level that would be consistent with fundamentals (with a gap ranging from -3 to -12
percent).
Background. During 2010-14, a large share of capital inflows has gone into purchases of locally-issued government
paper and other portfolio investments. Going forward, the structural reforms are expected to lead to higher FDI, while
portfolio inflows into government paper are likely to slow down.
Assessment. While the rising local currency share and long duration of sovereign debt reduce the exposure of
government finances to depreciation risks, the strong presence of foreign investors leaves Mexico exposed to a reversal
of capital flows and an increase in risk premiums. The authorities have refrained from capital flow management
measures, in line with their view that an open capital account reduces policy uncertainty and supports long-term growth.
Capital flow risks should also be mitigated by the prudent macroeconomic policies.

Capital and

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
In 2015, Mexico’s external sector position is
broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
The REER has depreciated sharply during the
first nine months of 2015 and is assessed to
be moderately undervalued. The
undervaluation is likely to be temporary. The
positive effects of the weaker exchange rate
on the current account may materialize with
a lag, and would be at least partially offset
by lower net oil exports.
The FCL provides an added buffer against
global tail risks.
Potential policy responses:
As the external sector position is broadly
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals, there is no reason to alter
the planned policy settings. The authorities
have committed to reducing the public
sector borrowing requirement from
4.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent
of GDP in 2018. The consolidation relies on
a gradual increase in tax revenues related
to the 2013 tax reform, rising fuel excises,
and expenditure rationalization. At the
same time private investment is expected
to rise, counteracting the impact of rising
public saving on the current account. The
central bank set monetary policy to ensure
that the inflation remains close to the

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Background. Mexico’s NIIP was -33 percent of GDP in 2014 (gross foreign assets and liabilities are 42 percent and
76 percent of GDP, respectively). Portfolio liabilities were 37 percent of GDP, of which around one third are holdings of
local-currency government bonds. The ratio of NIIP to GDP is projected to remain steady over the medium term.
Assessment. While the NIIP is sustainable, the large gross foreign portfolio liabilities holdings could be a source of
vulnerability to global financial volatility.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. The central bank remains committed to a floating exchange rate, using intervention occasionally to prevent
disorderly market conditions.2/ The central bank usually builds up reserves through purchases of the net foreign currency
proceeds of the state oil company. In 2015, FX reserves are expected to decline due to the dollar auctions.3/

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Following the tapering announcement by then Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in May 21, 2013, Mexico’s currency
experienced one of the sharpest depreciations across emerging markets, falling by nearly 8.4 percent by end-June 2013, but
followed by a rapid recovery.

Assessment. The current level of foreign reserves is adequate for normal times according to a range of reserve coverage
indicators. The Fund FCL arrangement has been an effective complement to international reserves against global tail risks.

2/ Since December 8, 2014, the Bank of Mexico has operated a rule-based intervention mechanism, in which up to
USD 200 million are auctioned whenever the peso loses more than 1.5 percent (lowered to 1 percent since July 30) of its
value compared to the previous session’s official exchange rate. A similar program had been in place before April 2013.
3/ Since March 11, 2015, the Bank of Mexico has auctioned USD 52 million daily (raised to USD 200 million since July 30).
This program is set to expire at end-November.

3 percent target. The authorities have a
flexible exchange rate policy, and use foreign
exchange intervention occasionally to
prevent disorderly market conditions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group. The Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) FY14–19—which was jointly prepared with the Government of Mexico—focuses on
the World Bank Group’s twin goals (ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity) and
is fully aligned with the Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013–18. It describes the
Bank’s engagement with Mexico as a partnership to achieve development results through selective
and tailored packages of financial, knowledge, and convening services. IBRD lending has remained
an important part of this engagement throughout the years.
As a member of the OECD and the G20, Mexico has maintained economic stability through times of
recent crisis, and increased economic and social well-being over the last two decades. Mexico's
exposure to the IBRD increased with the onset of the global financial crisis as lending surged to
US$10.6 billion in FY10–12. As of August 2015, the World Bank’s exposure was US$14.6 billion which
has positioned Mexico as the second largest borrower in the world in terms of IBRD debt
outstanding. The increase of the Single Borrower Limit up to US$19.0 billion provides the Bank with
further financial space to support Mexico's efforts in achieving its development agenda.
The active portfolio consists of 13 IBRD projects and 7 GEF operations for a net commitment of
US$2.4 billion and an undisbursed balance of US$1.5 billion. In FY15, the World Bank approved
US$850 million in 3 loans to support Mexico in the areas of social protection and the education
sector. For FY16 the pipeline includes 3 operations supporting projects in energy efficiency, access
to finance and solid waste.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
The Bank and Fund teams have discussed the following priorities:


A well-funded and effective government. Increasing transparency, operational efficiency and
progressivity of public expenditures, improving public sector performance through better
budget and financial management as well as a systemic coverage and mitigation strategy of
fiscal risks are some other areas that require additional attention.



Comprehensive reforms to boost productivity and potential output growth. To increase
productivity and assure that such gains are widespread, focus should be placed on policies and
programs that foster sound financial sector development generate a competitive business
environment, foster innovation and upgrade infrastructure.



Social protection. Mexico’s social security, social assistance and labor market programs face
important equity and efficiency challenges due to fragmentation, weak design and coverage
gaps. Reforms are needed to build a more inclusive, effective and integrated social protection
system that provides protections from income shocks and helps smooth consumption over the
life cycle with due attention for their impact on the labor market.



Climate change and environmental protection. Increasing risks posed by climate change and the
cost of environmental degradation highlight the importance of efforts to reduce Mexico’s
environmental and carbon footprint of growth, including in areas such as energy efficiency and
renewable energy, water management, urban planning, solid waste and natural resource use.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed SDDS
requirements. A data ROSC update was completed on June 24, 2015 and was published as IMF
Country Report No. 15/176. There are various areas where improvements could be made, as detailed
below. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of National
Accounts, 2008 (2008 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and most statistical
outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are available, with economic
censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and annual surveys. For most surveys,
scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most samples exclude a random sample of
small enterprises. Some statistical techniques need enhancement. For example, taxes and subsidies
on products at constant prices are estimated by applying the GDP growth rate, a deviation from best
practice.
During 2014 STA conducted a reassessment of the data module of the ROSC that covered national
accounts. As compared with the 2010 ROSC, the reassessment was based on the newest (May 2012)
vintage of the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) and against those specified in the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The data ROSC reassessment found that national
accounts statistics are generally of a high quality, adequate to conduct effective surveillance and
adequately meet users’ needs. Since 2010, Mexico has made significant improvements on the
methodological and dissemination aspects of data quality. Nevertheless, areas for further
improvement and refinement exist, in particular, on the resources devoted to collecting state and
local government source data and seasonally-adjusted data, explaining data revisions, and on
compiling data on changes in inventories and on the volume of taxes on products.
INEGI has published annual sectoral accounts and balance sheets following the System of National
Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) classifications of assets and sectors for the period 2003–2012 in
November 2013. These accounts were revised recently and published on June 30, 2014. STA

conducted a mission during 2014 to assess the possibility for developing quarterly sectoral accounts
and balance sheets and agreed with the Mexican authorities on a work plan for developing these
accounts. INEGI and Banxico agreed to collaborate in the compilation of quarterly stocks and flows
of financial assets and liabilities by institutional sectors.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI is only
compiled by product and not by economic activity. A ROSC mission on prices was conducted in
November 2012.
Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the Fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed.1 Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken
down by maturity, and type of instrument). In 2014, STA conducted a technical assistance on
external sector statistics. The main purpose of the mission was to assist the balance of payment
statistics compilers in further strengthening their data collection and compilation system for external
sector statistics. In particular, the mission focused on foreign direct investment, financial derivatives,
bank accounts used in foreign exchange operations, capital account, and financial intermediation
services indirectly measured. The mission also assisted in addressing specific issues related to the
adoption of the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and classifications
that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive and timely, except for
states and municipalities. The new government accounting law mandates accounting standards that
follow international standards for all levels of government, and that take into account the
information needs of international organizations and national accounts. A full adoption of uniform
accounting standards at the sub-national level will be crucial to obtain a precise measure of public
fixed investment in national accounts, among others.
The authorities are committed to reporting government financial statistics in GFSM 2001 format, as
well as data for the GFS Yearbook.
The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the recording
of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions are overstating the
aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and survey. Availability of data on
other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds allow for the

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Public debt is expected to remain sustainable given projected increases in interest rate costs and a moderate
recovery of the economy in the medium term. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
decline to about 50 percent by 2020 from the current level of 52 percent. Gross financing needs are about
11 percent of GDP in 2015, declining to 9 percent at the end of the forecasting period. The DSA suggests that
public debt is sustainable under various shocks. A negative and sustained growth shock represents the major
risk to the debt outlook. Even under such scenario gross debt remains slightly below 60 percent of GDP,
without showing signals of an explosive trajectory. The impact of other shocks is smaller given that Mexico’s
debt structure results in a relatively low direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget. The
public debt profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks. The main risks arise from the large share of
debt held by non-residents—about 52 percent of total debt.

A. Comparison Previous Assessment
The baseline debt projection has increased slightly relative to last year’s DSA (2014 Mexico staff
report). Gross public debt is 3 percentage points higher in 2015 relative to previous projections (from
48.9 to 51.9 percent to GDP) and 1.6 percentage points higher by the end of the projection period. Main
factors explaining the different debt path are:


Higher primary deficit in the initial period, and stronger consolidation thereafter. The
primary deficit for 2014 was 0.4 percentage points higher than originally expected. This is
partially compensated by stronger consolidation efforts starting in 2015 (i.e., a primary deficit of
1.3 compared to 1.4 in the previous DSA).



Worse growth prospects for the whole projection period. The real GDP growth path is lower
compared to last year’s projection over the whole projection period.



Higher peso depreciation in the initial period. While the previous DSA assumed a peso
depreciation of 2.6 percent in 2014 and 0.9 percent thereafter, the current projections include a
higher actual depreciation in 2014 (4.1 percent), and a significantly higher depreciation rate for
2015 (18.6 percent).



Worse financing conditions. The cost of financing increased relative to previous assessment.
Although Mexico’s sovereign yields remain low, they increased from 173 in 2014 to 293 in 2015.1

B. Baseline and Realism of Projections

Debt-levels. As a result of the planned fiscal consolidation, gross debt levels are projected to
decline from a peak of 52 percent of GDP in 2016 to about 50 of GDP by 2020. Staff projects that

gross financing needs will be 10.8 percent of GDP in 201 (similar to the previous year), and will
decrease to 8.7 percent of GDP by 2020.


Growth. Mexico’s debt dynamics are highly sensitive to surprises in GDP growth, as indicated by
the response to growth shocks under the DSA stress tests. The median forecast error for real GDP
growth is low and in line with other emerging countries. There is no evidence of a systematic
projection bias in the baseline assumption for growth that could undermine the DSA assessment.
Current output growth projections at 2.2 percent for 2015 are in line with official estimates.2



Sovereign yields. Despite the volatility observed in most emerging markets in recent months,
Mexico’s sovereign yields remain low, with the 10-year local currency bond yield at around
6 percent as of September 3, 2015. The spread with U.S. government bonds yields of the same
maturity has remained on average at 380 basis points for the last three months. Spreads on
foreign currency-denominated bonds have increased by about 80 basis points since last
December. The local-currency sovereign yield curve has shifted up, but only slightly. Given the
upward projections for the US Libor rates over the medium-term, the effective nominal interest
rate on Mexico’s sovereign debt is projected to rise from 6.1 percent in 2014 to 7.6 percent by
2020.



Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline projection, the structural primary balance (adjusted by the
cycle and oil prices) improves between 2015 and 2020. On the revenue side, the consolidation
effort is driven by higher non-oil revenues that follow from the effects of the 2013–14 tax and
energy reforms. Higher non-oil revenues more than compensate for the fall in oil revenues
related to lower international oil prices and lower domestic production of crude oil. On the
spending side, projections assume compliance with the structural spending rule, 3 as well as some
savings from the 2015 cuts and the zero-based budgeting exercise in 2016. Considering the
distribution of fiscal adjustment episodes provided in the DSA template, and pre-2009 Mexican
evidence, the projected 3-year adjustment of the structural primary balance of 1.5 percent of
GDP seems feasible.



Maturity and rollover risks. Given current debt structure (average maturity close to 8 years,
82 percent share of government securities at fixed interest rates, and only 24 percent of debt
denominated in foreign currency), the immediate effect of interest rate changes on the budget is
very low. The long maturity structure also reduces rollover risks. A 100 basis points shock to the
yield curve across maturities is estimated to raise the interest bill by just 0.1 percentage points of
GDP. Similarly, a shock to the real exchange rate would have a relatively small impact on the debt
stock, given the large share of debt denominated in local currency (about 76 percent).

2

SHCP projects growth for 2015 between 2.0 and 2.8 percent.

3

The 2014 amendments to the fiscal responsibility law introduced a cap on the growth structural current spending
(comprising about 50 percent of all primary spending) from 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

C. Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 0.8 percentage point of GDP in the primary balance
in 2016–17 increases public debt to 51.6 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. The
gross financing needs also increase moderately. Effective interest rates on public debt do not
deviate significantly from the baseline.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation (2.8 percentage
points) for 2 years starting in 2016. The decline in growth leads to a deterioration of nominal
primary balance compared to the baseline—as nominal revenues fall against unchanged
expenditure plans—reaching -1.4 percent of GDP by 2017. Accordingly, the debt-to-GDP ratio
increases to about 58.5 percent during the growth shock, and to 56.8 percent by the end of the
projection period. Gross financing needs climb up to 12.2 percent of GDP in 2018, and stabilize
at around 10 percent at the end of period.



Interest rate shock. Interest rates are assumed to increase by 200 bps starting in 2016. The
government’s interest bill increased gradually, reaching an implicit average interest rate of
almost 8.5 percent by 2020, almost 1 percent higher than in the baseline. Similarly, the debt-toGDP ratio and gross financing needs increase, reaching 51.7 and 9.3 percent of GDP respectively
by 2020.



Real exchange rate shock.4 A permanent real exchange rate depreciation of 15 percent
increases debt by 1.9 percentage point of GDP. Gross financing needs increase by 0.2 percentage
point in 2016 and by 0.4 percentage point in 2018.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate).
In this case, debt would stabilize at around 61 percent of GDP, without showing signals of an
explosive trajectory. Gross financing need peak at 13.3 percent in 2018 and stabilize at 11.6 at
the end of the period.

4

Given the observed very low pass-through of depreciation to inflation in Mexico so far, this shock uses the low passthrough elasticity of 3 percent rather than the default value of 25 percent.

5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s external-debt-to GDP ratio continues to be low and sustainable (expected at
38 percent projected for end-2015), and is expected to remain stable over the medium term.
Most shock scenarios would increase external debt by just a few percentage points. The largest
increase would occur under a depreciation scenario. Indeed, the depreciation of peso is the main
reason for the rise in the external debt to GDP share from 33 percent and end-2014. However, even
in the unlikely event of a further 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation, the debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase to just over 50 percent, which would still be manageable. The reason for this
contained increase is that almost half of Mexico’s public external debt is now denominated in pesos.
Debt dynamics also benefit from the low interest rates and long maturities of the existing debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period, excluding reserve accumulation.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.
