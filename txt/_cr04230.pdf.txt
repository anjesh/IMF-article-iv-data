The 2004 Article IV discussions took place in Washington, D.C. during May. The staff team
comprised C. Towe (Head), T. Bayoumi, M. Mühleisen, C. Schnure, R. Cardarelli, and P. Rabanal (all
WHD); H. Lankes and K. Alexandraki (PDR); R. Thorne (ICM); A. Bhatia, G. De Nicolo, and
P. Hayward (MFD); and K. Ueda (RES). N. Jacklin and M. Lundsager, and A. Baukol, U.S. Executive
Director, Alternate Executive Director, and Advisor, respectively, also attended the meetings.

•

The Acting Managing Director Ms. Krueger, Mr. Singh (WHD), and Mr. Rajan (RES) took part in
the concluding discussions with Treasury Secretary Snow and Federal Reserve Chairman
Greenspan. The mission met with officials from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the
Bureau of Economy Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Congressional Budget Office, the
Employee Benefits Security Administration, the National Association of State Budget Officers, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The team also met with
financial market participants and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in March, and officials of the
California state government and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in April.

•

The 2003 Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2003 and the Staff Report was published as
IMF Country Report No. 03/244. During the Board discussion, Executive Directors highlighted the
valuable support that the U.S. economy had provided for global growth, but stressed the need for
decisive action to be taken to re-establish a strong fiscal position to help strengthen national saving
and prepare for the pressures of population aging. They urged the authorities to establish a credible
fiscal framework with the clear objective of bringing the budget to balance, excluding Social Security,
over the next five to ten years to provide room to phase in reforms needed to place retirement and
health care systems on a sound financial footing. Directors commended the Federal Reserve for its
aggressive response to the economic slowdown and also welcomed the considerable progress made
toward strengthening the oversight of accounting and corporate governance. Directors also called
upon the United States to continue to play a leadership role in promoting an open multilateral trading
system, including by ensuring that efforts to promote bilateral and regional free-trade arrangements
are complementary to the multilateral approach.

The United States has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix I). Comprehensive
economic data are available for the United States on a timely basis. The United States subscribes to
the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Data

I. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
State of the economy
1.
The 2004 consultation discussions took place against increasing signs that the
recovery was becoming self-sustaining. Although the 2001 recession was relatively shallow,
it was followed initially by an unusually tepid recovery, as a series of negative shocks offset
unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. Nonetheless, labor productivity growth
remained remarkably robust and an increase in the momentum of the recovery over the last
year has been followed more recently by a long-awaited improvement in employment
growth. A pickup in price pressures also appears to have fully erased earlier deflation fears.
Policy stance
2.
As a result, the focus of both monetary and fiscal policies has shifted toward
consolidation. After commendably aggressive and effective action to address the deflation
risks that emerged last year, the monetary authorities have now clearly signaled that stimulus
will be withdrawn soon, albeit at a measured pace. While emphasizing a commitment to
make recent tax cuts permanent, the FY 2005 budget also aimed to halve the budget deficit
over the next five years, largely through significant spending restraint.
Discussions
3.
Against this background, the policy discussions focused on how to manage the
withdrawal of stimulus and ensure long-run fiscal sustainability, in particular:
•

Restoring a sustainable fiscal position. With entitlement programs significantly
underfunded and an external current account deficit of 5 percentage points of GDP,
early steps are needed to establish a credible plan to restore fiscal surpluses and
reform health and retirement programs.

•

Ensuring an orderly withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Having successfully
forestalled earlier deflation risks, the challenge is now to return interest rates to
neutral levels without disrupting financial markets or kindling inflation.

•

The global ramifications of the U.S. economy and policies. The U.S. recovery has
led the global upturn; looking ahead, key issues include the impact of monetary
policy tightening on exchange rates and global borrowing conditions, including in
emerging markets, and the spillover effects of U.S. fiscal policy on global investment.

With the broadening of the
economic recovery in recent months,
concerns have shifted from the
sustainability of the upturn to the
possible emergence of inflationary
pressures (see the figure on the next page,
Tables 1–2). Following an initially anemic
recovery from the 2001 recession,
economic activity began to gather steam
in 2003, with real GDP growth beginning
to exceed potential around mid-year. The
acceleration in growth since last year’s
consultation has been somewhat stronger
than anticipated and has provided
welcome support to the global recovery.
Risks that a lack of employment growth
and correspondingly weaker household
incomes could derail the recovery have
dissipated earlier this year as payroll
employment finally started to accelerate.

effect on household demand from the
equity price collapse in 2001. Domestic demand has also been supported by fiscal stimulus,
with the structural fiscal balance shifting by some 5 percentage points of GDP since 2001
due to tax cuts, temporary investment incentives, and a rapid increase in government outlays.
Lower interest rates helped trigger a depreciation of the dollar and stem the drag on activity
from weak growth abroad as well as from the effects of the dollar’s strong appreciation
during 1995–2001.

The recovery has been marked by strong growth in productivity and profits, but recovery of
investment and employment has lagged, although recently they have both started to turn up.

However, macroeconomic stimulus is starting to wane. Financial conditions have
tightened somewhat in recent months as stronger data and statements from Fed officials have
led to expectations that monetary stimulus will soon begin to be removed. The 10-year
benchmark bond yield, in particular, has risen by around a percentage point since late March,
and part of the dollar’s earlier depreciation has been reversed. On the fiscal front, the
stimulus from this year’s surge in personal tax refunds associated with the 2003 tax cuts is
starting to fade, and investment incentives generated by accelerated depreciation allowances
are slated to expire at end-December.
7.
Increasing asset prices have helped support aggregate demand. Equity markets have
risen nearly 50 percent from their lows just before the Iraq war, although prices have
stagnated somewhat in recent months on concerns that the removal of monetary stimulus
would hurt corporate earnings. House prices have continued to increase rapidly, further
boosting household balance sheets, and a temporary surge in refinancing activity in the first
months of 2004 reflected households’ efforts to reduce interest payments and lengthen debt
maturities ahead of an expected tightening of interest rates.
8.
Labor productivity growth remains
remarkably strong, and has accelerated
compared with the late 1990s (Box 1).
Productivity growth rose strongly in the
latter half of the 1990s and has accelerated
further through the current cycle, moving
U.S. growth ahead of major competitors
(Table 3). Although this recent strength
appears to reflect partly temporary factors,
there is increasing evidence that it also
reflects the reorganization of production in
response to the IT revolution and other
innovations in business practices,
suggesting a further upward shift may have
also taken place.1

Labor productivity growth has been robust recently,
even compared to the late 1990s.

Job creation was unusually slow compared with other cyclical episodes, but has
begun to revive in the last few months. Tepid employment earlier in the recovery appears to
have largely reflected cost cutting in the face of uncertain growth and geopolitical prospects
but, as confidence has firmed over the last few months, almost a million new jobs have been
created and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent. Although data are sketchy,
offshoring of jobs appears too small to have any significant impact on these overall trends.2

-9Box 1. Inflation and Productivity
After an extended period of disinflation, price increases are
starting to accelerate. Inflation rates have reversed much of
last year’s decline, with the core personal consumption
expenditure (PCE) deflator moving up to 1.6 percent (yoy)
in May 2004, from 0.8 percent (yoy) at end-2003 (Chart).

The pickup of inflation reflects in part the effects of the
global recovery and geopolitical events on commodity and
other upstream prices. Increasing global output has led to a

tensions in the Middle East and elsewhere, has led to a spike

5 percent, respectively, over the 12 months ended May 2004,
while the weaker dollar contributed to a 3 percent rise in
non-oil import prices. Although the pass-through to final prices has historically been small—past estimates suggest a
permanent 10 percent rise in raw materials costs is associated with a 0.1 percent or less increase in final consumer
prices—the magnitude of the upstream price increases has caused concern.

Inflationary pressures may be dampened by significant economic slack in factories and labor markets. While real GDP
has expanded at a brisk 5 percent over the past year, at 76 percent, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate remains
well below the long-term average of 82 percent. The unemployment rate remains above most estimates of the NAIRU,
which center at around 5 percent, and the low labor force participation rate may represent additional slack through
“hidden unemployment.” Staff estimates show that monthly job gains of 300,000 would be needed to bring the economy
to full employment in late 2005 or early 2006, after allowing for a rise in the participation rate and growth of the labor
force.
A key determinant of current and future price pressures
is the rate of growth of labor productivity. For a given rate
of growth of activity, higher underlying labor productivity
growth implies more economic slack and a slower return to
potential. Output per hour has risen at a 3¾ percent annual
pace since 2000, leading to speculation that in addition to
cyclical factors, the underlying trend has accelerated
further from the already elevated 2½ percent rate recorded
in the late 1990s. As a result of this rapid increase in
productivity, unit labor costs have declined (yoy) for a
record nine consecutive quarters, helping hold price
pressures in check (Chart).

Data suggest that the improved performance of the U.S.

in total factor productivity (TFP) rather than just the
gains in the information technology sector. Recent research has found an acceleration in TFP growth across a range of
industries outside of the IT sector as businesses use new technologies and other innovations to improve the efficiency of
production (see Chapter 1 of the accompanying Selected Issues paper).
Faster labor productivity growth may also temporarily reduce employment. Analysis by the staff and others finds that
increases in output per worker reduces employment, but that this effect lasts only about a year-and-a-half. This suggests
that the recent acceleration in labor product growth may help explain both the limited job creation over much of the
recent recovery and hence some of the muted inflationary pressures that have been observed, but is unlikely to have
significant consequences for job growth over a longer period.

contributed to the longer-term growth of the U.S. economy, while also enabling the flow of

See Chapter 2 of the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

The impact of higher oil prices on aggregate activity has fallen over time as conservation and the increasing
role of services in U.S. GDP has lowered the energy intensity of output in the United States (see M. Mühleisen
and C. Towe (eds.), 2004, U.S. Fiscal Policies and Priorities for Long-Run Sustainability, IMF Occasional
Paper 227). Staff estimates from a range of sources suggest that a sustained increase of $5 in the price of a
barrel of oil reduces U.S. economic activity by around ¼–½ percentage point over two years.

a 40-year low of around 1 percent in early-2004, year-on-year core inflation has recently
started to rise, reaching over 1½ percent in May.5 The recent increase reflects a deceleration
of deflation in goods prices as the global recovery has increased costs of materials and
intermediate inputs, most notably energy. The depreciation of the dollar has added to these
pressures, although the exchange rate pass-through of the weaker dollar appears to have been
limited as foreign firms have reduced profit margins or benefited from earlier hedging.6 At
the same time, rapid labor productivity growth continues to dampen unit labor costs, and
service price inflation remains moderate.

remained largely unchanged. The effect
of the weaker dollar on real net exports, which continued to subtract from real GDP growth
in 2003 and early 2004, has been modest, reflecting the usual lags between changes in real
exchange rates and trade volumes as well as the relatively slower revival of foreign demand.
III. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND RISKS
14.
Staff projections are for output growth to remain above potential through 2004
and 2005, closing the output gap by 2006. The baseline forecast—which is broadly similar
to the private consensus and the assumptions in the FY 2005 budget—is underpinned by
continued strength in business fixed investment and an improvement in external demand.
This is expected to help offset a slowdown in household demand, responding to the waning
effects of tax cuts and a gradual rebound in the household saving rate, as well as weaker
5

These patterns are true of both the CPI and the personal consumption deflator (the measure preferred by the
Federal Reserve Board), although the recent rise in core inflation has been more marked for the CPI.

6

There is some evidence that pass-through has been declining over time. See, for example, E. Choudhri,
H. Faruqee, and D. Hakura, 2002, “Explaining the Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Different Prices,” IMF
Working Paper WP/02/224.

contained as the Federal Reserve withdraws stimulus broadly in line with current market
expectations. The current account position is anticipated to improve only modestly, with the
deficit falling close to 4 percent of GDP in 2009, as the lagged effect of the recent real

Officials broadly shared the
staff’s macroeconomic outlook and
agreed that downside risks to the
recovery had diminished in recent
months. Businesses appeared to have
worked off the excess IT capital stock
built up in the late 1990s and had strong
cash-flow positions. The boost to business
spending from the cyclical upturn would
likely offset the effects of the expiration
of accelerated depreciation allowances
later this year. In addition, firms would
need to restock inventories from their
current record-low relative to sales.
16.
Officials were less concerned
than the staff about domestic risks to
household spending. They agreed that the
household saving rate appeared low, but
noted that net worth as a share of
disposable income had rebounded recently
and had surpassed levels reached in the

mid-1990s.7 While the ratio of debt to income had risen to a record level, it was largely to
finance real estate purchases, and interest burdens remained manageable as homeowners had
locked in low interest rates. Some retrenchment of consumer spending growth was expected
as the boost from past tax cuts and mortgage refinancing faded and rising energy costs
reduced discretionary incomes. Nevertheless, in the absence of a geopolitical shock, officials
regarded the risks of an abrupt slowing of spending as small, given the signs that
employment and labor compensation were firming.
17.
Officials also indicated that, in their view, risks from recent housing price
developments were limited. They agreed with staff that some regional markets appeared
overheated but observed that house prices in general were recovering from relatively sluggish
increases during the 1990s and were broadly in line with disposable income.8 In any event,
officials noted that nominal house prices had never fallen on a national basis, suggesting that
any cooling of the real estate market would likely involve a slowing of future appreciation.
18.
Federal Reserve officials noted that unemployment and capacity utilization
suggested continued economic slack, limiting the risk to inflation. Their models were
consistent with the consensus view of the NAIRU of around 5 percent, although there was a
large degree of uncertainty surrounding such estimates. For example, the sharp drop in
inflation last year and the unusual decrease in the participation rate recently suggested the
potential for a lower NAIRU. Capacity utilization in manufacturing—which they regarded as
a relatively good measure of aggregate economic conditions—also remained well below its
long-term average. Thus, the overall picture was broadly consistent with the staff’s estimate
of an output gap of 1½ percent of GDP.
19.
Staff and officials agreed that the rapid labor productivity growth of recent years
represented an upside risk to the outlook.9 Official and staff forecasts have generally treated
the recent acceleration conservatively, assuming that productivity growth would slow to
2 percent or so over the medium term. A faster trend would boost domestic incomes, as well
as ease policy challenges by moderating pressures on prices, raising government revenues,
and encouraging capital inflows needed to fund the external deficit.

fiscal years—adopted the goal of halving the deficit in nominal terms by FY 2009, implying
a reduction of almost 3 percent of GDP relative to the projected FY 2004 deficit. The vast
majority of this decline would occur over FY 2005–06, when consolidation is projected to
occur at over 1 percentage point of GDP per annum (compared to one-sixth of a percentage
point per annum during the subsequent three fiscal years). The near-term adjustment would
mainly result from the expiration of temporary investment incentives and the restoration of
personal tax refunds to more normal levels. Tight limits on spending—as well as an easing of
pressures on defense outlays—are assumed to provide room over the medium-term for
making the 2001 tax cuts permanent and to introduce new tax-preferred savings instruments.
Recent data also suggest that the FY 2004 deficit could be as much as ½ percent of GDP
lower than projected in the budget.
21.
Congressional approval of the
budget is still awaited. Agreement on a
budget resolution has been hampered by
differences about the cost of further tax
measures. Whereas the House already
approved bills that would make many of
the 2001 tax cuts permanent, the Senate
would require the cost of any tax cuts in
FY 2005 to be fully offset by other
measures. Analysts also anticipate
difficulties in passing a full set of budget
appropriations, given that 60 votes would
be required to block costly amendments
to each bill in the Senate. This could
again necessitate bundling appropriations
into an omnibus spending bill, which has
reduced fiscal transparency and
weakened expenditure discipline in the
past.

The FY 2005 Budget foresees a narrowing of the deficit
through FY 2006 but relatively small changes thereafter.

Congress. It also assumed sustained
spending discipline that would take
nondefense discretionary spending as a
share of GDP to its lowest level since the
early 1960s. On the revenue side, the repeal
of the Foreign Sales Corporation Act was
likely to involve additional tax cuts, and the
budget’s revenue projections were
predicated on a significant increase in the
number of tax filers falling under the
Alternative Minimum Tax, which was
almost certain to trigger corrective
legislative action at potentially significant
fiscal cost.
23.
Regarding the longer term, the
mission noted that a significant effort
would be needed to address the
sustainability of the U.S. fiscal position.
Although the Administration has recognized
the pressures that are expected to build from
the Social Security and Medicare systems,
last year’s expansion of Medicare benefits
has exacerbated the long-run fiscal
imbalance. Staff estimates now place the
actuarial liability of major entitlement
programs over a 75-year horizon at about
230 percent of current GDP, roughly
equivalent to a 13 percentage point hike in
payroll taxes.

In the absence of reforms, federal debt is projected to
rise steadily as a ratio to GDP.

to build consensus on the entitlement front.
Reducing the deficit by 1 percentage point of GDP each year through the rest of this
decade—roughly the rate envisioned for FY 2005–06—could provide significant supply-side
benefits to the United States and elsewhere by raising public saving and thereby reducing

- 20 -

pressures on global interest rates and investment, with only modest effects on short-term
activity.10 To maximize these benefits, the mission considered that consolidation could be
achieved in a manner that would preserve the supply-side benefits from recent reductions in
marginal tax rates.
25.
Officials stressed the Administration’s commitment to reducing the deficit, agreeing
that persistent deficits would be harmful to the economy, including by driving up interest
rates. While seeing little merit in establishing a more formal longer-term fiscal goal, given
the uncertainties involved in budget projections, they emphasized that a balanced budget
remained the Administration’s longer run objective. By FY 2009, the ratio of the fiscal
deficit to GDP would fall below its long-term average, which they regarded as an
appropriately ambitious goal, especially in light of the need to give priority to spending on
defense and homeland security. They added that considerable care had been taken to ensure
that the budget rested on prudent macroeconomic and technical assumptions, but did not
expect that a better-than-expected outcome this year would translate into a more ambitious
medium-term target.
26.
The mission supported the Administration’s call for a reauthorization of the 1985
Budget Enforcement Act (BEA), but saw risks in the decision to limit its scope. Although
the Administration’s proposal would establish caps on discretionary spending and tighten
restrictions on “emergency” appropriations, it could significantly weaken fiscal discipline by
exempting most tax measures from “pay-as-you-go” provisions and shortening the horizon of
the legislation’s discipline to five years. This would allow lawmakers, for example, to
circumvent spending restrictions by granting targeted tax relief, or to design measures with
the fiscal impact concentrated in the outer years.
27.
The team discussed the role revenue enhancements could play in helping to achieve
consolidation. The mission agreed that spending cuts represented a preferable option for
restoring fiscal balance but noted that revenue reform could play an important role, especially
given the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment required and already ambitious plans for cutting
nondefense discretionary spending. In order to preserve potential supply-side benefits of
lower marginal tax rates, the mission suggested that emphasis should be laid on reforms to
broaden and simplify the tax base. As discussed in Box 2, potential options to improve the
equity and efficiency of the tax system could include lowering personal income tax
expenditures, such as the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, reducing corporate tax
exemptions, raising energy taxes, and introducing a national value-added or similar indirect
tax.11

10

Chapter 2 of the World Economic Outlook (April 2004) illustrates this point by reporting MULTIMOD
simulations that suggest that a delayed fiscal adjustment places greater downward pressure on investment and
output, both domestically and abroad, as higher government debt reduces private saving.

11

See also Chapter 3 of the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

- 21 -

Box 2. Options for Fiscal Consolidation1
Estimates of the size of measures needed to balance the budget excluding Social Security differ depending on
assumptions about policies and future growth. Using the Administration’s FY 2005 budget proposals, the CBO
projects a unified federal government deficit excluding the Social Security of 3¼ percent of GDP ($570 billion) by
2014, while a baseline that includes AMT relief and somewhat faster expenditure growth yields a gap of 4 percent
of GDP. Estimates of the fiscal gap are sensitive to underlying growth assumptions, with the required adjustment
falling (rising) by 1½ percent of GDP for each ½ percentage point, the potential growth rate is higher (lower) than
in the baseline.
Further spending cuts may be difficult to achieve. The Administration’s FY 2005 budget already aims to reduce
nondefense discretionary expenditure to under 3 percent of GDP over five years, the lowest level since the 1960s.
Additional cuts could include reigning in agricultural and other commercial subsidies, including curbing
agricultural price support, closing or privatizing federal agencies, such as NASA, the FAA, or the Export-Import
Bank, and ending a range of other federal programs. While such measures could yield savings worth up to
2½ percent of GDP by 2009, realistic targets are likely to prove considerably smaller. Similarly, reductions in
federal transfers to the states would simply move the fiscal problem from the federal to state budgets.
Even under relatively optimistic assumptions regarding expenditure restraint, sizeable revenue increases
appear necessary to restore the budget to balance excluding Social Security. Efficiency considerations suggest
that broadening the personal income tax base and introducing a federal consumption tax should take priority over
raising marginal income tax rates. The potential revenue impact of such measures could be significant:
•

The U.S. personal income tax system provides substantial tax deductions and exemptions, leading to
total revenue losses of about 6 percent of GDP in 2003. Savings could be achieved by bringing these
exemptions partly under the tax net. For example, the maximum mortgage amount on which tax
exemption can be claimed (currently $1 million) could be gradually reduced or phased out.

•

The corporate income tax system has been characterized by a widening gap between corporate book and
taxable profits. Potential revenue gains from closing corporate tax loopholes and stepping up enforcement
of existing rules are hard to estimate, but could be a multiple of the $25 billion (¼ percent of GDP)
annual cost of corporate tax expenditures projected over the medium term.

•

A gradual increase in energy taxes could raise revenues and help limit U.S. energy use especially since
from an international perspective energy use in the United States is relatively lightly taxed, even
accounting for geographical and climatic idiosyncrasies. Estimates suggest that raising gasoline taxes by
20 cents per gallon could yield around ¼–½ percent of GDP in revenues.

•

Experience from other industrial countries suggests that a federal VAT could yield about ½ percent of
GDP per percentage point. A VAT could help improve intergenerational equity by implicitly taxing
retiree wealth, and—once established—would provide an economically more efficient means to raise
revenues to respond to spending pressures from population aging.

While no alternative to long-term fundamental reform of the Social Security and Medicare programs, fasteracting measures to reduce entitlement spending could also be implemented. These could include, among others,
advancing the next phase of the increase in retirement age, currently slated for 2017; improving the formula for
cost-of-living adjustments to align benefit levels more closely with actual cost increases; and adjusting benefit
payments for increases in life expectancy. On the revenue side, the share of taxable earnings currently included in
the payroll tax base could be increased, and there also remains scope for raising premium levels for the SMI part
of Medicare. These measures could provide annual savings of ½–¾ percent of GDP by 2014.

28.
Officials ruled out tax increases to close the medium-term budget gap, but saw scope
for revenue-neutral tax reform. This reflected a fundamental view that budget discipline should
rest on curbing government spending. The Administration’s policy was aimed at maximizing
incentives for economic growth, including by keeping the ratio of tax revenue to GDP low,
encouraging private saving, and reducing the regulatory burden, while maintaining a reasonable
level of government. Nevertheless, officials acknowledged that the expected increase in the
number of taxpayers falling under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) ran counter to the
AMT’s original purpose of securing a minimum amount of tax revenue from wealthy individuals
and would likely trigger broader reform proposals.12
29.
The Administration also remains committed to simplifying and extending existing taxexempt vehicles to provide incentives for enhanced private saving. Existing tax-preferred
savings plans would be replaced by Retirement Savings Accounts, which would enable tax-free
investment so long as withdrawals were made following retirement (so-called tax-prepaid plans).
The Administration has also proposed tax-prepaid Lifetime Savings Accounts—which would
allow households to withdraw funds before retirement for a range of purposes—as a means to
support saving especially amongst low-income households that tend to suffer more from liquidity
constraints than other groups of the population. Health Savings Accounts were already
introduced as part of the 2003 Medicare reform bill to help make medical insurance more
affordable. Staff cautioned that existing evidence on the effectiveness of tax-exempt vehicles in
raising net private saving was mixed, suggesting that a positive impact on national saving was
not assured.
30.
In view of the continued underfunding of the Social Security system, the team noted
that delaying reform would require larger and more painful measures later on (Box 3). The
2004 Economic Report of the President analyzes a reform option already proposed and discussed
by a 2001 Presidential Commission. It involves indexing benefit accruals to inflation instead of
wage growth, which would slow benefit growth and eliminate the system’s underfunding, and
diverting part of the existing payroll tax to personal retirement accounts (PRAs). While PRAs
would have a limited impact on unfunded liabilities, the team noted that debt and deficits would
rise during the transition to a more funded system.
31.
Officials responded that the Administration had sought to foster debate around
alternative approaches to Social Security reform rather than identify specific policies.
Although it had not endorsed any particular reform plan, the Administration was deeply
committed to the introduction of PRAs. Officials discounted concerns about the associated rise in
public debt and deficits, noting that these would be transitory and would only reflect an explicit
recognition of implicit obligations. Indeed, the expectation was that the higher deficits in the
transition period would assist in disciplining spending in these and other areas. Accordingly, they
saw no need for offsetting measures, such as broadening the base of the Social Security tax
noting that indexing accruals to prices, in combination with the introduction of PRAs, would
eliminate the program’s funding gap over the infinite horizon.
32.
Officials agreed that the financial problems of the Medicare system were much more
daunting than Social Security. The system is expected to begin running cash-flow
12

See Chapter 4 of the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

- 23 Box 3. The Real Fiscal Problem—An Intergenerational Accounting Approach1
The recent re-emergence of large U.S. budget deficits has heightened concern regarding the extent to which the
retirement and health care systems are prepared to cope with the pressures of an aging population. Actuarial
estimates for the Social Security and Medicare systems show that the present value of the unfunded liability of these
two programs is around 230 percent of current GDP over a 75-year horizon (and higher if calculated over a longer
horizon; Table). This suggests the need for either benefit cuts or premium increases with a yield roughly equivalent to
an immediate and permanent 13 percentage point hike in
the current payroll tax rate.
Unfunded Liabilities
Reform options for Social Security were discussed in the
2004 Economic Report of the President. One plan,
which was outlined by the 2001 Presidential
Commission, slows the growth of Social Security benefits
by indexing accruals of benefits to inflation instead of
wage growth, and offers beneficiaries the option to
deposit part of their payroll taxes in personal retirement
accounts. The accumulated contributions, to be invested
in private securities, would be available for workers at
retirement in exchange for reductions in the traditional
Social Security benefit. While indexing accruals to
inflation would eliminate the program’s funding gap,
staff estimates (assuming that price-indexing ends after
75 years) suggest that the introduction of personal
retirement accounts would likely still leave the system
with a small remaining liability.1

Medicare is projected to rise from about 2½ in 2004 to about 10 percent of GDP by 2075, and Medicare’s 75-year

factors behind the projected increase in Medicare spending. Due to the increase in the cost of medical technology and
drugs, per capita health expenditure has increased significantly faster than wages over the last decade, and projections
assume this trend to continue. As indicated in the “tighter spending” scenario reported in the table above, staff
estimates indicate that containing Medicare spending to the rate of productivity growth would reduce its actuarial
imbalance by about one-third.

Estimates of the effect of this option are only available from the Social Security Administration for 75 years. IMF staff
assumptions for subsequent years include the indexation of benefit accruals to wages rather than prices, as discussed further in
Chapter 4 of U.S. Fiscal Policies and Priorities for Long-Run Sustainability, IMF Occasional Paper No. 227 (2004). As with all
long-term projections, changes to the underlying assumptions could affect the results.

deficits by the end of the next decade, and outlays are projected to rise rapidly as a share of
GDP, particularly given the drug benefits introduced last year. Officials stressed that the
problems went beyond the increase in the elderly population. Rising costs, in part, reflect
improvements in technology that have encouraged the increased use of more expensive
procedures and equipment, including for relatively expensive chronic illnesses, such as
diabetes and coronary heart disease.
33.
The mission asked about prospects for reform and whether it should involve the
broader health care system. Although the health system is largely run by the private sector,
half of U.S. medical spending is publicly financed, with this share likely to rise with
population aging. Consequently, durable reform of the public system would also seem to
require measures that could address the cost pressures and incentives in the private system.
Officials responded that recent and prospective reform proposals would help increase
efficiency and slow health care costs. The Health Savings Accounts established as part of last
year’s Medicare legislation were designed to give consumers greater responsibility and
choice over their health care and encourage them to play a greater role in containing costs.
The 2003 legislation also introduced the principle of means-tested benefits, contained
initiatives to promote preventative care and the use of information technology, and increased
private sector involvement in administering benefits. Although private health management
organizations have had only mixed success in containing costs thus far, officials viewed these
systems as likely to be effective in reducing costs related to excess capacity, which was
especially significant in urban rather than rural areas.
34.
Health care issues also remain of central importance at the state level. Financial
conditions among the states have improved since mid-2003 reflecting expenditure cuts, some
revenue measures, and a recovery in economic activity. However, most states continue to
seek budgetary savings to cope with the steep drop in tax revenues after 2001, and some were
concerned that new federal mandates in areas such as education and homeland security had
only been partly funded. In the long run, however, the states’ fiscal position was largely
dominated by health care spending, which was projected to continue to trend upwards at a
rate of 8–9 percent per year. With diminishing room for further expenditure cuts, states are
expected to increasingly turn toward revenue measures, with the taxation of internet
transactions emerging as an area of potential friction in state-federal fiscal relations.
V. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES
35.
In recent months, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has begun to lay
the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus. Following the August 2003 formulation that an
accommodative stance would be maintained for a “considerable period,” the FOMC’s
January 2004 statement suggested that deflationary risks had eased by stressing that the Fed
could be “patient” before withdrawing stimulus. In subsequent speeches, FOMC members
downplayed fears that low interest rates were fueling a speculative bubble in asset markets,
but also cautioned that households and businesses should be prepared for a higher interest
rate environment. In May, the FOMC’s statement shifted toward a balanced assessment of
inflation and noted that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to

- 25 -

be “measured.” More recent speeches have
emphasized that, if necessary, the FOMC
stands ready to move rapidly to maintain
price stability.

have effectively anchored expectations and
reassured markets. Fed officials responded that, with the recovery now becoming well
advanced, the focus of their communication strategy had shifted toward preparing financial
markets for the inevitable withdrawal of monetary stimulus. This emphasis reflected a desire
to avoid the type of market over-reaction that had occurred in 1994, when bond yields rose
sharply in response to Fed tightening. FOMC statements seemed to have been effective in
signaling that policymakers were committed to a gradual policy adjustment, and officials
expressed broad satisfaction with the extent to which this signal had been reflected in bond
yields.
37.
At the same time, however, the team discussed whether recent price pressures
suggested that an earlier withdrawal of stimulus might have been warranted. The core PCE

38.
Fed officials saw little likelihood that an abrupt removal of stimulus would be
needed. Indeed, they suggested that the rate of withdrawal of stimulus in 2005 implied by
yield curves seemed more rapid than warranted by cyclical conditions. Although the federal
funds rate was a considerable distance from its neutral level, bond yields had increased and

- 26 -

headwinds associated with the higher oil prices, the anticipated rebuilding of the household
saving rate, and the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, meant that monetary policy could be easier
for longer than otherwise.
39.
Thus, while Fed officials acknowledged that the recent rebound in inflation was a
cause for concern, they saw the risk of a significant acceleration in core prices as limited.
Recent price pressures seemed to largely reflect increases in margins rather than unit costs
and, with the share of profits in national income unusually elevated, there was considerable
room for margins to accommodate a further rise in material costs. Moreover, since the
disinflation through late 2003 and early 2004 had been larger than projected by conventional
models, the recent price increases likely represented a return to more normal conditions.
Although inflation expectations had increased, the rise was modest and to be expected in the
face of higher energy prices and the cyclical recovery, and surveys indicated that
expectations remained well anchored.
40.
Officials observed that the Fed continued to take a “risk-management approach” to
policy. The weight that policymakers placed on the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and
full employment tended to vary depending on which of these objectives were at greatest risk.
Thus, greater weight was given to real output growth during economic downturns, with a
larger weight attached to inflation and interest rate smoothing during upturns (Box 4).13
41.
The Federal Reserve remains one of the most transparent central banks. That said,
as in the past, the staff queried whether introducing a more explicit definition of price
stability and medium-term target for inflation would provide valuable additional guidance to
markets. They noted that a greater number of FOMC members appeared amenable to this
idea than in the past. Officials acknowledged that there were different views on the merits of
adopting an explicit inflation target within the FOMC, but key objections included the Fed’s
dual mandate, the fact that inflation expectations were already well anchored, and that
inflation indices tended to be biased. A number of options for increasing transparency—such
as adopting a standard formula for describing the FOMC’s policy stance, releasing more
detailed macroeconomic forecasts, and accelerating the publication of minutes—had been
discussed at the FOMC’s January 2004 meeting, but there had been no agreement on these
proposals.
42.
Staff discussed the implications of the large U.S. current account deficit and
associated risks of market disruption. Especially against the background of a large fiscal
deficit, the low U.S. national saving rate could be a significant drain on global saving as the
global recovery matures, potentially dampening global investment and growth.14 In addition,

The cyclical response of monetary policy is discussed in Chapter 5 of the accompanying Selected Issues
paper.

Deficit and of China’s Growth.”

Box 4. How Typical Was the Federal Reserve’s Response To This Recession? 1
To compare the monetary policy response to past cyclical episodes, the staff has estimated a
monetary response function in which the coefficients on the Taylor rule vary depending on
the state of the cycle. More precisely, Taylor rules were estimated separately for recessions
(i.e., periods of negative output growth) and expansions. Given uncertainties about the true
state of the economy, the implied policy being followed at any one time is a weighted average
of these two rules, with the weights depending on the relative probabilities assigned to being in
either situation.
The results indicate that in expansions the Federal Reserve puts a high weight on combating
inflation and on smoothing interest rate changes, while in recessions more weight is
assigned to output growth and responses are faster. The focus on inflation in recoveries and
output growth in recessions plausibly reflects differing economic risks and costs as well as
possible nonlinearities in the relationship between inflation and output over the cycle.
Similarly, the difference in speed of response is consistent with some stylized features of the
cycle, including that the onset of recessions is less predictable than recoveries and that output
tends to fall more rapidly than it increases.
The two-state Taylor rule captures the

rule, with its greater concentration on
inflationary developments and interest rate smoothing, suggests that the tightening cycle would
normally have started but be at an early stage.
The analysis also suggests, however, that current stimulus is larger than typical. A closer
examination of the results reveals that the easing cycle this time around was particularly
aggressive. The speed of easing appears to have reflected fears of deflation and the limited
room to provide future interest rate reductions due to the closeness of the zero interest rate
bound, which generated a greater-than-usual emphasis on ensuring adequate current stimulus.
However, this also implies that the current stance is more simulative than would be typical at
this stage in the cycle. This suggests that at some point, the tightening cycle might be expected
to be somewhat more aggressive than in a more typical environment.

the projected continuing rise in U.S. net foreign liabilities as a ratio to GDP posed the risk of
a disorderly adjustment as financial markets might become saturated with U.S. instruments.
Finally, market conditions could be affected by a reversal of the recent trend toward an
increasing proportion of the deficit being financed by foreign official flows.
43.
Treasury officials emphasized that they viewed the current account deficit as a
reflection of the buoyancy of the U.S. economy and weakness of demand abroad rather
than a policy concern. Capital inflows still largely reflected market-based decisions by
investors, and they expressed confidence that if official purchases diminished, private
investors would fill the gap without significant consequence, since a mild depreciation of the
dollar would make U.S. securities cheaper and more attractive to foreign investors. Treasury
officials and Federal Reserve officials agreed that market developments during the past year
had illustrated that fears of disorderly market adjustments were largely overdone.
44.
Nonetheless, Federal Reserve officials acknowledged that the U.S. current account
deficit could not remain in the present range over the long term. The relative strength of the
U.S. economy, recent increases in global oil prices, and the likelihood that higher interest
rates would begin to raise payments abroad to holders of U.S. Treasuries, could keep the
deficit at or higher than 5 percent of GDP for the foreseeable future (Box 5 discusses
prospects for the trade balance). Officials recognized that the steady rise in net external
indebtedness could not be sustained indefinitely, and stabilizing the external debt-to-GDP
ratio would require a much larger adjustment in the trade balance than may be assumed,
given the need to service the net liability position.
VI. FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
45.
Officials expressed strong confidence in the stability of the banking system. While
the improvement in overall economic conditions was helping to create record profits and
near-record returns on assets, sound risk management practices had also made important
contributions. The system was well prepared for interest hikes and, given high levels of
capital, the system appeared unlikely to face significant threats to its financial stability. Staff
agreed that banking profitability and capital measures looked healthy, especially compared
with their levels following the 1991 recession. At the same time, the importance of large,
complex banking groups continued to increase, and staff welcomed the authorities’ continued
efforts to adapt inter-agency supervisory arrangements.15
46.
The authorities remain committed to the Basel II Accord. Outstanding issues within
the Basel Committee, largely involving the treatment of credit card debt, were likely to be
resolved soon. The main concern among U.S. regulators was to ensure that Basel II did not
significantly affect the competitive position of adopting banks relative to non-adopters. Were
this to be the case, implementation might be delayed until supervisors were satisfied that any
such unintended consequences could be mitigated. That said, officials viewed the benefits of
15

Box 5. Prospects for the Trade Deficit
Standard trade models suggest that the expansion in the U.S. trade deficit over recent years reflects U.S. growth
relative to competitors, and that the U.S. trade deficit will continue to widen as a consequence of domestic
economic vibrancy. However, this view may be unduly pessimistic and, if supply-side effects are important, the trade
deficit as a ratio to GDP could stabilize even with rapid
domestic growth.
Traditional trade models imply that countries in which
growth accelerates should suffer a deterioration in their
trade balance or a trend depreciation in their exchange
rates. In such models, trade only reflects demand factors.
Exports depend on relative prices (e.g., the tradeweighted real exchange rate) and a measure of global
demand. Similarly, imports depend on relative prices and
growth at home.

Staff estimates of such a specification imply that, on
current WEO assumptions about growth in the United States and its trading partners and unchanged real exchange
rates, the trade deficit would reach 5¾ percentage points of GDP by 2009.

-6

Some authors, however, have argued this prediction reflects the absence of “supply-side” effects.2 They note that
countries with fast underlying growth rates tend to also have higher estimated activity elasticities on exports compared
to imports. As a result, rapid development in countries such as Japan or South Korea was not associated with growing
trade deficits or trend depreciations in their exchange rates. This suggests that an expansion of domestic supply
creates a demand for exports and reduces the demand for imports. Such an effect could occur if growth increases the
range of goods produced by that country. If consumers enjoy variety, they will purchase more goods from a fastgrowing economy.
Forecasts that incorporate such supply effects suggest a more modest deterioration of the trade balance. For
example, in a model that assumes that demand factors dominate in the short term, but that exports and imports
respond equally to demand and supply factors in the long run, the trade balance as a ratio to GDP is projected to fall
modestly over the next 5 years and stabilize at around 4 percent of GDP.

adopting Basel II, in terms of risk improved measurement and management, as exceeding the
costs of implementation.
47.
Officials and staff agreed on the need for stronger regulation of the major
government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (Box 6). Although they expressed confidence in
the financial position and risk-management practices of the GSEs, officials saw the rapid
expansion of their asset holdings as posing potential concerns due to the concentration of
interest rate risk, particularly given the incorrect perception by many market participants that
the GSEs benefited from an implicit government guarantee. The Administration had
proposed legislation to create a new regulator with powers to set capital levels, define stress
tests, and place a GSE into receivership if necessary. It appeared doubtful that the legislation
would be enacted in the current year, however, largely due to a lack of agreement on the
receivership issue, and officials were exploring how the current regulatory framework could
be used to tighten oversight. Staff welcomed the proposed measures, but noted that
strengthened regulation would not necessarily curb the growth in GSE activities if the
perception that these agencies were too big to fail remained, and allowed funding at an
advantageous rate.
48.
Corporate governance reforms contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation were
largely in place. There had been few difficulties in implementing these changes and—
notwithstanding some concerns in the corporate sector—officials said they had found little
evidence that the rules had hampered firms from expanding activities or attracting qualified
candidates for boards and audit committees. The Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (PCAOB) had made significant progress in strengthening the oversight of the auditing
profession by initiating registration of domestic auditors and conducting “limited procedure”
inspections of the top accounting firms. Official agreed with staff that recent revelations of
questionable practices in the mutual fund industry underscored the need for continued
vigilance with regard to the integrity of markets.
49.
Officials noted the improvement in finances of defined benefit corporate pensions,
but indicated additional reforms could further strengthen the system. Such plans remain an
important, if declining, part of the U.S. pension system. Rising stock prices and increased
contributions had generally improved balance sheets, although there were still significant
funding issues in several plans, particularly in the steel and airline industries.16 Recentlyenacted legislation would improve the accuracy of measuring pension liabilities but also
would provide relief to most severely underfunded plans, reducing overall funding and
raising issues of moral hazard. Administration proposals to strengthen future funding levels
included measures to reduce incentive problems by restricting the benefits severely
underfunded plans may offer. Officials acknowledged that restructuring the Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corporation’s (PBGC) premium structure to reflect pension plan risks was one of
the measures under consideration to improve PBGC funding.

Box 6: Proposed Regulatory Reform of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)
During the past year, debate has intensified over regulation
of the two major housing GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac. The authorities and Congress have been considering
measures that would enhance the supervision of their activities
and could reduce the potential moral hazard arising from the
continued market perception of an implicit government
guarantee on their debt.
The activities and balance sheet size of the GSEs have
expanded significantly in recent years (see Chart). Not only
is the quantity of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)
guaranteed by the GSEs of a comparable size to the U.S.
Treasury market, but the GSEs’ own balance sheets are more
than half the size of the securitized markets they have fostered.
The implicit guarantee that markets attach to GSE debt has
enabled them to acquire large amounts of mortgage-related
assets at a lower cost than other market participants and, in the
process, take on interest rate exposures.

1/ As of end-2003, over 80 percent of federally related MBSs were
guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and almost 70 percent of GSE
debt was issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Besides their size, the GSEs are important to financial stability for several reasons: About 30 to 50 percent of their liabilities
are short-term; their role as one of the largest counterparties in the interest-rate swap and swaption market; and possible
amplification of market volatility from their readjustments of hedges when yields move and expectations of mortgage
prepayments change. The GSEs’ activities are large enough to give them price-setting influence in the interest rate derivatives
markets.
Concerns about the GSEs’ potential impact have been heightened by accounting problems. Freddie Mac was required to
restate earnings upwards for 2000–02, and its 2003 statement is still under preparation. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight (OFHEO) is conducting a special examination of accounting policies and practices at Fannie Mae. These accounting
problems have not cast doubt on the GSEs’ underlying financial soundness, but do raise questions about the transparency and
control of their complex risk management operations.
The potential for future problems is exacerbated by the continued perception of an implicit government guarantee. The
perception persists because of several factors, including: a line of credit from the Treasury; exemption of GSE debt from banks’
large exposure limits; exemption of their income from state and local taxes; exemption from SEC securities registration
requirements; and, perhaps most importantly, the widespread belief that they are “too big to fail.” As a result, investors and
counterparties may take on greater exposures to the agencies than they would to an equivalent institution without such links to
government.
The Treasury has proposed legislation that would treat the GSEs more like other financial institutions. The proposal would
establish a new regulator, under the oversight of the Treasury, with more discretion to set capital and other requirements. In the
same way as bank regulators, the new regulator would have the power if necessary to place GSEs in receivership, take other
enforcement actions, and fund itself through GSE assessments. However, the current version of the bill in Congress does not
contain the receivership provision, which the Treasury regards as essential, and legislation is therefore unlikely to be enacted this
year.
Federal Reserve officials have proposed more directly addressing the size of the GSEs. Noting that stricter regulation could
actually increase perceptions of the guarantee, Chairman Greenspan has suggested limiting the size of the GSEs’ own debt as a
proportion of the debt they securitize. Limiting their ability to fund holdings on their balance sheet, relative to the overall size of
the mortgage-backed securities market should reduce their potential impact while enhancing the liquidity of the securitization
market.

With legislation unlikely in the short term, the Administration is exploring more modest interim steps that can be taken
under existing law. In the absence of receivership, OFHEO is developing rules for applying conservatorship. The Treasury
intends to request more ongoing information on the GSEs’ debt issuance policy.

50.
Officials and staff concurred with the Financial Accounting Standard Board
(FASB) proposal that stock option grants should be expensed. Officials noted that stock
options are a form of compensation and that pricing them at zero in income statements was
not transparent. Moreover, although there was some discussion in Congress of weakening
this proposal—as had occurred in 1994—expensing options would bring the United States
more in line with international accounting standards. Indeed, officials noted with satisfaction
the more general convergence of accounting standards, and that FASB and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were working to eliminate differences in treatment with
an emphasis on adopting whichever measure was stronger.
51.
Officials noted that the United States has largely complied with the 40+8 Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), and progress was being made on the remaining
issues. The authorities are continuing their efforts to implement the provisions of the Patriot
Act, and will be in full compliance with FATF recommendations when regulations requiring
all nonbank financial institutions to report suspicious activities are in place. Given the range
of regulators involved in supervising different types of financial institutions, a new Office of
Intelligence and Analysis is being created to increase information sharing.
VII. TRADE POLICY AND OFFICIAL ASSISTANCE
52.
Officials explained that the Administration is pursuing a multi-pronged trade
policy strategy. On the multilateral front, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)
had been active in efforts to reinvigorate the Doha trade round, promoting regional free trade
agreements (FTAs), and building trade capacity among developing countries. On the bilateral
front, the authorities also placed an emphasis on bilateral FTAs and on ensuring a level
playing field with major trading partners such as China.
53.
The USTR representatives suggested that prospects for progress in the Doha Round
had improved recently, but agriculture held the key to success. Officials welcomed recent
EU proposals on agriculture and noted that, since the Cancún Ministerial, the United States
had indicated flexibility with regard to trade-distorting domestic supports. The central issue
now was to achieve agreement on an ambitious formula for agricultural market access, and
officials stressed the need for all sides to make concessions to secure a useful framework
agreement.
54.
The authorities’ Doha Round objectives also included ensuring that developing
countries faced disciplines and adopted liberalization commitments commensurate with
their importance in world trade. In particular, officials argued that large and competitive
developing countries should be subject to the same market access formula as developed
countries. However, the Administration was of the view that less developed countries should
not be asked to deliver results that were beyond their capacity and supported flexible
approaches that combined a gradual phasing of commitments with trade-related technical
assistance. The key was to avoid permanent “opt-outs” and excessive dilution of market
access goals, which could further disassociate such countries from the global trading system.

- 33 -

55.
Officials noted that the U.S. trade liberalization agenda also included aggressive
pursuit of bilateral and regional FTAs.17 This was partly founded on the view that such
agreements helped establish momentum in favor of free trade that could carry over to
multilateral negotiations. The staff cautioned, however, that the competitive advantage that
current and possible future FTAs could yield to participants might weaken their support for
multilateral liberalization, while also straining the administrative and negotiating capacity of
some developing countries, posing concerns regarding fragmentation of global trade.
56.
Officials noted that it would be difficult to meet the January 2005 deadline for
completion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. The Miami Ministerial in November
2003 concluded without a consensus on the specific issues to be negotiated and with
relatively modest commitments in nine broad negotiating areas. Key sticking points included
the U.S. emphasis on addressing issues related to domestic agricultural support within the
WTO framework and some Latin American countries’ aversion to including provisions on
investment, intellectual property rights, and government procurement.
57.
Officials confirmed the Administration’s commitment to the end-2004 deadline for
eliminating textile and apparel quotas. This was likely to prompt a rise in textile imports
from China, with negative implications for less competitive developing-country suppliers as
well as for domestic textile manufacturers. With regard to other competitors, the authorities
pointed out that some recent FTAs, such as the one with Central America, were partly
designed to mitigate the effect of the quota elimination. On the domestic front, measures to
alleviate trade-related adjustment costs were already in place to provide financial support to
affected industries and retrain workers—indeed, the textile sector had been the largest
beneficiary of such schemes over 1997–2003.
58.
Officials noted that China had remained an important focus of trade policy over the
past year.18 China had continued to provide an important area of opportunity for U.S. exports
and, while imports from China had also risen rapidly, this had largely been at the expense of
third-country suppliers rather than domestic production. In addition, important safeguards
had been introduced as part of China’s WTO membership, which could be triggered under
less stringent conditions, and these had been applied by the U.S. government in
December 2003. Looking forward, U.S. authorities placed important emphasis on China’s
full and timely compliance with its market access commitments at the WTO, as well as on
enforcement of intellectual property rights. The team welcomed the Administration’s
outward-looking approach and cautioned against a defensive recourse to trade remedy action.

17

Over the past year, FTAs have been signed with Australia, Chile, five Central American countries, and
Singapore, and negotiations have been launched with Bahrain, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Panama,
Peru, the Southern African Customs Union, and Thailand. Officials noted that the busy legislative agenda meant
that ratification of many recently-signed FTAs by Congress was unlikely this year.

funded, which has the advantage that
they will not be subject to future appropriations, but also implies that fewer programs could
be approved initially. The authorities reiterated the President’s commitment to allocate $15
billion in five years to fight HIV/AIDS, including $10 billion of new money, and outlined
other initiatives to ensure that humanitarian relief remains adequate, such as the creation of a
famine fund.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
60.
The U.S. recovery has gathered considerable momentum since last year, and is
again leading the global recovery. The economy has shaken off an unprecedented series of
adverse shocks and—supported by the sizeable injection of monetary and fiscal stimulus
since the onset of the downturn—has expanded strongly during the past year. To be sure,
downside risks remain, including those related to high energy prices and the course of
household demand given high debt loads and concerns that some real estate markets are
overvalued. However, productivity growth continues at an exceptional rate, balancing these
downside risks and holding out the possibility of further upside surprises to the economy’s
supply side.
61.
The FY 2005 budget signals a welcome shift toward fiscal consolidation especially
in the nearer term. With the recovery now well on track, the deficit reduction projected for
the coming two fiscal years is appropriate. Nonetheless, the challenge remains to sustain
expenditure discipline, contain budgetary pressures—including those related to ongoing
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and a number of legislative initiatives presently before
Congress—and anticipate costs of likely AMT reform. It will help that the budget outcome
this year will likely be better-than-expected, providing the opportunity to strengthen
subsequent deficit-reduction objectives.

- 35 -

62.
Continuing the pace of deficit reduction beyond the next two years will help place
the long-run fiscal position on a sustainable basis. Federal deficits and debt will come
under increasing pressure as the baby boom generation retires and places greater demands on
entitlement programs, especially in the context of the expansion of Medicare benefits and
plans to make tax cuts permanent. Against this background, it will help if the deficit
reduction pace envisaged over FY 2005–06 is extended to subsequent years.
63.
Bringing the budget back to balance, excluding Social Security, within a
reasonable period would leave the U.S. fiscal position much better placed to cope with
impending demographic pressures. Although entitlement reform holds the key to long-run
fiscal sustainability, restoring a fiscal surplus equal to the cash-flow surplus of the Social
Security system by the end of the decade would achieve significant debt reduction ahead of
the retirement of the baby boom generation and provide greater room to build consensus for
and implement entitlement reforms. This more ambitious fiscal objective could also have
significant supply-side benefits for the United States and the rest of the world by reducing
pressures on global interest rates and investment.
64.
The recovery provides a valuable opportunity for embarking upon the fiscal effort
that is needed to achieve such a medium-term objective. Helpfully, the authorities have
supported budget enforcement legislation that could provide the necessary framework for
solidifying fiscal responsibility and expenditure discipline but proposals to limit the pay-asyou-go requirement from covering most tax measures and to shorten its horizon to five years
risks weakening the legislation’s discipline.
65.
Revenue measures in the context of efficiency-building tax reform warrant
consideration. While expenditure discipline will need to be an essential element of the
consolidation effort, given the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment required and already
ambitious plans for cutting nondefense discretionary spending, revenues may also need to
rise. To avoid having to unwind recent marginal tax rate cuts and give up their potential
supply-side benefits, emphasis could be laid on reforms to broaden and simplify the tax base,
for example by cutting tax expenditures, which significantly reduce revenues and distort
resource allocation, or by introducing a national indirect tax.
66.
Delaying actions to address the Social Security system’s funding problems will
likely entail larger and more painful adjustments later on. The Administration has already
taken the important step of commissioning reform proposals, which show that amending
indexation formulas to slow benefit growth would eliminate the system’s underfunding.
However, the proposed diversion of a portion of the payroll tax into private retirement
accounts would significantly boost the federal budget deficits and debt in coming decades,
and care is needed to ensure that this measure is coupled with durable steps to address longterm fiscal sustainability.
67.
The financial problems of the Medicare system dwarf those of Social Security, and
also reflect the effects of the additional drug benefits introduced last year. The Medicare
Reform legislation included useful initiatives to introduce competition and increase

- 36 -

efficiency in health care delivery, and the means-testing of Part B premiums could enable
enhancements of system revenues. However, the Medicare system is still expected to begin
running cash-flow deficits by the end of the next decade and outlays are projected to triple as
a share of GDP by mid-century. Early steps to address these adverse trends are needed, but
may also require broader, efficiency-enhancing reforms of the U.S. health care system.
68.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has appropriately begun preparing
markets for the gradual withdrawal of stimulus. The aggressive easing of recent years has
provided essential support to the recovery, and the monetary authorities are to be commended
for forestalling fears of deflation that emerged last year. Nonetheless, with signs that the
recovery is maturing, labor market conditions are improving, and concerns that higher energy
prices could revive inflation expectations, the time has come to start removing stimulus.
Although there appears scope for a measured tightening, recent statements by officials have
helped market participants recognize that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus will not be
unduly delayed.
69.
Building on the Fed’s already high transparency, the mission discussed the scope
for providing further guidance to financial markets. Useful options were a subject of recent
FOMC discussions, and there would also seem to be merit in the Federal Reserve further
anchoring expectations by clarifying its definition of price stability and its medium-term
inflation objective.
70.
Financial markets have demonstrated during the past year their ability to digest
significant exchange rate movements. Nonetheless, the U.S. current account deficit is still
expected to remain large at around 5 percent of GDP and highly dependent upon foreign
private and official investor appetite for net claims against U.S. residents, with the attendant
risk that shifts in such demand could result in abrupt adjustments of interest and exchange
rates. Although stronger growth abroad should play a key role in fostering the resolution of
global current account imbalances, determined efforts to strengthen the U.S. fiscal position
would help boost national saving and ensure that the adjustment is orderly and avoids an
undue burden on investment, both domestically and abroad.
71.
The banking sector has proven its resilience over recent years and ongoing reforms
of corporate governance have helped increase confidence in market integrity. Strong
fundamentals have left the financial system well prepared for the expected withdrawal of
monetary stimulus. At the same time, the authorities have also moved effectively in response
to recent corporate scandals to strengthen corporate governance. Looking ahead, it will be
important to ensure that the Financial Standards Accounting Board is able to fulfill its
responsibilities in an independent manner.
72.
The Administration has raised justified concerns about the large and increasing
share of mortgage-backed securities held by the main government sponsored enterprises
(GSEs). The growth of these institutions has concentrated interest rate and mortgage
prepayment risk, and the Administration’s proposal to overhaul the current supervisory
regime and establish an independent regulator warrants legislative support.

- 37 -

73.
The U.S. authorities have taken welcome steps to provide impetus to the Doha
Round negotiations. Continued U.S. leadership and commitment to multilateral approaches
to trade liberalization, especially with regard to agriculture, will be critical to the success of
the Round.
74.
Recent increases in U.S. official development assistance (ODA) and progress on
Millennium Challenge Account are welcome. However, U.S. ODA remains the lowest
among industrial countries as a share of GNI and the mission supports Administration plans
to boost U.S. foreign assistance as a ratio to GNI over coming years.
75.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX III

United States—Debt Sustainability
1.
This appendix subjects projections for U.S. public debt and net external liabilities to a
series of established macroeconomic stress tests.1 Following the methodology prescribed in
“Assessing Sustainability,” (May 28, 2002, www.imf.org), a baseline trajectory for these two debt
variables is determined by setting key macroeconomic variables, including the primary fiscal deficit
and the non-interest current account balance, at values projected by staff. The fiscal baseline is then
subjected to two-standard deviation shocks in domestic interest rates, real growth and the primary
fiscal deficit, each lasting two years before the variable returns to normal. For external debt, similar
shocks are assumed for real growth, domestic prices, the foreign interest rate, and the non-interest
current account balance.
2.
The exercise focuses on short- to medium-term vulnerabilities for the general government.
Accordingly, net general government debt is defined by combining the net financial liabilities of
federal, state, and local government debt to the public (that is, excluding government debt held by the
social insurance trust funds).
3.
In all but one case, shocks to the fiscal baseline lead to an upward path of public debt
(Figure and Table 1a). Under adverse interest rate, fiscal, and real GDP shocks, the debt-to-GDP ratio
continues to grow after an initial jump in the first two years. Under a combination of all shocks (at
one standard deviation) the ratio plateaus after the initial rise. The greatest vulnerability is with regard
to fiscal and interest rates shocks—both shocks induce a temporary increase in the debt ratio in 2005
and 2006 and leave the 2009 ratio at more than 5 percent of GDP above the baseline.

4.
Shocks to the external baseline all imply a faster accumulation of foreign debt by 2009
(Figure and Table 1b). In the baseline scenario, the ratio of net external liabilities to GDP increases
from 22 percent in 2003 to 37 percent in 2009. Non-interest current account and real GDP would
have the largest influence on debt accumulation. External debt would be within 37–40 percent of
GDP in all simulated cases. These simulations reflect the higher historical volatility of the external
variables, which increases the magnitude of the two standard deviation shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Christopher Towe
July 22, 2004
1.
This supplement reports on information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. The topics covered include the June 30 meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Report to Congress,
recent economic and financial market developments, and an update on the budget outlook.
These changes do not affect the staff appraisal.
Monetary policy developments
2.
As widely anticipated, the FOMC raised its target for short-term interest rates by
one-quarter percentage point to 1¼ percent on June 30. The accompanying statement
offered a balanced assessment of the risks to both growth and inflation, and reaffirmed that
the pace of tightening “is likely to be measured.” Nonetheless, in an apparent
acknowledgement of the recent pickup in inflation, the FOMC cautioned that it “will respond
to changes in economic prospects as needed.” The move was fully discounted in markets, and
bond, equity, and currency prices were little affected.
3.
The Federal Reserve Board’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report was presented
to Congress on July 20. The FOMC’s central forecast is for growth to moderate to between
3½–4 percent in 2005 (Q4 on Q4), with the core deflator for personal consumption
expenditure stable between 1½–2 percent (Q4 on Q4), both consistent with staff projections.
The FOMC expects the economy to continue to benefit from improving labor market
conditions, brisk increases in capital spending as a result of strong corporate financial
conditions, stock building, and a pickup in activity abroad.
4.
In his testimony, Chairman Greenspan expanded on the FOMC’s view that the
pace of policy tightening can remain “measured.” The Chairman acknowledged that
productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinary pace in 2003, contributing to a
modest increase in unit labor costs in recent quarters, but emphasized that these
developments did not appear to pose a risk to long-term price stability. However, the
Chairman also reiterated the FOMC’s view that a rise in inflationary pressures as a result of
the Fed’s recent accommodative stance could not be ruled out, and that the Federal Reserve
would therefore pay close attention to incoming data, especially on costs and prices.

-2-

Recent economic and financial market developments
5.
Although recent data suggest a somewhat slower rate of growth in the second
quarter than previously projected, the staff’s forecast for the year as a whole still appears
appropriate. In June, payroll employment rose by 112,000 (1 percent on an annualized
basis), about half the pace of the first five months of the year; industrial production fell
0.3 percent; and retail sales declined 1.1 percent. However, strong export growth helped
lower the trade deficit to $46 billion in May from the previous month’s record $48 billion.
Moreover, forward-looking indicators also remain positive, with the Conference Board’s
consumer confidence index rising above 100 in June for the first time in two years and
diffusion indices for both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors also consistent
with strong growth of output and employment. Thus, while second-quarter growth may dip
below 4 percent, most forecasters expect faster activity in the second half of the year,
supported by continuing strength in profits and compensation.
6.
Inflation pressures appear to be contained. Although higher energy prices continued
to boost the overall consumer price index, taking the 12-month inflation rate to 3.3 percent,
the core consumer price index rose by only 0.1 percent in June leaving the 12-month core
inflation rate at 1.9 percent. Similarly, the headline and core producer price indexes rose by
4 percent and 1.8 percent over the past 12 months. Against this, oil prices have returned near
their recent highs due to strong demand and the reemergence of supply concerns.
7.
Weaker recent data have
helped scale back market
expectations of the pace of future
interest rate hikes. The yield curve
now suggests a federal funds rate of
3¼ –3½ percent by end-2005, almost
50 basis points lower than before the
rate hike (figure). Similarly, 10-year
Treasury bond yields have fallen by
some ¼ percentage point to around
4½ percent. Stock prices have also
eased, partly on concerns that energy
prices will hurt earnings prospects,
and the dollar has weakened
moderately.

The June 30 FOMC decision had little impact on
expectations of future monetary tightening but
expectations have moderated subsequently.

Fiscal developments
8.
Recent budget data continue to suggest an increasingly favorable budget outlook
for this year. Reflecting stronger-than-anticipated revenue growth through June, a recent
Treasury report suggested that the FY 2004 deficit would likely fall below the CBO’s March
estimate of $477 billion (4¼ percent of GDP) and well below the administration’s February
estimate of $520 billion (4½ percent of GDP). Progress toward passing the FY 2005 budget
has been slow—since late June, the House has completed work on five spending bills and the
Senate on one.
After a lengthy debate, the House rejected a proposal by the Administration that would
have effectively reauthorized the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). The bill would have
required budgetary offsets for changes in mandatory spending, but would have exempted
most future tax cuts from this obligation. Although Congress may yet agree on some budget
enforcement measures during the ongoing appropriations process, the debate on restoring
BEA provisions is unlikely to resume before next year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 30, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the United States
On July 23, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
Following a rather tepid recovery, the economy gathered strength in 2003. Supported by
continued robust productivity growth, real GDP growth began to exceed the growth rate of
potential output around mid-year. The recovery broadened in early 2004 as payroll employment
strengthened, easing concerns that a lack of employment growth and correspondingly weaker
household income could weigh on consumer demand. Both the pickup in economic activity and
higher world energy prices have contributed to a rise in inflation that has helped erase earlier
deflation fears. Although the pace of recovery appears to have slowed recently, partly owing to
the dampening effect of higher oil prices on demand and the waning effects of earlier fiscal
stimulus, prospects appear favorable for continued strength in the second half of the year.
Stronger asset prices have played an important role in supporting aggregate demand. Equity
markets have risen nearly 50 percent from their lows just before the Iraq war, although prices
have stagnated somewhat in recent months on concerns that the removal of monetary stimulus
and higher energy costs would hurt corporate earnings. Nonetheless, house prices have
continued to increase rapidly, and households have continued to refinance mortgage debt in
order to reduce interest payments and lengthen debt maturities.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Both monetary and fiscal policies have provided significant support to the recovery, but stimulus
is now being withdrawn. The Federal Reserve acted to raise the Federal funds rate by
¼ percentage point on June 30, long-term interest rates have risen by around 1 percentage
point since late March, and part of the dollar’s earlier depreciation has been reversed. On the
fiscal front, the stimulus from this year’s surge in personal tax refunds associated with the 2003
tax cuts is starting to fade, and investment incentives generated by accelerated depreciation
allowances are slated to expire at end-December.
Labor productivity growth has remained remarkably strong during the past year, and job
creation has also begun to revive. Tepid employment growth earlier in the recovery appeared to
have largely reflected cost cutting in the face of uncertain growth and geopolitical uncertainties.
With confidence firming, however, payrolls have expanded by 1¼ million in the first half of 2004
and the unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in the second quarter.
Strong productivity growth has also contributed to significant improvements in corporate and
financial balance sheets. A sharp rebound in operating profits and relatively low levels of capital
expenditure have helped elevate the share of after-tax profits in GDP to a post-war high. While
this left the nonfinancial corporate sector in the unusual position of being a net provider of funds
to the rest of the economy, firms have also taken advantage of low interest rates to extend the
maturity of their debt. At the same time, the banking system booked record profits in 2004Q1
and near-record returns on assets.
Year-on-year core CPI inflation rose to almost 2 percent in June, after having fallen to a 40-year
low of around 1 percent in early-2004. The rise reflects a deceleration of deflation in goods
prices as the global recovery has increased costs of raw materials and intermediate inputs, but
also some effect of the depreciation of the dollar. Nonetheless, rapid labor productivity growth
continues to dampen unit labor costs, and service price inflation remains moderate. The passthrough from higher energy prices to non-energy prices has been limited, but higher fuel bills
have lowered discretionary income, dampened aggregate demand, and weighed on the external
trade balance.
Reflecting strong demand and higher import prices, the current account deficit has remained
close to its record high of 5 percent of GDP. Although the dollar has rebounded somewhat in
recent months, it remains some 10 percent in real effective terms below its peak in early 2002.
The depreciation has been almost exclusively against industrial country currencies, while the
dollar’s position against major developing country partners has remained largely unchanged.
The effect of the weaker exchange rate on real net exports, which continued to subtract from
real GDP growth in 2003 and early 2004, has been modest, reflecting the usual lags between
changes in real exchange rates and trade volumes as well as a relatively slow revival of foreign
demand.
Fund staff projects output growth to remain above potential through 2004 and 2005, closing the
output gap by 2006. The baseline forecast is predicated on continued strength in business fixed
investment and an improvement in external demand. This is expected to help offset a slowdown
in consumer demand, following the waning effect of recent tax cuts and a gradual rebound in
the household saving rate, and weaker growth in government expenditure as the fiscal position

-3is improved. Core inflation is expected to remain contained as the Federal Reserve is assumed
to withdraw stimulus broadly in line with current market expectations. The current account
position is anticipated to improve only modestly, with the deficit falling to close to 4 percent of
GDP in 2009 as the lagged effects of dollar depreciation and economic recoveries in partner
countries support net exports.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the economy has shaken off an unprecedented series of adverse
shocks and, with the support of significant monetary and fiscal stimulus that has been injected
since the onset of the downturn, expanded strongly during the past year and is again providing
valuable support to the global economy.
Directors observed that the short-term outlook for the U.S. economy remains relatively
favorable, although subject to some uncertainty. While they acknowledged some downside
risks—such as those related to high energy prices, the low household saving rate, and rapid
recent increases in house prices—many viewed these as balanced by upside risks associated
with rapid productivity growth that has kept price pressures at bay. Looking further ahead,
however, most Directors stressed that continued robust growth of the economy will require
decisive action to strengthen the U.S. fiscal position to avoid a crowding out of investment.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the emphasis that was placed on fiscal
consolidation in the FY 2005 budget. With the recovery now well on track, most Directors
agreed that the pace of deficit reduction projected in the budget over the coming two fiscal
years is appropriate. They noted that sizeable budgetary pressures exist, and underscored the
importance of ensuring that these pressures do not slow the pace of deficit reduction over this
period. Indeed, most Directors also suggested that the likely better-than-expected budget
outcome for the current fiscal year offers an opportunity to strengthen the near-term deficitreduction objective.
Most Directors, however, questioned whether the Administration’s medium-term fiscal
objective—of halving the deficit in five years—is ambitious enough, especially given the
increasing pressure on the Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid programs that is expected
with the retirement of the baby boom generation. While acknowledging that entitlement reform
holds the key to long-run fiscal sustainability, a number of Directors encouraged the authorities
to aim toward bringing the budget back to balance, excluding Social Security, by the end of the
decade, in order to provide greater fiscal room for placing entitlement programs on a sound
financial footing. Directors also re-iterated their longstanding call for the establishment of a clear
long-term fiscal goal, embedded in a credible medium-term fiscal framework, to anchor
expectations and discipline policies.
Directors discussed the role of both expenditure discipline and revenue measures in ensuring
longer-run fiscal sustainability. In this regard, they emphasized the helpful role that could be
played by budget enforcement legislation, and cautioned against exempting tax cuts from the
requirement that expansionary measures be accompanied by offsets to ensure budget
neutrality. Indeed, given the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment considered necessary and the

-4already-ambitious plans for cutting nondefense discretionary spending, most Directors felt that
revenue enhancements should be actively considered. In this regard, it was noted that the focus
might be on policies aimed at broadening and simplifying the tax base to help avoid unwinding
recent cuts in marginal tax rates.
Directors recognized the need to address the severe underfunding of the Social Security and
Medicare systems, noting that delaying reforms would only entail larger and more painful
adjustments later. In this context, a number of Directors agreed that recent proposals to amend
indexation formulas to slow the growth of Social Security benefits merit consideration, but
several cautioned that diverting a portion of the payroll tax into private retirement accounts
would significantly lower fiscal revenues and would have to be coupled with durable steps to
ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Directors observed that the underfunding of the Medicare
system dwarfs that of Social Security, and has increased significantly as a result of the
additional drug benefits introduced last year. Therefore, early steps to contain the growth of
health care outlays are needed.
Directors observed that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), after earlier providing
essential support to the recovery and forestalling fears of deflation, has more recently
appropriately prepared markets for the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Given signs
that the recovery is maturing and labor market conditions are improving, and concerns that
higher energy prices could revive inflation expectations, Directors supported the recent decision
to start removing stimulus. Directors agreed that that there remains scope for a measured
withdrawal of stimulus, with due regard for the pace of economic recovery, but—given the
substantial gap between the current and neutral level of the federal funds rate and the usual
transmission lags—Directors also welcomed recent statements by FOMC members that this
process would not be unduly delayed.
Directors commended the Federal Reserve for its already high level of transparency, noting the
effective manner in which the recent policy shift had been communicated to financial markets.
A number of Directors suggested, however, that there could be merit in further anchoring
market expectations by clarifying the Federal Reserve’s definition of price stability and its
medium-term inflation objective.
Directors reiterated their long-standing concern about the large U.S. current account deficit.
While they acknowledged that the past two years had illustrated the market’s ability to absorb a
significant depreciation of the dollar, the current account deficit is expected to remain large,
leaving the United States highly dependent upon private and official inflows from abroad.
Directors noted that determined efforts to strengthen the U.S. fiscal position would help boost
national saving, avoid an undue burden on investment—both domestically and abroad—and
help achieve an orderly adjustment in resolving global current account imbalances. Directors
also recognized that stronger growth abroad should play an important role in facilitating this
adjustment.
Directors agreed that the banking sector has proven its resilience in recent years and that
measures to strengthen corporate governance have helped increase confidence in market
integrity. They observed that strong fundamentals have left the financial system well prepared

-5for the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Directors also commended the authorities for moving
effectively in response to recent corporate failures. Directors agreed with the authorities’
concerns about the large and increasing share of mortgage-backed securities held by the
government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and supported the Administration’s efforts to
strengthen supervision of these enterprises.
Directors recognized the important role of the United States in providing impetus to the Doha
Round negotiations. They stressed that continued U.S. leadership and commitment to
multilateral approaches to trade liberalization, especially with regard to agriculture, will be
critical to the success of the Round. Directors welcomed recent increases in U.S. official
development assistance (ODA) and progress achieved in implementing the Millennium
Challenge Account. They noted, however, that U.S. ODA remains low as a share of Gross
National Income and encouraged further increases in ODA in coming years.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post
assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with the United States is also available.
