Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Tessa van der Willigen
December 19, 2008
Executive Summary
•

Context and recent developments. Colombia’s growth prospects and financial markets
have been affected by the ongoing turbulence in global markets. CDS spreads and
equity prices have moved broadly in line with the rest of Latin America, while EMBI
and corporate bond spreads have risen more. So far, there have been no disruptions to
debt or interbank markets. External credit lines to domestic financial institutions have
been affected only modestly, although there has been an increase in interest rates.
Risks from increased spillovers from abroad are substantial.

•

Key policy recommendations:
o Further strengthen financial safety nets. There is scope for greater clarity in the
sequencing of actions and definition of responsibilities of different institutions
regarding bank resolution. It would also be desirable to strengthen the deposit
insurance system over the medium term.
o Continue with a flexible monetary policy to maintain the projected path toward a
soft landing. Continued close monitoring of forward-looking indicators of
economic activity and of inflation expectations will be needed to determine the
pace at which monetary policy can ease as headline inflation declines.
o Maintain the fiscal targets currently envisaged for 2009. This will help keep
financing needs low and public debt ratios on a declining path, bolstering
confidence. With revenues likely to be lower than budgeted, some expenditure
reductions may be required, although the fiscal stance would remain expansionary.

•

Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with staff on the importance of strong
financial safety nets. There was also broad agreement on the appropriate stance for
monetary and fiscal policy.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sound economic policies have contributed to strong economic performance in
recent years. Supported by wide-ranging structural reforms, strong macroeconomic policies,
and favorable external conditions,
10
economic growth has picked up

growth has been solid and broad-based,
aided by increased productivity and strong
economic growth in Colombia’s key trading partners.
2.
This performance has been accompanied by a significant reduction in
macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Fiscal discipline and strong economic growth have
contributed to large declines in public debt ratios, which are now close to the average for
emerging market countries with investment grade status. The composition of public debt has
also improved, with a significant reduction in exposure to exchange rate and rollover risks.
External debt has fallen substantially, helping reduce foreign financing needs to modest
levels, and international reserves have increased sharply. Colombia’s flexible exchange rate
regime has enhanced the economy’s resilience to shocks, helping facilitate adjustment to
changes in external conditions. The financial system has accumulated significant buffers,
while foreign participation in financial markets has remained limited. In this context,
Colombia is in a generally strong position to confront the challenges posed by global
economic and financial shocks.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic growth has slowed in 2008 as a result of less buoyant domestic demand
conditions and, more recently, the effects of global shocks. GDP growth declined from
7¼ percent in the second half of 2007 (y/y) to 4 percent in the first half of 2008, reflecting
the effects of monetary tightening to address overheating pressures and the under-execution
of public investment. Weakening commodity prices and world economic activity, as well as
the effects of global financial market turbulence, have also dampened the pace of economic
activity since mid-year. For 2008 as a whole, economic growth is projected at 3½ percent.

As in other countries of the region, higher inflation remains a challenge. Inflation
(y/y) stood at 7¾ percent in November, well above the Banco de la República (BdR)’s
end-year target range of 3½–4½ percent. Overheating pressures are dissipating only slowly,
and the output gap remained positive in the first half of 2008. Nontraded goods inflation—a
good indicator of underlying demand pressures—rose in the first half of this year (Figure 2).
Inflation expectations remain outside the BdR’s medium-term inflation target
(2–4 percent), with survey-based data pointing to expectations for end-2009 inflation of
about 5¼ percent.

Monetary policy has tightened, but fiscal policy remains expansionary. With
additional increases in the policy rate, to 10 percent by mid-2008 (a 400 basis point increase
since April 2006), credit growth has slowed significantly. Despite a mid-year decision to cut
government outlays by about ¼ percent of GDP relative to the original budget, the structural
balance in 2008 has weakened, owing partly to strong growth in primary current expenditures
(Figure 3).
6.
The exchange rate has been highly volatile and rules for foreign exchange (FX)
intervention have undergone frequent modification. The peso appreciated by about
15 percent in real effective terms between end-2007 and mid-June 2008 (Figure 4). Citing
prudential considerations, the BdR stepped up its FX intervention in June, replacing the
US$150 million monthly options-based auctions introduced in March with daily
US$20 million purchases in the spot market. To facilitate sterilization, the BdR raised reserve
requirements on deposits. In June, BdR suspended its automatic FX intervention rule (which
sought to smooth out volatility), as continued implementation of the rule would have forced
the sale of reserves to support the peso. In early October, against the backdrop of a
weakening peso, the BdR suspended its daily purchases of foreign exchange. The automatic
intervention rule was also reintroduced, but with a wider band (5 percent, compared with
2 percent). 1 Since mid-year, the real effective exchange rate has weakened by an estimated
20 percent, reflecting the decline of commodity prices and turbulence in international
financial markets.
1

Under the rule, the BdR places exchange rate options of US$180 million when the 20-day moving average of
the bilateral exchange rate with the U.S. dollar changes by 5 percent or more.

7.
Capital controls were tightened at mid-year, but subsequently eliminated during the
market turbulence of October. Capital controls on non-FDI inflows were imposed in
mid-2007, with an important objective being the reduction of appreciation pressures. The
controls resulted in a decline in foreign borrowing; nevertheless, as other inflows, including
FDI, remained strong, appreciation pressures persisted through mid-2008. In May 2008, the
controls were tightened by imposing a minimum stay for FDI inflows, and an increase in the
unremunerated reserve requirement on portfolio inflows from 40 percent to 50 percent. In
early September, the controls were loosened, and fully eliminated in October.
8.
The effect of the global turbulence on the Colombian financial markets has broadly
followed regional patterns, albeit with some differences. Since mid-September, CDS
spreads and equity prices have generally moved in line with the rest of the region, although
EMBI and corporate bond spreads have risen more (Figure 6). 2 External trade credit lines to
domestic banks have been affected only modestly, although interest rates have risen and
maturities have shortened. Interest rates on long-term domestic debt have also increased
substantially. Interbank and debt markets, however, continue to function normally.

The authorities have acted swiftly to bolster confidence and ensure that the private
sector retains access to credit in the wake of the global crisis. They have secured financing
from multilateral institutions (MDBs) for 2009, which is expected to allow the public sector
to meet its external financing requirements without recourse to market sources. They have
also reaffirmed their commitment to the 2009 fiscal targets to limit financing needs.
Arrangements are being made to line up additional, contingent, financing from MDBs. The
authorities have also secured multilateral financing for the state-owned foreign trade bank
(BANCOLDEX) to provide loans to banks and corporates in the event of disruptions to
external credit lines. As a preventive measure, the BdR has reduced reserve requirements (by
the equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP) and injected liquidity through open market operations.
The monitoring of liquidity by the Financial Sector Superintendency has also intensified.
2

The larger increase in Colombia’s EMBI spread in part reflects the lower duration of its bonds, as increases in
the short end of the yield curve for emerging market sovereign debt have been larger than those at the long end.

Despite the slowdown in economic growth and sharp downward movement of asset
prices, financial soundness indicators remain solid. Although nonperforming loan ratios
(NPLs) have risen—especially for consumer credit—banks are well provisioned and
profitable, and expected default probabilities, while rising, remain very low. There is no
evidence of an extraordinary reduction of activity by subsidiaries of foreign banks, which
account for about 20 percent of banking system assets, compared with 30 percent for the
region as a whole. External credit lines only account for a small share of banking system
liabilities (2½ percent), and reliance on nondeposit funding is moderate, at about 25 percent.

III. OUTLOOK FOR 2009 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
11.
Economic growth is expected to slow in 2009 in the face of harsher external
conditions. Staff projects that growth will decline to 2 percent in 2009, before rebounding to
about 4 percent in 2010 in line with the expected recovery in the global economy. Over the
medium term, staff projects growth at 4½–5 percent, consistent with estimated potential
growth. Inflation is projected to decline to under 5 percent by end-2009, and to gradually
converge to the medium-term target of 2–4 percent. Consistent with the authorities’ mediumterm fiscal projections, the budget deficits would average about 1 percent of GDP over the
next 5 years and public debt would decline to 26 percent of GDP by 2013. The current
account deficit would rise slightly to about 3¼ percent of GDP in 2008–09, before declining
over the medium term as nontraditional exports recover. 3

The difference between the underlying and projected external current account deficit is small. See Appendix I
for details.

12.
Risks to growth are weighted to the downside. The external environment continues to
pose important risks to economic activity. Staff analysis indicates that a shock to global
growth would have a significant effect on the Colombian economy, mainly through its effects
on export growth. A sharp deceleration of growth in Venezuela could also have a significant
impact on economic activity (see paragraph 24), given its substantial share of exports
(17 percent in 2007). A further deepening of global financial turmoil could also result in
additional increases in borrowing costs or disruptions in credit markets, reducing growth.
13.
The inflation forecast is subject to a certain level of uncertainty. High inflation
expectations pose an upside risk. In addition, an adverse outcome from minimum wage
negotiations could increase inflationary pressures. The second-round effects of higher food
and fuel prices increases appear to have been well contained, consistent with Colombia’s
experience under its inflation targeting regime (Box 1). However, the depreciation of the
peso in the second half of 2008 poses a risk through its effects on the prices of tradable
goods. With respect to downside risks, inflation could fall faster than expected if economic
activity or commodity prices were to fall below staff projections.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions centered on the macroeconomic and financial sector risks posed by
global shocks and the appropriate policy responses. Within this context, the dialogue
focused on three related themes: (a) the stability of the financial system; (b) the risks to
external stability in the current global environment; and (c) the policy options for achieving
macroeconomic stability under difficult global conditions.

The second-round effects of food and fuel prices shocks have been well contained. Despite large
increases in food and fuel prices—resulting in higher headline inflation—core inflation has increased
relatively little. Between January 2007 and October 2008, core inflation increased ¾ percentage point,
while food and fuels increased by 7¼ and

The future effect of the exchange rate depreciation on inflation is more uncertain. A BdR study
suggests that the pass-through is small, particularly if the economy is growing below potential—about
20 percent after one year. However, confidence intervals are quite large, which implies significant
risks to the outlook in light of the large depreciation in the second half of 2008.

16

Challenges to financial stability
15.
The financial sector has significant buffers to help resist a worsening of financial
conditions, but risks remain. While financial soundness indicators are strong, NPL ratios
have risen over the past few years, most notably for consumer credit. In light of the
slowdown in economic activity, the authorities agreed that credit risk, especially in
consumer lending—for which the nonperforming loan ratio had reached 7 percent—should
continue to be closely monitored. Staff analysis suggests that real sector developments have
important effects on the health of the financial system. 4 Liquidity ratios in the banking
system, while declining, appear adequate, as short-term assets exceed short-term liabilities
by a healthy margin. The results

solvent under a number of
extreme scenarios, albeit with significant effects on liquidity and bank profitability. 5
Exchange rate risks for the financial system are low, as foreign currency liabilities are small
and there are strict regulations limiting net open foreign exchange positions.
16.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to enhance the financial system’s capacity to
respond to a possible worsening in global conditions. In addition to the reduction in
reserve requirements and the injection of liquidity through open market operations, the
authorities plan to broaden the range of assets that can be used in repo operations,
facilitating the provision of liquidity support. They are also considering requiring banks to
temporarily limit the distribution of dividends to help provide an additional cushion against
unexpected losses.
17.
Staff welcomed the intensification of activities by the Financial Surveillance
Committee. The Committee provides a useful vehicle for coordinating activity across the
financial sector superintendency, the ministry of finance, the BdR, and the deposit insurance
4

See chapter 1 of Selected Issues paper for an assessment of the effects of economic growth and financial
market developments (including those abroad) on the banking sector.

17
agency (FOGAFIN). The work of the Committee in assessing potentially adverse scenarios
and developing contingency plans is especially important, and could be helpful in identifying
areas where further strengthening of financial safety nets is needed. Staff suggested that this
work draw on the BdR’s assessments of alternative macroeconomic scenarios and their
implications for financial stability. The authorities concurred that to assist the development
of contingency plans undertaken by the Financial Surveillance Committee, it would be useful
to clarify the circumstances under which emergency liquidity support would be forthcoming.
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the desirability of further improving financial
sector safety nets. The framework for bank resolution is well established, but there is room
for greater clarity in describing the sequencing of actions and responsibilities of different
institutions to help ensure that the process can be undertaken in a timely manner. Regarding
deposit insurance, a more expedited process for returning funds to depositors, as well as the
elimination of the deductible, would be desirable. Over the longer term, a review of the
coverage of deposit insurance could also be considered. The authorities intend to request
Fund technical assistance in this area.
19.
Staff welcomed other steps to improve the assessment of financial sector risks over
the past year. A quarterly survey of credit conditions has been initiated, and an assessment of
financial risks related to developments in economic activity in Venezuela and the United
States has been undertaken. Looking forward, the authorities agreed that there was scope for
further improvements in reporting risk assessments in the BdR’s financial stability report.
Drawing on the work of the Financial Surveillance Committee, this could include the results
of stress tests encompassing different scenarios affecting international financial markets of
relevance to emerging markets.
20.
The dissemination of information on financial and corporate sector derivative
positions could also be strengthened. The BdR collects data on a daily basis on on-shore
derivative positions of both the financial and corporate sectors, but this information is not
widely circulated or reported. 6 The authorities welcomed staff’s recommendation to include
these data in the BdR’s financial stability reports.
21.
Additional progress has been made in expanding the derivatives markets and
improving the regulatory framework. Interest rate derivatives for five-year government
bonds were introduced in mid-year, and the legal framework governing the regulation and
taxation of derivatives has been strengthened. A reference interest rate, an essential
component for further development of derivatives markets, has also been established.

6

For an overview of recent developments in financial indicators in the corporate sector, see Chapter 2 of the
Selected Issues paper.

18
22.
The authorities have closed fraudulent pyramid schemes. In mid-November, the
government closed the operations of all the major schemes and began a process to liquidate
assets and return the recovered funds to investors. They have also enacted legislation that
strengthens the authorities’ legal powers to proceed swiftly against these illegal operations.
Early estimates suggest that the size of assets controlled by the schemes was less than
½ percent of GDP. The closing of the schemes has had no systemic effect on the financial
system. Nevertheless, the social consequences have been significant, given the large number
of participants involved in these schemes. To help address these social costs, the authorities
have reallocated funds in the 2008 budget toward targeted social spending. They have
indicated that investors that participated in these schemes will not be bailed out.
23.
Staff suggested a more ambitious agenda for financial sector reforms. The
government’s financial sector reform program currently being considered by congress
envisages, inter alia, the development of a multi-tier pension system providing a greater
range of choices to pension plan participants. Staff saw merit in the proposed reforms, but
also recommended broadening their scope to address other longstanding issues in the
financial system, including the need to improve creditor rights and strengthen the
independence of the financial sector superintendent. The authorities pointed out that the
current reform proposal contains a provision for increasing the autonomy of the
Superintendent in the form of assistance for legal costs. They also noted that proposals to
strengthen creditor rights were planned for development at a later stage.
Risks to external stability in the current global environment
24.
Risks to external stability from sudden shifts in the external current account
balance remain important. The current account deficit is projected to remain broadly
constant as a share of GDP in 2008–09, before starting to decline over the medium term.
Export growth has been vigorous in recent years, although it is projected to moderate. Export
receipts, which had benefited from high commodity prices, are projected to soften in the
coming years but could experience large declines if global growth weakened significantly
more than expected. Staff estimated that with a one-standard deviation shock to commodity
prices, the current account deficit would worsen by 2¼ percentage points of GDP. 7
Economic developments in Venezuela—which had grown above trend in recent years—also
remain an important source of uncertainty. Staff estimates that a one standard deviation
negative shock to Venezuelan growth would reduce Colombian exports by ½–1 percentage
point of GDP.
25.
Colombia’s moderate level of vulnerabilities and flexible exchange rate regime
should continue to help offset the risks from unsettled global capital markets. Colombia
compares well with other emerging market countries, including those at investment grade, on
7

The scenario comprises a one-standard deviation reduction in the projected 2009 prices of oil (to about
US$31 per barrel), nickel, and coal.

19
most vulnerability indicators. External financing requirements remain less than half the level
of such countries, while international reserves are large (10 percent of GDP). Rollover risks
and external financing needs for the public sector are low. External gross financing needs of
the private sector are estimated at 4 percent of GDP for 2009, with the financial sector
accounting for about 25 percent of this total. Continued flexibility of the exchange rate
should allow Colombia to adjust rapidly to changing global financial conditions.
Furthermore, under a scenario in which the peso depreciates sharply, external and public debt
burdens would still remain manageable (Tables A.1 and A.2). Stress testing also indicates
that corporate sector balance sheets would be robust to large changes in the exchange rate. 8
Staff analysis suggests that the real exchange rate remains consistent with fundamentals

Box 2. Assessing Colombia’s Exchange Rate
The Colombian peso appreciated
briskly in the first half of 2008, but
since then has reversed course. Over the
first half of 2008, it appreciated by about
15 percent in real terms, based on
differences in consumer price inflation
and exchange rates in Colombia’s trading
partners. Since then, with the decline in
commodity prices and increased global
financial turbulence, the rate has fallen by
about 20 percent in real terms.

From a longer term perspective, most—but not all—measures suggest that the exchange rate
has experienced significant appreciation in recent years. Based on the consumer price based
measure, the real exchange rate, at mid-year, reached nearly its most appreciated level in a decade.
Developments in the unit labor cost-based real exchange rate show a similar trend, and suggest that
the peso appreciated markedly from end-2005 to mid-2008. During this period, fundamentals also

fundamentals since the last CGER estimate in September 2008—when the rate was estimated to be
5 percent over its equilibrium value—staff estimates that the rate is close to its equilibrium value.

Non-FDI outflows could also be higher
than expected in a scenario where risk
aversion toward emerging market assets increases. These risks are offset, to some extent, by
the small foreign participation in financial markets and the cautious baseline forecast, which
already assumes a net outflow.
Policies for achieving macroeconomic stability under difficult global conditions
27.
There was agreement that developments in commodity prices and world growth
were the key channels through which a more adverse global scenario would affect the
economy. A sharp drop in commodity prices and world activity would reduce growth and
place pressure on the banking system’s health. Sizable foreign exchange reserves, combined
with the mobilization of additional multilateral financing under the authorities’ contingency
plan, would provide an important buffer in the case of less favorable conditions in capital
markets.
28.
Staff and the authorities concurred that risks to both growth and inflation should
be considered in determining the appropriate stance for macroeconomic policies. The
uncertain global outlook underscored that policies would need to be flexible to avoid a sharp
reduction in economic activity. At the same time, continued progress in inflation was also
important. Low inflation had been a pillar of Colombia’s macroeconomic stability and has
enabled an investment climate conducive to high rates of capital formation. In this context,
the authorities’ firm resolve to place inflation on a downward path was highly appropriate.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
29.
The mission team supported the monetary policy stance oriented toward guiding the
economy to a soft landing. Staff viewed as appropriate the BdR’s continued close watch of
forward-looking indicators of economic activity and inflation expectations to guide the
course of monetary policy. As inflation and inflation expectations decline, there should be
scope for a gradual reduction in the policy rate or further reduction in reserve requirements.
With substantially weaker commodity prices and global growth, demand pressures were also

22
expected to diminish. Staff and the authorities agreed that this would provide room for
monetary easing to maintain domestic economic activity, provided that the inflation targets
were not put at risk. Continued exchange rate flexibility would also be important to allow the
economy to adjust well to external shocks.
30.
The mission endorsed the authorities’ plan to achieve a gradual reduction in
inflation toward the long-term target range of 2–4 percent. The authorities have announced
a target range of 4½–5½ percent for 2009, and a reduction from 5 percent to 4 percent for the
mid-point of the target range in 2010. Staff viewed these targets as striking the right balance
between achieving an ambitious reduction in inflation and providing a credible downward
path toward the long-term objective.

average over the past two years. Staff
welcomed the widening of the band (from 2 percent to 5 percent) for the automatic
intervention rule. With the wider band, intervention should be triggered only infrequently.
Staff also saw a role for discretionary intervention in the current unsettled environment, but
with a clear view to addressing disorderly conditions. The authorities indicated that FX
intervention in 2008 had been guided by the goal of accumulating international reserves
which, in their view, had not generated uncertainty about the objectives of monetary policy.
32.
Staff encouraged the authorities to study further the effects of pension fund
regulations on the foreign exchange market. Pension funds are active in daily trading in the
exchange rate market. Existing pension fund regulations, which require minimum returns
over a short time period, provide a strong penalty for deviations from average performance in
the industry and encourage herd behavior. Staff argued that this may have contributed to
large and sudden movements of pension fund assets between peso- and foreign-currency
denominated assets, exacerbating volatility. In this context, staff suggested further
examination of the minimum return regulations. Consideration could be given to making
minimum return regulations more flexible by, for example, lengthening the time period
considered for estimating the minimum return. The authorities noted that actual returns in
Colombia had typically been far from those required by minimum return rules, which made it
unlikely that these rules had played a role in exchange rate volatility.

23
33.
The views of staff and the authorities differed on the merits of capital controls and
their effectiveness. Staff’s econometric analysis suggested that the controls—which were in
place from May 2007 through October 2008—had a statistically significant effect on foreign
borrowing. 9 These inflows, however, had been modest in the pre-controls era relative to
other capital flows. 10 The controls were found to have no significant effect on other non-FDI
inflows, and there was no robust evidence that they reduced the sensitivity of the exchange
rate to interest rate differentials. Staff noted that a large share of capital flows had been
excluded from the controls (including portfolio investment by pension funds), which may
have limited their impact. The controls were also associated with a significant increase in
exchange rate volatility. In light of their limited effectiveness and adverse effects on
volatility and asset market development, staff saw significant drawbacks to the controls. The
authorities, however, were of the view that the controls had helped protect financial stability
by preventing a large build-up of foreign-currency debt by the private sector, which could
have generated domestic instability in the context of the global financial crisis. They saw the
controls as a potentially useful tool that could be employed again, if required by
circumstances.
34.
Colombia maintains two exchange measures subject to Article VIII. 11 An exchange
restriction and multiple currency practice arise from a tax on remittances abroad of
nonresident profits earned before 2007 and retained in the country for less than five years.
The Board has approved the retention of this restriction and multiple currency practice until
April 15, 2009. Colombia also maintains an exchange restriction arising from the special
regime for the hydrocarbons sector.
Fiscal policy
35.
The mission team endorsed the authorities’ commitment to maintain the fiscal
targets in the medium-term fiscal plan. The plan envisaged some fiscal stimulus in 2009, but
a broadly neutral stance in 2010 onward. Maintaining the commitment to the deficit targets in
2009 will likely require some reduction in expenditure growth relative to the budget, given
the probability that revenues will be lower than envisaged because of weaker economic
growth and lower commodity prices. The authorities noted that with the increased budget
deficit in 2009, and increase in long-term government bond rates, domestic financing
conditions had tightened considerably, which limited the scope for a more expansionary
policy in the near term. Staff and the authorities agreed that adhering to the deficit target
would assure markets that public debt would continue to decline as a percent of GDP and that
financing needs for the public sector remain modest, helping maintain confidence in
Colombia’s commitment to reducing fiscal vulnerabilities.

During the first four months of 2007—the period of strongest inflows before the implementation of the
controls—net foreign borrowing amounted to about ¾ percentage point of GDP on an annualized basis.

36.
Under a more adverse scenario for growth, the authorities indicated that financing
conditions would continue to be a key factor in determining the fiscal policy stance. Staff’s
analytical work supported this approach, as it indicated that the effects of the fiscal stance on
output were heavily influenced by the impact of fiscal easing on expectations and domestic
interest rates (Box 3). 12 While not ruling out the case for fiscal stimulus under these
circumstances, staff agreed that a cautious approach would remain appropriate.
37.
Medium-term fiscal risks related to the health system and special tax zones should
be carefully assessed. Recent rulings by the constitutional court—requiring important
changes to the structure and coverage of the health system—could have substantial fiscal
costs from 2010 onward. The likely expansion of special tax zones (zonas francas),
following the government decree of 2007, could also lead to a significant loss of revenues
over time. 13 The staff team recommended a careful assessment of these risks, including
consideration of appropriate policy responses to offset their potential impact on the public
finances. The authorities indicated that they remained committed to the medium-term fiscal
targets and stressed that, if necessary, appropriate measures would be adopted to ensure
meeting these targets.
38.
The authorities concurred with the staff suggestion to explore the adoption, over
the medium term, of a fiscal rule to limit the procyclicality of fiscal policy. The rule would
set a floor for the central government structural balance, and could be incorporated into the
existing medium-term fiscal framework, which aims at further reductions in public debt
ratios. By setting a floor for the structural balance, the rule would adjust the nominal deficit
target (as a share of GDP) in light of changing cyclical conditions. This would help
communicate to markets that any weakening of fiscal balances during downturns would be
temporary. Given uncertainties regarding oil revenues, staff suggested that the rule could
focus on establishing a floor for the nonoil structural balance.
39.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reduce the procyclical effects of royalties
on local government expenditures. Local governments had benefited from the increase in oil
prices in recent years through the effect on royalties, and could accrue higher royalty
revenues in the future as hydrocarbons and mining production increase. The proposal
recently submitted to congress—which creates a “rainy day fund” for a share of
hydrocarbons and mining royalties—is a positive step to control the procyclicality of local
government spending over the longer term.

Box 3. Financing Conditions and the Impact of Fiscal Policy
The ability of fiscal policy to stabilize
output, in the face of external shocks,
is dependent on financing conditions.
Simulations from the Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model
developed for Colombia suggest that
the effects on growth of different fiscal
policy responses to an external shock
are linked to underlying financing
conditions. This can be illustrated by
comparing the impact of fiscal policy in
responding to a negative external
demand shock with no changes in
financing conditions against a scenario
in which conditions are tighter.

Fiscal policy is less effective if
financing conditions deteriorate.
Simulations incorporating an increase
in the interest rate risk premia—which
could occur if the expectations of a
higher deficit trigger financing
concerns—suggest that an
accommodative fiscal policy could
potentially be ineffective in stabilizing
output and consumption.

Quarters

1.0

Fiscal policy can contribute to
stabilizing the economy if financing is
not an issue. Based on simulations of
policy responses to an external demand
shock, a cyclically neutral policy, by
letting automatic stabilizers work,
improves the stability of output and
consumption compared to a constant
deficit rule.

Plans for advancing structural fiscal reforms are modest. The government plans to
sell its stake in a major electricity company (ISAGEN) in 2009, as well as smaller regional
electricity companies. The authorities also hope to achieve a further strengthening of tax
administration, which is expected to yield a significant decline in evasion and boost public
revenues.
41.
Staff encouraged the authorities to rejuvenate the agenda of fiscal reform. The
efficiency of the tax system could be improved by phasing out the financial transactions tax,
reducing exemptions and the number of VAT rates, and cutting taxes on labor. The
authorities broadly agreed on the desirability of these reforms. They saw no political scope,
however, for additional tax reform during the remainder of the current administration. On the
expenditure side, the mission team urged the authorities to reduce budget rigidities, such as
revenue earmarking, which continue to hamper fiscal management. The authorities noted that
earlier reforms to pensions and intergovernmental transfers had indirectly helped increase
budget flexibility by restraining spending on some of the largest categories of outlays.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Colombia’s economy has performed well in recent years, but now faces the
challenge of harsher external conditions. Led by private investment, growth exceeded the
average for Latin America in 2005–07. Public debt has declined sharply as a percent of GDP,
aided by high growth and prudent fiscal policies. As in the rest of the region, the pace of
economic activity is expected to moderate in 2009 with the weakening of the global
economic environment. A flexible approach will be required to maintain macroeconomic
stability in the near future.
43.
A review and strengthening of the crisis prevention framework is important in light
of the turmoil in global financial markets. Staff welcomes recent efforts to strengthen
monitoring and financial safety nets, as well as measures to prevent liquidity problems in the
banking system. While financial safety nets in Colombia are generally sound, there is scope
for further strengthening the bank resolution process and deposit insurance system, and to
clarify the circumstances under which emergency liquidity support would be provided.
Recent efforts to expand the assessment of financial sectors risks are welcome, and could be
strengthened further by extending stress testing to a broader range of macroeconomic
scenarios, and to alternative scenarios of global financial conditions.
44.
As in other countries in the region, inflation has risen and remains a policy
challenge. While higher inflation has been led mainly by global shocks to food and fuel
prices, overheating pressures have also played a role. Inflation is projected to exceed the
target in 2008, while inflation expectations remain above the medium-term target. Reducing
inflation will be essential for maintaining an environment in which investment and growth
can flourish in a sustainable manner over the medium term.

27
45.
The Banco de la República’s skillful management of monetary policy is steering the
economy toward a soft landing. Monetary policy has been tightened substantially over the
past 2½ years, and the current policy stance is consistent with a reduction of inflation toward
the medium-term target. Continued close monitoring of forward-looking indicators of
economic activity and of inflation expectations will be needed to determine the pace at which
monetary policy can be eased as headline inflation declines.
46.
The flexible exchange rate regime has helped Colombia maintain external stability.
The real exchange rate is estimated to be consistent with fundamentals. Looking forward, the
exchange rate should continue to be allowed to move flexibly, as this will help Colombia
adjust to changes in the external environment. Greater stability in exchange rate intervention
practices would also strengthen the policy framework. In this context, the reintroduction of
the volatility rule, with a wider band, is welcome. The elimination of capital controls is also a
positive step, given their potentially negative effects on financial sector development and
exchange rate volatility.
47.
Maintaining the fiscal targets incorporated in the medium-term fiscal plan will help
underpin confidence during a period of global turbulence. The plan incorporates some
fiscal stimulus in 2009, but a broadly neutral stance from 2010 onward. Maintaining the
current targets will help assure markets that public debt ratios will continue to decline and
that public financing needs will remain modest. Were growth to turn out much lower than
expected, financing conditions would be a key factor in determining the scope for an easing
of fiscal policy. Over the medium-term, consideration could be given to the adoption of a
fiscal rule to further strengthen the policy framework.
48.
There is scope to strengthen structural reforms. In the financial sector, progress on
expanding the derivatives markets and improving the regulatory framework has continued,
and the proposed development of a multi-tier pension system is welcome. The reform agenda
could nevertheless be further expanded to encompass a strengthening of creditor rights and
greater independence for financial sector supervisors. Further progress in improving the
efficiency of the tax system, and tackling budget rigidities, also remains important.
49.
There have been no changes in Colombia’s exchange measures since the last
Article IV consultation. Staff recommends approval of the retention of the restriction and
multiple currency practice arising from taxing remittances of nonresident profits earned prior
to 2007, given that they are of a temporary nature, maintained for balance of payments
reasons, and non-discriminatory in application. Staff does not recommend approval of the
retention of the restriction derived from the special regime in the hydrocarbons sector, since
there is no timetable for its removal.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus one standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus one standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/2 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2009

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Covers the combined public sector (Non-financial public sector balance plus quasi-fiscal balance of the central bank and costs of financial reestructuring- FOGAFIN and FINAGRO). Debt is measured in gross terms.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Estimating the Underlying External
Current Account Balance for Colombia
Under the 2007 Surveillance Decision, the underlying current balance is defined as the
medium-term level of the current account, stripped of temporary factors influencing the trade
and income balances. The adjustments to the projected current account balance, explained
below, imply an estimated underlying current account deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP for 2008,
compared to a projection of 3.2 percent of GDP. The adjustments are as follows:
¾ Domestic output gap. Domestic output is estimated to be below potential. Closing the
output gap results in higher imports and has, therefore, a direct negative effect on the
trade and current account balances.
¾ Output gap in trading partners. Foreign demand in Colombia’s key trading partners is
estimated to be below potential as a result of the global financial turmoil. Closing the gap
will increase exports and therefore improve the trade and current account balances
relative to the cyclically-unadjusted external balance.
¾ Exports adjusted for commodity prices and the global economic slowdown. Prices for oil
and mineral products (Colombia’s major export commodities) are estimated to be above
their medium-term levels, implying a negative adjustment on the trade and current
account balances. Non-traditional exports are also adjusted in the exercise, as they are
assessed as being temporarily below their long-term level, in part on account of this
year’s temporary trade disruptions with Venezuela.
¾ Exchange rate. The average real effective exchange rate for 2008 is more appreciated
than its long-term level.
¾ Income account. High oil prices and the appreciation of the peso in the first half of 2008
resulted in a high amount of repatriated profits from foreign investment.

Appendix II. Background and Summary of Informational Annexes
Discussions
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bogotá during
October 27–November 7, 2008. The mission met with the Minister of Finance and Public
Credit, Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga; the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República; the
Director of the National Planning Department, Ms. Carolina Rentería; senior staff of several
government ministries and agencies; and representatives of the private sector and a major
labor union. The staff team comprised B. Clements (Head), M. Piñón, L. Abrego, E. Flores,
H. Kamil (all WHD), M. Souto (MCM), and M. Vera-Martin (SPR). Ms. Agudelo (OED)
participated in most meetings.
Fund relations
The last Article IV consultation with Colombia was on January 16, 2008 (IMF Country
Report No. 08/31). Colombia has no outstanding credit from the Fund. An FSAP update was
carried out in September–October 2004 and the FSSA was discussed in April, 2005 (IMF
Country Report No. 05/287). STA and MCM have provided technical assistance since 2005.
Exchange arrangements
Colombia has had a flexible exchange rate regime since September 1999, which is
classified as a managed float. It maintains two exchange measures subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple currency practice and an exchange
restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of nonresident profits earned
before 2007 and that have been retained in the country for less than five years; and
(2) an exchange restriction arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector.
Branches of foreign corporations are required to either surrender their export proceeds
or agree to a government limitation on their access to the foreign exchange market.
While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose surrender requirements and to
exempt the application of those requirements, conditioning such exemptions to the
acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions is inconsistent with
Article VIII, section 2 (a) of the Fund’s Articles.
Statistical issues
The quality of data in Colombia is generally adequate for surveillance. Colombia observes
the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Colombia is availing itself of a flexibility
option on the timeliness of certain production, monetary and external data. A data ROSC was
completed in September 2006 and was subsequently published as IMF Country Report
No. 06/356.

42
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of October 31, 2008, Colombia’s outstanding debt to the IBRD was US$3.6 billion. The
Bank’s portfolio consisted of 19 active projects, with a total undisbursed balance of about
US$0.8 billion. A new Country Partnership Strategy was approved in April 2008.

ANNEX II. COLOMBIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
The World Bank and Colombia’s development strategy 1
Colombia’s National Development Plan is built on five pillars: (i) provide security to all
Colombians; (ii) foster sustainable economic growth and employment generation under
macroeconomic and price stability; (iii) build a more equitable society; and (iv) increase the
transparency and efficiency of the State, and (v) promote environmental sustainability. On
April 8 the new Colombia CPS was taken to the Board. FY08 IBRD lending to Colombia was
US$940 million. In the last few months, the Colombian authorities have requested support for
a large number of initiatives, taking full advantage of the Bank’s array of services. Some of
these are operational in nature, such as technical assistance for liability management, local
finances, pensions and health sector reforms, safety net administration, among others.
IBRD is currently Colombia’s largest single creditor
The World Bank Group and the Government of Colombia have built a productive and dynamic
dialogue on a wide range of development issues and this has led to a strong lending program.
Under each pillar it was agreed that the Bank would provide a flexible menu-based mix of
financial and analytical services tailored to the country’s evolving needs. New frontier products
would also be offered, particularly in the area of financial and risk management.
Colombia's IBRD portfolio consists of 21 operations under implementation with 22 active grants
($46 million). Programmed lending for FY09 is over US$1 billion.
Good cooperation between IBRD and IFC on the growth and PSD agenda.
The central vehicle for IBRD support to the competitiveness agenda has been the Business
Efficiency DPL series. Much of IFC’s country program also revolves around strengthening the
business environment and private sector competitiveness. IBRD reports on infrastructure,
logistics and regional competitiveness, have been complemented by the recent regional Doing
Business report.
Infrastructure. IBRD and IFC are supporting Government policies to improve utility
management, particularly public-private models of service delivery in the water sector, where
IFC is also a potential investor in small and medium sized private operators. IFC and IBRD are
also helping to structure infrastructure concessions, with IFC focusing on private sector
participation and IBRD providing technical assistance to the Government.
Urban Services. IBRD is financing the expansion of Bogotá’s Transmilenio system to five
additional cities, some of whom may be interested in borrowing from IFC or mobilizing market
resources without a central Government guarantee.

Financial Sector

IBRD has supported the Government’s efforts to strengthen the financial sector in multiple
ways, including support to issue and implement a new Capital Markets Law, consolidate
supervision across all financial markets and develop a new financial sector law. To support
country efforts to promote sustainable access to financial services, IBRD produced a study
which investigates Colombia’s relative performance (compared to other LAC countries) in
banking sector finance to SMEs. IBRD is also exploring a potential contingent credit line for
Disaster Risk Management and is collaborating with an inter-agency committee to carry out
simulations of potential financial crises to ensure Government readiness to adequately
manage risks. IFC is evaluating private equity players to identify strong business models that
will generate efficiencies in industries with strong growth potential. IFC will also continue
to focus on capital market development, as well as investment in firms at the pre-IPO stage.

ANNEX III. COLOMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Colombia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC was published in October 2006.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the
national accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial
accounts. Estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approcahes both use 2000
as their base year. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the
System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). The revision of the national accounts’ base
year (announced in December 2006) resulted in step increases in nominal GDP levels of
about 12 percent with respect to the prior official estimates. Most of the revisions reflected
improvements in source data, although methodological improvements regarding GDP
calculations/estimates also affected nominal GDP levels.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of
public revenue, expenditure, and financing data. While significant progress has been made,
there is still a need to improve the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, develop timely and
reliable data on the finances of local governments, and improve monitoring of floating debts.
Data cover the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), but coverage of “above-the-line”
operations of units outside the national administration is not exhaustive due to capacity
constraints.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the
public sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to
compile GFS on accrual and cash bases. The information is sent to the Statistics Department
of the IMF for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
Monthly data have been reported for publication in IFS and annual data for subsectors of
general government on accrual and cash bases have been reported for publication in the 2007
GFS Yearbook, with data up to 2006. Data for the consolidated general government have not
been published yet because of shortcomings in the consolidation process.
Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Superintendency of
Banks and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund
technical assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data
quality, including interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency. The

7
introduction of a new call report form in March 2005 significantly improved the quality of
monetary statistics. In mid-2007, the authorities migrated to the new standardized forms for
reporting to STA monetary data for the central bank (form 1SR) and other depository
corporations (form 2SR). Currently, they are finalizing the migration to the standardized
forms for other financial corporations (form 4SR).
Balance of payments and external debt
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics.
Quarterly data have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in
1998. Balance of payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade
zones. Improved surveys, particularly in the service sector, have enhanced coverage and
consistency and financial account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than
registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE,
develop a methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely
basis. The BdR should reclassify FDI intercompany debt transactions from “other
investment” to FDI and some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust the
related investment income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify
government bonds issued abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by
residents on the secondary market.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics,
External Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Colombia
On January 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Colombia. 1
Background
Colombia’s economy has performed well in recent years. Economic growth in 2006-07
exceeded the regional average by a substantial margin. However, GDP growth slowed to
about 4 percent (y/y) in January-September 2008, reflecting less buoyant domestic demand
conditions and weaker global economic growth.
Colombian financial markets have been affected by the recent global turbulence, although debt
and interbank markets have continued to function normally. Since mid-September 2008,
spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) and equity prices have generally moved in line with the
rest of the region, although EMBI and corporate bond spreads have risen more. External trade
credit lines to domestic banks have been affected only modestly, although interest rates have
risen.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The authorities have acted swiftly to bolster confidence and ensure that the private sector
retains access to credit. They have secured financing from multilateral institutions and private
capital markets for 2009, which will inter alia permit Colombia to meet its public sector external
financing requirements. The monitoring of liquidity has intensified, with frequent contacts with
the banking sector to keep abreast of the latest developments. As a preventive measure, the
Banco de la República (BdR) has also reduced reserve requirements and injected liquidity
through open market operations.
As in other countries in the region, inflation has increased, driven mainly by higher food and
fuel prices, although overheating pressures have also played a role. Nontraded goods
inflation—a good indicator of underlying demand pressures—rose in the first half of the year.
Inflation expectations remain outside the BdR’s medium-term inflation target (2–4 percent).
The peso appreciated by about 15 percent in real effective terms between end-2007 and midJune, but since then it has weakened, reflecting the decline of commodity prices and
turbulence in international financial markets. Citing prudential considerations, the BdR stepped
up its FX intervention in June, replacing the US$150 million monthly options-based auctions
introduced in March with daily US$20 million purchases in the spot market. Against the
backdrop of a weakening peso, the BdR suspended its daily purchases of foreign currency in
early October. It also reinstated the automatic FX intervention rule, which had been suspended
in June. Capital controls, which had been tightened at mid-year, were also eliminated in
October.
Monetary policy was tightened in recent years to lower inflation and bring the growth of
domestic demand to more sustainable levels. The BdR raised its policy interest rate by
400 basis points (to 10 percent) between April 2006 and July 2008 to rein in the growth of
credit and domestic demand. Against this background, credit growth (y/y) slowed from about
35 percent in early 2007 to about 20 percent by September 2008. The policy rate was,
however, lowered by 50 basis points in December 2008 against the backdrop of weakening
global and domestic growth.
Fiscal policy has been expansionary, but public debt has continued to decline. Despite the
mid-year decision to cut government outlays relative to the original budget, the fiscal stance in
2008 has remained expansionary. Nevertheless, strong economic growth over the past few
years has led to a marked reduction of public debt ratios, which are now close to the average
for emerging market economies at investment grade.
Financial soundness indicators remain solid. Although nonperforming loan ratios (NPLs) have
risen—especially for consumer credit—banks are well provisioned and profitable, and
expected default probabilities remain low. There is no evidence of extraordinary reductions of
activity by subsidiaries of foreign banks. External credit lines account for a small share of
banking system liabilities, and reliance on wholesale (nondeposit) financing is also moderate.
Executive Board Assessment

3

Executive Directors commended the Colombian authorities for implementing sound
macroeconomic policies and wide-ranging structural reforms, which had contributed to rapid
growth and reduced vulnerabilities. Directors considered that, with improved economic
fundamentals and a healthy banking system, Colombia is well-placed to confront the
challenges posed by the ongoing global downturn. They emphasized nonetheless the need for
continued flexible and timely policy responses.
Directors considered that the authorities’ fiscal policy appropriately allows for some relaxation
in the budget deficit in the near term, while keeping public debt ratios on a declining path. They
underscored the importance of adhering to the fiscal targets incorporated in the medium-term
fiscal plan, to reassure markets of the authorities’ commitment to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities
further. At the same time, financing conditions would continue to be a key consideration in
determining the scope for additional fiscal easing if economic growth turns out to be weaker
than presently envisaged. Directors suggested that consideration be given to the adoption of a
fiscal rule over the medium term to strengthen the policy framework. They also encouraged the
authorities to further improve the efficiency of the tax system and reduce budget rigidities.
Directors agreed that the monetary policy stance should aim at steering the economy toward a
soft landing. They welcomed the efforts to reduce inflation to its medium-term target. The
recent reduction of interest rates was deemed appropriate in view of the weakening economy.
Going forward, Directors stressed that continued close monitoring of forward-looking indicators
of economic activity and inflation expectations will be necessary to guide the course of
monetary policy.
Directors considered that Colombia’s flexible exchange rate regime has helped maintain
external stability in the face of a rapidly changing external environment. Greater stability in
exchange rate intervention practices would also strengthen the policy framework. In this
regard, Directors welcomed the wider band for the automatic intervention rule, under which
exchange rate intervention would take place less frequently. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ elimination in October 2008 of the capital controls imposed in mid-2007. Noting the
difference in views between the staff and the authorities on the effectiveness and impact of
capital controls in the short run, some Directors considered that capital controls should remain
in the authorities’ toolkit in case the need should arise in the future. A few Directors
encouraged the authorities to remove the exchange restriction arising from the special regime
for the hydrocarbons sector.
Directors noted that the financial sector has significant buffers and that, based on stresstesting undertaken by the authorities, it is expected to remain solvent under a number of
extreme scenarios. They suggested extending stress-testing to a broader range of
macroeconomic and global financial scenarios, and agreed that credit risk should be closely
monitored given the rising nonperforming loan ratios. Directors welcomed recent efforts to

4
strengthen the crisis prevention framework, improvements in financial sector monitoring and
financial safety nets, and measures to help prevent liquidity problems. They saw scope for
further strengthening the bank resolution process and the deposit insurance system, with
technical assistance from the Fund. Greater clarity is also needed with respect to the
circumstances under which emergency liquidity support would be provided.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward with their structural reform agenda. They
welcomed progress in improving the regulatory framework for derivatives, and the proposed
development of a multi-tier pension system. A strengthening of creditor rights and greater
independence for financial sector supervisors remain important priorities.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Colombia
January 14, 2009
1.
This statement reports on developments since the issuance of the staff report for the 2008
Article IV Consultation. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data releases point to a continued economic slowdown, consistent with staff
projections.

•

Real GDP growth declined to 3.1 percent (y/y) in the third quarter, driven mainly by
weaker domestic demand. Recent figures on industrial production and retail sales are
also consistent with the further slowdown envisaged by staff for the fourth quarter.
We are keeping our GDP growth estimates unchanged, both for 2008 and 2009.

•

Headline inflation was 7.7 percent (y/y) in December, slightly above the staff
forecast, owing largely to higher food prices.

3.
Declining oil prices are leading to a widening of the external current account deficit.
The current account deficit is now expected to be 3½ percent of GDP in 2008 and 3½–4 percent
of GDP in 2009. Additional public sector external borrowing is expected to help finance the
larger deficit in 2009.
4.
The authorities eased monetary policy in late December. The Banco de la República
reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points (to 9.5 percent), citing the continued weakening of
economic activity and improved inflation expectations.
5.
The authorities have recently indicated that they will allow some further easing of
fiscal policy in 2009. The target for the overall deficit of the combined public sector will now be
about ½ percent of GDP higher than envisaged in the budget. The authorities have reiterated their
commitment to their medium-term fiscal targets, and staff continues to project that public debt
will decline steadily as a ratio of GDP.
6.
Colombia has taken advantage of improved global financial conditions to tap
international capital markets. Following the recent decline in sovereign bond spreads, in early
January the government placed US$1 billion (½ percent of GDP) in 10-year bonds, at a yield of
7½ percent. Financial conditions have also improved in the domestic markets, with long-term
government bond rates having declined by about 250 basis points between early November 2008
and early January.

Statement by María Inés Agudelo on Colombia
January 14, 2009
I thank staff for the interesting and helpful discussions during the mission and for an accurate
report. My authorities appreciate the advice provided, take serious consideration of the
recommendations and value the in-depth analysis and conclusions of the selected issues paper.
Several years of strong economic performance, progress in structural reforms and improvement
in the security situation give the country support to face the current international financial and
economic crisis. Staff and the authorities coincide, in general, with the medium-term outlook and
with the policy options to face a less favorable economic environment. Equally, they agree with
the identified risks and the restrictions they inflict.
To understand the recent dynamics of the Colombian economy, it is essential to remember that
the concerns, one year ago, were the risks posed by a dynamic economic activity that was
considered above potential. Signs of overheating were pushing the authorities to take action to
ensure a soft landing. In fact, during the first part of 2008, previous policy decisions on the
monetary and fiscal fronts were already doing their job and economic growth was reduced to
levels more consistent with potential, expecting that for the medium term economic growth will
be more at the 5-5.5 percent range.
The international financial crisis and its effect on the global economic growth will put pressure
on an already weak domestic demand. In addition to a tight monetary policy, a reduced
disposable income, as a result of fuel and food prices increases, and low levels of public
investment have induced a reduction on growth of domestic demand. In addition, exports of
Colombian goods and services to Venezuela are lower now. On the supply side, nearly every
economic activity has been affected, with industrial production now in the negative side and with
weak commercial activity. As a result, after a record year of economic growth in 2007 of almost
8 percent, economic activity dropped to just 3 ½ percent in 2008 and it is expected to be below
that this year.
Fiscal policy
The 2008 fiscal deficit is expected to remain at 0.8 percent of GDP, the initial target set by the
government. Although income revenues were significantly lower than originally planned, the
government announced, in mid-year, expenditure cuts, committing to the targets set in the
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework and keeping public debt in a downward trend. Gross public
debt was reduced to just above 30 percent of GDP from over 40 percent five years ago.
Budget discussions for this year were driven by the idea of reducing further public debt and
keeping fiscal deficit at about 1.2 percent of GDP. However, the government is facing now a
significant reduction of revenues due to lower economic activity and, recently, it announced a
further cut in expenditures to partially compensate the revenue loss.
My authorities agree with staff that under a more adverse growth scenario, financing conditions

2

would be determinant to allow for a larger fiscal deficit. In that sense, the government gives
serious consideration to a well-functioning domestic public debt market, to the dynamics of
interest rates and to the avoidance of any potential crowding out of the private sector. In
particular, the authorities do not want to put pressure on scarce financial sector resources and
wish to limit the willingness of banks to finance the public sector over the private sector.
Fortunately, international markets are still open and Colombia successfully issued a new bond for
one billion dollars during the first week of this year. As a result, the fiscal deficit will increase by
½ percentage point of GDP financed externally.
One final consideration on fiscal policy. Although Colombia has improved substantially its
fundamentals and the country faces the global crisis with a strong foot, the possibility of having a
“fiscal package” is limited. With a lower than expected economic growth, the government has to
concentrate on finding resources to fill the gap left by revenue losses, leaving no room for being
active on public expenditure. In other words, only automatic stabilizers can operate and only up
to a point. In fact, box 3 of the staff report gives good support to the fact that only when
financing is not an issue, fiscal policy can contribute to stabilize the economy. Under the current
circumstances, liquidity restrictions and the lack of resources in global markets might be a real
issue, limiting the possibility for a country like Colombia to have an active anti-cyclical fiscal
policy.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
My monetary authorities agree with the assessment and recommendations made by staff with
respect to monetary policy. I only want to add at this point that after a long period of monetary
tightening during which the central bank increased its interest rate by 400 basis points, at the
December meeting the rate was reduced by 50 basis points.
Since April 2006, monetary tightening was driven by the need to reduce pressures coming from
domestic demand, to reduce credit growth and to limit second round effects of food and fuel
prices. The current and expected external and domestic conditions give today room for a
relaxation of monetary policy and for a change in the policy stance. Global inflation is coming
down, domestic and external demand are weak and long-term interest rates and expectations are
lower. In addition, for the last couple of years, the central bank has explicitly taken decisions to
accumulate international reserves and, as a result, today the country has a comfortable level of
international reserves at 10 percent of GDP.
At the Board discussion last year, we agreed with staff that capital controls should be temporary,
given that in the long term they are ineffective and that financial markets and stock markets are
negatively affected. During 2008, capital controls were removed.
My authorities are not completely satisfied with the main conclusions of the paper on capital
controls, as support for “main drawbacks” are not warranted. I want to highlight the fact that
although the evidence suggests that capital controls did not successfully affect capital flows (even
if it reduced inflows of foreign borrowing) nor the level of the exchange rate, the association with
an increase in volatility is not clear and the evidence to support this conclusion is weak. The fact

3

is that exchange rate volatility is higher in Colombia than in any other country in Latin America,
even during the very recent period of depreciation and appreciation of the exchange rate when
capital controls where not in place. Staff points out that portfolio investment of Colombian
pension funds might play a role, but further work in this area is needed.
In addition, measures taken to limit capital inflows into the country are part of a larger package
with the aim of securing financial stability and reducing vulnerabilities to foreign exchange risks.
We have to remember that at the same time other measures were taken (for example, limits on
derivative positions). My authorities have made it clear that reducing balance sheet effects
coming from exposure to foreign currencies was one of the objectives of the whole package of
the measures taken. In fact, the observed reduction of external debt gave them comfort. Today
the banking and the corporate sector are less vulnerable to the external markets lack of liquidity.
The authorities response to the appreciation of the peso during the last years finds support in the
deep believe that an economy, the size and characteristics of Colombia, is too vulnerable to the
dynamics of external capital flows and to large swings of the exchange rate.
The complete package of policies in this front included, in addition, an increase in reserve
requirements on bank deposits. Under large capital inflows, there was a real need to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy. The evidence of the staff paper might suggest this objective
was also achieved.
Financial sector
My authorities share the assessment of staff on financial sector issues. The Colombian financial
sector has sound indicators and stress tests show that they might remain adequate even under
extreme circumstances. The liquidity at the inter-bank market has been working steadily without
interruptions and deposits keep growing. My authorities concur with the main recommendations
for further financial sector reforms and they are currently discussing with Congress some of these
issues.
Risks
With strong financial markets and the correct macroeconomic policies, the Colombian economy
should be well placed to weather the current global difficulties. However, risks in the external
front are important and may challenge the current solidity of the economy. While my authorities
are particularly concerned with expectations on economic growth of our main commercial
partners (US, Venezuela and Ecuador) and the effect of reduced oil prices on our neighbors’
economy, the baseline scenario is already introducing harder external conditions. In any case,
they are ready to adjust economic policies according to evolving circumstances while remaining
committed to long-term sustainability.
