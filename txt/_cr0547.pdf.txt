The Kyrgyz Republic accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in 1995
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, other than restrictions for security reasons, which the
authorities will soon notify to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

•

In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation on February 20, 2003, Directors commended
the authorities’ prudent monetary and fiscal policies, noting that growth had reduced poverty,
particularly in rural areas. The managed float exchange rate policy had been successful. The
external debt strategy was on track, and in this context Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue their fiscal consolidation. They pointed to a likely decline in gold exports and the
need to diversify the economy by strengthening the business environment, and emphasized
this would require redoubling efforts to reduce corruption and improve governance, as well
as reforms to improve tax administration. The fifth review under the Kyrgyz Republic’s PRGFsupported program was completed on a lapse of time basis in June 2004.

•

Relations with the IMF and World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II and recent IMF
technical assistance is described in Appendix III. The periodicity, availability, and quality of
economic statistics are satisfactory and are discussed in Appendix IV. Annex I presents the
staff’s debt sustainability analysis. An updated Fiscal Transparency ROSC is provided in

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Kyrgyz Republic faced severe macroeconomic imbalances following the 1998
Russian financial crisis. Disciplined policies during the current PRGF arrangement brought
about a successful stabilization in 2001–03. Growth has strengthened and become more
broad-based, inflation is low, and poverty rates have declined substantially. Heavy external
borrowing in the 1990s and export growth far below projections created unsustainable
external public debt levels, which the present PRGF-supported program has helped to reduce.
Nevertheless, the debt burden remains among the country’s key macroeconomic challenges,
along with the need to diversify the gold-dominated export structure. Staff simulations
indicate a need for further Paris Club debt relief.
Discussions focused on the economic outlook and medium-term challenges. With
continued sound macroeconomic policies and effective structural reforms, annual real growth
of 5 to 6 percent appears likely, supported by good growth prospects among key trade
partners. The authorities stressed the large shadow economy as the main development
concern. The staff also stressed corruption and weak governance as contributors to informal
activity and as key impediments to investment.
The medium-term fiscal strategy balances the spending needs associated with the
Millennium Development Goals against the constraints imposed by high external debt.
There was broad agreement on the desired pace of fiscal consolidation—including bringing
the state government fiscal deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP by 2007—and that scope existed to
reduce certain tax rates. Views within the government diverged as to whether and how
quickly the staff’s proposed payroll tax rate reductions could be implemented. The agreed
fiscal path incorporates additional poverty and related spending (largely on investments) in
the next five years, financed with proceeds from government shares in Centerra (owner of the
Kumtor gold mine) without compromising the previously envisaged debt path.
Rapid remonetization of the economy is among the main recent macroeconomic
achievements. Real money demand has grown at annual rates of about 20 percent since
2001. The staff and authorities agreed that the managed float exchange rate regime has
worked well for the country. The staff emphasized that price stability should remain the main
objective of monetary policy and that the level of international reserves provided scope to deemphasize the further accumulation of reserves in the medium-term. The high rate of private
sector credit growth and its potential impact on loan portfolios was seen as a medium-term
risk facing the financial sector. It called for strengthening bank supervision and safeguarding
central bank independence.
The staff’s Ex Post Assessment concludes that program implementation was uneven in
the past but has improved significantly during the present PRGF arrangement. The
reform agenda remains challenging and a low-access PRGF arrangement would be
appropriate to support the government’s reform efforts.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Kyrgyz Republic faced severe macroeconomic imbalances following the
1998 Russian financial crisis. In 1998-99, growth slowed, exports contracted by a quarter,
and the som depreciated by 60 percent against the U.S. dollar, exposing vulnerabilities
stemming from the rapid external borrowing begun in the 1990s. After an initially inadequate
policy response, macroeconomic policies and performance began to improve; however, the
sharp increase in the ratio of debt service to fiscal revenues—from 14 percent in 1997 to over
a third in 2000—strained the budget and brought to the forefront concerns over external debt
sustainability.1
2.
Disciplined economic policies during the current PRGF arrangement underpin
the successful macroeconomic stabilization in 2001-03. Program ownership and
policymaking capacity strengthened, as reflected in the timely completion of all program
reviews so far.2 The lynchpin of the strategy (IMF Country Report No. 01/223) was the
recognition that the debt overhang fundamentally constrained policies and required a multiyear fiscal consolidation. This was to be achieved principally by strengthening tax collection
and streamlining the externally financed public investment program (PIP).

Monetary policy contained inflation to 4 percent on average in 2001–03—compared to
21 percent in 1998–2000—helping to stabilize the nominal and real effective exchange rates
while fostering an environment more conducive to private investment. In 2003, per capita
GDP was 36 percent higher than in 2000 and the poverty rate had declined from 52 to
41 percent. In key areas, outcomes were better than envisaged when the PRGF-supported
program was approved.

The final program review is expected to be completed in early 2005. Tentative information
suggests that all September 2004 performance criteria have been observed.

Growth has become more broad-based. Real growth outside the volatile gold and
energy sectors has averaged 5 percent since 2000, with strong growth in manufacturing
industries such as food processing, textiles, and glass production. Productivity improvements
(including greater capacity utilization) have contributed more to growth than has
employment growth or capital accumulation. However, there are indications that new
investment has been a significant factor supporting the 7 percent growth in JanuarySeptember 2004.

External current account deficits have moderated, despite recent rapid import
growth.3 An improved external macroeconomic environment has contributed to an average
9 percent export volume growth in 2002–03. High growth in China, Kazakhstan, and Russia
supported Kyrgyz exports, while gold exports recovered from the low 2002 levels that

resulted from the Kumtor mine accident. In 2003, gold accounted for 14 percent of GDP and
44 percent of merchandise exports, partly reflecting higher world market prices. Electricity
exports remained well below peak levels, but tourism and other services exports have been
strong. High import volume growth mainly reflects strong domestic demand, but also
increased oil prices and improved customs statistics.
5.
During 2001–03, external public debt fell from 111 to 94 percent of GDP.4
Progress under the authorities’ external debt strategy owes much to fiscal consolidation. The
general government fiscal deficit, which consistently had been above 9 percent of GDP from
1996–2000, was reduced to an average of 5 percent of GDP in 2001–2003. Tax revenue
performance improved, owing mainly to better administration. State government collections
rose 2½ percentage points during 2000–03, to 14.3 percent of GDP. At the same time,
improved tax administration helped to maintain payroll tax collections despite a 4 percentage
point rate reduction in 2002. The two tax steps taken in 2003—extending the VAT to
agriculture and introducing a new real property tax—faced strong political resistance and
their revenue impact remained marginal.
6.
Expenditure policy contained total expenditures while gradually allocating
higher shares to social and poverty-related areas. Social spending (including education,
health, social security and welfare, and pensions) rose from an average 12 percent of GDP in
2000-01 to 14 percent in 2002-03. Overall pension increases outpaced nominal GDP growth
during this period and much higher percentage increases were targeted at poor pensioners,
helping to alleviate poverty among the elderly. The government wage bill rose from
5.1 percent of GDP in 2000 to 6.8 percent in 2003, mainly because of increases in the lowwage health and education sectors.
7.
Progress was made in strengthening fiscal institutions. The annual rolling threeyear fiscal framework has improved fiscal transparency, expenditure planning and
expenditure execution, although weaknesses remain in the areas of commitment control and
arrears tracking.5 The computerization of the treasury, with IMF and World Bank technical
assistance, was begun in 2003 and is progressing broadly according to schedule. However, it
is expected to help substantially improve public expenditure management only in 2007. The
August 2003 restructuring of the large taxpayer unit is expected to strengthen implementation
of self assessment and enforcement. Customs modernization and computerization was
implemented in 2004, assisted by the AsDB and USAID, and a new Customs Code takes
effect in January 2005.

Debt management has strengthened in recent years, reflecting greater attention to debt
issues on the part of staff and the authorities and the presence of an IMF-supported resident
advisor (Appendix III).

Financial Sector Developments
8.
Commercial banks continue to dominate financial intermediation. Following the
Kairat Bank privatization in June 2004, the Savings and Settlement Company (SSC)
(operating as a narrow bank) is the only state-owned bank among the 20 banks in the
country. Recently, foreign investment has shaped the landscape of commercial banking. At
end-June 2004, seven foreign-owned banks accounted for half of bank loans and deposits,
compared to five banks with 2 percent of loans and 21 percent of deposits at end-2001.
9.
The financial market remains shallow. Both money and credit relative to GDP are
low, even by CIS standards. However, financial soundness indicators suggest a slowly

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
Discussions focused on the macroeconomic outlook and medium-term policy
challenges and strategy. Specific attention was placed on external debt dynamics,
conditions for private investment, and the ways and means of reducing the share of the
shadow economy.

- 10 -

A. Economic Outlook
11.
The staff’s medium-term baseline scenario assumes continued sound
macroeconomic policies and continued implementation of structural reforms. This
would support real growth rates of 5 to 6 percent in the medium-term, including in 2005
despite a decline in gold exports. The overall fiscal deficit would decline gradually, from
5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3¾ percent in 2007, helping to reduce the external debt
overhang. Monetary policy would contain inflation to about 4 percent.
12.
A favorable external environment is envisaged for the next few years. Strong
growth prospects among key trade partners6 and gradually improving market access for
Kyrgyz goods and services is expected to underlie buoyant external demand. However,

external current account deficits would increase until 2006, reflecting continued high
domestic demand growth and new investments in gold projects. The scenario assumes that
donors would fill the balance of payments financing gaps of 2½ to 3 percent of GDP
beginning in 2005. This could include further Paris Club debt relief in early 2005. Overall,
this baseline is broadly consistent with the authorities’ recent PRSP annual progress report
(IMF Country Report No. 04/200). Beyond 2007 the economy faces significant uncertainty
with the expected decline of gold exports, emphasizing the need for export diversification.
13.
Three key risks to this macroeconomic scenario were identified. First, a
substantial negative terms of trade shock—such as from a protracted period of high oil prices
or a drop in gold prices—could lead to lower growth and higher inflation. Second, a sharp
slowdown in partner countries’ demand for Kyrgyz exports—apart from slowing growth—
could weaken the exchange rate and external debt ratios. Third, a loss of confidence in the
banking system—such as could result if high rates of credit growth lead to weak loan

portfolios and individual bank failures—could worsen the investment climate and reverse the
shift away from the shadow economy.
B. Ex Post Assessment
14.
The Kyrgyz authorities assessed positively past cooperation with the Fund and
welcomed the main conclusions of the EPA, but felt the EPA could have highlighted
more the achievements of the 1990s. They stressed the Fund’s role in identifying a proper
policy course and in building policymaking and technical capacity, including through
technical assistance. Close cooperation with the Fund had helped to develop a consistent
framework for macroeconomic policies and established a dialogue among key policy makers.
The authorities recognized that a challenging reform agenda remains in front of them and
agreed on the need to broaden support for their economic program, including by clearly
articulating to the public the rationale for the government’s strategy. The EPA concludes that
a low access PRGF arrangement would be an appropriate means of IMF involvement over
the next few years. Other highlights of the EPA discussion are presented in Box 1.
15.
The EPA concludes that Fund-provided technical assistance has been well
received by the authorities. Nevertheless, more “hands-on” assistance and, in certain areas,
more systematic follow-up and monitoring of TA recommendations would be desirable. In
statistics, recent TA missions have noted substantial progress in implementing earlier
recommendations. Other areas with strong progress include treasury and customs
modernization (paragraph 7), external debt monitoring, and the restructuring of debt between
the NBKR and the Ministry of Finance. Important steps have been taken in response to TA in
the areas of tax policy and tax administration, although overall effectiveness in these areas
has been mixed. For example, while the authorities recognized the quality of assistance on
the agricultural VAT, that TA remains ineffective because of strong opposition to the policy.
C. Policy Challenges and the Strategy Ahead
16.
The staff and the authorities agreed on the key aspects of the medium-term
macroeconomic strategy. During the last few years, the strategy has faced three major
challenges, which continue to shape the policy landscape. As noted also in the EPA, the first
challenge has been the high level of public external debt, which called for continuous
fiscal adjustment and more cautious foreign borrowing.7 Government net borrowing
during 2001–03 amounted to $177 million compared to $404 million during the previous
three-year period. The authorities agreed that even with further Paris Club debt relief in 2005,
the fiscal consolidation would need to continue in order to ensure that debt sustainability is
achieved during this decade. However, it was also recognized that the pace of fiscal
adjustment could slow somewhat as the recent sale of part of the government ownership in

Box 1. Highlights of the Ex Post Assessment (EPA)
The EPA draws attention to past policy implementation that often raised questions about program
ownership. Successful periods were followed by relapses and, too often, reforms implemented on paper
but not in practice. Tackling problems through issuance of presidential decrees, government resolutions,
and legislative amendments does not bring results if enforcement is neglected, the EPA concludes. The
authorities agreed that implementation had been a problem in the past, but the performance has improved
and weaknesses in policy execution was a common feature in all CIS countries.
The key message of the EPA is the need to close this “implementation gap” to sustain success. A
professional civil service that is granted the necessary authority while also being held accountable for its
actions is critical to developing strong public administration. This will need to be accompanied by
reductions in corruption—and in the public’s perception of corruption—to garner public support for
reforms. Efforts to increase the transparency of government operations are important to help generate the
dynamic investment climate needed for growth and poverty reduction. Interestingly, the authorities felt
that, with the benefit of hindsight, governance reforms should have been included in donor-supported
programs at an earlier stage.
The EPA underscores the vulnerability resulting from high external debt, concluding that a
concessional bilateral debt restructuring would improve the prospects for medium-term
sustainability. Ensuring debt sustainability would also require a continued shift toward grant financing.
The government’s responsibility in this respect is to continue fiscal consolidation. Explicit limits on new
concessional borrowing should be considered. In this context, the authorities stressed inadequate donor
coordination as a factor contributing to external debt accumulation in the mid- to late-1990s. External
borrowing from official sources sometimes overwhelmed the capacity for its effective, well-governed
use.
The EPA concludes that a low access PRGF arrangement would be an appropriate means of IMF
involvement over the next few years. It notes that although the country does not face a large balance of
payments need, further Paris Club debt relief is essential to establishing debt sustainability, and that an
IMF-supported program is an important complement to such debt relief.

17.
The second challenge has been the prospect of declining gold production.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s view that, under these circumstances, export
diversification is crucial not only to offset the negative impact on real incomes but also to
avoid the re-emergence of spiraling external debt ratios. It was noted with satisfaction that
8

By 2007, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 3.7 percent of GDP,
0.8 percentage point higher than in the authorities’ last PRSP update. The case for the
Kyrgyz fiscal adjustment was discussed in IMF Country Report No. 04/200.

- 13 -

in 2002–03 non-gold, non-energy exports (in U.S. dollars) were about one third higher than
in 2000–01 on average. The key for further broadening the export base is preserving external
competitiveness through low inflation and strong productivity growth, to maintain
competitive unit labor costs. The major trading partners—Kazakhstan and Russia—are
resource rich countries and therefore likely to appreciate their real exchange rates in the
medium term, allowing a good opportunity for the Kyrgyz Republic to preserve its current
advantage in relative labor cost levels. To fully utilize this competitive edge, regional trade
restrictions will need to be reduced further. To foster productivity growth, governance reform
has to accelerate, corruption must be reduced, and the energy sector’s quasi-fiscal deficit has
to decline significantly to accelerate enterprise restructuring.
18.
The third challenge discussed was the constraint on domestic savings, and thus
investment, caused by high poverty and weak institutions. Although private savings show
some signs of recovery, to increase national savings requires higher public savings.
Promoting private savings requires solid growth of real incomes, building up trust in banks,
and reducing the size of the informal economy thus bringing about a more efficient use of
funds currently under the mattresses. Regarding private investment, apart from
macroeconomic stability, several structural reforms are needed to improve the investment
climate as also forcefully pointed out in the staff’s EPA (Box 2).
19.
In the discussions, the authorities stressed the large share of the shadow
economy as the main development concern, which they linked to high taxation driving
enterprises underground. The mission agreed and pointed out that the tax code reform
under discussion should significantly simplify taxation to make it less intrusive. At the same
time, some tax rates—notably the payroll tax rate—are highly punitive, and should be
reduced. However, a significant reduction in the payroll tax rate requires compensating for
the revenue loss by broadening the tax base, improving compliance, strengthening the
performance of other taxes, and restraining expenditures, the staff emphasized.
20.
The staff noted that corruption and poor governance are also important
contributing factors to the growth of the informal economy (Box 3). Recent research
provides ample evidence of the strong link between the relative size of the shadow economy
and poor governance. Tax and governance reforms would provide an incentive for businesses
to formalize their operations. This would boost productivity as enterprises could better
exploit economies of scale and draw on better functioning market institutions for more
efficient services delivery. Thus, to reduce the size of the shadow economy—apart from
taxation—future policies should reduce the regulatory burden, improve governance and
lessen corruption.

- 14 -

Box 2. Determinants of Private Investment
Strong and sustained economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic requires higher private investment ratios in
coming years. Private investment averaged 12 percent of GDP in 2002–03—well below other CIS countries.
Continued macroeconomic stability will be critical to enhance growth and profit prospects and to reduce the
cost of financing to stimulate private investment. This, however, must be complemented by reforms in the
tax regime, the financial infrastructure, and governance. A simple tax system with minimal exemptions and
clear rules can accelerate investment while ensuring tax compliance. Such a regime also limits tax
inspectors’ discretion, reducing corruption and improving governance in general. The expected Tax Code
revisions—the harmonization of existing laws and new small business taxation scheme—are important in
this respect.
Further development of the financial infrastructure is needed to enhance access to financial services and
mobilize savings for private investment. Despite the ongoing remonetization, the Kyrgyz financial system
remains underdeveloped, with the ratio of private credit to GDP of only 4 percent—much lower than in other
countries in the region. Recent entries of foreign banks are a positive development, but further financial
sector reforms are necessary to improve access to finance. Examples of areas to be addressed include
enterprise accounting reform, land registration and title, the development of auditing capacity, and the
framework for property and creditor rights.
Good governance is at the center of a supportive investment climate. An efficient regulatory framework,
control of corruption, strong corporate governance, transparency, and accountability of public administration
are essential parts of a growth-enhancing investment environment. A proper regulatory framework calls for
minimal interference in private business operations, simple business registration procedures, strong contract
enforcement, effective property rights, and efficient bankruptcy procedures. Weak contract enforcement is
among the most frequently cited investment obstacles in the Kyrgyz Republic. Debt dispute resolution
requires over 492 days, compared to 304 days average for the region.1 The cost of debt resolution is also high
at 48 percent of per capita income—compared to the 18 percent regional average.

Box 3. The Kyrgyz Shadow Economy
The shadow economy consists of untaxed
economic activity—legal and illegal—that
would be taxable if reported. While difficult
to measure, studies suggest that in 2000 the
Kyrgyz shadow economy comprised about
40 percent of official GDP, about 5
percentage points higher than in the mid1990s. As cash dominates informal
transactions, the rapidly rising cash-to-GDP
ratio since 2000 suggests that the shadow
economy has expanded more rapidly than
the formal economy in recent years, despite
structural reforms and the successful
macroeconomic stabilization. This suggests
that official measures may underestimate
economic growth in recent years.
Key factors affecting the size of the shadow
economy are high taxes (especially payroll
taxes), excessive government controls, and
poor governance. These are all areas where
international comparisons indicate that the
Kyrgyz Republic could do better.

Fiscal Policy
21.
The staff stressed that the
medium-term fiscal strategy must
balance the spending requirements
of meeting the Millennium
Development Goals against the
constraints imposed by high
external debt.9 This tradeoff has been
at the crux of economic strategy for
the past three years and the recent
receipt of $84 million (4 percent of
GDP) in proceeds from the Kumtor
financial restructuring allows the
objectives to be addressed more
urgently while maintaining the

previously envisaged debt path. The staff has suggested to increase annual spending (relative
to the previous baseline) for the next five years, to be used for poverty related expenditures
(mainly on health and education investments), and discussions on this issue continue.
22.
While there was broad agreement on the desired pace of fiscal consolidation,
views on some tax policy issues diverged within the government. Both the staff and
authorities felt that, following the rapid improvement in 2001-03, the ratio of general
government tax revenues to GDP could remain at about 18 percent over the next few years.
However, the staff stressed that an additional revenue effort could free further resources for
poverty reduction and help to reduce the ratio of debt to tax revenue, an important indicator
of debt sustainability. A gradual broadening of the tax base and improved tax administration
would allow the reduction of certain tax rates. The broadening of the tax base would include
fully implementing the personal property tax and the application of the normal VAT regime
to large-scale agriculture—measures adopted by parliament in 2003 that remain ineffective.
The staff and the Ministry of Finance favored gradually eliminating distortionary production
taxes and cutting several percentage points from the payroll tax—which, at 33 percent,
provides disincentives to formal hiring and full wage reporting. Social Fund officials,
however, opposed reducing the payroll tax. Also, deep-rooted opposition has developed in
some agencies and parliament to the personal property tax and the removal of the VAT
exemption for agriculture.
23.
The staff supported efforts underway to remove tax code inconsistencies and
ambiguities developed as a result of successive tax code revisions over the past several
years. The authorities began a review of the tax code in early 2004 that drew on expertise
from both inside and outside the government, including the IMF Legal Department, USAID,
and the Moscow-based Institute for Economies in Transition. The staff also supported the
authorities’ work in revamping small business taxation and recommended eliminating the
present patent taxes and the realignment of the VAT and small business tax thresholds. These
reforms, and particularly the small business tax reform, are intended to reduce discretion and
discrimination in the tax system as a means to limit the scope for corruption.
24.
Achieving the fiscal consolidation path articulated by the Government also
requires containing state government expenditures while ensuring adequate public
investment and social spending. The authorities welcomed staff suggestions to continue
reorienting spending toward durable reductions in poverty, in line with the PRSP and MTFF.
Increased social spending in recent years has been driven by current spending (e.g., wages
and pensions), while capital spending was held to more moderate levels. Looking forward,
this reorientation would be reflected partly in higher health and education investments and
other poverty-related spending of ¾ percent of GDP annually. However, staff stressed that
this additional spending should not lead to permanent expenditure increases and that budget
planning must take account of the recurrent maintenance costs associated with higher
investment. Key officials also emphasized a need for further increases in the overall public
sector wage bill, citing the need to strengthen the quality of public services and reduce
incentives for corruption. The staff saw merit in further, appropriately targeted increases and
encouraged the Government to reform, in the medium-term, the civil service and its pay

- 17 -

structure so that key personnel can be provided with merit-based and more competitive
salaries. Following such a catch-up, real wage increases could be modest—below the real
GDP growth rate—leading to a gradual decline in the wage bill relative to GDP. Continued
streamlining of the foreign-financed public investment program was seen as important, both
because of the external debt strategy and to help control recurrent maintenance costs, where
bottlenecks have appeared. On pension policy, the staff recommended that real benefits
increase by 2–3 percent a year. Key Social Fund officials considered this insufficient.
The 2005 Budget
25.
The authorities were committed to minimizing the influence of election-related
pressures on the 2005 budget. The staff noted that sales proceeds from the sale of Centerra
shares turned out higher than anticipated. This windfall gain provided some room for fiscal
flexibility without increasing external debt provided that sales receipt will be allocated to
investments and one-time projects to avoid permanent expenditure increases. The
government will submit to parliament revisions to the 2005 budget in early November and is
in discussions with the staff regarding the size of the 2005 deficit. The key issue is whether—
in light of the higher sales receipt from Centerra shares—the state budget fiscal deficit could
be kept at the 2004 level (4.4 percent of GDP) instead of 4.0 percent as recommended during
the August mission. In any event, the government intends to reduce the use of foreign
borrowing to finance the budget from 4.9 percent of GDP to 3.5 percent, as targeted earlier.
26.
The staff broadly supported the President’s call for a socially-oriented budget
and encouraged the authorities to draw on their PRSP update and medium-term fiscal
framework. Higher health and education sector wages (a 15 percent increase in 2005) and
investments were a component of this vision. These wage increases are another open issue
under discussion with the staff. A supplement to this staff report will be issued before the
Board meeting on the results of these discussions.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
27.
Rapid remonetization of the economy is among the main recent macroeconomic
achievements. With steady economic growth and low inflation, real money demand
expanded by 20 percent on average in 2002–03, a trend that has continued so far in 2004.
Higher money demand has been met primarily by balance of payments inflows, rather than
by expanding the domestic component of the money supply.10 Indeed, the NBKR’s gross
official reserves rose to the equivalent of 4.7 months of imports at end-June 2004, from
3.8 months at end-2001.

10

With the NBKR prohibited from lending to the government and with its credit windows for
commercial banks limited to liquidity management, the domestic component of monetary
expansion remained small.

- 18 -

28.
The authorities were satisfied with the managed float exchange rate regime. The
staff agreed and emphasized that price stability should remain the main objective of
monetary policy and, in this context, noted that the NBKR should be more willing to let the
nominal exchange rate appreciate.11 The authorities also expressed interest in moving to
inflation-targeting in the medium-term. This was a reasonable goal, in the staff’s view, but
the preconditions for such a regime remained distant, given unstable monetary transmission
mechanisms and the current macroeconomic modeling capacity. There was broad agreement
that the level of international reserves provided scope to de-emphasize the further buildup of
reserves in the medium-term. The staff observed that financial intermediation remained
relatively shallow, making it difficult for the NBKR to manage banking system liquidity.
With a view to facilitating monetary management, the staff and authorities explored means of
deepening the government securities market.12
29.
The staff saw the high rate of private sector credit growth and its potential
impact on loan portfolios as a key medium-term risk facing the financial sector. The
authorities emphasized that the stock of credit was relatively low, but they recognized the
need for increased vigilance and effective monitoring of individual banks. The authorities
and staff shared the view to a large extent that high credit growth reflected the desired
remonetization of the economy. Recent experience in many other transition economies with
high credit growth was instructive in this respect. However, it was agreed that the NBKR
should strengthen bank supervision to safeguard against the vulnerabilities presented by the
rapid credit growth. In this context the staff stressed the importance of strengthening the
independence of the NBKR and its bank supervision department and encouraged the
Government and parliament to fully support these efforts. The staff welcomed the
authorities’ openness to foreign participation in the banking system, which was bringing
additional competition and expertise and had resulted in a broader range of banking services
and lower interest rates. Nevertheless, extensive foreign participation presented a new
challenge to the supervisory authorities, and the staff recommended they seek close
cooperation with their counterpart foreign supervisors.13

11

Staff stressed that exchange rate flexibility would also help to ensure borrowers’ and
lenders’ awareness of exchange rate risk.

12

In the staff’s view, a deeper government securities market could provide banks with liquid
collateral and an alternative asset management tool. This would also help establish a
benchmark short-term yield curve and foster the interbank market to support the development
of a secondary market. The September 2004 MFD mission recommended actions in this area.

13

Foreign-owned banks, mainly Kazakh, accounted for 60 percent of banking sector assets
(and about half of loans and deposits) as of mid-2004.

- 19 -

E. External Policies
30.
The staff presented various debt scenarios that indicate a need for further Paris
Club debt relief (Annex I). Staff simulations suggest that an improvement in debt indicators
to sustainable levels is feasible, although external obligations will remain burdensome. Paris
Club debt relief on Houston terms would temporarily alleviate the debt problem, but only a
concessional restructuring would improve debt indicators permanently. As suggested by the
stress tests, however, debt sustainability would remain vulnerable to shocks.
31.
The staff welcomed the Kyrgyz Republic’s liberal trade regime, marked by few
non-tariff barriers, low import tariffs, and comprehensive WTO tariff bindings.14 The
authorities noted that the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) provided for a common
external tariff (CET) by 2005, but that provisions allowed EAEC members to postpone
implementation. About one-third of Kyrgyz MFN tariff rates were in line with the present
CET, with about half below. Some counterparts expected that the CET may need to change
prior to the WTO accession of Russia and other EAEC members. The authorities appreciated
that the Fund’s bilateral and multilateral surveillance had begun highlighting the negative
impact of industrial countries’ trade restrictions on low-income countries and urged the Fund
to do more in this respect.
32.
The authorities welcomed recent steps by neighboring countries to improve
market access and the transit of Kyrgyz goods. However, they stressed that important
restrictions remained, including local taxes and fees imposed in Kazakhstan on road transit
and the uncertainty of an agreement on rail transit.
F. Structural Policies
33.
A comprehensive structural reform agenda is being implemented mainly under
the lending programs of the Fund, World Bank, and AsDB.15 In addition to fiscal and
banking sector reforms, the discussions focused on the electricity sector quasi-fiscal deficit
(QFD), which was 12 percent of GDP in 2002, and governance.16 On the former, the
authorities noted that they had met their 2003 and June 2004 QFD reduction targets, mainly
14

The authorities reported a simple average import tariff of 5.1 percent, with 42 percent of
tariff lines carrying zero duties and other “bands” at 5, 10, 12, and 15 percent (excluding
higher seasonal rates on refined sugar). They indicated that all tariff lines are bound in the
WTO at rates of 15 percent or less (except refined sugar, with a 30 percent bound rate), with
applied rates on many products below the bound rates.

15

Apart from the energy sector reforms, the World Bank currently has a comprehensive
agenda under its Governance Structural Adjustment Credit. The AsDB has focused on
corporate governance, financial market development, and customs reform.

16

Reliable data on the stock of liabilities related to quasi-fiscal deficits are not available.

- 20 -

through improved collections. They reiterated their commitment to broadly halve the
electricity sector QFD by 2006 and supported the present Fund monitoring framework and
the use of semi-annual QFD targets. The staff urged the authorities to work closely with the
World Bank in devising and implementing the specific tariff, bill collection, and management
measures needed to meet this goal. The planned further reduction of the QFD by about
3 percentage points of GDP would accelerate enterprise restructuring and improve financial
discipline more generally, yielding important macroeconomic benefits.17
34.
In the financial sector, the authorities were satisfied that most 2003 FSAP
recommendations on legal and regulatory reforms have been implemented. They
regretted, however, that amendments proposed by the NBKR on the legislative framework
for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), with IMF
technical assistance, had not yet passed parliament. Aspects of the June 2003 Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations are reflected in the AML law that was
submitted to parliament during 2004. Legislative amendments have been drafted that aim to
remove conflicts between banking and other legislation and to avoid the introduction of such
inconsistencies in the future. A new Law on Bank Bankruptcy and Conservatorship has taken
effect, but amendments to certain other laws are needed before it can be implemented
effectively.
35.
Regarding governance, the staff regretted that establishment of the National
Integrity Council in 2003 has not yet led to concrete governance reforms. Initial efforts
to develop the agenda lacked tangible measures and a clear time schedule. On the other hand,
a major step in the mining sector is the increased transparency resulting from the adoption of
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), spearheaded under the Fundsupported program and being implemented with World Bank and DFID assistance. More
generally, the staff noted that many specific governance policies were outside the Fund’s
competence and that further steps would need to be taken under the guidance of the World
Bank and other development institutions and donors. The Fund would focus on fiscal and
financial sector reforms, and in other areas only if they had a significant macroeconomic
impact (e.g., electricity sector QFD). The authorities, however, urged that the Fund remain
engaged on a broad front, noting that the public attached particular significance to the Fund’s
endorsement of and engagement with the reforms.
G. Statistical and Other Issues
36.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s economic statistics are adequate for effective
surveillance. The authorities subscribed to the Fund’s SDDS effective February 2004 and a
17

The QFD is monitored under the Fund’s PRGF-supported program, but the World Bank
leads in the provision of policy advice affecting tariffs, collections, and losses. However,
reforms under the World Bank Consolidated Structural Adjustment Credit have stalled
recently.

- 21 -

Data ROSC module was published in November 2003. Nevertheless, methodological
improvements are ongoing. The NBKR’s official balance of payments is being revised to
incorporate newly available data on migrants’ transfers, estimated at 5 percent of GDP in
2003, and the staff has revised its BOP estimates accordingly.
37.
The authorities are requesting an extension of the PRGF arrangement (Attachment II)
to allow for the disbursement of rephased amounts that would follow the completion of the
sixth review under the PRGF.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The Kyrgyz Republic has achieved strong economic performance over the past
few years, reflecting a generally favorable external economic environment and prudent
fiscal and monetary policies. Economic growth has begun to broaden, inflation has
remained low, and the balance of payments has strengthened. This performance has
contributed to strong real income growth and declining poverty. With continued prudent
macroeconomic policies and further structural reform, the country’s medium-term economic
outlook is positive. Nevertheless—as the accompanying Ex Post Assessment stresses—a
successor PRGF arrangement and further Paris Club debt relief are needed to continue the
recent favorable developments.
39.
Economic policymaking strengthened under the present three-year PRGF
arrangement. The staff notes the authorities’ good record of responding to Fund policy
advice, particularly regarding improved fiscal discipline. Strengthened administration has led
to better tax compliance, while expenditure growth has been contained and spending has
increasingly focused on social priorities. Steady improvements in the three-year mediumterm fiscal frameworks underlie strengthened fiscal planning and discipline and have helped
line ministries to better understand budgetary tradeoffs. However, spending controls require
further attention, as government decisions have sometimes overruled the Ministry of Finance
efforts to keep expenditures on the budgeted track.
40.
The staff supports the authorities’ revised spending plans to address urgent
social needs. These plans mainly reflect higher-than-anticipated receipts from the sale of
Centerra gold company shares. Under the revised spending plans, fiscal deficits over the next
few years would be somewhat higher than previously foreseen, but without implying
additional borrowing. The authorities should work closely with the World Bank to ensure
that additional spending is targeted at high quality social sector investments and one-time
poverty alleviation projects because of the temporary nature of Centerra proceeds. While
there is some risk that the receipts would be inefficiently used or inappropriately targeted, on
balance the staff feels that the urgency of spending needs and the authorities’ improving
capacity to plan and efficiently implement spending justify accepting this risk. External
budget financing should be contained in the future and consideration given to setting explicit
limits also on concessional borrowing.

- 22 -

41.
With the size of the shadow economy a growing concern, payroll tax rate
reductions should begin with the 2005 budget. The staff welcomes the steps toward
overhauling the tax code and, in particular, small business taxation. The authorities should
swiftly complete the process, in line with staff recommendations, and bring the changes into
effect with the 2005 budget. In light of the external debt burden and social spending
priorities, the authorities should view the projected path of tax revenues as a minimum. The
staff urges additional efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax administration, leading
to a gradual rise in the ratio of tax revenues to GDP.
42.
The NBKR’s sound monetary policy is a key factor behind the country’s
sustained macroeconomic stability, having facilitated the rapid remonetization of the
economy while achieving price stability. Nevertheless, high rates of private sector credit
growth—albeit from a low level—need to be monitored carefully for their impact on the
quality of banks’ loan portfolios. Financial sector indicators do not indicate any immediate
banking vulnerabilities at present, but the NBKR must be prepared to act quickly should
pressures emerge. Therefore, further strengthening of bank supervision will be important and
the Government and Parliament should support the NBKR’s effective independence in this
respect. The increasing role of foreign banks is an overall benefit to the economy but presents
additional challenges to banking supervision, requiring enhanced cooperation with foreign
counterparts.
43.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s managed float exchange rate regime remains
appropriate. Facing strong demand, the som has strengthened but, as inflation continues to
be several percentage points below that in partner countries, the real effective exchange rate
has remained stable. Other indicators such as unit labor costs also suggest that
competitiveness remains adequate.
44.
The authorities should approach structural reforms with renewed vigor. The
period leading up to the 2005 elections has been marked by increasing reluctance to
implement reforms despite earlier commitments, in particular in the energy sector
restructuring. Governance measures should be more concrete. At the same time, all public
policy decisions must consider the implications for corruption and governance, minimizing
opportunities for public officials to exercise undue discretion. This includes areas such as tax
policy, tax administration, public procurement, economic regulation, privatization, and the
management of public enterprises. These are critical concerns of domestic and foreign
investors.
45.
The staff believes that a robust successor PRGF program is needed to support
the government’s reform effort. It would provide the basis for further Paris Club debt relief
and help mobilize the grants needed to meet poverty alleviation goals, while moving toward
debt sustainability. A low-access PRGF appears to be the most appropriate vehicle for close
IMF involvement over the next few years as the country, because of its recent
macroeconomic achievements, does not face a large balance of payments need. The Fund’s
major role would be to help ensure that the government continues with recent policies
conducive to consolidation of a stable macroeconomic environment. At the same time, such

- 23 -

involvement would reassure the international community and foreign investors that the
country is on the right track.
46.
The staff supports the authorities’ request to extend the PRGF arrangement and
welcomes their consent to publish this Article IV staff report and related documents. It
is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the July
2002 decision on consultation cycles.

Update to the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
2001 Fiscal Transparency Module
This update on developments since the March 2002 Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes-Fiscal Transparency was prepared on the basis of information provided by the Kyrgyz
authorities. For a full description of institutions and practices, it should be read in
conjunction with the original report.1 The recommendations in the original report remain
valid except where noted below.
The authorities have regularized financial relations between the National Bank of the
Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Drawing on MFD
technical assistance, a scheme to restructure NBKR-held government bonds was developed,
under which both government deposits at NBKR and NBKR claims on government carry
positive interest rates. The decree clarifying relations between the MOF and NBKR took
effect on June 21, 2002.2
Some progress was achieved toward reducing the commercial activities of ministries.
The president has issued a decree initiating work towards transferring all obligatory
payments (or “special means”) to the budget. An inter-ministerial working group was
established to review and reform the obligatory payments system. A new regulation expected
to take effect in late 2004 would require that license fees, fines, penalties and other
obligatory payments received by ministries and government agencies be processed directly
through the treasury system and credited to the single treasury account. As an intermediate
measure, license fees collected by six ministries and agencies have been directly credited to
the budget since 2003. The process is expected to be completed by 2006. In accordance with
the Law on the Republican Budget, all “special means” revenues and the expenditures they
finance are shown as separate items in the respective republican budget and local budgets.
Since 2002, the Central Treasury holds a separate account at NBKR (and transit accounts at
agent banks for the regional offices of the treasury) for “special means” that are not yet
credited to the Treasury Single Account to manage operations under “special means.”
A new tax code is expected to enter into force in January 2005, drawing on technical
assistance from the Fund (LEG) and other entities. A high-level commission was created
in January 2004 to draft the new tax code, with a view to removing internal inconsistencies

and ambiguous expressions, and to expanding the coverage of the code to include all tax
regulations. An initial draft new tax code prepared by the commission in May 2004, with
assistance from international experts mainly through USAID was posted on the web for
public comments. The final draft will be submitted to parliament in October 2004.
Four large extra-budgetary funds are gradually integrated into the Treasury system,
following the government action plan approved in June 2004. The Economic
Development Fund was integrated in July 2004. The State Reserve Fund will be integrated
by the end of 2004 and the State Property Fund by mid-2005. All the necessary documents
have been signed that would reorganize the Enterprises Support Fund as a joint stock
company in 2005.
The Treasury modernization project supported by the World Bank Governance
Technical Assistance Credit is underway and is expected to be completed by 2007. The
regulatory framework and manuals for treasury operations have been developed. Due to
delays with the tender process for selecting a consulting firm for design of the automated
treasury management system (ATMS), it is now expected that the system will not be
implemented before the summer of 2005.
Pending the full automation of the Treasury system, the cash forecasting function of the
Treasury has been improved and a manual commitment control and arrears tracking
system has been put in place. A cash forecasting unit was created within the Central
Treasury in 2003. The manual control system established in 2003 was significantly improved
in 2004 with the introduction of systematic reporting from budget institutions. The
Regulation for Drafting and Approving the Financial Plan for Central Government Budget
Expenditures, approved in April 2003, guides the preparation of monthly cash flow forecasts
and financial plans for central government budget expenditures.
Significant improvements were made by the government in the publication of fiscal
information. Following the Regulation on the Central Treasury, a monthly budget
implementation report is available on the MOF website.3 The National Statistics Committee
(NSC) subsequently publishes this information in its monthly statistical bulletin. The
quarterly bulletin published monthly by the MOF since 2003 discusses issues related to
budget preparation and execution and includes information on government debt. The bulletin
is published within three months after the end of the quarter, and is available on the MOF
website as well as in paper copies.4 The MOF reports data on government debt (also

Preliminary information on budget execution is placed on the MOF website by the 10th of
the following month. Once numbers are reconciled with revenue agencies, the final report
will be place on the website (after the 20th of the following month).

available on the MOF website) to NBKR and NSC, which subsequently include it in their
reports. The Chamber of Accounts audits budget execution and publishes an annual report
(reports for 2001 and 2002 are available on the Government website). A three-year rolling
medium term budget framework (see below), updated annually and available on the MOF
website, includes detailed technical notes on assumptions underlying budget preparation and
planning.
The budget planning process has improved significantly with the annual publication,
beginning in 2003, of rolling three-year medium-term budget frameworks (MTBFs).
Although much remains to be done, the MTBF and attached technical notes, which covers
the Social Fund and the public investment program (PIP), specify macroeconomic
assumptions and the overall fiscal framework that underlies the annual budget preparation. It
also helps to operationalize the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) by
prioritizing and sequencing the stated objectives. Monthly budget execution reports with
detailed analyses are provided to main legislative and executive offices for use in decision
making. Although all extra-budgetary funds, except the Social Fund, will be integrated into
the Treasury system by mid-2005, other issues related to the coverage of the annual budget
documents remain.
Little progress has been made to improve the reporting of the government quasi-fiscal
activities. While this was identified as one of the important steps to improve transparency
and clarify the role of the government vis-à-vis the rest of the economy, government quasifiscal activities remain unreported in the budget documents. Publication of the electricity
sector quasi-fiscal deficit in the MOF quarterly bulletin is a welcome exception.

ANNEX I

SUSTAINABILITY OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC’S PUBLIC EXTERNAL DEBT1
Background
1.
The stock of the Kyrgyz Republic’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt
amounted to $1,790 million (94 percent of GDP) at end-2003. Of this debt, 68 percent
was owed to IFIs and 32 percent to bilaterals. The World Bank was the largest multilateral
creditor, followed by the Asian Development Bank and the IMF. Japan and Russia accounted
for 71 percent of the bilateral debt. Because of the high concessionality of the IFI loans, in
present value terms (PV), 56 percent of the debt was multilateral and 44 percent bilateral
(Table 1). The lower concessionality of the bilateral debt implies that any Paris Club debt
relief has a much larger impact on debt sustainability than judged on the basis of absolute
debt values.
2.
While the debt situation has improved since the Paris Club flow rescheduling in
March 2001, it remained unsustainable at end-2003. Net foreign borrowing slowed
considerably—to $177 million in 2001-03, compared to $404 million in 1998-2000. Debt
ratios improved because of stronger export performance since 2000—the PV debt-to-exports
ratio fell by 14 percentage points between 2001 and 2003, to 205 percent. The PV debt
relative to government revenue fell from 480 percent at end-2001 to 380 percent at end-2003.
Rising tax revenue explains the improvement--the state tax revenue-to-GDP ratio increased
from 12.4 percent of GDP in 2001 to 14.3 percent in 2003. Debt service ratios were brought
down significantly with the 2002 Paris Club flow reschedulings.
3.
Fiscal consolidation has been the key component of the Kyrgyz debt reduction
strategy. Earlier, large fiscal deficits financed through external loans contributed to an
unsustainable external position. Between 2000 and 2003, however, the primary fiscal deficit
declined by 3 percentage points of GDP, to 3.7 percent, as borrowing under the PIP and
program loans slowed.

1

The Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt is defined as public and publicly guaranteed debt to
non-residents. The analysis excludes private sector debt, including the Kumtor gold mine
debt, amounting to about 10 percent of GDP at end-2003. The Kumtor debt was included in
public debt in earlier simulations as the state-owned KyrgyzAltyn owned 66 percent of the
mine. Now the Kumtor gold mine is owned by Centerra company which is listed in the
Toronto Stock Exchange and only 20 percent of its shares are held by KyrgyzAltyn.

4.
The assumptions underlying the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) reflect the
staff’s latest projections and are broadly consistent with the authorities’ National
Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) progress report of June 2004. Real GDP is projected
to increase by about 5 percent a year in the medium and long term. Export volumes are
anticipated to grow by about 5 ½ percent a year during 2005-10, and 3-3 ½ percent a year
thereafter, compared to annual growth of 7.5 percent in 2001–04. This slowdown reflects the
declining trend in gold production. Import volumes are expected to grow at an average
annual rate of 5 ¾ percent in 2005-10 but slow to 3 ½ percent in outer years. These
assumptions imply a current account deficit of about 4 percent of GDP during the average
year. Growth in the CIS area is assumed at 4 ½ percent per year and in the OECD countries
at just over 3 percent per year. It is presumed that the real effective exchange rate would
remain broadly constant.
5.
The DSA has four components: (1) a medium-term baseline scenario, which
assumes no further Paris Club debt relief; (2) a scenario with a second flow rescheduling on
Houston terms; (3) a scenario with a debt stock operation under Naples terms;2 and (4) a set
of stress tests around the debt stock relief scenario, exploring the robustness of debt
sustainability to alternative macroeconomic assumptions.
6.
The analysis is based on loan specific CIRRs and exchange rates which are
incorporated into the Debt-Pro debt analysis program.3 The loan-specific approach is
2
3

The Paris Club treatments are computed to be effective as of December 2004.

At end-2003, the CIRR for the U.S. dollar denominated loans was 4.5 percent and the
U.S. dollar exchange rate against the SDR was 1.49.

- 40 -

ANNEX I

important in the Kyrgyz case because a significant part of the bilateral debt is in other
currencies than the U.S. dollar. The Fund’s low-income country template does not provide
sufficient degree of detail in this respect. An additional benefit from using the Debt-Pro
template together with the low-income country template, is that alternative Paris Club debt
treatments can be simulated. Stress tests are run with the Fund’s low-income country
template against the baseline which is close to the Debt-Pro baseline.4 The som-U.S. dollar
exchange rate and nominal rates to other currencies are assumed constant.
7.
The simulations suggest that without further debt rescheduling, debt service
relative to fiscal revenue would rise to levels beyond those before the 2002 Paris Club
flow rescheduling. Such a high debt service requirement would risk the onset of a debt
default as allocating on average 25 percent of fiscal revenue to debt service in 2005–07
would unduly compress the government wage bill, investment, and social spending.
Continuing with Houston terms would relieve the liquidity constraint temporarily—but
without resolving the solvency problem, as called for under the Paris Club Evian approach.5
Although the debt-to-fiscal revenue ratio could become manageable by mid-2010s, the debtto-exports ratio would remain high. As an illustration, the PV debt-to-exports ratio would
only temporarily fall under the threshold used in assessing the HIPC countries debt
sustainability.
8.
The simulations suggest that during the next twenty years, debt sustainability
(using the HIPC thresholds as a yardstick) could be achieved only through a
concessional debt stock operation. With a Paris Club stock operation under Naples terms,
the PV debt-to-exports ratio would stabilize at 120-130 starting in 2008. The PV debt-tofiscal revenue would decline below 250 percent in 2009 and continue to fall thereafter even
with a conservative assumption that state tax revenue relative to GDP would increase only
from 15 percent of GDP in 2004 to 16 percent by 2010 and stay at that level thereafter.
9.
In the simulations, the long-run debt sustainability is very sensitive to the
financing pattern of the balance of payments. The simulations assume that the financing
gaps of the balance of payments would be filled on concessional terms until 2008, half on
concessional and half on market terms in 2008–15, and two-thirds on market terms after
2015. Under these assumptions, although the solvency ratios would decline to sustainable
levels under the Naples terms debt relief, debt service becomes increasingly expensive.
4

Debt service ratios are identical and the small differences in the debt-to-export ratios mainly
reflect the measurement of debt relative to the current years exports in the Fund low-income
template as opposed to the three-year average exports in the Debt Pro framework.

5

Debt service ratios would rise abruptly at the end of a Houston flow rescheduling unless a
subsequent rescheduling was agreed (in which case the debt service-to-revenue ratio would
remain below 20 percent). The simulations suggest that a Houston rescheduling would not
keep the NPV debt-export ratio below the 150 percent benchmark.

- 41 -

ANNEX I

Assuming that 20 percent debt service ratios are manageable, this benchmark (relative to
fiscal revenue) would not be exceeded before 2018, however.

Stress Tests
10.
The stress tests assume that key macroeconomic variables are at their recent
historical averages, or below them by a factor reflecting their historical volatility
(Table 3). Historical averages and standard deviations are computed for 1997–2003.

11.
The simulations suggest that debt sustainability remains vulnerable to
macroeconomic shocks. The medium-term debt dynamics are highly sensitive to current
account performance, in particular to export growth assumptions. With key macro variables
at their historical levels—which are significantly worse than in recent years--the PV debt-toexports ratio could be more than 100 percentage points higher than in the baseline simulation
at the end of this decade. This reflects the larger current account deficit than currently
projected, and thus, a return to higher foreign borrowing. Consequently, by 2010, the ratio of
debt service-to-exports would be 7 percentage points higher (at 18 percent) than in the
baseline.
12.
A sudden negative shock to exports which would keep the export values
permanently at a lower level—such as an increase in trade restrictions or a loss of
important market shares—would also undermine the efforts to achieve debt
sustainability during this decade. On the other hand, non-debt creating capital inflows
(mainly foreign direct investment) are projected so low (about 2 percent of GDP) that
possible disappointments in this area have little impact to debt sustainability.

APPENDIX II

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of September 2004)
On May 15, 2003, the World Bank Boards of Directors endorsed a Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) FY 03–06 for the World Bank Group based on the Kyrgyz Government’s
National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which aims at assisting the authorities in
capitalizing major reforms to date while maintaining a reform and growth course, which will
both reduce poverty and enhance prospects for debt sustainability.
International Development Association (IDA). Between 1992 and 2004, IDA has approved
29 credits and 2 grants totaling approximately $658 million (after cancellations), of which
about $517 million has been disbursed. Six structural adjustment credits have already been
completed, which provided quick disbursing support for the Government’s economic reform
programs in privatization, enterprise restructuring, agricultural policy, financial sector, public
sector resource management, and pension reform. Seven investment operations have also
been completed, supporting reform and rehabilitation of the telecommunication sector, social
safety nets, health, rural finance, private enterprises, and livestock development.
The active portfolio includes 17 operations:
•

A balance of payments support operation (Consolidation Structural Adjustment
Credit, CSAC), assisting with reforms in the power and gas sector and improvements
to the business environment (reducing the cost on business from licensing and
inspections). The first tranche of the CSAC was disbursed at the end of 2000 and the
second at the end of 2001. Because of luck of progress in energy reform
implementation, the disbursement of the third tranche has been delayed. Therefore, at
the request of the Government, the closing date of the credit was extended to
December 31, 2004.

•

A balance of payments support operation (Governance Structural Adjustment Credit,
GSAC) and accompanying Governance Technical Adjustment Credit (GTAC),
supporting the Government’s efforts to strengthen the governance framework. The
first tranche of GSAC was disbursed in June 2003.

•

Two operations supporting energy sector rehabilitation and reform (Power and
District Heating and a Technical Assistance Credit, supporting the CSAC program).

•

Six operations supporting provision of key public goods and reform in agriculture
(irrigation rehabilitation, flood emergency, on-farm irrigation, rural finance,
agricultural support services, and real estate and land registration—the latter also
provides the basis for the introduction of a tax of non-movable property in rural and
urban areas).

•

An operation supporting capacity building in the financial and banking system.

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

•

A second health sector operation continuing support for sectoral restructuring and the
authorities’ reform program.

•

A rural water supply and sanitation operation (approved together with the CAS
Progress Report).

•

An urban transport operation.

•

A community driven development (CDD) initiative to support the above-mentioned
activities (Village Investment Project), designed to empower village comminutes to
identify and implement high priority investments and infrastructure needed to
facilitate local enterprise and thereby generate local employment and growth.

The World Bank Group’s operational objectives for the next 12 months are to support the
ongoing structural reforms in energy, the business environment, the banking sector,
governance, public expenditure management, intergovernmental finance, pension system and
social protection, health, water and sanitation, and agriculture, and to enhance the portfolio
performance. It will continue providing the Government with economic sector work and
assisting it with capacity building. In this endeavor, the Bank has recently delivered Public
Expenditure Review, Poverty Assessment, Financial Sector Assessment, Country
Procurement Assessment, and Country Financial Accountability Assessment reports. The
World Bank Group has also delivered a Governance Survey, a Mining Strategy Paper, and
engaged in an active dialogue on energy, health, and pension policies. The Bank is in the
process of finalizing a Country Economic Memorandum on Growth and Trade.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). IFC strategy focuses on institution and capacity
building through investment and technical assistance, that will promote private sector
development, especially SMEs, and support the transformation into a market based economy.
IFC’s portfolio has grown steadily to $17.8 million ( as of September 2004). Building upon
IFC's initial investment in the financial sector, the Demir Kyrgyz International Bank, IFC has
played an instrumental role in the establishment of the largest bank in the country, the
Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank, with a $1.4 million equity investment. IFC developed a
strategic partnership with FINCA by investing $1.0 million in a fund to support
microenterprises. This investment was accompanied by technical assistance to FINCA to
facilitate its transformation and to the government in developing the appropriate regulatory
framework. IFC has also provided technical assistance to review and develop the legal and
regulatory framework for leasing. The largest investment in the existing portfolio is the
Kumtor gold mine, with additional investments in a packaging plant (Altyn-Ajydar). In 2002,
under the Small Enterprise Fund (SEF) procedure, IFC has disbursed a direct investment into
a pasta plant (Akun) in the amount of $1.4 million. The IFC Board also approved in May
2002 a Micro and Small Enterprise facility for Central Asia, with IFC investment of
$45 million. The same year, the Central Asia Small Enterprise Fund (CASEF) was set up on
collaboration with other lenders. The amount of IFC’s investment into this fund is
$2.5 million. The fund will provide equity, quasi-equity, and debt financing, as well as

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

technical and managerial assistance to growth-oriented SMEs. With financial support from
the Swiss Government, IFC draws upon the resources of the Private Enterprise Partnership to
advise on improving the business environment, provide training and support services for
SMEs, continue past IFC efforts to develop leasing activities, and support agri-business for
local and export markets. Technical assistance with a focus on developing tourism has been
undertaken in the sector. IFC reviewed the IT sector, including its investment opportunities
and development potential.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). MIGA has supported private sector
development in the Kyrgyz Republic by extending guarantees to foreign direct investments in
four projects in the manufacturing, services, and mining sectors. Three are currently
outstanding – two related to airport services at Manas airport and one related to the Kumtor
gold mine. The total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA guarantees is
over $360 million. MIGA has also provided capacity building in foreign investment
techniques to the State Committee on Foreign Investments and Economic Development,
under an initiative supported by the Swiss Government. MIGA plans to continue to assist the
development of the Kyrgyz Republic through its guarantee program and capacity building.
Data on the Kyrgyz Republic are also featured in MIGA's Privatization Link service, which
connects potential investors to information on companies slated for divestiture via the
Internet.

APPENDIX IV

Kyrgyz Republic—Statistical Issues
General framework
1.
The three institutions responsible for collecting, compiling and disseminating
macroeconomic statistics, the National Statistics Committee (NSC), the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), and the National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), have legal and institutional
environments that support statistical quality and the respective staffs are well-versed in
current methodologies. Unlike staff resources, however, computer and financial resources are
not in general commensurate with current needs and constrain future statistical development,
especially for the NSC.

2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated data web site largely
incorporating international methodological recommendations, with adequate coverage and
timeliness (http://stat-gvc.bishkek.su). The Kyrgyz Republic subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 assessed the Kyrgyz Republic’s data
dissemination practices against the GDDS and undertook an in-depth assessment of the
quality of national accounts, price, government finance, monetary, and balance of payments
statistics. The mission concluded that the quality of the Kyrgyz Republic’s macroeconomic
statistics had improved significantly in the last few years. The authorities had established a
good track record of implementing recommendations of past technical assistance missions in
the area of statistics and had demonstrated commitment to pursue plans and programs to
further improve their statistics. The mission recommended that, a program of regular
intersectoral consistency checks be introduced to reduce the sometimes significant,
unexplained discrepancies between the government finance, monetary and balance of
payments datasets. The authorities’ response to the data module ROSC (posted on the IMF
website (www.imf.org/external/np/rosc)) includes an update on the status of implementation
of the ROSC mission’s recommendations.
4.
The SDDS subscription mission in January/February 2004 found that Kyrgyz
Republic met most of the SDDS requirements and made recommendations on two remaining
requirements related to the reserves template and external debt. The recommendations were
successfully implemented by the authorities prior to Kyrgyz Republic's subscription in late
February 2004.
National accounts
5.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is prompt. Technical
assistance has been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, World Bank, and bilateral
donors. While significant progress has been made in improving the national accounts
estimation process, problems persist with respect to the quality of the source data, due mainly
to excessively tight collection deadlines associated with the present national accounts release
schedule; efforts are needed to improve the quality of the source data for quarterly GDP

- 54 -

APPENDIX IV

estimates. Moreover, subannual national accounts statistics are still prepared on a cumulative
basis rather than by discrete time periods. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the
degree of underreporting, especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and
reliability of primary data, work has been undertaken to introduce scientific sampling
procedures. Improved sampling procedures have been adopted for household surveys and
new report forms are being introduced for the enterprise survey. The NSC has established a
division of sample surveys, which would assist in improving the sampling techniques.
Prices, wages, and employment
6.
The scope of the new consumer price index (CPI), which has been published since
January 1995, is broadly consistent with international standards. The price index covers all
urban resident households of all sizes and income levels, but excludes rural households,
which comprise the majority of the population. The ROSC mission recommended that the
authorities expand the coverage of the CPI to include rural households.
7.
The new producer price index (PPI), which has been published since October 1996, is
compiled broadly in accordance with international standards, although its coverage needs to
be improved. The coverage of the PPI was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be
further expanded in the coming years.
8.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports.
Work continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index
presentation and the development of an export price index. However, problems in customs
administration have led to incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate
valuation system. Moreover, the quality of data processing by customs has suffered due to
the use of an outdated computer software system.
9.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual
data are not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems
extend to employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of
unregistered unemployed.
Fiscal accounts
10.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards in that
it excludes data for the Social Fund and the externally-financed Public Investment Program,
although these data are published separately. Among the other limitations are the exclusion
of financial transactions with domestic banks and the discrepancies between the deficit and
financing data. The authorities do not disseminate any details on financing data. While
revenue and expenditure data generally accord with GFS international standards, there are
misclassifications in both categories (for example, some nontax revenues are classified as,
taxes and certain expenditure items are misclassified in the budget and treasury accounts).
Monthly GFS data for IFS publication have been reported up to July 2003. GFS data are

- 55 -

APPENDIX IV

reported each year for the GFS Yearbook with the latest data being for 2001 and only include
budgetary central government and local government data..
11.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual
debt service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt and revised debt projections, are
provided on a monthly basis. The quality and timeliness of external debt data are adequate.
The External Debt Division of the Ministry of Finance is now solely responsible for
monitoring external debt, and this division has benefited from on-site training provided by a
Swiss-financed long-term consultant and from the computerization of its database.
Monetary sector
12.
The authorities introduced new charts of accounts for the NBKR and the commercial
banks during 1997, with the assistance of a resident MAE advisor and USAID. The 1999
monetary and financial statistics mission reviewed the compilation of the monetary data and
recommended improvements to the NBKR’s chart of accounts and to the accompanying
instructions.
13.
The November 2002 ROSC mission found that: (1) the residency criterion was not
uniformly applied, as the currency denomination was used to classify some transactions with
foreign and domestic units, (2) deposits with banks in liquidation were included in broad
money, and (3) source data did not provide sufficient information for a more detailed sectoral
breakdown (e.g., subsectorization of nonbanks institutions as recommended in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual l (MFSM)).
14.
An STA mission on monetary and financial statistics was in Bishkek (April 27–
May 11, 2004) to (1) follow up on the implementation of the ROSC mission’s
recommendations, (2) expand the institutional coverage of the broad money survey, and
(3) assist the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic in implementing the methodology in the
MFSM. This mission found that the NBKR made substantial progress in implementing the
ROSC mission’s recommendations pertaining to monetary statistics. To address the
outstanding issues, the mission further recommended that the NBKR (1) improve the basic
source data for monetary statistics compilation to allow for proper classification of the
transactions with foreign and domestic units in the monetary accounts; (2) fully implement
the MFSM’s methodology concerning accrual accounting for monetary statistics compilation;
(3) exclude deposits with banks in liquidation from monetary aggregates and classify them as
restricted deposits; and (4) set up a working group to follow up on consistency between
monetary and balance of payments statistics. The mission also recommended expanding the
current broad money survey to include the accounts of credit unions and micro-finance
companies.
15.
Monthly monetary data for IFS publication are reported on a regular and timely basis.
Since December 2002, monetary data are reported electronically to STA. Beginning May
2004, the NBKR is reporting monetary data to STA through the Internet, by using the
Integrated Correspondence System.

- 56 -

APPENDIX IV

External sector
16.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position are compiled
and disseminated on a quarterly basis. The 2002 data ROSC mission noted that the
compilation of BOP statistics broadly follows the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5). The NBKR has good arrangements with other agencies to ensure the timely flow of
data. However, because of legal issues related to secrecy provisions, high value transactions
cannot be verified with respondents, which limit the ability to cross-check the accuracy of
data. Although the data collection program has been expanded in the recent past, coverage
deficiencies remain with respect to trade, services, and foreign direct investment. The NBKR
enterprise surveys lack an up-to-date register and have inadequate coverage of enterprises,
particularly those in free economic zones. There is also a need to improve compilation
procedures for achieving temporal consistency of data, and investigating and reconciling
discrepancies.
17.
The NSC conducts a quarterly sample survey for the estimation of shuttle trade, and
uses customs records on the number of people crossing the border with CIS countries to
derive the sample. However, the high value limits applied for free import of goods by
individuals has resulted in the proliferation of a large industry engaging in shuttle trade,
complicating estimation.
18.
An STA mission on balance of payments statistics was in Bishkek (March 15–29,
2004) in response to the authorities’ request for technical assistance to address compilation
issues, and to assess training needs. The mission noted that while improvements have been
made in several areas of the balance of payments, further improvements are needed in the
areas of the international transactions reporting system, data sampling methods, data
validation and data coverage particularly on trade, services, private sector external debt and
foreign direct investment. The mission developed a questionnaire for collecting data on
foreign direct investment, and provided guidelines on the collection of data on external debt.

Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation and Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility—Request for Extension of the Arrangement Supplementary Information

(In cooperation with other departments)

This supplement reports on developments since the staff report was issued.

Recent Developments
2.
The Statistics Committee reports that real GDP increased by 6.8 percent in January–
October 2004 over the same period a year ago. The October 12-month rate of inflation was
3.1 percent. The nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 6 percent since
the beginning of the year.
The 2005 Budget Discussions
3.
During a recent visit to Bishkek, the staff reached understandings with the authorities
on three hitherto unsettled issues to be reflected in the government’s revised 2005 budget
proposal.1 First, the funds received from the sale of Centerra gold shares exceeded program
expectations by US$20 million. Because of this, there was room for more spending on poverty
reduction projects without increasing external debt. Provided that the additional spending is
allocated to poverty reduction without permanently increasing recurrent and capital expenditure, the
staff supported an increase in the 2005 fiscal deficit target from 4.0 percent to 4.4 percent.
4.
Second, because of the higher-than-expected tax base, revenue projections of the state
government for 2005 could be raised by 0.1 percentage point of GDP. Given the higher
projected revenues and reallocations in the budget, the staff estimates indicated that a 10 percent
increase in wages for teachers, doctors and nurses beginning in July 2005 was feasible. Wage
increases beyond these would not be feasible unless other revenue sources are identified. The room
for other wage increases of government employees would be reassessed in May 2005.

1

The second draft will be submitted to Parliament in late November 2004.

-25.
Third, the authorities agreed to reduce the payroll tax rate from 33 percent to
32 percent in 2005, to be followed by further reductions in the coming years. Despite the
payroll tax reductions, pensions could increase on average by 8 percent in 2005 and be
differentiated in favor of poorer pensioners.
6.
The staff also reached agreement with the authorities on the specifics of the small
business tax reform package. The main feature of the reform package is to unify the VAT
threshold with the small business tax threshold at an annual turnover of som 2.5 million ($56,800)
and eliminate the voluntary patent system, which had become a major loophole.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
Kyrgyz Republic
On November 19, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic.1
Background
The Kyrgyz Republic has enjoyed strong economic performance since the last
Article IV consultation in February 2003. Real GDP growth was 6.7 percent in 2003 and
7 percent in January-September 2004. Economic activity is becoming more broad-based,
and annual real GDP growth outside the Kumtor gold mine and the energy sector has been
steadily at or above 4 percent since 2000. Productivity improvements, including greater
capacity utilization, have made an important contribution to growth, although investment has
been an important factor this year. Per capita U.S. dollar GDP rose by 1/3 from 2000 to 2003,
during which time the official poverty rate fell from 52 to 41 percent. At about 3 to 4 percent,
annual inflation rates remain low. External current account deficits in 2002 and 2003 were
equivalent to about 2½ percent of GDP, with both imports and exports growing rapidly. Private
transfers received from Kyrgyz working abroad have become an important source of income,
reaching about 5 percent of GDP. External debt has stabilized, while the ratio of debt to GDP
(and other debt ratios) have begun to fall. With the receipt of about $80 million in privatization
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2proceeds resulting from the sale of government shares in Centerra, the Canadian company
that operates the Kumtor gold mine, official reserves of the central bank have reached nearly
$500 million, equivalent to about 5 months of imports.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s good economic performance owes much to its macroeconomic policies.
The general government fiscal deficit has been gradually reduced from 5½ percent of GDP in
2002 and is on target toward 4 percent of GDP this year. Fiscal consolidation has helped to
stabilize external debt, particularly by containing the externally-financed public investment
program. Tax performance has improved gradually, and the ratio of general government tax
revenues to GDP will reach about 18 percent this year, compared to 16 percent in 2001.
The 2001-04 Paris Club debt rescheduling has been an important factor allowing more
spending on social and anti-poverty priorities. Social spending (including education, health,
social security and welfare, and the pension fund) rose from 12 percent of GDP in 2000-01 to
14 percent presently.
The exchange rate of the som has been broadly stable. Low inflation has allowed for a modest
nominal appreciation while maintaining external competitiveness. Ratios of money and credit
to GDP remain low, even by Commonwealth of Independent States standards. Nevertheless,
remonetization is progressing and growth rates of private sector credit are high. The banking
sector is being reshaped by foreign investment, with seven foreign banks now operating in the
country and accounting for one half of bank loans and deposits. Most bank lending and deposit
taking continues to take place in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. Financial soundness
indicators suggest a gradually strengthening banking system.
In June 2004 the IMF Executive Board completed the fifth review under the three-year
economic program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Kyrgyz authorities for the economy’s strong performance in recent
years, reflecting prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a favorable external environment.
Economic growth has begun to broaden, inflation has remained low, the balance of payments
has strengthened, external debt has been reduced, and poverty has declined albeit from high
levels. Nevertheless, Directors noted that important challenges remain. The still heavy external
debt burden calls for continued fiscal discipline while ensuring adequate spending to support
poverty reduction efforts. The anticipated decline in gold exports calls for actions to diversify
exports and preserve cost competitiveness through low inflation and structural reforms to
boost productivity growth. Further efforts will also be needed to improve the investment climate
by advancing tax reform, improving public administration, addressing corruption and
governance problems that contribute to the growing shadow economy, and strengthening the
financial sector.
Directors recognized the authorities’ good record of responding to Fund policy advice, both
under surveillance and the most recent PRGF-supported program. While the strengthening of
policy implementation has been particularly evident in the fiscal area, Directors underscored

-3that further fiscal consolidation is essential. The gradual reduction of fiscal deficits needs to be
continued for the success of the external debt strategy, and spending controls need to be
further strengthened to keep expenditures on the budgeted track. Directors welcomed the
partial sale of state-held shares in the Centerra gold company which provides more flexibility to
increase poverty-related investments, without compromising the prospects for debt
sustainability. Going forward, they supported the gradual reorientation of spending toward
poverty-reducing areas, in line with the country’s poverty reduction strategy, but underscored
the importance of ensuring the quality of social sector and poverty reduction projects. Over the
medium term, the authorities were also encouraged to embark on a reform of the civil service.
Directors welcomed the gradual increases in the ratio of tax revenues to GDP in recent years
even though some tax rates have been reduced. This performance mainly reflects improved
administrative efficiency, and Directors looked forward to more concrete steps toward
broadening the tax base and further efforts to improve tax administration. They supported the
recent efforts to overhaul the tax code and to simplify and strengthen small business taxation,
and welcomed plans to gradually reduce the payroll tax rate, beginning in 2005, which will be a
key step in the effort to contain the shadow economy.
Directors commended the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic’s (NBKR) skillful monetary
and exchange rate management. They observed that the rapid growth of private sector credit
calls for strong bank supervision and close monitoring of the quality of banks’ loan portfolios.
They welcomed the increasing foreign participation in the banking system, but saw this
development as calling for enhanced cooperation with foreign supervisory counterparts.
Directors also stressed the need for strengthening central bank independence, and deepening
financial markets. They welcomed the progress in implementing most of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program recommendations, and looked forward to steps to addressing the
remaining issues, including in the area of combating money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Directors agreed that the managed float exchange rate regime remains appropriate
under the country’s circumstances, while encouraging the authorities to allow more flexibility in
the exchange rate, including by allowing it to appreciate when warranted by market forces.
Directors took note of updated staff projections of the Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt
suggesting that further Paris Club debt relief appears necessary. Directors underscored,
however, that reaching and maintaining debt sustainability will also require continued
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms as well as a prudent
debt strategy. Many Directors highlighted the importance, in this context, of containing both
concessional and non-concessional borrowing in the future, with several of them encouraging
a continued shift to grant financing.
Directors urged the authorities to approach structural reforms with renewed vigor. While
financial sector reform is advancing, energy sector reform needs to be accelerated, in
particular by taking further measures to improve cost recovery, including through tariff
increases. On governance, Directors welcomed the adoption of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, but stressed that concrete and wide-ranging steps will be needed to
improve the business climate. It will be important that all public policy decisions carefully

-4consider the implications for corruption and governance to minimize opportunities for public
officials to exercise undue discretion. Directors commended the Kyrgyz Republic’s liberal trade
policies. They encouraged the authorities to work with other Eurasian Economic Community
members to ensure that tariffs and other trade policies remain as liberal as they are today and
to foster close regional cooperation.
Directors agreed with the general conclusions of the ex post assessment (EPA) on the lessons
from past Fund engagement and the guidelines for future Fund support. They noted that policy
implementation had been uneven in early programs reflecting a variety of factors, including the
difficult, unchartered, and rapidly changing conditions of the transition to a market-based
economy as well as weaknesses in Fund program design and sequencing. Directors were,
however, encouraged that policy implementation has improved considerably under the current
PRGF arrangement. Directors also highlighted the lessons of the EPA on the importance of
avoiding the build-up of unsustainable debt. Looking ahead, they stressed the need to reduce
the gap between legislative initiatives and policy implementation as a signal of strong
ownership of reform policies, as well as to pay particular attention to weaknesses in public
administration and governance issues that contributed to serious setbacks under earlier
programs.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Fritz Zurbrügg, Executive Director for the Kyrgyz Republic
November 19, 2004

The discussions in Bishkek and Washington on the 2004 Article IV Consultation and the Ex
Post Assessment provided an excellent opportunity to take stock of past and current
economic performance in the Kyrgyz Republic. My Kyrgyz authorities thank both teams for
the very good papers and the constructive dialogue.
This Board discussion comes at a time at which all of the important macroeconomic
indicators have developed more positively than expected. While favourable external
economic conditions have contributed to this outcome, a strong track record of economic
policy implementation was a key factor. In this context, my authorities are convinced that the
Fund’s support under the current PRGF program played an important role. Performance
under the program has been strong. All program reviews have been completed according to
schedule so far. The latest review was completed on a lapse of time basis in June, and current
information indicates that all September 2004 performance criteria have been observed. The
structural reform efforts have become increasingly effective over the recent past, as noted in
the Ex Post Assessment. Moving forward, my Kyrgyz authorities are committed to build on
these achievements. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability and secure external
sustainability, they look forward to benefit from continued technical assistance and financial
support from the Fund and the donor community.
Recent economic developments
Following a strong growth performance of 6.7 percent last year, the staff now project real
growth for 2004 at 5.5 percent, a full percent higher than at the time of the last review in
June. Inflation remains low, compared both to the initial target under the current program and
to other countries in the CIS. Fiscal consolidation has continued, with revenue performance
again improving and expenditure under control. Also, the share of social spending in total
expenditure has increased. The sound macroeconomic management has been conducive to
productivity improvements and the diversification of the economy. Manufacturing has
developed favourably over the last year, and the contribution of the non-gold and non-energy
sectors to overall output growth has increased. This said, my authorities are aware that efforts
to further diversify the economy will be necessary to offset the expected decline in gold
production over the medium term.
Price stability and productivity gains have also preserved low unit labour costs and external
competitiveness. Exports have benefited from rapid growth in the Kyrgyz Republic’s main
trading partners. Non-traditional exports, including tourism and other services, have
performed strongly. While import growth has also been strong, due mainly to domestic
demand, the current account deficit has fallen well below the level anticipated at the outset of
the PRGF program. My authorities are confident that the economic outlook for the region
will continue to support export performance over the near term. For the longer term, they
believe that enhanced economic cooperation within the region would greatly benefit trade

-2and development, not only of the Kyrgyz Republic, but of the region as a whole. For their
part, the Kyrgyz authorities remain strongly committed to an open trade regime.
On the structural side, the authorities are committed to continue the reforms necessary for
further productivity gains and export diversification. Recent achievements in structural
adjustment include the privatization of Kairat bank in early 2004, as recommended by many
Directors at the time of the last Board discussion. On governance, the Kyrgyz Republic has
adopted the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is being implemented
with support from the World Bank and the UK’s DFID. The authorities are also on track to
meet the program targets to reduce the overall quasi-fiscal deficit of the electricity sector.
Fiscal policy
Further consolidation continues to be the main objective of fiscal policy. At the same time,
my authorities are aware of the need to increase poverty-oriented expenditure. This is to
ensure that the benefits of growth reach the poor and most vulnerable segments of the
population. To this end, the higher-than anticipated proceeds from the sale of Centerra shares
will allow for more room for social expenditure in the 2005 budget, especially in the health
and education sectors. The emphasis will be placed on investment spending.
On taxation, the authorities believe that revenue can be sustained at the present level of
18 percent of GDP. However, they are alert to the need to improve the tax system. This
includes improving the incentive structure for businesses to remain within the formal
economy. To this end, the payroll tax rate will be successively reduced in 2005 and in the
years ahead. To compensate for the effect on revenue, measures to broaden the tax base, to
remove tax code inconsistencies, and to improve tax administration are to be implemented.
These include measures foreseen under the small business tax reform package, on which
agreement has recently been reached with the staff.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Sound policy implementation by the National Bank (NBKR) has been critical to securing
overall macroeconomic stability. The monetary authorities are committed to staying this
course. In the current context, they believe that the rapid growth in private credit reflects the
ongoing remontization of the economy. My authorities are, however, alert to the fact that this
will necessitate a careful monitoring of the banks’ assets. The NBKR is also aware of the
additional demands on banking supervision of the increased participation of foreign-owned
banks.
Looking ahead, the financial sector is set to gain further strength through the implementation
of the new Law on Bank Bankruptcy and Conservatorship, and the full implementation of the
2003 FSAP recommendations. The authorities are also committed to introducing the
measures foreseen to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, once the
requisite legislation has been passed by parliament.

-3External debt
Reducing the vulnerability stemming from high levels of public external debt has been a
cornerstone of the authorities’ economic program. Over the past years, the external debt-toGDP ratio has fallen to under 100 percent, mainly because of improved debt management
and successful fiscal consolidation. Also, the 2002 Paris Club rescheduling has temporarily
eased the debt service burden. Gaining external viability will hinge critically on continued
growth and prudent balance of payments financing. However, as the staff’s debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) shows, the debt service will rise rapidly in the years
immediately ahead, which would result in considerable fiscal strain in the absence of further
rescheduling. It is clear that long-term solvency will only be attained through a concessional
debt stock treatment by Paris Club creditors. My Kyrgyz authorities, for their part, are fully
aware that reaching and maintaining external sustainability will also require continued
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.
Ex post assessment
My authorities are grateful for the in-depth and candid assessment of policy performance
under past Fund-supported programs. The Ex Post Assessment (EPA) illustrates the
considerable accomplishments that have been made over the last decade. Price and trade
liberalization were undertaken early on, as were the sale of state-owned assets and farreaching fiscal reforms. Following the backlash suffered in the late 1990s, economic
restructuring regained momentum under the current PRGF arrangement. Important reforms
of the financial sector were initiated, in the course of which the economy has been largely
remonetized. Price stability has been secured by prudent monetary policy. Reforms have
helped increase the share of private sector output in GDP, which has more than doubled since
1994. Per-capita income has increased by over a third since 2000. Also, considerable
progress has been made in reducing the incidence of poverty, particularly in rural areas.
It is clear from the EPA that the process of transition to a market-based economy has not
always followed a linear path. Certain set-backs were due to weaknesses in public
administration and governance, which have yet to be fully addressed. Areas in which
important further reforms are required include large-scale privatization, corporate
governance, and the further deepening of financial markets.
However, it is important to bear in mind that the reforms of the 1990s were undertaken under
very difficult and rapidly changing conditions. It took both the authorities and the Fund
considerable time to understand the full magnitude of the challenges of transition. Since the
difficulties involved were initially underestimated, the targets under past programs were
often set at overly ambitious levels. It is also important to note that some of the problems in
implementing reforms only became apparent once the process of structural change was well
underway. This particularly pertains to the area of governance, where new challenges
emerged with the implementation of market-oriented reforms. It is also noteworthy that the
longer-term impact of adverse external developments, in particular of the Russian crisis of
1998, was initially misjudged. Overall, my authorities believe that, given the constraints of a

-4small landlocked economy, they have coped relatively well with the daunting challenges of
transition.
Looking ahead, the findings of the EPA contain valuable lessons for the further reform
process. My authorities remain committed to further advancing this process, and are
confident that lasting effort to close the ‘implementation gap’ will bear fruit. The Fund’s
support has been critical throughout the process of transition. The Kyrgyz authorities
continue to count on this support, and on that of the international community more broadly,
in bringing their reform efforts forward.

IMF Executive Board Extends the Kyrgyz Republic's Three-Year PRGF Arrangement
On November 19, 2004 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) extended
the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement for the Kyrgyz
Republic until April 5, 2005 to enable completion of the sixth and final review of the Kyrgyz
Republic's economic performance under the arrangement.
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement effective on December 6, 2001
(see Press Release No. 01/49) for a total amount equivalent to SDR 73.4 million
(about US$110.4 million).
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.
