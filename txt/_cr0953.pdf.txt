INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Mexico
Approved by David J. Robinson and Philip Gerson
January 15, 2009
Executive Summary
•

Focus. The consultation focused on the economic and financial sector implications of the global crisis
and the policy responses to manage them. Medium term prospects, including for structural reforms,
were also discussed.

•

Assessment. The outlook is for a significant drop in growth against the background of tight financial
conditions and a U.S. recession. Thanks to strong policy frameworks and balance sheets, a
countercyclical policy response is not only desirable but also possible—the first time in Mexico. The
economy is relatively well-positioned to adjust to external shocks in an orderly manner. Still, risks
remain, especially from a further worsening of the global context.

•

Policy advice. The staff report advocates to:
•
•
•
•

•

Ease monetary policy in the face of the projected increase in economic slack.
Consider further fiscal policy stimulus if the outlook worsens more than expected.
Continue to respond quickly to financial market stresses, including through development banks
and liquidity provision, to prevent an abrupt tightening of financial conditions.
Bolster the risk management framework, including through further strengthening the bank
resolution and bankruptcy framework, more extensive bank and corporate risk assessments, and
enhanced coordination between regulators.
Take measures to offset the expected medium-term decline in fiscal revenues from oil and
consider the possibility of shifting to a structural fiscal rule, to allow more flexible macro
management.

Authorities’ position. The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment. They agreed that a
deteriorating outlook called for an easing bias of macro policies but were weighing credibility and other
constraints. Promoting normal functioning of financial markets and preserving stability amidst volatile
global conditions remained a priority. They emphasized the importance of structural reforms to improve
growth prospects.
Staff. The mission conducted discussions in Mexico City during December 1−12, 2008 with officials
(including from Banco de Mexico, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, and CNBV) and private
sector counterparts. The team comprised S. Phillips (head), V. Haksar (incoming mission chief), R. Blavy,
R. García-Saltos, K. Krajnyák (all WHD); A. Cebotari (FAD); and M. Souto (MCM), supported by
V. Tulin at headquarters. D.J. Robinson (WHD) joined the mission for part of the discussions;
N. Eyzaguirre (WHD) participated in the concluding meeting with Secretary Carstens. A. Guerra and
L. Jiménez (OED) joined the mission meetings.

I. CONTEXT FOR THE CONSULTATION
1.
Mexico has made substantial progress over the past decade in strengthening its
economic framework and enhancing resilience. Inflation has been anchored in a low range
and public and private balance sheets have been substantially strengthened. Most
importantly, public external debt and financing requirements have been sharply reduced. The
external current account position has been solid and official reserves have been built up
steadily, though not to the extent in some other emerging markets. The banking system is
highly profitable and well-capitalized. This performance has been underpinned by a solid,
rules-based macro-institutional policy framework. Inflation targeting has achieved a high
degree of credibility in the context of a freely floating exchange rate regime. Sizeable fiscal
adjustment earlier in this decade and the introduction of a fiscal responsibility law have been
additional support. Meanwhile, the 2006 FSAP Update acknowledged the strength and
sophistication of the financial sector supervisory framework.
2.
However, the external environment has deteriorated sharply in the last months,
presenting a new test for Mexico’s resilience and current policy framework. The global
financial shock-wave, which for many months had not severely affected Latin America, has
intensified following the failure of Lehman Brothers. Financial markets in Mexico too have
been affected by shortages of liquidity, and a pull back by foreign investors leading to asset
price drops across the board. In addition to tighter financial conditions, the weakening
outlook for U.S. activity, remittances, and international oil prices all weigh on prospects for
Mexico. The authorities have responded with measures to address liquidity problems—
including through foreign exchange intervention—and support domestic debt markets, and
with fiscal stimulus to support demand. The central bank has put its tightening cycle on hold
in view of the outlook for a widening output gap and reduced inflation pressures.
3.
This year’s Article IV discussions focused on assessing risks arising in the
current conjuncture, and weighing policy options to mitigate the current real and
financial shocks, while also considering implications for the medium term.
II. A WAVE OF EXTERNAL SHOCKS
4.
Over the past year, Mexico has been hit by a series of mainly external shocks
influencing inflation, growth, and the external current account:
•

Growth: the Mexican economy has begun to decelerate in tandem with the slowdown
in the U.S. (Figure 1), reflecting a marked slowdown in industrial production, and
falling capacity utilization, but also broader based weakness in the services and
manufacturing sectors. Domestic demand has eased in tandem with a sharp
deterioration of confidence, especially in October.

Inflation: international commodity
price shocks and later the peso’s
depreciation have pushed up
inflation. Also, last year’s fiscal
package, involving introduction of
higher taxes, has tended to slightly
increase the price level this year.
Headline inflation was above
6 percent y/y by end-December,
compared to a 3 percent target, while
inflation expectations for 2009
drifted up to about 4.4 percent.
External current account: non-oil
export volumes have begun to
weaken, reflecting especially the
slowdown in the U.S. (Figure 2).
Pressure on the trade balance has
been compounded by falling oil
export prices and domestic
production declines. Meanwhile
remittances (which account for some
2.2 percent of GDP) started
declining, reflecting especially
Mexico’s close links with U.S. states
most affected by the housing crunch.1

Impact of State-Level Economic Conditions in the
U.S. on Aggregate Remittances to Mexico

national authorities, staff calculations.
Note: For each state, size of dot represents the share of
Mexican immigrants in state’s population. Red-shaded
states denotes states where economic conditions had a
significant impact on aggregate remittances to Mexico.
For states in white, correlation coefficients were not
significant.

5.
The September intensification of the global financial shock had a significant
impact on Mexico as on other major emerging markets. To a considerable extent, this
reflected the generalized emerging market sell off, though the episode also exposed some
Mexico-specific concerns.
•

1

Generalized asset price decline. Asset prices in Mexico fell sharply during
September−October, in line with other emerging markets in Latin America and Asia,
but less so than in emerging Europe. This reflected in part deleveraging by foreign
investors, and generalized heightened risk aversion amongst market players
(Figure 3). Asset prices have been more stable in recent months.

For further analysis, see the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

Corporate foreign exchange losses. The
abrupt currency depreciation (Figure 4)
in Mexico flushed out home-grown
vulnerabilities. In particular, some
Mexican companies, which had been
short-selling peso volatility betting that
stable levels of recent years would
continue, experienced large losses. This
led to further pressure on the currency
and to a loss of confidence of investors
in at least some Mexican corporates.
Money market pressures. Increased risk
aversion intensified the ongoing
disruption of the relatively small MBS
and commercial paper markets in
Mexico, which together comprise some
6 percent of GDP. Mutual funds were
particularly affected by losses in longterm government paper, triggering large
early redemptions in October–
November.

Credit conditions. Credit growth has decelerated markedly, reflecting in part liquidity
and capital pressures on Mexican subsidiaries of global banks that account for almost
80 percent of system deposits (Figure 5).

6.
In the first half of 2008, the near-term policy focus was on containing inflation
and mitigating the welfare impact of higher food prices.
•

Monetary and exchange rate policy. The policy stance was tightened by 75 bps
during the summer months, reaching 8¼ percent, amid rising headline and inflation
expectations. The peso tended to appreciate during this period. In July, the authorities
suspended the rule-based daily dollar auctions,2 while continuing to abstain from any
discretionary FX market intervention.

•

Transfers and subsidy policies. To counter the impact of food price shocks on the
poor, the government announced in May an expansion of the system of conditional

Following a large purchase by the government of dollars from Banxico, the authorities in July suspended the
regular auctioning of half the public sector's net dollar inflows, explaining that this would permit Banxico’s
reserves to return to their previous level more quickly.

cash transfers. As international gasoline prices soared far above the administered
price charged by PEMEX in Mexico, the government acted to reduce this costly and
untargeted price subsidy, by gradually increasing the pace of adjustment for prices
charged by PEMEX.
7.
As market conditions suddenly worsened post-Lehman, the authorities
responded with policy actions on multiple fronts:
•

Exchange rate policy. In early October, at a time of several episodes of sharp
depreciation and low market liquidity, the central bank (Banxico) intervened in the
foreign exchange market for the first time in a decade—and on a large scale, with a
mix of small rules-based and extraordinary dollar auctions.3

•

Stabilizing debt markets. The treasury announced a reduction in the duration of
planned government bond issuances over the next 12 months to support demand for
government bonds, while Banxico expanded interest rate swaps. Public sector
financial institutions have provided guarantees on MBS and commercial paper
markets, and taken on the role of buyer-of-last-resort in a number of cases.

•

Securing external financing. Banxico entered into a dollar swap facility with the
Federal Reserve, for US$30 billion, in place through April 2009. The authorities
announced additional financing of US$5 billion from IFIs (World Bank and IDB).

•

Fiscal stimulus. The congress approved a modification of the balanced budget target
of the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which effectively eased the fiscal stance by about
0.6 percent of GDP in 2009 (relative to the previous version of the rule). The overall
fiscal impulse for 2009 is expected to be close to 1 percent of GDP.

•

Monetary policy. While the monetary stance remains moderately restrictive, the
increased provision of liquidity by the central bank effectively led to overnight rates
sometimes below the 8¼ percent target.

8.
Financial markets and asset prices broadly stabilized after late October, albeit at
generally weaker levels. However, volatility remains high in an environment of
substantially reduced trading activity, especially in offshore derivative markets. The yield
curve has flattened after spiking at the longer end in October, but rates are higher than earlier
in the year. While money market conditions have improved, bank credit to the private sector
continues to decelerate and commercial paper markets are tight.
3

Banxico announced that it will make available through auction US$400 million each day, to the highest
bidders, but at a minimum peso/dollar price 2 percent depreciated from the previous day. This auction
mechanism was previously in place during 1997−2001. Outside this mechanism, Banxico auctioned much
larger amounts in several “extraordinary” interventions, including some US$6 billion on October 10. Since
intervention began, Banxico has sold about US$15 billion, the bulk of this around mid-October.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS––ASSESSING THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXTERNAL SHOCKS
9.
External real and financial shocks are expected to affect significantly Mexico’s
short-term prospects. Strong real and financial links to the U.S. expose Mexico more to the
downturn than other emerging markets (Box 1). Financial conditions are noticeably tighter as
appetite for risk has decreased globally and the global financial sector has continued to
deleverage. Also, declining oil prices are eating into external and fiscal revenues (although a
price hedging policy should offset this loss in 2009). The adjustment process is projected to
be orderly, given Mexico’s proven buffers, and the expectation of a flexible policy response,
but there are downside risks.

10.
A significant slowdown is projected, and the widening output gap should lead to
a sharp decline in inflation. GDP growth is projected to turn negative in 2009 (around
-¼ percent) as external demand drops, confidence weakens (Figure 6), and domestic and
external financial conditions remain tight. Growth is expected to pick up gradually in 2010 as
the U.S. economy, supported by a large fiscal stimulus, recovers. In the meantime, as
economic slack increases and the impact of commodity price and exchange rate shocks fades,
inflation is likely to decline rapidly towards Banxico’s 3 percent inflation target.
11.
Tighter financial conditions are expected to be an important factor in the
slowdown. The cost of external financing is expected to remain high (with the EMBI above
400 bps) and market funding for corporates costly and limited (with external spreads
averaging about 900 bps and the domestic market largely limited to rollovers), essentially
shutting out most firms from new financing. Domestic credit growth is expected to slow
sharply, as deleveraging by global banks influences the balance sheets of their Mexican
subsidiaries, and banks adjust to deteriorating loan portfolio performance (particularly on the

Box 1. Real and Financial Spillovers from the United States to Mexico1
Mexico’s links to the U.S. suggest that the outlook for the Mexican economy is strongly dependent on U.S.
developments. Given the large uncertainty surrounding the course, duration and severity of the current U.S.
downturn, a key question is, how could this dependence be quantified? The effects of real and financial shocks
in the U.S. on Mexico can be assessed based on the IMF’s newly developed Global Projection Model. The
model links several blocks of the world economy—namely, the U.S., the Euro area, Japan, Mexico, and an
aggregate of inflation targeting economies in Latin America (LA5).
The results suggest that shocks in the United States account for about one-fourth of the variation in Mexican
growth. Almost half of this contribution is explained by financial conditions in the U.S., which are considered a
forward looking indicator for the availability of financing and a leading indicator for output in the U.S. and thus
for Mexico.2 Reflecting tight trade and financial linkages, Mexico is more strongly affected by real shocks in
the U.S. than any other country in the LA5. A negative output gap shock of 0.4 percent in the U.S. generates in
Mexico a 0.1 percent negative output gap on impact that cumulates to 0.25 percent after 4 quarters. These
results are in line with previous IMF research.
Tighter U.S. financial conditions also tend to slow activity and widen the output gap in Mexico. As in the U.S.,
the negative effect on output is persistent—peaking after about 2 years—and similar in size to the effect in the
U.S. itself. This suggests that, with the large shock to U.S. financial conditions still unfolding, a significant drag
on Mexican activity is still in the pipeline.

consumer side). Negative feedback effects between worsening credit quality, weakening
bank capital, and a further growth slowdown, are key downside risks to the outlook.
12.
On the external side, gross private capital inflows are projected to slow
significantly in 2009, in line with global trends, offset by higher public borrowing from
international development institutions (Figure 7). For related reasons, Mexican FDI and
portfolio investments abroad are also projected to slow. Private sector external financing
requirements, below 2 percent of GDP in 2009, appear manageable though concentrated, and
some corporates will be facing sizable maturities. The current account deficit is expected to
remain broadly stable––around 2¼ percent of GDP––as smaller net oil exports are offset by
shrinking imports. In this baseline scenario, external payments are expected to balance in
2009 without significant further FX market
intervention or exchange rate adjustment.
13.
Uncertainties are large and risks to
growth in 2009 are on the downside.
Reflecting tight links with the U.S., the
authorities agreed that Mexico shares in the
uncertainties and risks surrounding the U.S.
outlook, with much depending on the size,
composition, and timing of the planned U.S.
fiscal stimulus, as well as developments in
the auto industry. The staff views risks as
tilted to the downside, including from weak
U.S. demand, and tighter or more volatile
financial markets than assumed.

Over the medium-term a cyclical

rebound is projected to close the output
gap over a five-year horizon. A key aspect of the outlook is the projected decline in oil
exports, with the public sector (PEMEX) a net oil importer as early as 2013. Risks to the
medium term growth outlook also arise from increasing constraints on fiscal space to fund
needed new public investment, and the possibility that potential growth could soften more
than assumed as a result of the crisis. Furthermore, organized crime could also weigh on
growth over the medium term.

IV. POLICY CHOICES—RESPONDING TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND ENHANCING
RESILIENCE
The policy discussions in this consultation focused on three questions:
A. Macro Policy Management—what role can monetary and fiscal policies play in
supporting economic activity in 2009?
B. Financial Sector Policies—what additional steps can be taken to mitigate a credit crunch
and preserve stability in the face of small pressure points across the system?
C. Medium-Term Challenges and Goals––how does the weakened outlook for oil
production and the external environment affect the policy strategy?
A. Macro Policy Management
The current macroeconomic policy challenge is to alleviate the negative impact of the very
large external shocks facing Mexico. Countercyclical policy efforts will be essential, with
their design taking due account of the need to preserve credibility and of the room for
financing.
Monetary policy
15.
On monetary policy, the staff assessment is that there should be scope for easing
from the currently restrictive policy interest rate. Although headline inflation had
continued to rise, this mainly reflects supply side shocks, while underlying inflationary
pressures—notably domestic demand and wage growth—remain very moderate (Figure 8).
With the output gap projected to widen significantly, and commodity prices declining, the
staff’s projections suggest that consumer price inflation is likely to slow sharply from early
2009. Consistent with this assessment, markets currently expect easing in Mexico to begin in
the first part of 2009.
16.
The authorities broadly agreed, but stressed that the timing and speed of
monetary policy easing needed to be carefully weighed. In this connection, they noted that
indicators of inflation expectations for 2009 and even 2010 were above the 3 percent target,
and had not yet started to come firmly down following their recent increase. They noted that
price-setters may have not yet fully internalized the weaker outlook for demand, and that
expectations could be backward looking, putting undue weight on recent supply shocks, in
particular the large October depreciation of the peso. The staff agreed that these were valid
concerns, but also recognized, with the authorities, the risks of easing the policy interest rate
too slowly, taking into account the lags with which monetary policy operates, and the speed
at which U.S. economic activity appears to be decelerating. In this context, the staff
suggested that the communications efforts of Banxico will be key, and will be aided by the

17.
The staff and authorities agreed that the independently floating exchange rate
regime had continued to serve Mexico well, amid unusually large external shocks. The
full flexibility of the peso had been a key shock absorber, with the recent depreciation of the
peso playing a stabilizing role, helping to rebalance portfolios and clear markets for financial
assets—indeed, surveys point to expectations of peso appreciation in the near term,
offsetting a rise in the risk premium investor’s demand for holding peso-denominated
instruments. On the whole, the peso’s depreciation had not had significant destabilizing
effects, as the balance sheets of the government and the banking system had not been
vulnerable to depreciation. Most of the corporate sector also seemed resilient to a weaker
peso, reflecting progress in strengthening balance sheets (see accompanying Selected Issues
paper), although some corporations had made considerable losses on complex derivatives
positions, the existence of which had not been widely known. Upon investigating this
incident, the authorities assessed that the problem was contained, with most such positions
closed in October. Going forward, they considered that existing derivatives reporting
requirements are broadly adequate but that implementation and enforcement must be
improved; actions against various involved parties are already underway.
18.
The recent FX intervention has helped ensure orderly markets, while preserving
the most essential benefits of the fully flexible exchange rate regime, and leaving the
bulk of Mexico’s international reserves still in place as a cushion against future shocks.
The authorities noted that the bulk of the intervention to date had been confined to a brief
period in October and targeted at relieving liquidity pressures in the FX market related to the
corporate losses on derivative transactions. Foreign exchange had been sold only in preannounced amounts, at prices determined by the market in competitive auctions, so that there
was no constraint on the movement of the exchange rate, and no suggestion of a targeted
level of the peso. Notwithstanding the intervention, NIR at end-2008 was about
US$7½ billion above its level a year earlier, aided by strong foreign exchange receipts earlier
in the year from oil. The authorities noted that their recent swap agreement with the U.S.
Federal Reserve had boosted foreign exchange liquidity, although they had not found it
necessary so far to utilize this agreement. The authorities also welcomed the creation of the
Fund’s Short-term Liquidity Facility, as a potentially useful tool for countries with strong
policy records, but did not see Mexico using this facility at this time.
19.
The staff’s assessment is that the peso’s real exchange rate is somewhat weaker
than its medium-term equilibrium value. This conclusion is based largely on the results of

As in the previous consultation, the
authorities noted that assessments of equilibrium exchange rates are subject to great
uncertainties, observing that possible longer-term shifts in risk aversion, and in potential
growth patterns across countries, were now heightening uncertainties.

Fiscal Policy
20.
On fiscal policy, the government is now set to play an appropriate
countercyclical role in 2009, but will face a complicated balancing act in 2010. The
unusual size of the demand shock and output gap expected for 2009, the staff agreed, clearly
called for an active countercyclical effort beyond the operation of Mexico’s limited
automatic stabilizers. At the same time, policymakers will be looking ahead to 2010, when
revenues from oil exports are projected to drop more significantly, possibly triggering a
premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus by constraining government expenditure.
21.
For 2009, the staff estimated the fiscal stimulus implied by the approved budget
at about 1 percent of GDP. This will be the first time that fiscal policy has been able to act
countercyclically in a downturn. This stimulus will be made possible notwithstanding the

The three methodologies include the macroeconomic balance approach (that compares the difference between
the “sustainable” and the projected medium-term current account balance); the external sustainability approach,
and the reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate regression approach. Estimates suggest that the peso has
shifted somewhat to the weak side with the large effective peso depreciation in September−October. All three
methodologies now indicate a slight undervaluation. In making this assessment, the future level of Mexico’s oil
production remains a key uncertainty. Recent downward revisions to the medium-term oil production outlook
suggest a downward shift in the equilibrium rate, although this could be reduced—or even reversed—to the
extent that recent reforms are successful in allowing Mexico to tap its deep water oil resources.

5

Surveys taken since October’s large depreciation have consistently pointed to expected appreciation of the
peso against the dollar of 5 to 10 percent over the coming 12 months. A special consensus survey in December
suggested a nearly 50 percent probability that the peso will appreciate by more than 5 percent by end-2009, and
only a 19 percent chance of a larger-than-5-percent depreciation. With the 12-month forward discount rate (and
interest differential) above 7 percent, the implied risk premium is above 10 percent.

22
balanced budget rule,6 and a large decline in oil export prices that might have required a
contraction of spending in 2009, as follows:
•

A successful oil price hedging operation is expected to prevent a major decline in oilrelated income in 2009 (Box 2). In addition, the peso’s recent depreciation will help
support the value of oil export income, against a projected decline in net oil export
volume of about 5 percent.

•

A recent modification of the Fiscal Responsibility Law’s balanced budget target,
related to PEMEX reform (Box 3), will create room for 0.6 percent of GDP in higher
spending in 2009. This room will be used mainly for infrastructure investment.

•

An expansion of development banks’ net lending, from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to
a projected 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009, will further support economic activity. This
will be complemented by further extension of guarantees by development banks of
about 1.2 percent of GDP. Both types of activity help to avoid a supply shock via a
credit crunch (see below).

22.
The staff recommended keeping the fiscal stance under close review as the
economic situation develops—if the outlook were to deteriorate further, consideration
could be given to additional easing of the fiscal stance. This could take the form of a larger
positive impulse in 2009, or a slower withdrawal of stimulus in 2010. Indeed, the muchreduced outlook for oil export prices will be felt harder in 2010 and, other things constant,
the FRL will require government expenditure to be cut back by about ¾ percent of GDP,
relative to the 2009 expansion. A sudden reversal of stimulus may not be desirable at that
time, though reversal will have to come eventually.7
23.
Government financing has not so far come under sustained pressure but this
remains a potential risk, especially if the global financial situation were to deteriorate
further. The authorities agreed that volatile global markets increased the need for flexibility
in the financing mix. On the whole, government bonds so far have benefited from an

6

Ordinarily, the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) seeks to hold the budget balance steady from year to year
unless exceptional circumstances are invoked at the time of budget approval. Since the FRL’s introduction,
exceptional circumstances have not been invoked.

7

At the least, it should be possible to allow that automatic stabilizers on the tax revenue side operate. That is, if
lower-than-expected growth pulls down revenue, there would be no requirement to cut expenditure; instead, the
policy framework allows using previously accumulated stabilization funds. Roughly, a 1 percentage point
shortfall in growth lowers non-oil tax revenue by about 0.1 percent of GDP.

23

Box 2. The 2009 Oil Price Hedge1
Mexico’s budget is heavily dependent on revenues from oil, which account for about 8 percent of GDP or more
than a third of revenues. Although the bulk of oil revenues are from domestic sales and do not fluctuate
proportionately when world prices change (given the long-standing policy of keeping domestic prices of
gasoline and diesel about constant in real terms), about a quarter are from net exports and vary directly with
world prices. For example, as of 2008, a US$10 per barrel drop in oil (export and import) prices would reduce
oil revenues by ¼ percent of GDP.
To safeguard the 2009 budget from an unexpected drop in oil prices, the authorities hedged about 70 percent of
PEMEX gross exports of crude oil (330 million barrels) at the budgeted price of US$70 per barrel for the
Mexican oil mix. The size of this operation was chosen to effectively hedge all of PEMEX net export revenues
(taking into account that PEMEX also imports fuels, at lower cost when world prices decline).
The hedge was purchased in the third quarter of 2008 at a cost of US$1.5 billion, paid out of the oil stabilization
fund. The hedge will be due to pay out at the end of 2009 if the average annual price of Mexico’s 2009 exports
comes below US$70 per barrel. With the average price for the Mexican oil mix projected by the staff at
US$47.3 per barrel for 2009, the value of the hedge is estimated at US$7.5 billion (0.8 percent of GDP), far
above the cost of the hedging operation.

“internal flight to quality”; the spike in yields in October was limited to the long end and has
been largely reversed. While demand for bonds is likely to be supported by the steadily
expanding pension funds, foreigners’ demand is less assured (as the recent sell-off has
demonstrated, although still over 10 percent of domestic debt is in foreign hands). Domestic
issuance should be able to provide the bulk of gross financing needs in 2009. At the same
time, the authorities wish to maintain Mexico’s presence internationally—indeed, Mexico in
December8 was the first emerging market country to tap international capital markets since
September—and also envisage drawing on World Bank and IDB funding. Arranging such
external financing will reduce the additional pressure on the domestic bond market related to
financing the fiscal stimulus.
24.
The staff shared the authorities’ mindfulness of potential limits to discretionary
fiscal policy moves. The focus on infrastructure investment is appropriate to Mexico’s needs,
but there are natural limits to accelerating such expenditure. Given volatile global markets,
financing conditions could, in principle, become limiting factors on further fiscal expansion,
and maintaining credibility in financial markets via adherence to a rules-based policy
framework is key. With public debt (augmented definition) close to 40 percent of GDP in
most stress scenarios over the medium term (Figure 9), a fiscal stimulus effort of 1–2 years’

Box 3. Fiscal Policy Framework and the Reform of PEMEX1
The federal budget is highly reliant on
revenue from PEMEX oil production,
which is now in a declining phase.
Since the last consultation, the
authorities have lowered their projection
of PEMEX production over the medium
term. For as long as oil production
continues to fall, or fails to keep up with
domestic consumption of hydrocarbons,
PEMEX imports have to rise, effectively
lowering budget revenue. Staff estimate
that PEMEX net exports of hydrocarbons
will fall to about zero in 2013, from
about 2 percent of GDP in 2008.

This decline in oil export revenue over the medium term is expected to be partially offset by
gains in non-oil tax revenue, from the tax policy reform that began to be implemented in 2008,
coupled with tax administration efforts.
For a longer-term solution, the 2008 reform of the state-owned oil sector (PEMEX) aims to
boost production by improving governance and increasing investment. Independent members
will be added to the board of PEMEX, and new mechanisms for contracting with the private sector
are now possible. However, private equity stakes in PEMEX, as well as the risk-sharing contracts
that are standard in the global oil industry, are not allowed, leaving PEMEX at a disadvantage in this
respect relative to other state-owned oil companies, such as Brazil’s Petrobras.
It is too soon to know the reform’s pay-off in terms of higher oil production. A first test will be
whether the investment-related elements of the reform will prove adequate to attract the large,
technology-intensive projects and expertise necessary to develop Mexico’s deep water oil resources.
Once such projects do begin, major effects on production could be as much as 10 years away.
The PEMEX reform was accompanied by related modifications of the Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL). Starting with the 2009 budget year, the calculation of the fiscal target will exclude
capital spending by PEMEX (although this change does not necessarily represent the lifting of a
constraint on PEMEX investment2 and PEMEX expenditure remains subject to congressional
approval). This change does introduce a relaxation of the required fiscal stance over the next several
years, relative to the path implied by the unmodified rule, worth about 0.6 percent of GDP in 2009.
The FRL also was strengthened in a number of respects: (i) to raise the maximum size of the oil
stabilization funds, which had been capped at relatively low levels, (ii) to record all PEMEX-related
debt in the federal debt statistics, and (iii) to assure the orderly evolution of the augmented public
debt. The authorities estimate that this will require keeping the augmented fiscal deficit—which
includes PEMEX capital spending—at no more than 2½ percent of GDP each year.

Before this change, most PEMEX investment had not counted immediately against the targeted traditional
budget balance—but years later, when associated amortization was paid. Now, new capital expenditure by
PEMEX will be reflected contemporaneously, and more transparently, in the traditional budget balance, though
not counted against the fiscal policy target.

duration should not threaten perceptions of solvency. But clearly, the stimulus has to be
reversed in time, as government revenues from foreign sources—net oil exports—are
projected to decline. (Indeed, the FRL will require an ongoing tightening of the “domestic”
fiscal balance over the medium term, and for as long as net oil exports continue declining.)
25.
The staff broadly supported the authorities’ plans for targeted and careful use of
the development banks to provide or incentivize credit.9 In recent months, development
banks helped support the corporate bond market through guarantees and direct lending; the
authorities plan to step up these activities in 2009. The well-capitalized development banks
have room to expand, and the budget allows for further increasing capital. At a time of tight
financial conditions, these activities can provide support to the economy, including by
avoiding a supply-side credit shock.
B. Financial Policies to Preserve Stability
26.
The mission noted that the initial impact of the global crisis on the Mexican
banking sector had been modest, reflecting minimal direct exposure to toxic assets or
troubled global players as counterparties, and strong reliance on domestic deposits for
funding. Banks remain strongly capitalized and have been highly profitable (Table 5—see
also the Selected Issues paper). With several of the largest Mexican banks being subsidiaries
of large global institutions, however, groupwide caution in lending has translated into
tightening credit conditions and slowing credit growth in Mexico. Potential liquidity or
capital pressures that troubled global parents may put on their (highly liquid) Mexican
subsidiaries are a potential concern, but the authorities noted that related party lending rules
(which are conservative by international standards) are in place, and that they closely monitor
the largest banks’ liquidity situation, and remain in close contact with counterpart
supervisors. These measures have so far contained liquidity transfers, and the authorities
emphasized that notwithstanding shocks to some parent banks in their home markets,
spillovers to confidence in banks in Mexico have not been evident.
27.
Although risks remain, strong balance sheets position the banking system well
for weathering the continued global turmoil and the domestic downturn. The banking
system’s traditional business and funding model has provided insulation from significant
losses related to global financial volatility. In 7 of the 8 largest banks, the deposit base is
larger than the loan portfolio, and capital cushions are substantial. Although non-performing
loans (particularly on the consumer lending side) are expected to increase further as the
economy weakens, the authorities’ stress tests indicate that the system is well-placed to

including an obligation for the government to provide appropriate capital. Their net lending is reported in the
augmented fiscal balance and public sector borrowing requirement statistics.

27
handle shocks to credit quality and bond prices.10 Banks’ currency exposure is limited by
regulation—foreign currency denominated credit is less than 5 percent of the total, and less
than 15 percent of deposits is in foreign currency. Interbank liquidity has not come under
pressure; lower-tier institutions that may yet face some problems would have recourse to
Banxico’s expanded liquidity facilities.
28.
Financial markets show the effects of reduced appetite for risk and duration,
and the authorities have responded with policy adjustments. Trading volumes have fallen
in the derivatives market, as well as in the peso market. The small MBS market remains dry
and dislocation has necessitated government support in the corporate paper market (see
below). Moreover, short-term market valuation risk on holdings of long-term government
bonds can be substantial for pension funds and some banks (a fact highlighted by the global
EM bond selloff in October, although Mexican government bond prices quickly recovered
from that episode, helped by steps to somewhat reduce duration). The authorities emphasized
that such valuation losses do not affect pension funds’ long-run returns, nor threaten the
solvency of banks, but could lead to an undesirable procyclical tightening of credit to the
private sector. Against that background, they had recently modified accounting rules for
some holdings of government bonds by banks.11
29.
Policy action to support financial markets may need to continue to ease the real
effects of financial shocks. Although the corporate sector’s leverage is low by international
standards—bank lending to the sector is about 7 percent of GDP and the corporate paper
market is about 3 percent of GDP—and few firms tap international capital markets,
disruptions to financing flows would reverberate through the real economy. The authorities
have acted (through development banks) with partial guarantees and direct credit to help
domestic debt rollovers when liquidity dried up in the corporate paper market; the programs
could be stepped up if necessary. External rollover needs have been modest in the months
since September. No major problems have been reported, but the fact that Cemex (Mexico’s

debt maturing in 2009 is indicative of tight conditions. The authorities projected more
substantial refinancing needs in 200912 but expected that Mexican firms would retain market
access, albeit at tighter terms. The staff noted that should major dislocations occur, Banxico’s

11

In particular, holdings of government bonds that are repo’d are no longer required to be valued at current
market prices, but can instead be booked in the held-to-maturity category. To implement this change, a one-time
reclassification of certain bond holdings has been permitted.
12

On residency basis, refinancing needs (excluding trade credit) are estimated around US$7 billion. Market
estimates that also consider borrowing by affiliates suggest that Mexican corporates face refinancing needs on
external bonds and syndicated loans of some US$16 billion in 2009.

28
possibilities for direct support to the corporate sector would be limited, but that assistance
could be provided through other channels, including development banks.
30.
While the Mexican financial system remains generally resilient, the authorities
are mindful of individual pressure points. The staff highlighted existing pressures on
mutual fund redemptions, potential funding pressures on some small financial intermediaries,
and still substantial holdings by non-resident investors of Mexican portfolio assets.13 The
authorities emphasized that in contrast with previous crises, so far, residents’ portfolios had
shifted within Mexico, towards banks and short-term government paper. However, in the
current volatile financial environment, they stressed that they stood ready to address any
emerging problems rapidly, to prevent them from escalating. A buy-back operation of the
deposit insurer’s debt had helped liquidity in mutual funds, and supervisors were in close
contact with institutions with potential liquidity or funding problems.
31.
The staff stressed the need for taking additional early steps where possible to
head off pressures and support the functioning of financial markets. While the 2006
FSAP Update recognized many strengths of the Mexican policy framework, enhancing tools
for crisis management, contingency planning and monitoring are particularly important in the
current turbulent environment, and further efforts may yet be needed to manage an
impending credit crunch:
•

Coordination among regulators. Though recent policy actions illustrate the
authorities’ ability to act speedily, the existence of multiple regulators could impair
timely and strategic policy responses. The authorities noted that coordination amongst
members of the Financial Stability Committee (FSC)14 is well advanced, with regular
meetings of supervisors and a formal internal protocol on coordinated policy
responses near finalization.

•

Strengthening the bank resolution framework. Although there is a special bank
resolution regime under the banking law, bankruptcy proceedings for banks are
currently undertaken within the corporate bankruptcy framework. This could
potentially slow down aspects of the regulatory response. As part of their ongoing
refinement of the financial policy framework, the authorities have prepared a draft
reform to address these concerns.

13

At end-2007, non-residents held about 25 percent of GDP in Mexican portfolio assets (US$154 billion in
equities and US$117 billion in bonds). These values have likely declined as the peso depreciated, the stock
market fell, foreign investors exited the corporate paper market, and reduced their participation in the
government bond market as part of the generalized emerging market sell-off. Non-residents have additional
exposure to peso denominated bonds through offshore OTC derivatives, though data on these are not available.

29
•

Monitoring the corporate sector. The staff recommended broadening the scope of
monitoring the corporate sectors’ domestic as well as external financing needs,
including the operations of Mexican multinationals’ offshore affiliates. The
authorities concurred, while adding that they have strengthened disclosure on
corporate derivative exposures, noting that the losses in October largely reflected bad
judgment by risk managers in a small number of Mexican corporates.

•

Facilitating financial market functioning. The authorities noted that if needed,
recent measures to support markets—which include Banxico’s expanded liquidity
facilities; a flexible approach to the government’s debt financing strategy to ease
pressures on certain market segments; acting as a buyer of last resort or guarantor;
and direct credit to the corporate sector—could be used more extensively.

•

Preparing for tail risks. Given its low external debt, Mexico is less vulnerable than
many countries to a “sudden stop” of external financing (Figure 10). Even so, staff
noted the value of contingency plans, including on how to use government resources
most effectively to ease the impact of a potential sharp tightening of external
financing conditions for the private sector.

32.
The staff also discussed implications for Mexico of financial sector policies in the
advanced countries. Concerns have been expressed in some quarters that the extension of
guarantees to financial intermediaries and assets in the advanced countries has increased the
relative riskiness of emerging market assets, compounding pressure on asset prices and the
cost of capital. The authorities agreed this was a potential concern, but felt that at present the
sharp increase in global risk aversion was dominating any changes in relative risks.
33.
While near-term financial stability was a key focus, the authorities are also
looking to needed future reforms. Going forward, they saw a need for increased regulation
especially of non-bank institutions. They also hoped to be closely involved with reforms of
the international financial architecture; in this context, some saw merits in the Spanish model
of counter-cyclical provisioning and tighter regulation including of off-balance sheet risk and
structured investments.
C. Medium-Term Challenges and Goals
34.
The environment facing Mexico has deteriorated since the last consultation,
beyond the near-term effects of the global crisis, raising the value of proceeding with
pro-growth reforms. Growth of potential output in Mexico is likely to strengthen less than
previously thought, reflecting a higher cost of capital internationally, and weaker growth in
the U.S. Meanwhile, prospects for lower government revenue from oil exports over the
medium term will reduce “fiscal space” for public sector investments.
35.
In this context, the authorities pointed to recent progress on reforms and agreed
on the importance of maintaining momentum (Box 4). Recent reforms included steps in

Box 4. Outstanding Structural Reforms1
The authorities are committed to an ambitious reform agenda, needed to boost potential growth in Mexico.
Key challenges include:
•

Strengthening competition, particularly in key network sectors, is a priority. Effective
implementation of the 2006 competition law, notably action by the strengthened competition commission,
will be key.

•

Deepening financial intermediation. Access to credit and financial development are low. Reforms aim
to improve access and competition (lower fees and commissions, correspondence banking, investment
regime of pension funds and insurance companies). Contract enforcement and creditor rights’ protection
needs to be strengthened.

•

Improving education. To increase accountability and progressivity, in 2008 the government introduced
standardized national tests and performance-linked pay for primary education.

•

Resolving security issues by fighting crime. This is a priority of the government, with a recently
approved judicial system reform.

•

Boosting competition, flexibility in product and labor markets, and reducing informality. This
includes scope for rationalizing the electricity tariff structure and boosting productivity in the sector—for
example through a reform of the national electricity company akin to the 2008 oil sector reform.

•

Liberalization of foreign trade and investment—removing those barriers to external competition that
still exist in the form of import licensing requirements and limitations on FDI, building on recent steps to
reduce exemptions from custom duties.

the areas of the state-owned oil sector, finance, education, and the judicial system. A plan to
streamline external trade procedures and reduce tariffs on imports from countries with which
Mexico does not have a free trade agreement was also approved late last year. Reforms to
increase security and confront organized crime would continue to be a top priority.
36.
Improving the degree of competition among firms also remains a priority. The
authorities emphasized ongoing progress, despite the absence of “headline” events recently.
Promoting competitive behavior in key network sectors, such as telecommunications,
transportation, and energy, could have major growth benefits and was particularly important.
The staff also urged moving ahead with plans for labor reform, which would be even more
important if net emigration of Mexicans to the U.S. slows.
37.
The staff welcomed the recent reform of PEMEX as a step in the right direction
even though major benefits would take time to materialize (Box 3). The authorities were
confident that this reform would be sufficient to begin the development of Mexico’s
untapped oil resources, including in deep waters.

38.
Looking at the medium term, the staff noted the risk that declining revenue from
PEMEX could constrain the growth of important public sector investments and social
spending. This had been partly offset by the exclusion of PEMEX capital expenditures from
the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) budget target, which allows higher capital expenditures
in 2009 and beyond. Nonetheless, it remains essential to continue to increase revenues
through better tax administration, and keep the growth rate of the public sector wage bill
below that of GDP, as set out in the authorities’ medium-term fiscal plan. Further fiscal space
could be obtained by focusing the costly price subsidy to electricity consumption to those
with low incomes.
39.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline
over the medium term. While the removal of PEMEX expenditures from the budget target
would itself allow an easing of the fiscal stance in 2009 and in the medium term (relative to
the path that would have been implied by the unmodified rule), this effect would dissipate
over the longer term.15 Moreover, the policy rule for the annual fiscal balance now has been
supplemented by a requirement to ensure the orderly evolution of the augmented public
debt—and for this the authorities estimate that it will be necessary to keep the augmented
fiscal deficit at no more than 2½ percent of GDP. The staff also encouraged the authorities to
15

The change relates to accounting for amortization payments, associated with oil sector investment undertaken
in previous years. Until now, these counted as expenditure, reducing fiscal space under the balanced budget
requirement. Indeed, because such amortization payments are scheduled to rise over the medium term, the
unmodified fiscal rule would have required tightening the underlying fiscal position in coming years (beyond
the tightening required to offset the decline of oil export revenue).

33
continue their work to monitor more systematically on and off-budget fiscal risks. This
would be of growing importance in view of the impact of the weakening economic situation
on contingent liabilities—including in the pension system—as well as increasing
development bank guarantees, and public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment.
40.
Finally, the staff and the authorities discussed the possibility of eventually
refining the fiscal policy framework. The balanced budget rule has a number of advantages
and is supportive of fiscal discipline, but some features may be procyclical in nature or do
not always assure the operation of automatic stabilizers. Consideration could be given to a
rule that would allow greater, and more systematic, smoothing of expenditure in response to
cyclical fluctuations (across budget years) in output and the tax base. This would help
smooth the business cycle in a credibility-consistent manner.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Mexico, like other emerging markets, is being increasingly affected by the global
crisis. Ongoing deleveraging and increased risk aversion of foreign investors have placed
strains on many asset classes and institutions in emerging markets, including in Mexico. This
financial shock is now being exacerbated by slumping external demand as the United
States—to which Mexico’s economy is closely linked––faces a deep recession. As a result,
Mexico is expected to experience a sharp slowdown, with substantial downside risks related
to prospects for the U.S., and a further tightening of financing conditions
42.
That said, Mexico faces this external crisis from a position of much greater
strength than in the past. Over the last decade, Mexico has made significant gains in
improving the macroeconomic policy framework––including the flexible exchange rate––and
in strengthening public, corporate and banking sector balance sheets. Correspondingly, the
resilience of the economy to shocks has significantly increased, and—for the first time
ever—the authorities are in a position to respond to a downturn with countercyclical policies.
43.
The current policy challenge is to smooth the downturn while maintaining
stability. Financial market strains have been deftly handled––the policy measures taken since
October have been effective in stabilizing markets. Sentiment has also been helped by the
swap facility agreed with the U.S. Federal Reserve, as well as market perceptions that the
creation of the SLF has improved financing options for key emerging market countries.
44.
The balance of inflation risks is shifting towards room for easing monetary
policy. There should be substantial scope for lowering interest rates during 2009, given the
projected growth slowdown and likely withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2010. However, the
timing is complicated by the fact that there has not yet been a clear downturn in neither
headline inflation nor expectations which remain above target. Balanced against these are the
rising costs to waiting with the growing deterioration in the U.S. outlook. In this context,

34
ongoing steps by the Bank of Mexico to explain to the public the outlook and downside risks,
and prepare the market for policy changes are welcome.
45.
The flexible exchange rate has been a key shock absorber. The depreciation of the
peso in October has helped clear asset markets and rebalance portfolios, while central bank
intervention—in controlled quantities—has helped address liquidity shortages in the foreign
exchange market while preserving the most essential aspects of the flexible currency regime.
From a medium-term perspective, the peso may now be somewhat undervalued, based on the
staff’s various methodologies.
46.
The 2009 budget provides welcome stimulus, but the fiscal stance will need to be
kept under review as the situation develops. The planned stimulus in this year’s budget is
very timely and the fiscal stance at the present exceptional juncture is appropriate. Budget
policy is being supplemented by an important effort to support intermediation and financial
stability through development banks. The policy of hedging the price of oil sold by PEMEX
in the upcoming budget year is expected to pay handsome dividends in 2009—an experience
which may offer lessons to other countries—and should help preserve room for the planned
expansion of spending to support activity. But with the expiration of the oil price hedge, the
stimulus would be largely withdrawn in 2010. Looking forward, further easing could be
considered if the economic situation were to deteriorate significantly more than expected, or
to smooth the withdrawal of stimulus in 2010. However, financing and implementation
constraints and the potential impact on credibility are limiting factors.
47.
Nonetheless, financial conditions remain tight with risks to the downside––early
action to strengthen further the risk management framework is key. Risks in individual
financial sector segments—including smaller intermediaries and corporate financing
prospects—will need to be monitored carefully and it will be important to continue moving
proactively. It would be opportune to press ahead with ongoing efforts to bolster the risk
management framework, including advancing on the proposed reform of the bankruptcy
framework for banks, and further extensions of current risk assessments to analyzing
liquidity and funding risks for banks and corporates. The enhanced coordination amongst the
different financial sector regulators is a welcome step and it will be important to finalize
agreed protocols for joint action and information sharing, while also engaging in “fire drill”
exercises to test readiness.
48.
The increasingly less favorable medium-term environment heightens the
importance of accelerating the reform agenda. Looking forward, potential growth in
Mexico is likely to be adversely affected by a higher global cost of capital, weaker U.S.
potential growth, and falling oil production. This will add to the central challenge facing
Mexico of boosting relatively low levels of output and productivity growth. It will be crucial
to pick up the pace of implementation of the well-identified reform agenda, including on
increasing product market competition and labor market flexibility. The recently approved
PEMEX reform is a step forward, but potential production benefits are some years away,

35
while the effectiveness of the new framework for attracting needed new private participation
is yet to be demonstrated.
49.
Assuring the fiscal space for new public investment and key social expenditures
is another key challenge. Fiscal space is projected to come under pressure over the mediumterm, as oil revenue falls, and pension costs rise. This highlights the importance of achieving
the authorities’ goals for tax administration gains and restraint of current expenditure. Other
policies to raise revenue or cut untargeted subsidies may become necessary. The constraints
to managing the economic downturn within the current balanced budget rule suggest the
possibility of eventually moving to a cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance target. In addition, the
likely increase in contingent fiscal liabilities because of the crisis, underscores the need to
continue enhancing the analysis of fiscal risks, including at the aggregate public sector level.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico occur on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Background and Summary of Informational Annexes
Discussions. The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Mexico City during
December 1–12, 2008. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the Governor and the
members of the Board of the Bank of Mexico, senior staff of several government ministries
and agencies, representatives of regulatory agencies, and banks.
Exchange arrangement. Mexico has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3,
and 4, and does not have restrictions on payments for current international transactions.
Mexico has a floating exchange rate regime since December 22, 1994.
Fund relations. Mexico has no outstanding purchases or loans.
Technical assistance. Since 2005, STA has provided assistance in national accounts. In 2007
and 2008, FAD provided assistance in customs administration, intergovernmental fiscal
relations, and treasury.
Statistical Issues. Core data are adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was
subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. In a number of cases, the
periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements. Still, there is
room for improvement in a number or areas (see Informational Annex III), including
subnational government fiscal and debt statistics.
Relations with the World Bank. As of October 31, 2008, Mexico was the Bank’s eighth
largest borrower with US$4.1 billion debt outstanding, representing 3.3 percent of the
IBRD’s total portfolio. The new Country Partnership Strategy that was discussed by the
Board in April 2008 proposes anchoring most lending in a large annual DPL that will support
government's overall development strategy and will be accompanied by an enhanced package
of non-lending services. As of this date, Mexico's IBRD portfolio consisted of 17 projects
under implementation for a net commitment of US$2.5 billion, of which US$1.4 remain
undisbursed. During this fiscal year, 5 new loans for a total lending volume of
US$1,859 million have been approved. It is expected that by the end of FY 09 a total lending
amount of US$4 billion will be approved for Mexico.

ANNEX II. MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The Bank’s relationship with Mexico in recent years provides a good demonstration of the
Bank’s current role in middle income countries (MICs). On the demand side, as in the case of
many other MICs, Mexico is interested in Bank support for addressing global priorities,
including climate change, catastrophe risk management, and trade integration. The country
also seeks to draw on the Bank’s international experience through high-level technical
assistance, and to maintain its relationship with the Bank as a fallback financing option
should private credit markets fail to provide sufficient liquidity at some future point.
Mexico has been a leading consumer of many of the new or redesigned products and services
that the Bank has developed. It was the first country to use local currency products, which
have eliminated foreign currency risk to financial intermediaries in subnational loans.
Mexico is also a leading implementer of Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants and other
products that help to counter climate change and environmental degradation. Government
officials have worked closely with Bank staff on efforts aiming toward the use of existing
fiduciary and safeguard systems within Bank projects, both to reduce the cost of doing
business with the Bank and to facilitate the development of the country’s institutions. Mexico
has been open to the Bank’s facilitation of dialogue on major development issues such as
poverty and inequality, often through jointly sponsored conferences and workshops. Where
Bank support could not be easily carried out through loan or grant-financed programs,
various units of government have been willing to pay for the Bank’s unique expertise through
fee-based services arrangements.
As of October 31, 2008, Mexico was the Bank’s eighth largest borrower with US$4.1 billion
debt outstanding, representing 3.3 percent of the IBRD’s total portfolio. The new Country
Partnership Strategy that was discussed by the Board in April 2008 proposes anchoring most
lending in a large annual DPL that will support government's overall development strategy
and will be accompanied by an enhanced package of non-lending services. As of this date,
Mexico's IBRD portfolio consisted of 17 projects under implementation for a net
commitment of US$2.5 billion, of which US$1.4 billion remain undisbursed. During this
fiscal year, 5 new loans for a total lending volume of US$1.9 billion have been approved. It
is expected that by the end of FY 09 a total lending amount of US$4 billion will be approved
for Mexico.

5
ANNEX III. MEXICO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The overall quality of Mexican statistics is good.
A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was subsequently published
as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed
SDDS requirements. However, there are various areas where improvements could be made.
The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Real Sector Statistics
A national accounts mission conducted in January 2008 assessed the results of the inputoutput table for the new base year 2003, evaluated the production and generation of income
accounts by economic activity and the sources and methods of the estimates on the nonobserved economy. The mission observed that most of the recommendations on methodology
made by the previous mission conducted in May 2006 had been implemented. The National
Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEGI) compiled the 2003 supply and use table and
the 2003 input-output table, concluded the production and generation of income accounts for
the period 2003–2006, and compiled the 2003 employment and remunerations matrix at
detailed level (3-digit level of the North American Industry Classification System NAICS, 96
sub-sectors). Methods are consistent with the guidelines of the System of National Accounts
1993 (1993 SNA), with some exceptions, such as the lack of estimates for agricultural workin-progress, the no distribution of the financial services indirectly measured (FISIM) by use,
and the allocation of inputs for restaurant services to household final consumption. The
authorities of the INEGI released the new national accounts series in March 2008.
In addition, the Mexican Congress recently approved the law of the National System of
Statistical and Geographical Information (NSSGI), which grants financial and operational
autonomy to the INEGI.
Government Finance Statistics
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the
fiscal balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net
cost of public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts
(PIDIREGAS) as well as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not
been previously recorded. Both the preliminary (available with a 45-day lag following the
end of each quarter) and the final (available mid-year of the subsequent year) data are
published and submitted to congress, ensuring that revisions are transparent and subject to
public scrutiny.

6
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary data, compiled in line with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM), are reported on a regular monthly basis to STA. The authorities
have completed the migration to the new standardized report forms for the central bank, other
depository corporations, and other financial corporations. Due to lack of information,
financial derivatives are not sectorized and their net balance is included as part of Other
Items (Net).
External Sector Statistics
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several measures
to improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on
external liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock exchange
(external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken down
by maturity, and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt service of
commercial banks is still not available. International reserves data are compiled according to
the Operational Guidelines for the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity of the IMF (2001).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Mexico
Approved by David J. Robinson and Philip Gerson
February 3, 2009
This supplement reports on economic and policy developments since the staff report
was issued on January 16, 2009.
1.
Weakening outlook. Weak activity indicators, rapidly declining non-oil exports,
lower remittances, slowing employment growth and depressed confidence measures suggest
that the Mexican economy closed 2008 on a weaker note than projected in the staff report;
indeed, the Ministry of Finance now estimates that the economy contracted at a 1 percent
(y/y) rate in the fourth quarter.1 Prospects for 2009 have correspondingly worsened, and it is
likely that growth will be lower than the staff’s current forecast of -¼ percent.
2.
Orderly markets but tight corporate financial conditions. After their brief spike in
October, government domestic bond yields have declined significantly and are now below
their levels before the turbulence. While the stock market also recovered somewhat towards
the latter part of the year, it dropped about 12½ percent in January on weak activity indicators
in Mexico and in the U.S., Mexico’s main export market. The peso has weakened further
amid relatively calm market conditions, bringing the currency’s cumulative depreciation
since its peak in July to over 40 percent. External corporate spreads remain wide, suggesting
that access to financing is difficult; indeed, a smaller Mexican company has just announced
that it will not be able to meet an upcoming bond payment. However, a larger Mexican
multinational has recently successfully completed a refinancing of $4 billion in obligations
falling due this year.
3.
Fiscal policy stimulus. The weakening economy prompted the authorities to
announce a further fiscal stimulus package in early January. The main measures include
1

This compares to a staff projection of 0 percent y/y growth in the fourth quarter of 2008.

2
higher infrastructure and social spending and development bank lending—partly anticipated
in the staff reports growth and fiscal projections—and temporary reductions in energy prices.2
On the staff’s definition, total fiscal stimulus for 2009 is now estimated at around 1½ percent
of GDP.3
4.
Monetary policy easing. Banxico’s latest quarterly inflation report, released at endJanuary, noted that the outlook for growth had deteriorated sharply, and issued a substantial
downward revision to the growth projection for 2009.4 Although headline inflation was high
at 6½ percent in December and volatile financial conditions remained an upside risk,
inflation was expected to fall sharply to below 4 percent by end-2009 as the economy slowed,
commodity price declines fed through, and recent measures to freeze gasoline prices and cut
gas and electricity tariffs were felt. Against this background, Banco de México cut its policy
rate by 50 basis points in January. Separately, Banxico has this week announced an
extension, through October 2009, of the US$30 billion swap facility agreed in October last
year with the Federal Reserve.
5.
Given rapidly materializing downside risks, staff supports recent monetary and
fiscal policy action. Measures of the fiscal stimulus package are generally well-targeted at
alleviating the downturn. As such, the thrust of the staff’s appraisal remains unchanged.

2

These include a freeze in gasoline prices for 2009 and changes in cost recovery formulae for electricity tariffs
to allow quicker pass through of currently falling input costs.

3

The staff measures fiscal stimulus as the change in the domestic resource balance, i.e. the change in the
augmented balance, less the change in net oil export revenues by PEMEX, with some additional adjustments.

4

Banxico now projects the economy to contract between 0.8 to 1.8 percent in 2009. The late January consensus
forecast for growth is -0.7 percent this year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
[Month, dd, yyyy]

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On February 6, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
Mexico has made substantial progress over the past decade in strengthening its economic
framework. However, the external environment has deteriorated sharply since last year, testing
Mexico’s resilience and current policy framework.
Since September 2008, financial markets in emerging markets, including Mexico, have been
disrupted by shortages of liquidity, and a pull back by foreign investors leading to substantial
asset price drops. Credit growth in Mexico has also decelerated markedly. The abrupt currency
depreciation in October last year resulted in sharp losses for some Mexican companies on
foreign currency derivative positions.
The weakening outlook for U.S. activity, remittances, and international oil prices all weigh on
prospects for Mexico. Growth has begun to decelerate as the U.S. has slowed sharply and
consumer confidence in Mexico has weakened. Real GDP growth is projected at minus
0.3 percent in 2009 with a gradual pick-up in 2010 to annual average growth of 2.1 percent.
Headline inflation reached almost 6.5 percent year-over-year by end-December—above the
3 percent target—mainly pushed up by external supply shocks. However, inflation is expected
to fall towards the target over the next year in the face of a widening output gap.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The current account deficit is expected to widen in 2008—from 1 percent of GDP in 2007––and
then remain in a broadly stable range of 2–2.5 percent of GDP over the next years. Non-oil
export volumes have begun to weaken, reflecting especially the slowdown in the U.S.,
compounding the effect of falling oil export receipts and remittances. However, there will be
some offset as imports are expected to slow in line with moderating domestic demand and the
weaker exchange rate.
The authorities have responded promptly with a comprehensive policy package. On financial
markets, measures including foreign currency intervention and steps to buoy up domestic debt
markets have helped contain stresses, although some pressure points remain. The
announcement of a swap agreement with the Federal Reserve has also supported confidence.
On macro policies, the fiscal stance is set to ease, with a stimulus of about 1.5 percent of GDP
budgeted in 2009. Fiscal policy is on track to achieve balance in 2008−09, on the traditional
budget measures, as required by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). But reflecting the planned
stimulus, the augmented balance is set to widen in 2009 by over 1 percent of GDP from a
projected minus 1.7 percent of GDP deficit in 2008. The government’s oil price hedge policy is
expected to safeguard room for maintaining spending levels in 2009 to support needed
investments and social spending. Meanwhile, the central bank cut its policy rate by 50 basis
points in January, pointing in its statement to an expected downward trend in inflation and the
deteriorating outlook for growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Mexico’s significant improvements in its macroeconomic policy
framework over the last decade, including the flexible exchange rate and rules-based fiscal and
monetary policies, and in strengthened public, corporate and banking sector balance sheets.
Directors noted that, as a result, the economy faces the current external crisis from a more
robust position than in the past and for the first time the authorities can respond to a downturn
with countercyclical policies, while maintaining stability and without jeopardizing medium-term
sustainability. They observed that market sentiment had also been supported by the swap
facility agreed with the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Directors endorsed the planned 2009 fiscal stimulus, which should, along with increased
development bank intermediation, provide timely support to economic activity. They observed
that the counter-cyclical spending increases would protect employment and support low-income
families, increase competitiveness of small-and medium-sized businesses, and augment
infrastructure. Such measures were partly financed in effect by the authorities’ prudent price
hedging of oil sold by PEMEX.
Directors considered that if the economic situation were to deteriorate more or longer than
expected, there could be scope for further fiscal easing in 2009 and also to smooth the planned
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2010. They welcomed the authorities’ recognition of financing
and implementation constraints and the need to carefully weigh the potential impact on hardearned policy credibility.

3
Looking forward, Directors noted that providing the fiscal space for needed public investment
and social expenditures was a key challenge, especially in view of projected lower oil revenues
and rising pension costs. They encouraged the authorities to advance efforts to improve tax
administration and restrain current expenditure, including by refocusing untargeted subsidies.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to refine the fiscal policy framework by giving
consideration to moving from the current balanced budget rule to a fiscal rule that would allow
greater expenditure smoothing in response to cyclical fluctuations, while ensuring policy
credibility.
Directors generally saw the balance of inflation risks as tilted to the downside, suggesting room
for monetary policy easing. Nonetheless, they recognized that still-high headline inflation and
above-target inflation expectations are complicating factors, underscoring the importance of
communication efforts to explain the outlook and downside risks. In that light, they welcomed
the timely interest rate cut in January 2009.
Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate has been an important shock absorber, and
viewed central bank intervention as having helped address liquidity shortages in the foreign
exchange market, while preserving essential aspects of the flexible currency regime. Directors
noted the staff’s assessment that the peso may be somewhat undervalued from a medium-term
perspective.
Directors welcomed the staff finding that the banking sector was well-capitalized, profitable, and
supported by a robust regulatory framework. However, they noted that financial conditions
remain tight and emphasized the need to carefully monitor risks in individual financial sector
segments, including smaller intermediaries and corporate financing. Directors encouraged the
authorities to press ahead with efforts to bolster the risk management framework—including by
advancing the proposed reform of the bankruptcy framework for banks, and extending current
risk assessments for analyzing liquidity and funding risks for banks and corporates. Directors
welcomed the enhanced coordination amongst the different financial sector regulators and
emphasized the importance of finalizing protocols for joint action and information sharing.
Directors considered that acceleration of the reform agenda remained key to improving growth
prospects over the medium term. They welcomed the recently approved reforms in the energy
sector and import tariff reductions as positive steps forward. However, Directors noted that
significant additional progress was needed, including product and labor market reform,
improving infrastructure and education, and strengthening competition.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
