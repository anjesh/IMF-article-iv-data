KIRIBATI
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2009 Consultation with Kiribati
Approved by Kenneth Kang and Dominique Desruelle
April 16, 2009

•

Staff team. Messrs. Khatri (Head), Tokuoka (both APD), and Steinberg (OAP). Mr. Moveni
(OED) joined the mission.

•

Mission meetings. The mission met with President Tong, Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning Teewe, senior parliamentarians, heads of public enterprises, other senior officials,
private sector representatives, and donors.

•

Exchange rate. Kiribati has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The currency of Kiribati is the Australian dollar.

•

Context of past surveillance. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
April 27, 2007. Directors focused on the need for fiscal consolidation and preserving the
Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) by controlling the public sector wage bill and
subsidies to public enterprises, and through structural measures, such as adoption of a
medium-term budget framework and improved revenue administration. Directors welcomed
the new Private Sector Development strategy and urged the authorities to move ahead with
reform to improve the investment climate. The authorities have made some progress with
fiscal consolidation and revenue administration, but capacity constraints have limited the
pace of structural reforms overall.

•

Statistical Issues. Kiribati subscribed to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
in 2004, but the quality of data remains weak and its availability subject to long lags. GDP
and BOP series have been recently revised with Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Centre (PFTAC) assistance. The authorities have requested additional assistance with BOP
statistics and GFS compilation.

•

Outreach: At the end of the mission, the team made a presentation on the Global Financial
Crisis and its Impact on Kiribati (attended by officials and the general public), issued a press
release, and provided a briefing to key donors.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Outlook
•

Growth picked up in 2008 to 3½ percent, mainly reflecting growth in agricultural and
public sector activity. Inflation reached 19 percent by end-2008, with the lagged pass
through of global food prices. The fiscal deficit declined to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2008
(from 16 percent in 2007), reflecting higher fishing license fees (in A$ terms) and some
expenditure constraint.

•

The main impact of the global financial crisis and slowdown has thus far been through
global asset price declines and the depreciation of the Australian dollar (A$). By end2008, government and pension fund assets declined by around one-third (in U.S. dollars);
and inflation remained at around 19 percent in part because of the A$ depreciation.
Growth is projected to slow to around 1½ percent this year with the risks to the downside
stemming from lower customs and fishing license revenues and smaller remittance flows.

•

Growth has been trending downwards, but forceful reforms could enhance substantially
medium-term prospects. In addition to recent improvements in revenue administration,
a number of pivotal reforms are planned—notably reform of public enterprises—the
implementation of which could raise the medium-term outlook.

Policy discussions focused on options for cushioning the impact of global shocks; and on
the need for fiscal consolidation, public sector reforms, and private sector development:
•

In the near term, in the absence of monetary policy options, the authorities agreed that
fiscal policy could help mitigate the impacts of the global shocks through expediting and
bringing forward grant funded projects; and through well targeted social spending if
necessary.

•

Over the medium term, fiscal sustainability requires halving the fiscal deficit and
Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) drawdowns. Staff estimates suggest
reducing deficits to around 6–7 percent of GDP would stabilize the real per capita value
of the RERF. Expenditure and revenue measures combined with structural reforms could
deliver the needed adjustment in the medium term. A well-defined rule for RERF
drawdowns and a medium term budget strategy could help smooth expenditure and
safeguard the RERF. The authorities agreed with the need to contain RERF drawdowns,
but noted some drawdowns were necessary to maintain government services.

•

The mission and authorities broadly agreed on the reform priorities for improving public
sector performance and developing the private sector. Public sector reforms in parallel
with reforms to boost private sector opportunities would create fiscal space for much
needed social spending, and would offer the best chances for success. While there has
been some progress with reforms, progress has been constrained by limited capacity.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The geography of Kiribati poses significant challenges, but also offers
substantial opportunities. Kiribati has a population of around 100,000, nearly half of which
live densely concentrated in Tarawa and the remainder widely dispersed on low lying atolls
in around 3½ million square kilometers of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Like other Pacific
island nations, Kiribati is far from major markets and has a shallow economic base.
Production and exports are limited to copra, seaweed, and fish and much of the population
(particularly on outer islands) lives a subsistence lifestyle. The public sector dominates the
economy and external grants amount to around 60 percent of GDP (Figure 1). Kiribati is also
one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to sea level rise. However, the geography
also provides key sources of sustainable revenue. Fishing license fees, remittances from
Kiribati seamen, and revenues from the trust fund (derived from phosphate up to 1979)
already provide substantial revenue sources.
2.
This year’s Article IV consultation focused on the impacts of the global financial
crisis and slowdown and appropriate policy responses; and revisited longer-term
challenges to economic sustainability. The main impacts have, so far, been through the
decline in public sector financial assets and the depreciation of the Australian dollars (A$);
and have been contained by the limited role of exports, tourism, and FDI in Kiribati. In the
absence of monetary policy, fiscal measures could help address adverse impacts and risks
from the global crisis. In the medium term, there is a need for reducing the large public
payroll and public enterprise subsidies, revenue enhancement, and medium-term budgeting;
and the related need for public sector reform and private sector development. On top of
progress with revenue administration, a number of pivotal reforms are planned—notably for
reviewing and restructuring of public enterprises (PEs)—implementation of which would
transform the medium-term outlook.

The fiscal deficit declined from
16 percent of GDP in 2007 to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2008. This improvement mainly
reflected higher revenue from fishing license fees (in A$ terms), but also some expenditure
constraint, with overall recurrent spending held broadly at 56½ percent of GDP. However,
copra subsidies in 2008 were larger than expected given production was expected to decline
last year with aging trees.

In August 2008, PFTAC assisted the National Statistical Office (NSO) in revising Kiribati’s national accounts
and BOP data (and provided follow-up TA in February 2009 on the national accounts). The new indicative
national accounts data (which suggest GDP levels are 50 percent higher than the official series) reflect the
inclusion of household and informal sector activities, and methodological improvements.

Inflation generally reflects import prices (with a lag related to contracts and shipments) and exchange rates.

In early March 2009, Cabinet approved declines in retail petroleum prices to reflect lower world prices. While
retail prices for petrol and kerosene are controlled, only kerosene was set below the import price.

Large fiscal deficits have
necessitated large RERF drawdowns
(A$25 million in 2008) as the RERF is the
main source of deficit financing. With the
large drawdowns in recent years, and the
global decline in asset values, the RERF has
dropped to around A$4,200 in real per capita
(1996 A$) terms, which is more than
40 percent below its peak in 2000 and below
the previously cited informal target of the per
capita level in 1996 (Box 1).

6
Box 1. Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund
Kiribati’s Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) has been an important source of
income for Kiribati. The fund was established in 1956 and capitalized using phosphate mining
royalties. Under a conservative policy, the fund’s asset grew steadily until 1979 when phosphate
deposits were exhausted. In subsequent years, this conservative approach continued, but there has
been an increase in drawdowns from the RERF since 2001. The fund has been taking a relatively
conservative investment strategy (30 percent equity; 70 percent bonds).

The RERF has been significantly affected by the
global financial crisis. In 2008, the capital loss in
A$ terms was over 10 percent and drawdowns (for
financing budget deficits) mean the per capita RERF
balance dropped by around 20 percent in 2008 to
around A$ 4,200 (in 1996 A$).

nominal returns, the fund is projected to be depleted
in 2030—five years earlier than the projection as of 2007 Article IV consultation. To maintain the
per capita value of RERF (in 1996 A$), a substantial fiscal effort is required. Non-stochastic
simulations indicate that with 6 percent returns, fiscal deficits need to be reduced to around 6 percent
of GDP, implying an adjustment of around 6 percent of GDP from the expected deficit this year.

The asset mix of the fund is not a primary reason for the decline of the fund (the fund still
averaged a 4.5 percent return during 2004–08). In addition to a reduction in fiscal drawdowns,
there is a need for a well-defined target or rule combined with a medium-term budgeting framework.
Successful experiences of natural resource funds (for example in Norway) indicate that formulating a
medium-term plan is effective in allowing expenditure smoothing. If reforms can reduce fiscal
uncertainty, then a more return oriented portfolio mix might be appropriate. Continued efforts to
improve governance particularly through better disclosure, such as regular reports, would also be
welcome.

6.
Most PEs continued to operate with losses, although audited results are
generally not available. The poor performance of PEs likely reflects their pricing policies,
bloated staffing, and the limited transparency and accountability. During 2008, in addition to
on-budget transfers to PEs totaling A$1.8 million, there were continued increases in
government guaranteed loans from Bank of Kiribati (BOK) to cover PE losses (the largest
government guarantees are for the oil, shipping, and telecom PEs; while the Public Utilities

7
Board accounts for around ½ of the direct subsidy on budget). Such contingent liabilities
have increased to around A$40 million (compared to around A$20 last year).
B. Outlook and Risks
7.
Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and slowdown, near-term
growth prospects have deteriorated and vulnerabilities increased:
•

In our baseline scenario, growth and inflation are expected to moderate in 2009.
With the sharp depreciation of the A$, inflation is expected to remain high until the
second half of this year, but then to fall to around 3 percent by end-year. With
inflation having eroded real income and wealth, and continued government
expenditure constraint, growth is expected to be around 1.5 percent this year. The
current account is expected to widen (to 3 percent of GDP) with lower investment
income and grants offsetting the narrowing trade balance.

•

The fiscal balance is expected to improve further, but is subject to significant risk.
With improvements in revenue administration and higher foreign currency
denominated external revenues in A$ terms, the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow
further this year. Customs revenues may also be weaker than expected—there is
already some evidence of lower imports so far this year—as imports decline with real
incomes and the weaker A$. There are also fiscal risks stemming from PE losses and
growing loan guarantees; higher than budgeted copra subsidies; and lower fishing
license revenues.

•

External risks have also increased.
Income from external sources
remains critical—investment income,
and fishing license fees, and
remittances account for around onethird of GNP—and could be
adversely affected going forward
(Box 2). Another risk is a further
sharp depreciation of the A$, which
could exacerbate inflation pressure
and reduce the real purchasing power
of the RERF.

8.
A positive medium-term outlook for Kiribati could be best secured through
forceful reform implementation. Without sustained reforms, growth is expected to fall
below the 2 percent population growth in the medium term, suggesting deteriorating average
living standards (Table 4). Sustained growth in per capita income could feasibly be achieved
by public sector reforms and the expansion of private sector activity as a driver of growth.
President Anote Tong, in his December 2007 policy statement, highlighted the need for

8
strengthening revenue collection, spending discipline, improving management of the RERF,
reviewing the role of PEs, and improving the investment climate; and stated that “the private
sector offers the best prospects for economic growth.” Thus the priorities are well
understood, but capacity constraints have been a key obstacle to implementation. Mediumterm risks to the outlook include a continued period of low investment returns on government
assets and risks associated with climate change.
Box 2. Impact of the Global Financial Turmoil and
Slowdown on Kiribati
The impacts of the global financial crisis and slowdown have been contained by the small role of
tourism, exports and FDI in the Kiribati economy. The main impacts have thus far been through
the sharp declines in government assets and the exchange rate:
•

The RERF and the KPF declined by respectively 12 percent and 20 percent during 2008
(or 31 percent and 37 percent in U.S. dollar terms). The decline in government assets may
constrain government expenditure and thus feed through to growth; and brings forward the
expected RERF depletion date under current drawdown rates (Box 1).

•

The REER and the A$ depreciated by over 15 percent and 26 percent respectively
during 2008 Q4. High world prices for rice last year fed through into domestic inflation
(cushioned somewhat by price subsidies), but the global food price declines have not yet been
reflected in lower domestic prices, in part because of the depreciation of the A$.

Exports and tourism growth prospects will be curbed. With exports, at around 5 percent of
GDP and minimal tourism, the direct impact of the global slowdown on these is unlikely to be
substantial. However, growth prospects (particularly for tourism) will be affected in the near term.
On the plus side the sharp depreciation increases the competitiveness of Kiribati in relation to
other Pacific Islands.
Other channels are uncertain:
•

Investment income could worsen, depending on external developments.

•

Remittances may decline, at least in foreign currency terms, going forward as there seems to
have been a decline in demand for seafarers (the Marine Training Center intake was halved
this year and Fisheries Training Center had no intake this year). However, to the extent that
seamen are paid in foreign currency, there will be some upside in terms of A$ remittances.

•

Official aid flows could come under pressure. Although donors did not foresee such
declines, this could be a danger if donor economies continue to face difficulties.

•

Fishing license fees could fall, if demand and/or the international tuna price decline; but
these are mostly negotiated in U.S. dollars so there could still be a gain in A$ terms.

9
C. External Stability, Exchange Rate, and Competitiveness
9.
Kiribati’s use of the Australian dollar is appropriate given close financial and
trade linkages to Australia and the limited administrative capacity to conduct independent
monetary and exchange rate policies.4
10.
The real effective exchange rate is approximately in line with its long run level.
Taking the 10 and 20 year averages for the REER as indicative of the PPP-equivalent
equilibrium level, the REER in December was still respectively 3 percent and 4½ percent
above the long-run averages. This reflects the long period of A$ appreciation, being only
partially reversed by the depreciation in the last quarter of 2008.

11.
Over the medium term, the external situation and current account deficit are
broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. Staff and the authorities agreed that
the medium-term external situation seems sustainable. Weak exports (which are basically flat
in nominal terms) are explained more by structural factors—remoteness from major markets,
widely dispersed and small size of the islands, poor soil, and overall limited business and
export opportunities—than exchange rate competitiveness. In the medium term, external
stability is not at significant risk given external debt is small (at around 11 percent of GDP
and highly concessional), and external assets are still around 3½ times GDP. In the longer
run, if large fiscal deficits continued, these would eventually deplete the RERF and
undermine external sustainability.
III. POLICIES TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
12.
The mission supported the government’s objective of enhancing economic
growth for sustainable development and welcomed recent progress with reforms. There
is clearly political will at the highest level to move forward with reforms. In addition to
recent revenue administration reforms, the government is planning to review and begin
reform of PEs this year. The mission welcomed these pivotal undertakings and urged the
4

In 2005, 37 percent of imports were from Australia and these accounted for 58 percent of import duties.

10
authorities to forge ahead with their reform agenda in the window available. Public sector
reforms in parallel with reforms to boost private sector opportunities would create fiscal
space for much needed social spending, and would offer the best chances for success.
Experience from other Pacific Islands demonstrates the potentially large and timely benefits
from a bold and comprehensive reform strategy (Box 3).
A. Fiscal Policy and RERF Drawdowns
13.
In the near term, in the absence of monetary policy options, the mission and the
authorities agreed that fiscal policy can help mitigate the impacts of the global shocks.
Deficit neutral options include: expediting project implementation; bringing forward projects
in the pipeline (which donors appeared to favor); and ensuring that any funds remaining
undisbursed due to administrative delays and implementation issues are released by the
authorities taking the appropriate steps. If additional measures are needed to cushion the
impacts on the most vulnerable, well targeted social spending would be better than general
subsidies.5
14.
Over the medium term, fiscal sustainability will require reducing deficits further
and containing off-budget and contingent liabilities. Staff estimates suggest that
preserving the real per capita value of the RERF will require reducing drawdowns to around
6–7 percent of GDP. The decline in the deficit last year and the planned consolidation this
year are important steps towards fiscal sustainability. Reducing the deficit to less than half
the 2008 level will require additional revenue and expenditure measures. Off-budget and
contingent liabilities also need to be carefully tracked and contained. Government guaranteed
PE loans from the BOK have increased sharply. Such loan guarantees and subsidies implicit
in intra-PE transactions—for example, between Kiribati Oil and the Public Utilities Board—
are non-transparent and mask the true extent of the fiscal deterioration.6

In addition, a fiscal buffer would be advisable in the context of longer-term fiscal
risks associated with climate change. Climate change will adversely affect Kiribati in the
near future—with the impact intensifying over time. The main impact will come from rising
sea levels, more frequent and severe storms, and erratic rainfall. While the fiscal costs are
uncertain, they are likely to be substantial relative to GDP. An important first step is to
recognize the fiscal risks involved and to start building a fiscal buffer—with the assistance of
international donors—and to consider the implications for expenditure programs (See Annex
III for a description of the World Bank’s Kiribati Adaptation Program).

The copra subsidies seem to be poorly targeted, favoring the Copra Mill substantially more than copra
producers. The impact of high import prices of rice was offset somewhat in 2008 by subsidies (used to reduce
the margins above import prices, and some rice was also received in-kind and mainly distributed in schools),
funded by Taiwan Province of China. The subsidy was focused on the key staple of low-income families (rice),
and provides an example of how donors could step in to ease the impacts of external shocks.

Public sector loans and overdrafts with BOK are also extremely expensive, with interest rates of 12 percent.

Samoa has achieved a major economic transformation
since the early 1990s. Real per capita GDP increased
faster than elsewhere in the Pacific or in other small
island regions. The transformation owes to a broad-based
reform program since the early 1990s, and facilitated by
political stability:

Vanuatu’s Recent Success
Economic growth in Vanuatu has picked up since 2003, helped by: a booming tourism sector and foreign
direct investment, particularly in real estate by Australians. Introduction of VAT combined with improved
compliance and expenditure controls have improved the fiscal position. Some other factors behind Vanuatu’s
success include:
•

Progresses in transportation and communication sector— Port Vila is now connected with Australia,
New Zealand, and Fiji by several airlines, helped by its proximity to Australia and New Zealand, and the
government’s relaxation of restrictions and opening up to foreign carriers.

•

Sound monetary and financial policy—the basket peg has helped contain inflationary pressures and the
banking sector follows international prudential standards.

•

Political stability—government changed every year during 1995–2003, but political stability under the
former coalition government, which managed to stay in office for four years boosted confidence in the
economy and enabled the government to pursue structural and fiscal reforms.

These experiences highlight the potential benefits Kiribati can reap from fiscal consolidation measures and
leveraging its political stability to pursue deep structural reforms. Transportation links, supported by
appropriate policy, are clearly key to developing tourism for a remote island nation.

12
16.

The mission’s recommendations (similar to the previous consultations) included:

•

Improve tax revenues. Next steps with tax administration could be improving
compliance of large taxpayers by strengthening administration and adoption of a more
effective penalty system; merging tax and customs offices; and establishing single
taxpayer identification numbers. The mission recommended adoption of a broad-based
consumption tax and introduction of excises. As tariffs and customs revenues decline
under regional trade agreements (RTAs), gradual most-favored-nation (MFN) reduction
of tariffs together with adoption of a consumption tax and excises would minimize trade
diversion and could more than offset lost customs revenues.

•

Increase and make more stable fishing license fees: options include (sub-regional)
collective agreements, use of auctions, improved governance and transparency in the
contracting process, and hedging of foreign currency risk.7

•

Expenditure measures. Government
spending is large (around 115 percent
of GDP) and the public sector
accounts for two-thirds of formal
sector employment. Medium-term
expenditure adjustment will require
reductions in the wage bill, through
controlling numbers;8 and improving
performance of PEs and reducing
subsidies (discussed below).

The authorities are well aware of the need for fiscal consolidation and for
containing RERF drawdowns and have taken measures to do so. The authorities’ priority
for tax administration reform is adoption this year of “PAYE Final”—which involves tax
deductions from wages and simplification of the tax structure, such that much fewer
assessments are required—which will free-up resources to focus on compliance, particularly
of large taxpayers, through audits. They plan to consider the next steps with tax
administration after progress with these priorities. The authorities reiterated plans to
introduce a broad-based consumption tax, but capacity constraints have hindered progress,
and they indicated the need for further preparation and technical assistance. They agreed that
excises could compensate for the revenue losses from RTAs (which may be at least
15 percent of current customs revenue). The authorities noted recent efforts to extend the
7

Potential gains are difficult to estimate—we use a conservative assumption of $22 million a year from fishing
licenses (around the 2008 level) over the medium term.

Civil service reform should be done in conjunction with reforms to increase private sector opportunities
(discussed below) and appropriate social protections.

13
tenor of fishing licenses and the possibility of collective regional agreements or regional joint
ventures. On the expenditure side, the authorities reported freezing civil service numbers in
recent years, and constraining increases in the wage bill to at most the rate of inflation
(increases were substantially below inflation in 2008); but noted the difficulty of reducing
numbers given large scale unemployment.
18.
The mission suggested a well defined target or rule for the RERF combined with
a move to a medium-term budget framework would allow expenditure smoothing (in the
context of volatility in revenues) while safeguarding the RERF. A target of retaining the
RERF’s real per capita value (at or near the current level) in the medium term seems
appropriate from the perspective of inter-generational equity. Longer-term external stability
considerations (and the need for a fiscal buffer to cushion the impact of climate change)
would favor a more conservative policy. More immediately, given the high costs of
overdrafts with BOK, improved cash planning and commitment control are needed.
19.
The authorities felt it was important to stabilize the RERF balance over the
medium term. They noted that RERF drawdowns were necessary to maintain government
services as expanding the revenue base will take time. The authorities would like to build
capacity to analyze the RERF management and performance for themselves, but remain
committed to a relatively large share of less-risky assets. The authorities recognize the
importance of a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) and indeed plan to move to a
MTBF with the support of the ADB and others, over the next five years.

The mission and authorities agreed
that development of the private sector is
key to boosting sustainable growth.
Kiribati’s draft Private Sector Development
Strategy (PSDS) appropriately addresses the
key priority areas.9 The mission supported
the overall strategy and recommended that
the authorities move forward with a
monitorable implementation plan, including
timelines and accountability for deliverables.
The authorities’ focus on developing

-2
Sources: IMF, World Economic Outlook ; and Kiribati authorities.

The draft PSDP (scheduled to be finalized this year) focuses on creating an enabling environment through:
promoting business culture; improving access to land; restricting the scope of public enterprises and promoting
fair competition; improving licensing and infrastructure services; improving access to capital; and creating a
conducive investment climate.

14
Kiribati’s vast marine resources and tourism is appropriate and Kiritimati Island will be
important in this regard.10
21.
In addition, the mission suggested sustained growth in per capita income could
be achieved by:
•

Improving the performance of PEs. The mission recommended limiting PE operations to
areas where private sector operations are not viable. Putting the PEs on a sound financial
footing will require adjusting prices, increasing efficiency, and improving financial
management (such as reducing reliance on costly overdrafts and loans). Enhanced
monitoring (such as through annual disclosure of audited financial statements), increased
accountability, and reduced implicit and cross-subsidies are key to improving
performance of PEs.

•

Improving the investment climate. In addition to crowding out by PEs, constraints on
private sector growth include the cumbersome permitting and registration processes,
price controls, and restrictions on activities open to foreigners (ADB), (Figure 4).

•

Improving land titling and registration and associated financial intermediation. Progress
has been made on Kiritimati island—progress elsewhere will be difficult, but is
important.

The authorities regarded private sector development as a priority and reported tangible
progress and concrete plans in key areas:
•

Reviewing and restructuring PEs. Recognizing their fiscal burden and constraint on
private sector development, the authorities reported plans (awaiting parliamentary
approval) to review and restructure PEs. The plan suggests 15 (out of 24) public
enterprises should “exit” (which could involve privatization or liquidation). The
authorities acknowledged the need to improve monitoring and accountability of PEs,
especially through regular disclosure of audited financial accounts. ADB and AusAid are
providing technical assistance on exit and reform of PEs respectively.

•

Introducing competition. The authorities expressed concern about private sector
monopolies (particularly in the context of PE reform) and have targeted improved
competition. So far, a new airline has been allowed to directly compete with Air Kiribati;
Digicell is expected to enter the cellular communications market; and increased financial
sector competition is targeted (discussed below).

10

Kiritimati Island is relatively large, and has much potential for eco-tourism and fishing; and the land is
government owned, thus limiting land tenure issues.

15
•

Development of tourism. The authorities stressed tourism as an immediate and viable way
of increasing growth, but recognized Kiribati’s remoteness and the challenge of ensuring
regular flights.
C. Financial Sector Issues

22.
Financial intermediation in Kiribati is limited, as is financial sector competition.
The BOK (the only commercial bank, 25 percent government owned and 75 percent owned
by ANZ), and the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) invest most of their resources abroad,
although lending to central government and PEs by BOK has increased significantly. The
Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK) makes loans to small businesses, but poor risk
management has led to high non-performing loans. With only one bank and one insurance
company, competition is limited and BOK customers have regularly complained about high
fees and interest charges resulting from its monopoly position.11
23.
The mission agreed with the authorities on the need for greater competition, but
cautioned that an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework should be in
place. In the insurance sector, the Kiribati Insurance Act was changed in December to allow
entry into the insurance industry. The government is also considering the commercialization
of the DBK as a means to introduce competition for deposits and loans from BOK. Still
DBK’s large portfolio of non-performing loans (thought to be around one-third of total loans)
is a concern, and further expansion of its activity should be limited until an appropriate
regulatory and supervisory framework is in place—particularly with regard to risk
management.12 The draft financial sector legislation, prepared with the assistance of PFTAC,
seems to have been shelved and there has been little focus on financial supervision.
24.
KPF’s historical dividend policy and the recent sharp decline in foreign asset
prices have resulted in its financial position deteriorating to the point where liabilities
exceed assets.13 The mission recommended limiting dividends until capital returns to prudent
levels (an independent actuarial study suggested that KPF should carry 25 percent of total
capital in reserves). In the medium term, KPF should review its investment strategy and
dividend policy, based on international best practice.

11

Around 20 percent of BOK’s loans are consumer loans, with the rest relating to government and PEs. BOK’s
parent (ANZ) issued new guidelines governing credit allocation which have resulted in loan tenures declining,
but these have not yet resulted in a contraction of credit.
12

Government financial corporations generally fail to comply with statutory accounting and reporting
requirements on a timely basis; and there is a lack of adequate and effective internal control and risk
management systems.
13

KPF changed its investment policy in 2008 to a 60–40 split between risky assets and fixed income assets,
from 50–50 previously. At end-2008, member funds (A$100 million) exceed the asset balance (A$77 million).

16
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Kiribati’s geography poses major challenges, but also offers growth
opportunities. Kiribati’s marine and natural resources—through fishing and tourism—can
boost sustainable growth.
26.
In the absence of other policy options, fiscal policy could be used to counter the
impacts of the global slowdown. Deficit neutral options, such as expediting or bringing
forward project implementation, could be supplemented, if necessary, by well targeted social
expenditure to ease the impacts on the most vulnerable.
27.
Over the medium term, fiscal sustainability will require halving deficits and
RERF drawdowns. Fiscal consolidation will require a strategy that phases expenditure
reductions with tax policy and administration measures. On the expenditure side, the focus
should be on controlling civil service salaries (through numbers), and reducing PE subsidies
and loan guarantees. On the revenue side, the priorities are to further strengthen revenue
administration, adopt a broad-based consumption tax, introduce excises, and improve fishing
license revenues. A well-defined rule for RERF drawdowns (such as maintaining the real per
capita level of the RERF), in conjunction with a medium-term budget framework would help
smooth expenditure and safeguard the RERF. Most immediately, improved cash management
is needed.
28.
Public sector reforms in parallel with reforms to boost private sector
opportunities, would offer the best chances for success. In addition to civil service
reforms, reviewing and restructuring PEs (including through exits), and improving their
performance (through improving financial management, monitoring and accountability)
would support growth, private sector development, and help create fiscal space for much
needed social expenditure; and greater private sector opportunities would support public
sector reforms. Key in this regard is improving the investment climate and land titling;
introducing competition; and development of marine resources and tourism.
29.
The financial system requires greater competition, but also an appropriate
regulatory and supervisory framework. Given DPKs large NPLs, expansion of its
activities should be preceded by an appropriate risk management framework. KPFs
investment strategy and dividend policy should be reviewed, and dividends limited until
KPF’s capital position is strengthened.
30.
The use of the A$ remains appropriate, given the extensive financial and trade ties
with Australia.
31.
Recent data improvements will support improved policy making. However, there
is much scope to further strengthen data compilation and dissemination.
32.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a
24-month cycle. The authorities would welcome a more regular dialogue including in the
form of an interim staff visit early next year.

APPENDIX. KIRIBATI: MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS
This appendix describes key assumptions in the medium-term projections and summarizes the
results of the two scenarios.
Baseline policy scenario
Policy assumptions. In the absence of deep structural reforms, medium-term real GDP growth
declines to 1.1 percent. Current expenditure is assumed to increase in line with GDP growth.
Tax revenues also increase at this pace, and the losses of custom revenue due to the regional
trade arrangements are partly offset by administrative reform.
Outcome. The fiscal deficit (in percent of GDP) would increase gradually, as revenue in percent
of GDP declines while current expenditure (in percent of GDP) is flat. The RERF would decline
to A$ 3,500 in real per capita terms (1996 A$) in 2014 from A$4,200 in 2008, as drawdowns to
finance the fiscal deficits are large.
Adjustment scenario
Policy assumptions. In the adjustment scenario, fiscal and structural reforms (including PEs
reform and revenue reform) are fully implemented. The medium-term real GDP growth is
3.1 percent, 2 percentage points higher than that in the baseline scenario. Continued fiscal
reforms help to increase the tax and customs revenue to GDP ratio by 1 percentage point
annually in the medium term (with phasing in of a consumption tax and excises starting in
2010); and reduce the current expenditure to GDP ratio by 1 percentage point annually.1
(Development expenditure financed by external grants stays at the 2008 level in the mediumterm in both scenarios).
Outcome. In this scenario, GDP would be higher by around 20 percent in FY2014 than in the
baseline scenario. Fiscal reform would contribute to a continuous reduction in the fiscal deficit
(the deficit would be reduced to around 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014). With substantially smaller
fiscal deficits, the RERF balance would stop declining in real per capita terms (1996 A$) in the
medium term.

1

This reduction still allows current expenditure to grow in nominal terms at around 3.5 percent annually.

ANNEX II. KIRIBATI: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of March 2009)
The Centre’s assistance to Kiribati since 1998 has included 27 advisory missions. Kiribati also
sent 11 officials to regional seminars and workshops. PFTAC organized three attachments.
Tax administration and policy
PFTAC recommended reforms in 2003 which included: a value-added tax (VAT);
presumptive tax; and a single ad valorem tax on imports from non Pacific countries;
simplified personal income tax (PIT); single rate of corporate income tax (CIT). A steering
committee was established to manage the introduction of the reforms
The domestic revenue issues require to be addressed with some urgency. Compliance levels
are low and the impact of trade liberalization (PICTA and PACER) is expected to reduce
trade revenues by up to 15 percent on which Kiribati is highly dependant.
Although agreed to in principle little progress has been made to introduce the reforms.
However in February 2009, the cabinet approved the introduction of legislation to treat
income tax deductions from salary and wages (PAYE) as a final tax. There is some
confidence in Kiribati that the legislation will be passed through the Parliament. It is hoped
that the more substantial changes to reform the tax base will follow.
PFTAC has indicated that it stands ready to assist the authorities implement the reform once
the cabinet has made a firm commitment to proceed. Meanwhile, AusAid is funding a
customs automation project and PFTAC has indicated a willingness to assist a broader
customs modernization project upon request.
Public financial management
AusAid maintains a long-term TA program aimed at improving public sector financial and
economic management. A joint PFTAC mission with Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on
public financial management reform was undertaken in August 2006. Following this mission,
a multi-donor mission of AusAID, PFTAC, and AsDB visited Kiribati from
1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance
(TA) institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AusAID, and NZAID, with the IMF as Executing Agency. The
Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that
can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

4
12–15 December 2006. NZAID was represented by AusAID on the mission. Discussions
were held with the objective of implementing the recommendations made by the earlier two
missions. Two areas, implementation of a multi-year budget framework and a cash planning
and commitment control system, identified by the PFTAC August 2006 mission, were agreed
to by the government for immediate implementation. A draft ToR for setting up a multi-year
budget framework has been sent to the government for its comments and approval is awaited.
Also awaited are the governments request to initiate work on cash planning and commitment
control.
Financial sector regulation and supervision
In August 2003, the PFTAC advisor and an IMF legal expert visited Kiribati to conduct
consultations with industry and government officials on a Financial Institutions Bill that had
been drafted in July 2002. No major concerns arose from the discussions. Proposed responses
to comments raised in the meeting, together with appropriately amended draft legislation,
were forwarded to the authorities in December 2003 for action. In 2005, the advisor was
invited to attend a government and industry workshop to discuss aspects of the Financial
Institutions Bill. The mission did not precede however, the advisor provided authorities with
papers, which highlighted the need for such legislation. To date there has been no further
progress on the draft Financial Institutions Bill or the previously drafted Anti-money
laundering legislation. The PFTAC advisor makes periodic contact with the Ministry of
Finance regarding the status of the draft legislation.
Economic and financial statistics
GDDS metadata was published on the IMF website in April 2004, following assistance with
drafting by PFTAC. A brief mission was undertaken in August 2006 to assess TA needs. The
BOP compiler benefited from training provided in a regional course in April 2005. The
presence at the University of the South Pacific in Suva of a senior statistician was utilized to
arrange an attachment with PFTAC in 2006 to help build practical knowledge in Kiribati’s
economic statistics compilation. The PFTAC Multisector Statistics Advisor (MSA)
undertook a balance of payment (BOP) and national account (NA) statistics review mission
in August 2008, and assisted the authorities in improving compilation methods and use of
source data, as well as providing training. The MSA also provided assistance in revising and
updating the BOP and NA estimates. A follow-up NA statistics mission by a short-term
expert was undertaken in early February 2009 to continue developing NA statistics data
sources and methods provide further training and to update the estimates. PFTAC is also
sponsoring a one-month attachment for the BOP compiler with Statistics New Zealand in
May 2009.

5
ANNEX III. KIRIBATI: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(As of March 2009)
Kiribati became a World Bank Group member in 1986. Since that time the Bank’s assistance
consisted of a range of regional initiatives and the development of a major Global
Environment Facility (GEF) program on adaptation to climate change (Kiribati Adaptation
Program 2003–15). The Bank’s assistance to Kiribati, guided by the government’s own
priorities articulated in the National Development Strategies 2004–07 and the Bank’s broader
Pacific Regional Engagement Framework 2006–09 focuses on helping the country to prepare
for the effects of climate change and rising sea levels, which the government recognizes as
having the potential to have major social and economic consequences. A revised Pacific
Regional Engagement Framework, addressing Kiribati and eight other Pacific Island member
countries is under preparation.
The World Bank has no ongoing International Association for Development (IDA)
operations. Various trust funds support the development and implementation of the Kiribati
Adaptation Program. Phase I of the Kiribati Adaptation Program started in 2003 and was
completed in 2006. Phase II of the Program (KAP-II) was approved on 1 June, 2006, with a
US$1.8 million GEF grant as well as co-financing by the government, AusAID, and NZAID.
KAP-II aims to develop and demonstrate the systematic diagnosis of climate-related
problems and the design of cost-effective adaptation measures, while continuing to integrate
climate risk awareness and responsiveness into economic and operational planning. Lessons
learned from KAP-II would be used to plan the long-term national response to climate
change, and will be relevant to many other small island states around the world.
Following the release of the World Bank report “At Home and Away: Expanding Job
Opportunities for Pacific Islanders through Labor Mobility” (August 2006), Kiribati
participates in the two active temporary worker schemes in the region established by the
governments of New Zealand in 2007 and Australia in February 2009. In response to the
increase in global food prices, the World Bank is preparing a regional crisis response
program using a US$6 million grant received from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust
Fund. The program is expected to include a possible development policy operation in
Kiribati, currently estimated at around US$2 million. A World Bank team undertook a
mission to Kiribati in June 2008 to assess the impacts of the 2008 food and fuel crisis and a
second mission will return in April 2009 to identify operational design options.
Kiribati is also expected to receive assistance under the proposed Pacific Regional
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), a multi-donor trust fund principally supported by the
government of Australia. The Facility aims to support a broad range of infrastructure and TA

6
activities throughout the Pacific. A World Bank mission involving each of the four PRIF
development partners visited Kiribati in June 2008 to identify priorities for support including
the provision of advisory services in the areas of telecommunications, public utilities,
environmental management, and the management of state-owned enterprises, as well as
possible investment needs.
Total loan commitments:

None. A US$645,580 grant from the Japan Climate Change
PHRD funds (administered by IDA) was signed on
February 19, 2003, a US$99,100 Project Development Fund
grant from GEF was signed on October 28, 2004, a
US$1.4 million grant from AusAID was signed on June 27,
2006, a US$310,216 from NZAID was signed on September 4,
2006, and a US$1.8 million World Bank Trust Fund was
signed on July 6, 2006—all for the preparation and
implementation of the Kiribati Adaptation Program.

IFC investments:

None.

7
ANNEX IV. KIRIBATI: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of March 2009)
The Asian Development Bank has approved six project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$15.1 million, all from Special Fund resources. In addition, TA amounting to
US$12.8 million has been provided for 36 projects. The latest AsDB loan to Kiribati was
approved by AsDB in December 1998 for a Sanitation, Public Health, and Environment
Improvement project. The AsDB most recently approved an $800,000 TA grant for
Economic Management and Public Sector Reform in November 2008.
The strategy of the AsDB in Kiribati directly supports the government's Kiribati
Development Strategy (NDS) 2008–11. Further, AsDB’s approach is anchored in the midterm review of the Pacific Strategy, which put a stronger emphasis on issues of supporting a
conducive environment for private sector development, good governance, and capacity
development. Rapid population growth and urban migration has left Kiribati with
overcrowded urban areas, and its most pressing development challenges are social and
environmental concerns, including the impacts of climate change, access to clean water and
sanitation, and the spread of HIV/AIDS. AsDB supports the government’s efforts to balance
growth more evenly throughout the country through TA for the Integrated Land and
Population Development Program on Kiritimati Island. AsDB also supports efforts to
improve the government's financial management through TA for Economic Management and
Public Sector Reform recognizing the sizeable constraint the poor performance of public
enterprises is placing on government ability to fund needed goods and services.

ANNEX V. KIRIBATI—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 31, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Balance of
payments is the most affected area.
National Accounts: With PTFAC’s assistance, GDP estimates have been significantly improved.
During the last mission of February 2009, revised estimates up to 2007 and provisional estimates for
2008 were near completion. The estimates have been revised to include informal economic activities,
based on the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Also, the constant price estimates
were rebased to 2006 prices. However, further capacity building would be needed to continue to
improve the quality of GDP estimates. PFTAC has also recommended that the statistics authorities
work more closely with other agencies (e.g., tax authorities, public enterprises). There are no
expenditure-based GDP estimates. Also, unemployment indicators are not regularly available.
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index (1996=100) is produced with a short lag (about a
month), based on a survey in the capital (a national index is not available). There are no producer,
wholesale, or trade price indices.
Government finance statistics: Budget outcome is available with a lag of about a year. Currently, a
provisional budget outcome for 2008 is available. There are misclassifications in the current statistics,
which have been identified by PFTAC. Audited financial statements of public enterprises are not
available.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati,
Development Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance Corporation) are
available with lags, but the consolidated balance sheets of the financial sector is not available. Data
on interest rates are reported with a long lag.
Balance of payments: The quality of the data has been improved with recent PFTAC assistance.
However, there still remain some shortcomings: i) external statistics are reported with a long delay
(about a year or more), ii) there are large errors and omissions in some years, which appear to partly
reflect the underestimation of private transfers, iii) and there are some inconsistencies between the
balance of payments data and budget data. Given capacity constrains, the most recent balance of
payments estimates are available for 2007. As in the case of GDP data, PFTAC has suggested the
need for further statistical capacity building. In this regard, PFTAC plans to provide follow-up
assistance this year (2009), together with Statistics New Zealand.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since 2004.

No data ROSC available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook,
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati
On May 1, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kiribati.1
Background
Economic activity picked up in 2008 with growth reaching 3½ percent (following a mild
contraction in 2007), largely reflecting growth in agricultural and public sector activity. External
sources of income (investment income, fishing license fees, and remittances) have remained
critical and account for around one-third of GNP. The Australian dollar (A$) is used as the
domestic currency.
Inflation increased to around 19 percent by end-2008, largely reflecting higher food prices.
Administered fuel prices mean that the public sector absorbed the impact of the run-up in global
fuel prices through mid-2008. The sharp depreciation of the A$ during the last quarter of 2008
has in part offset the subsequent decline in international food and fuel prices.
The fiscal deficit declined from 16 percent of GDP in 2007 to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2008. This
improvement mainly reflected higher revenue from fishing license fees (in A$ terms), but also
some expenditure constraint. Large fiscal deficits have necessitated large drawdowns from
Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) (A$25 million in 2008) as the RERF is the main
source of deficit financing. With the large drawdowns in recent years, and the global decline in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
asset values, the RERF has declined substantially in real per capita terms. Furthermore, most
public enterprises (PEs) have continued to operate with losses, and there have been large
increases in government guaranteed loans from Bank of Kiribati to PEs. On the positive side,
there has been notable progress with improving revenue administration.
The current account deficit was broadly unchanged in 2008. The stock of external debt was
around 9 percent of GDP at the end of 2008, with most borrowing on concessional terms from
the Asian Development Bank. External debt service is around 11 percent of exports of goods
and services.
Structural reforms are underway, although the pace has been limited by capacity constraints.
Plans to review and restructure the large number of loss making PEs have been announced.
Kiribati’s draft Private Sector Development Strategy also addresses the key priority areas for
creating an enabling environment for business. Developing Kiribati’s vast marine resources and
tourism are key, but Kiribati’s remoteness and the difficulty of ensuring regular flights are major
challenges.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent improvement in economic activity. They observed
that, while Kiribati faces challenges from its remote location and vulnerability to climate change,
strong policy performance would contribute to maintaining financial stability, and support Kiribati
in taking advantage of its vast marine and natural resources, and growth opportunities in fishing
and tourism, to sustain economic growth.
Directors considered that, in the absence of monetary policy options, fiscal policy could be used
in the near term to counter the negative impacts of the global economic slowdown, including by
bringing forward projects and through well-targeted social spending if necessary. They stressed,
however, that over the medium-term deficits would need to be reduced in order to maintain
fiscal sustainability. Directors welcomed the recent improvement in revenue administration.
They indicated that, going forward, fiscal consolidation will depend on additional revenue and
expenditure measures including the further strengthening of revenue administration, the
introduction of consumption tax and excises, and enhanced fishing license revenues. On the
expenditure side, priority should be given to controlling the public sector wage bill, and reducing
subsidies and loan guarantees to public enterprises.
Directors noted the substantial decline in the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) due
to large drawdowns and global asset prices declines, and agreed that a well-defined rule for
drawdowns from the RERF and a medium-term budgetary framework could help smooth
expenditure and safeguard the RERF. They also stressed the importance of improving public
sector cash management given the high cost of bank overdrafts.

Directors welcomed the planned review and reform of PEs as critical to promoting private sector
development, and to boosting the growth potential. The rationalization and reform of PEs by
enhancing their financial management, transparency and monitoring would create fiscal space
for much needed social spending and increase the scope for private sector activity. Improving
the investment climate and land titling, enhancing competition, and developing further Kiribati’s
marine resources and tourism would also contribute to promoting private sector development.
Directors observed that greater competition together with an enhanced regulatory and
supervisory framework would strengthen the financial sector. Given the large share of
non-performing loans and its plan for expansion, the Development Bank of Kiribati should
improve its risk management. In light of its weak capital position, the investment strategy and
dividend policy of the Kiribati Provident Fund should be reviewed.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in national accounts and balance of payments
statistics, and looked forward to further improvement in data compilation and dissemination.

and Raynold Moveni, Advisor
May 1, 2009
Introduction
Kiribati shares the common characteristics of most small island economies: small landmass,
dispersion of the islands, and significant distance from international markets. These
disadvantages make the cost of delivering government services expensive, hinder growth of
domestic markets, and preclude economies of scale production. However, the Kiribati economy
is also supported by several positive attributes. Firstly, Kiribati has a strong traditional culture
which, to a large extent, has acted as a social safety net for I-Kiribati, and has also provided a
stable socio-political environment over the years. Secondly, and despite still being a young
nation, Kiribati is a vibrant democracy and follows good governance practices. Since the end of
phosphate mining in 1979, successive governments have prudently managed proceeds from
phosphate mining through the Reserve Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), and have responsibly
used income from fishing license fees to fund government services.
Our Kiribati authorities valued this year’s Article IV consultation during a time when the global
economy is under strain. The authorities also consider this Article IV to be a timely one because
the discussion has provided invaluable input to the government’s deliberations on policies
critical to move Kiribati forward. Like other countries, Kiribati has been affected by the global
turmoil and the staff report provides a detailed description of channels through which Kiribati
continues to be affected.
Economic Developments and Outlook
Based on available data, Kiribati’s economy is estimated to have grown by 3½ percent in 2008,
reversing the mild contraction recorded in 2007. Strong agricultural activities, particularly copra
production, and stronger-than-expected growth in public sector activities were the main driving
forces behind this growth. Formal sector employment expanded by about 15 percent to around
50,000 in 2008. Domestic inflation remained subdued in the first half of 2008, while the banking
sector remained profitable, liquid, and well-capitalized.
As a small island economy isolated from international markets, Kiribati has been affected by
international developments with a lag. The pass-through of the international food price shock to
domestic prices sent domestic inflation surging to 19 percent at end-2008 from just 3 percent at
end-2007. As a result, consumer spending slowed considerably, prompting businesses to scale
back operations and reducing government revenue collections. The downturn in foreign asset
prices has also affected the value of RERF, which has been the authorities’ principal source of
budget deficit financing, and the balance sheet of Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF). Combined with
the downturn in international trade and associated reduction in demand for Kiribati’s primary
exports (copra and fish), this confluence of factors is combining to reduce activity growth and
constrain fiscal position.

2
The authorities expect real GDP growth to slow down in 2009 and the domestic inflation to
return to its normal trend of 2-4 percent in the second-half of 2009. In addition, once customs
and tax reforms are completed later this year, the authorities expect government revenues to
increase and, with prudent expenditure administration, for the overall fiscal position to improve
further this year. The authorities agree with staff that forceful implementation of reform
beginning this year is the key to placing the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path,
Fiscal Sector
As in previous years, the main fiscal objective of the government in 2008 was to maintain a
budget that is affordable and consistent with the unofficial target of maintaining the real per
capita value of the RERF at the 1996 level. Accordingly, recurrent expenditures were capped at
56½ percent of GDP, recruitments were frozen, development expenditures were confined to
donor funding, and rigorous measures were introduced to strengthen revenue administration.
Indeed, the authorities were broadly on track to achieve their 2008 fiscal target in the absence of
the international food and fuel price shocks. To minimize the impact of rising prices on poor, the
authorities introduced a price subsidy on rice. Notwithstanding these pressures, the overall fiscal
deficit, as a ratio of GDP, declined from 16 percent in 2007 to 13 percent in 2008. This
improvement largely reflects higher-than-expected revenue collections, particularly from fishing
license fees, and better expenditure administration.
Because of Kiribati’s enormous Exclusive Economic Zone (covering some 1.24 million square
miles of the Pacific Ocean), fishing license fees are Kiribati’s single most important source of
government revenue. Compared to 2007, revenue collections from this source have increased by
about 27 percent to A$32.2 million and contributed more than 41 percent of government
revenues in 2008. Compared to other revenue sources, collections from Inland Revenues are
small. This is consistent with the pace of private sector development and economic structure of
Kiribati, where most people not employed in the public sector are engaged in subsistence
farming and fishing. However, in the medium-term, the authorities are anticipating Inland
Revenue collections to increase once the customs and tax administration reforms are completed
later this year. Funded by AusAID and other multilateral institutions, the reforms are aimed at:
(1) strengthening and modernizing the customs and tax administration framework; (2) improving
the capacity of tax customs service to increase collections; and (3) facilitating the authorities
planned move to PAYE final this year, whereby the tax bracket not subject to tax will be
increased from A$1800 to A$4000 and the tax structure simplified. The authorities expect
revenue loss of between A$1.2 million to A$2.1 million a year as a result of that increase but that
this loss will be offset by tax gains as the planned move to PAYE final will free up resources to
focus more on compliance through tax audits.
To increase government revenue collections in the medium to long-term, the authorities are
committed to: (1) developing the private sector so that tax revenues can increase; (2) expanding
the tax base through the adoption of a broad-based consumption tax; and (3) increasing revenue
earning from, and improving the administration of, granting fishing licenses through close
collaboration with Forum Fisheries Agency and other coastal states in the region. On the
expenditure side, the authorities are committed to adhering to a cap on recurrent expenditures of
56 percent of GDP, confining development expenditures to donor funding, and following

3
responsible expenditure management practices. In addition, with assistance from bilateral and
multilateral development partners, the authorities plan to develop a long-term budgeting and a
multi-year budgeting framework.
Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund
Drawdown from RERF has been the principal source of budget deficit financing. However, as
staff has rightly point out, the global crisis has eroded the value of RERF and substantial fiscal
adjustment is required to keep the per capita value of RERF constant at the 1996 level. Thus, in
line with the need to maintain the capacity of RERF to sustain future budgets, the authorities
will: (1) review existing guidelines relating to the protection of RERF capital value; (2) improve
public and parliamentary understanding of RERF performance through enhanced transparency
and; (3) consider introducing a legislative restructuring of RERF into a national reserve fund not
accessible to government without parliamentary approval; and (4) with assistance from ADB,
will move to a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) over the next five years and will
incorporate RERF within that MTBF. The authorities expect these planned measures to protect
RERF in the medium-term and, in that context, welcome staff’s recommendation to reduce the
drawdown of RERF through the reduction in fiscal deficit.
Financial Sector
Kiribati has a small financial sector comprising of one commercial bank (Bank of Kiribati
(BOK)), a development bank (Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK)), a superannuation fund
(Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF)), and an insurance company (Kiribati Insurance Limited (KIL)).
Based on recent data, BOK is profitable, liquid, and well-capitalized. However, KPF is showing
signs of financial stress as demonstrated by its negative capital position at end-2008, reflecting
the downturn in foreign asset prices and a legislated dividend policy requiring KPF to declare a
7.5 percent dividend each financial year. In an attempt to boost its capital position, the KPF has,
since 2007: (1) allowed additional voluntary contributions from its members; (2) taken on board
voluntary contributions from seafarers, I-Kiribati, working abroad, and outer island copra
workers; and (3) changed its investment strategy by investing 60 percent of its assets on growth
assets. Recent information also suggests that DBK could also be in financial distress due to a
large portfolio of non-performing loans.
Because the size of the financial sector is small, financial intermediation is very limited and
financial sector competition is virtually non-existent. Thus, to encourage competition, the
authorities in December 2008 have amended the Kiribati Insurance Act to allow entry into the
insurance industry. Similarly, the authorities are also contemplating commercialization of the
DBK. In these regards, the authorities agree with staff’s recommendation on bringing into force
robust financial sector legislation and strengthening the financial sector supervisory framework
prior to commercializing the KDB.
Structural Issues and Medium-term Challenges
Because of its physical geography, Kiribati is exposed to many risks. The Staff Report provides a
thorough description of these risks and recommendations on the way forward. The government
has developed a “Kiribati Development Plan: 2008-2011”. This plan takes as its starting point

4
the desirability of the private sector becoming an engine of growth. This is particularly
challenging in Kiribati’s case due to shortages of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and
limited investment opportunities. Nonetheless, to provide an environment conducive to private
sector growth, the Cabinet has approved a plan to reform all PEs. That approval will pave the
way for the government to divorce itself from 15 out of 24 PE businesses that the government
has assessed the private sector could run more efficiently on a commercial basis.
As part of the Development Plan, the authorities and their development partners have taken a
number of initiatives to address skill shortages in Kiribati. Those initiatives include:
(1) providing tertiary scholarships to I-Kiribati in priority fields; (2) establishing a KiribatiAustralia Nurses Initiative whereby I-Kiribati youths obtain Australian nursing qualifications and
industry experience; (3) equipping Kiribati Teachers College with appropriate tools or resources
to train and produce high-quality teachers; (4) improving quality of local curriculum and
assessment, raising educational standards, providing high-quality curriculum resources for
schools; and (5) strengthening the domestic maritime institution to train and produce high-quality
seafarers. Progress has been achieved in these areas and that the authorities are hopeful of
reaping the benefits of these initiatives in the coming years.
The authorities are also committed to a sustained increase in per capita growth through:
(1) developing fully and commercializing the fisheries and marine resources either through a
public-private partnership with reputable foreign investors or a close collaboration with coastal
states in the region to obtain maximum sustainable EEZ access fees; (2) developing tourism in
the Line and Phoenix island groups; (3) expanding production and export of fish, prawns, and
solar salt from Kiritimati Island; (4) strengthening and diversifying the copra industry;
(5) developing human resources for local and foreign labor markets; (6) encouraging private
sector to invest in industries that Kiribati has comparative advantage in such as seaweed farming
and pet fishing and; (7) providing supporting infrastructure; and (8) fostering good relationships
with existing and potential bilateral and multilateral development partners. The road ahead will
be challenging but with strong political will, and help from development partners, and
multilateral institutions, the authorities are hopeful of addressing some of Kiribati’s challenges
and moving the economy forward.
Final Remark
Finally, our Kiribati authorities express their sincere gratitude to the Mission Chief and his team
for the candid and productive exchange of views during the Article IV consultation in Tarawa,
and for their frank assessment of the developments in the economy. They also welcome the
well-written and succinct staff report, which provides a balanced account of the economy’s
performance.
