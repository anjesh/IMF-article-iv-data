Executive Summary
Macroeconomic performance continues to be strong, but inflationary and external
pressures are evident. Economic growth reached 8.4 percent in 2004/05 (July–June) and is
expected to remain high. Inflation has accelerated and is likely to stay above the authorities’
target over the coming year. Import growth has also been rapid, moving the current account
into deficit during 2004/05, despite higher worker’s remittances.
Indicators point to progress toward poverty reduction. High growth, including in
agriculture, is estimated to have raised disposable incomes. A recent survey shows
improvements in various health and education outcomes. Further increases in health and
education spending are nonetheless needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Pakistan’s medium-term outlook is favorable. The authorities’ ambitious growth
objectives require substantial increases in investment, including from the private sector.
Public investment has been increased to ease bottlenecks in transportation, irrigation, and
energy. Likewise, reforms to improve the investment climate are being undertaken, though
weak governance in some public sector institutions remains a problem.
In the short-run, macroeconomic policies need to be tightened somewhat to counter
inflationary and external pressures. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has raised its policy
rates substantially, but key interest rates remain slightly negative in real terms. Further
increases in interest rates seem warranted as monetary growth is still high. A modest
tightening of fiscal policies relative to the budget would alleviate demands on monetary
policy. The government has already taken steps to offset pressures on the budget from rising
oil prices, but for 2005/06, a small increase in the deficit is still projected. Some additional
revenue effort and tight expenditure control could contain the deficit at last year’s level.
Better revenue performance is needed to achieve medium-term fiscal objectives. The
government is targeting higher social and development spending, while further reducing the
debt-to-GDP ratio. Stronger tax efforts will be required to achieve these targets. Enhancing
compliance of existing tax payers is a first step to improving collection, but a strategy to
extend the tax net into the service and agriculture sectors needs to be developed quickly.
Vulnerabilities have been reduced. Debt dynamics are favorable, and international reserves
are adequate. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated slightly in early 2005, but
competitiveness is not a concern so far. The financial sector has strengthened further as
reflected in financial soundness indicators and resilience in standard stress tests.
Structural reforms are progressing. The sale, together with management control, of
26 percent of the public telecommunication company was the largest transaction so far in
Pakistan’s privatization program. The sale of several other important companies is under
way. However, energy sector reforms are taking longer than envisaged.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The key challenge facing Pakistan is to continue building on the impressive
economic gains of the last half decade. Persistent implementation of reforms has paid off:
growth in 2004/05 was amongst the highest in the world; vulnerabilities have been reduced;
and Pakistan has regained access to international capital markets. While the acceleration of
inflation and the emergence of a current account deficit are to some extent the “price of
success,” they point to the need for careful macroeconomic management, including to deal
with the oil price shock. But this should not detract from recent achievements. Moreover,
Pakistan is better placed than at any time in the recent past to sustain growth over the
medium term and achieve a lasting reduction in poverty.
2.
Cooperation with the Fund has been fruitful. In contrast to earlier experience, the
2000 Stand-By Arrangement and the 2001–04 arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility were implemented steadfastly, as discussed in the Ex Post Assessment of
Pakistan’s Longer-Term Program Engagement (Box 1, refer to www.imf.org). Furthermore,
many of the recommendations made during recent Article IV consultations have been
implemented (Text Table 1).
3.
The political and security situation has been calmer in recent months. Local
elections in August gave support to the ruling coalition, although there was some scattered
violence. With parliamentary elections scheduled for 2007, there is now a window to address
remaining macroeconomic and structural problems. Pakistan and India continue working to
enhance economic integration, including through the framework of the South Asian Free
Trade Area.
Box 1. Ex Post Assessment of Pakistan’s Longer-Term Program Engagement
The main findings of the ex post assessment (refer to www.imf.org) were:
•

•

Pakistan’s Fund-supported programs during 2000–04 were successful because of strong
ownership, especially by the central government. International support helped the recovery from
late 2001.
Progress was slower in areas where broader institution building or cooperation from lower
levels of government was needed. Tax collection remains disappointing and the energy sector
continues to pose a large drain on the budget. This highlights the complexities in designing
structural conditionality, which seems more effective in areas covered by the central
government.

The authorities generally welcomed the report’s findings. They emphasized that increased ownership was
indeed the main factor behind the economic turnaround. As such, while some officials viewed
conditionality under the 2000 Stand-By Arrangement as punitive, others said that most of the measures
needed to be implemented regardless of the Fund. The authorities expressed frustration with the frequent
need for waivers of structural performance criteria, even for minor deviations or brief delays. They urged
the Fund to review its procedures for deciding whether a performance criterion has been met or not.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Pakistan’s macroeconomic performance continues to be favorable, but
inflationary and external pressures are evident. Growth is estimated to have reached
8.4 percent in 2004/05 with strong domestic consumption and investment demand offsetting
the adverse impact from net exports (Text Figure 1, Text Table 2, and Table 1). Rapid
growth continued in manufacturing, partly export driven. Timely rains contributed to bumper
harvests. However, 12-month inflation reached 11 percent in April 2005, before easing to
8.4 percent in August (Text Figure 2), reflecting monetary tightening and government
measures to increase food imports (including from India). Core inflation has remained at
8 percent in 2005. Asset prices (including real estate) had shot up, but have cooled since the
stock market correction in March 2005. The correction did not have a significant impact on
economic activity (Box 2).

Box 2. Stock Market Developments
Equity prices have risen substantially over the last 3½ years before suffering a correction in early
2005 (Text Figure 3). The performance through 2004 reflected largely the economic turnaround, while
privatization prospects lifted share prices of partly floated public enterprises. However, the 65 percent
increase during the first 2½ months of 2005
Text Figure 3. Pakistan: Karachi Stock Exchange
appears to have been speculative. An inquiry into

the boom and subsequent correction found that
11000

some key players abused weaknesses in the system
to profit from price manipulations. In particular,

5.
Despite higher worker’s remittances,
the current account moved into deficit in
2004/05 (Text Figure 4 and Table 2). Exports
and imports have grown rapidly (Text Figures 5
and 6). Following the end of the textile quota
system, textile exports rose by 15 percent in the
first six months of 2005 over the same period in
2004. Faster import growth reflected both higher
oil prices and strong demand, including for
machinery. Gross international reserves fell
somewhat in 2004/05 to $10 billion (over four
months of projected imports), notwithstanding a
continued increase in non-debt-creating inflows
and substantial concessional financing by the
Asian Development Bank and the World Bank
Group.

Fiscal targets for 2004/05 were broadly met. The overall deficit (excluding grants)
was 3.3 percent of GDP, roughly in line with the budget, but up 1 percentage point over the
2003/04 outcome (Text Figure 7 and Table 3). Compared with the budget, the drop in the
tax-to-GDP ratio and modestly higher-than-budgeted spending were largely offset by higher
nontax revenues. While the Central Board of
Text Figure 7. Pakistan: Fiscal Developments,
Revenues (CBR) met its nominal target, the tax
2000/01–2005/06
ratio fell because of the elimination of excises

The SBP has tightened monetary policy significantly. In addition to inflation going
into double digits, capacity utilization rates had reached 80–100 percent in some key
industries (Text Table 3). Since the beginning of
Text Figure 8. Pakistan: Interest Rates and
2005, the SBP has raised the six-month treasury bill

Progress has been made in structural reforms, notably privatization. In June, the
largest privatization transaction in Pakistan’s history took place, with the sale, together with
management control, of 26 percent of the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. The
winning bid amounted to $2.6 billion (2¼ percent of GDP). The sale of several other major
companies is under way, including Pakistan Steel and Pakistan Petroleum. However, the sale
of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation has been delayed, as the auction winner did not
meet the payment deadline. Negotiations are continuing with the other auction participant.
Energy sector reforms have again taken longer than envisaged. While some progress has
been made in unbundling WAPDA, the individual distribution companies still cannot operate
independently because their tariffs have not been set.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
The key challenges facing Pakistan are to sustain strong growth over the medium
term and improve living standards, while tackling existing and emerging vulnerabilities.
Medium-term growth prospects depend importantly on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks
and emerging skill shortages, while improving the investment climate. Progress on poverty
reduction will require further increases in social spending, particularly on health and
education. Concurrently, Pakistan should strive to further reduce its still relatively high public
debt burden. Raising the revenue ratio will be essential to achieving these objectives
simultaneously. Against this background, discussions focused on:
•

sustaining growth over the medium term;

•

the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix in 2005/06;

•

identifying and addressing vulnerabilities;

•

improving revenue performance; and

•

assessing poverty reduction efforts.
A. Sustaining Strong Economic Growth

10.
The authorities are targeting growth in the 6–8 percent range over the medium
term, which they consider the minimum to achieve their development objectives and
substantial poverty reduction.2 They were confident that the institutional reforms of the past
five years (including the Fiscal Responsibility Law,3 more central bank independence,
financial sector reforms, and privatization) had laid the basis for noninflationary growth. But
2

Growth sustainability in Pakistan is analyzed in the accompanying Selected Issues paper (refer to
www.imf.org).

3

The Fiscal Responsibility Law, inter alia, requires that government debt is reduced by 2½ percentage points
per year, places a ceiling on government guarantees, and calls for social and poverty-related expenditures of at
least 4 percent of GDP. See also Selected Issues paper IMF Country Report No. 02/247.

- 12 -

substantial public infrastructure investments were still needed to remove key bottlenecks in
the areas of transportation, irrigation, and energy. Moreover, reforms to improve the business
and investment climate are in progress, including streamlining the tax and judicial systems,
and overhauling regulations and procedures that slow private sector development. To address
emerging skill shortages, the authorities are strengthening higher education and technical
training.
11.
Public sector governance remains an irritant to some private investors. A recent
International Finance Corporation study lists land regulations, tax administration, business
registration procedures, and labor regulations as significant investment barriers.
Liberalization, updating legal frameworks (some dating back to colonial times), labor reform,
automation and e-government solutions, as well as one-stop shops are proposed in the study
to improve the investment climate. According to World Bank staff data, corruption is still a
frequent phenomenon in interactions with the government. Nevertheless, according to the
World Bank’s 2005 Doing Business survey, Pakistan made progress in enhancing the
business climate and compares well within the region. The authorities said they were putting
priority on creating an environment conducive to investment. Governance in key
macroeconomic institutions, including transparency, had already been improved, as attested
to by the data, fiscal transparency, and various financial ROSCs.
12.
The authorities considered Pakistan well placed to benefit from regional and
global opportunities. Improved relations with India are setting the stage for bilateral trade to
increase rapidly from its current depressed levels. Likewise, the reconstruction of
Afghanistan is offering business opportunities. The opening of Gwadar port should make
Pakistan a regional transport hub, serving central Asia and some parts of China. Staff
stressed the need for export diversification to make the economy less vulnerable.
B. The Macroeconomic Policy Mix for 2005/06
13.
The growth outlook for 2005/06 is favorable. The authorities and staff largely
agreed on macroeconomic prospects for 2004/05. Growth is projected at 7 percent as the
contribution of agriculture is expected to return to a more normal but positive level.
However, there is still a weather-related risk that agricultural output will be lower than
projected. High international oil prices and their impact on global demand pose another
downside risk, but are unlikely to cause a major slowdown given the domestic demand
momentum. Many indicators show that investment has been rising and new capacity will
come on stream during 2005/06 (Text Table 4); however, national accounts data appear to
understate private investment because of incomplete coverage of firms and underreporting.
In addition, strong export growth should continue, assuming the textile industry continues to
adjust successfully to new world market conditions. Inflation has settled in the 8–9 percent
range, though the authorities see more signs of an immediate decline than the staff. The
current account deficit is projected to widen, in part reflecting the oil price increases, but
privatization inflows are expected to boost international reserves to $12 billion by
end-2005/06.

14.
The 2005/06 budget targets an increase in the overall deficit to 3.8 percent of
GDP. This reflects a drop in nontax revenues, which is only partly offset by expenditure
restraint. However, nontax revenues are budgeted conservatively, as previously. CBR
revenue is projected to remain almost flat in percent of GDP; again, a number of tax relief
measures for exporters and manufacturing were introduced in the budget. Expenditures are
envisaged to decline relative to GDP in several categories, including defense and subsidies,
which may be ambitious, while development outlays remain unchanged. Even with the
increase in the fiscal deficit, government debt would fall to 53 percent of GDP given a very
favorable growth-interest differential and substantial privatization receipts.
15.
The government has taken steps to offset pressures on the budget from rising
international oil prices and should be able to achieve the target. The authorities agreed
that high oil prices no longer appeared temporary and that the differential between
international and domestic oil prices could undermine the budget (Box 3). As such,
significant increases in petroleum retail prices were implemented in September and October.
In addition, the government is now targeting modestly higher-than-budgeted CBR revenues,
and has increased nontax revenue projections to more realistic levels. Expenditures will be
tightly controlled, with priority given to achieving the development spending target.
16.
Staff called for containing the deficit to last year’s level to alleviate the demands
on monetary policy. With the economy operating close to potential and domestic demand
growing rapidly, a fiscal impulse seems untimely. The concomitant financing needs are
likely to require T-bill rate increases in excess of what may otherwise be needed to contain
inflation and could crowd out the private sector. Absent such harsh tightening, the SBP
might—as in 2004/05—again be forced to provide substantial budget financing, which would
add to inflationary pressures. The authorities stressed the importance of meeting Pakistan’s
growing infrastructure needs. They could not commit to keeping the deficit below the
budgeted 3.8 percent of GDP, but said they would seize any opportunity to minimize the
increase in the deficit, including through further oil prices adjustments.

- 14 -

Box 3. The Impact of Global Oil Price Increases
Rising international oil prices have not yet had any visible adverse impact on growth. About
40 percent of Pakistan’s energy consumption is petroleum-related, and virtually all petroleum products
are imported. Nonetheless, the impact on growth has been negligible so far, partly because adjustment of
domestic retail prices has been incomplete, but also because rising investment, consumer confidence, and
favorable agricultural output have helped sustain growth. High oil prices resulted in a current account
deterioration of 1 percent of GDP in 2004/05; a similar impact is projected for 2005/06.
The automatic oil price adjustment
mechanism has been suspended. Previously,
retail prices were adjusted fortnightly
according to the import-parity price, adding
freight, distribution costs, dealer margin, sales
tax, and a levy, which generated up to
1 percent of GDP in revenues. As oil prices
rose, the government smoothed the impact on
domestic prices by lowering the levy (Text
Figure 11), and raising consumer prices only
occasionally. By May 2004, the average levy
was zero, and the government had to provide
an outright subsidy, in addition to some crosssubsidization between products.

1/ The weighted series takes into account the relative quantity of each product sold.
Incomplete adjustment of retail prices is
exerting pressures on fiscal policy. In
2004/05, the fiscal deficit was about 1 percent
of GDP higher due to lost revenues and increased subsidies. For 2005/06, the authorities have again
budgeted negligible revenues and a subsidy. The recent rise in oil prices has been largely offset by the
increases in retail prices in September and October. No significant additional pressures are expected if
WEO oil price projections materialize.

17.
The authorities intend to rely on monetary policy to contain inflation, with fiscal
policy laying the basis for medium-term growth. They were confident that the recent
tightening of monetary policy, combined with measures to increase domestic food supply,
would be sufficient to achieve the 8 percent inflation target in 2005/06. Nevertheless, as
stated in the July 2005 monetary policy statement, the SBP stood ready to raise T-bill rates
further if necessary. The authorities agreed that external privatization receipts needed to be at
least partly sterilized to prevent lower interest rates from undermining the SBP’s antiinflation stance.
18.
Staff cautioned that inflation may not decrease soon and that somewhat tighter
monetary and fiscal policies were needed. Given the authorities’ policy mix, staff projects
12-month inflation at about 9 percent by June 2006, reflecting lags in monetary policy
transmission (Text Figure 12), the fact that lending rates have yet to fully reflect rising T-bill
rates (Text Figure 13), and the recent pass-through of petroleum price increases. While
moderate inflation may have limited adverse effects in the short-run, staff believes there is a

- 15 -

risk that inflationary expectations become ingrained around 10 percent. Perhaps more
importantly, there is a risk that external imbalances could build, as indeed suggested by July–
August 2005 trade data. Eventually, a much harsher tightening to restore macroeconomic
stability could be required with adverse effects on growth. However, with a neutral fiscal
stance and suitable monetary tightening, 12-month inflation could come down more quickly,
and inflationary expectations would be re-aligned with the government’s target range. The
current very rapid import growth would also decelerate more sharply.

The real exchange rate level is broadly appropriate. Staff noted that, based on the
Reinhart/Rogoff 4 approach, the Pakistani rupee appears to be de facto pegged to the
U.S. dollar (Text Figure 14). This has led to a minor real appreciation, given relatively high
domestic inflation (Text Figure 15). Nevertheless, the SBP sees the Pakistani rupee as
appropriate or even slightly undervalued relative to Pakistan’s trading partners and
competitors. Staff agreed that the real exchange rate level was broadly appropriate, citing
strong export growth, rising market share, the small variation of the real effective exchange
rate, and a still limited current account deficit, partly driven by investment activities (Box 4).

classified as de facto band.

20.
But staff cautioned that further
real exchange rate appreciation would
undermine competitiveness. The
deterioration in the terms of trade, rapid
import growth, and the need for incentives
for the textile sector suggested that
nominal exchange rate flexibility could be
needed quite soon to protect
competitiveness, if the inflation
differential is not reduced. The SBP
reiterated its commitment to exchange rate
flexibility, but would continue to intervene
in the foreign exchange market to prevent
excess volatility.

Box 4. Assessment of External Competitiveness
Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate has been on a depreciating trend for the last five years. However, with
the modest appreciation in the first half of 2005 and the shift of the current account into deficit, the issue of
real exchange rate appropriateness has emerged again.
The strong performance of Pakistan’s exports, including the shift toward manufactured exports and the
increase in market share, is not a definitive indicator of competitiveness, given that Pakistan is opening up to
trade and that imports have also increased rapidly. However, the widening trade deficit has been partly
financed by a significant increase in private transfers, and the recent surge in imports has been fuelled in good
part by imports of machinery, an indication that cyclical factors may explain these developments.
A cross-country comparison of price levels does not show evidence of misalignment of the Pakistani rupee.
Looking at bilateral purchasing power parity (PPP), exchange rates for four important competitors suggest
that market exchange rates are broadly in line with the predictions of relative PPP theory (Text Figure 16).
Bilateral market exchange rates lie mostly within, or close to, the illustrated band of ±1 standard deviation of
the PPP exchange rate—or the level consistent with a constant real exchange rate over the past two
decades.1/

C. Vulnerabilities Have Been Reduced
21.
Debt dynamics appear favorable over the medium term. The authorities noted that
the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Law mandates continued debt reduction by at
least 2½ percent of GDP per year. Staff projects domestic and external debt to continue on
their downward path (Table 8), assuming that real growth steadies at 6 percent, external and
domestic demand remain robust, and the fiscal deficit is restrained below 4 percent of GDP
(Tables 9, 10 and Figures 1, 2). The trajectory of debt reduction, however, gradually flattens
as the growth-interest rate differential narrows from the currently highly favorable gap.5
Also, the debt-to-revenues and debt-to-exports ratios remain high, reflecting the relatively
small values of Pakistan’s government revenues and exports. However, rollover and interest
rate risks are modest and exchange rate risk is comparable to other emerging markets. Debt
sustainability bound tests indicate that the public debt path would remain on a downward
trend with shocks to growth, or the primary fiscal balance. However, a large exchange rate
depreciation would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio, though, subsequently, it would return to its
downward trend.
22.
Under the authorities’ scenario, the debt burden is reduced more rapidly. This
assumes growth rising to 8 percent in 2008/09, and the fiscal deficit gradually being reduced
to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2009/10, as a result of stronger revenue mobilization. Staff strongly
supported the intention to bring the deficit down to the 2004/05 level, and urged that this be
done as soon as possible. Nonetheless, staff is somewhat more cautious on revenue
projections given the recent track record.
23.
Under an alternative low-growth scenario, government debt to GDP would
stabilize at the 2005/06 level as lower revenue and higher interest costs push up the
deficit. Such a scenario could be triggered by either a slowing world economy or domestic
turbulence that limits investment. The projections abstract from policy responses, which
would be required under the Fiscal Responsibility Law. On the external side, the current
account deficit would be somewhat higher, calling for additional commercial borrowing by
the government (Tables 11 and 12).
24.
The authorities considered the current international reserves level adequate.
They were not concerned about the modest fall in reserves during 2004/05, and argued that
the current account deficit was largely covered by non-debt-creating flows. There were no
sustained pressures on the exchange rate. A further increase in international reserves should
be realized in 2005/06 on account of external privatization receipts. Staff welcomed the sharp
increase in reserves since 2001, which has allowed Pakistan to catch up with levels
maintained by similarly-placed countries (Text Figures 17a and 17b). Pakistan’s reserves
5

External debt is largely on concessional terms, and the average domestic interest rate has come down as some
instruments have been better aligned with market rates. However, with domestic rates on the rise, the differential
is projected to narrow.

- 19 -

holdings appear in line with cross-country benchmarks, but are by no means excessive
(Text Table 5). Staff also noted that it will be important to use privatization receipts in
2005/06 and beyond to build reserves, as Pakistan integrates into the world economy.

To maintain market presence, the authorities intend to continue tapping
25.
international capital markets once per year. Given the availability of concessional
financing and privatization receipts, Pakistan does not need market financing. Nevertheless,
maintaining market presence following successful recent issues is considered essential by the
authorities. Staff cautioned that external bonds should be designed to minimize the build-up
of rollover, exchange rate, and interest rate risks.
The authorities pointed to further strengthening of the financial sector. Banks’
26.
financial soundness indicators have improved, and the sector shows resilience in standard
stress tests (Box 5 and Table 13). Staff questioned whether another increase in the absolute
minimum capital requirement was necessary given the improving capital adequacy ratio. The
authorities argued that some banks were too small and further consolidation was needed.
Staff also cautioned that the high rate of credit growth may lead to compromised prudential
standards. The rapid credit expansion had already resulted in a rebound in corporate
indebtedness, though in general, corporate vulnerabilities were declining and in line with
comparator countries.6 The authorities were confident that banks had strengthened
substantially their risk management. But they agreed that, given improving nonperforming
loan ratios, this may be an opportune time to tighten specific provisioning requirements and
better prepare banks for any future problems.
The SBP noted that it has recently increased the frequency of open market
27.
operations and focused on stabilizing overnight rates. This has reduced volatility in
banks’ funding costs. Going forward, staff recommended that the SBP consider to announce
a target band for the overnight rate and gradually replace T-bill rates with the overnight rate
as the key intermediate monetary policy target. The resumption of long-term government
bonds auctions envisaged in the 2005/06 budget should revive the secondary market and
extend the maturity of government debt.

Box 5. Banking System Update1/
Pakistan’s banking system is expanding strongly
and becoming more competitive. In 2004, total
assets and customer deposits grew by 20 percent and
22 percent, respectively, while gross loans expanded
by 38 percent—faster than in many comparator
countries (Text Figure 18). Concentration declined,
with the market share of the five largest banks
slipping to 56 percent, from 62 percent in 1997, prior
to reforms.
Loan growth, led by consumer financing, has
boosted profitability. After-tax returns on assets
reached 1.4 percent in the second quarter of 2005—a
far cry from the chronic losses of 1997–2001.
Consumer financing now accounts for over
10 percent of loans.

As nonperforming loans fall, the banking system’s capital cushion is expanding faster than riskweighted assets (Text Table 6). Notwithstanding improving financial soundness indicators, periods of
sustained rapid credit growth can mask a buildup of vulnerabilities. Thus, the SBP recently mandated
special provisioning requirements for secured and unsecured consumer financing of 1.5 percent and
5 percent, respectively. The nonperforming loan ratio on consumer financing remains below 1 percent,
compared with over 10 percent for all loans.
Stress test results underscore the need for continued supervisory vigilance. Staff updated some of
the stress tests reported in the 2004 FSSA (IMF Country Report No. 04/215), Text Table 7).2/ Resilience
to a regulatory tightening has fallen marginally, but vulnerability to a (severe) credit shock is broadly
unchanged. Vulnerability to an interest rate, exchange rate, or an equity price shock has increased
somewhat. Resilience to a property price crash, conversely, has improved, as reliance on real estate
collateral has wound down.

Office was being expanded and has started to develop
a debt management strategy. Moreover, the SBP has
established a roadmap for implementation of Basel II,
and steps have been taken to strengthen the regulatory
framework of the stock market after the excessive
speculation in early 2005. Pakistan’s EMBI+ spread
relative to its peers was evidence that the market has
viewed these developments favorably (Text Figure 19).

D. Revenue Mobilization

29.
Staff noted that tax buoyancy has been disappointingly low despite ongoing CBR
reforms. CBR revenue declined in percent of GDP in 2004/05 and is expected to remain
roughly flat in 2005/06. This has to some extent reversed the limited gains under the PRGF,
and has curtailed the fiscal space available for social and development spending. The
authorities responded that the decline reflected transition costs of streamlining the tax system

- 23 -

to improve the business climate. Staff agreed that streamlining was important, but regretted
that tax relief measures had been granted in the last two budgets. Moreover, staff expressed
concern that the exemption from sales tax of the textile value added chain might undermine
the self-enforcing nature of the system. The authorities argued that this would increase CBR
collection because they were previously unable to control fraudulent refund claims.
The CBR is focusing on enhancing compliance of existing tax payers. Despite
30.
high growth and profitability, two-thirds of corporate tax filers reported declining or
unchanged income in 2004/05. Hence, the CBR saw scope for increasing collection from
existing taxpayers. Staff agreed, but encouraged the renewal of efforts to extend the tax net
into the agriculture and service sectors (including real estate and capital gains). This would
create a more efficient and equitable tax system that could generate the resources needed for
social and development expenditures while maintaining fiscal sustainability. The authorities
agreed, but noted that the taxation of agriculture and services was a provincial prerogative,
and past efforts in these areas had shown little result. Staff suggested that these issues be
treated as part of the overall discussions on allocating tax revenues in the National Finance
Commission.
E. Poverty Situation

31.
The authorities were confident that gains had been made in poverty reduction.
High growth, in particular in agriculture, is likely to have raised disposable income,
including in rural areas. Indicators of wages and employment have recently risen
significantly. Results from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey
show improvements in various health and education outcomes (Table 14). Pakistan also
improved its ranking in the 2005 United Nation’s Human Development Index (135th place
out of 177 countries in the 2005, up from 142nd in 2004). The authorities noted that results
later this year from the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey will provide valuable
additional information about progress in poverty reduction. Staff appreciated these
developments, but cautioned that high inflation—if left unchecked—could erode many of
these gains.
Staff encouraged the authorities to further raise health and education spending.
32.
Achieving the Millennium Development Goals remains challenging for Pakistan, and health
and education expenditures are still relatively low in international comparison (Tables 15
and 16). While health and education spending has increased substantially in recent years
(Table 17), they are budgeted to remain broadly unchanged in real per capita terms during
2005/06, partly because of local capacity constraints. The authorities agreed it was crucial to
increase the quality and effectiveness of social spending, including through the
implementation of a medium-term budget framework, and enhancing administrative and
financial capacity at the district level. In this regard, staff looks forward to the revised
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which the authorities intend to present in 2006.

- 24 -

F. Statistical Issues

33.
Staff believes that data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance (see
Appendix III). Notwithstanding this, fiscal data suffer from a large statistical discrepancy;
government expenditure data based on economic classification are not available; and early
publication of quarterly national accounts would facilitate within-year analysis of economic
developments. Staff encourages the authorities to continue improving data on the basis of the
recent ROSC recommendations and to take the remaining steps to subscribe to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

34.
Pakistan’s economy continues to gain momentum. Reflecting strong domestic and
external demand, growth is projected to exceed 6 percent for the third consecutive year in
2005/06. While the terms of trade have recently been unfavorable, Pakistan continues to
benefit from rising private transfers, textile exports, and foreign investment, despite security
and governance concerns. Some preliminary evidence that poorer segments of the population
are benefiting from strong growth is becoming available. However, the growth acceleration
has been accompanied by inflationary pressures, and, in 2004/05, the current account shifted
into deficit. In all, macroeconomic performance has been remarkable given that 5–6 years
ago the economy was in crisis.
Ambitious growth objectives have been set. Given the past experience in Pakistan,
35.
the targeted 6–8 percent growth is probably the minimum needed to substantially reduce
poverty over the medium term. The authorities have rightly identified the lack of physical
and human capital as key constraints to growth. The ongoing boost in public spending to
rectify the shortage of transportation and irrigation infrastructure is therefore welcome.
Curtailing the large energy subsidies and channeling additional resources into development
and social spending, especially education and health, would further improve growth
prospects.
The medium-term fiscal framework is broadly appropriate. Pakistan has taken
36.
advantage of the favorable international climate and stronger domestic economic
performance to reduce vulnerabilities greatly in recent years. Key public and external debt
indicators are projected to continue improving, though some remain very high by emerging
market standards. In this context, staff welcomes the approval of the Fiscal Responsibility
Law, which provides a framework for continued debt reduction while raising social
expenditures.
But medium-term fiscal objectives can only be met with a marked improvement
37.
in revenue performance. Tax buoyancy has been a disappointment, partly caused by tax
relief measures and subsequent erosion of the tax base. While streamlining the tax system to
improve the investment climate is important, it needs to be accompanied by determined
efforts to bring previously untaxed sectors into the tax net. The CBR’s focus on enhancing
compliance of existing taxpayers is probably appropriate in terms of generating revenue in

- 25 -

the short term. However, a strategy to extend the tax net into the service and agriculture
sectors needs to be developed in cooperation with the provinces.
For the strong medium-term potential to be realized, short-term macroeconomic
38.
risks need to be managed. Inflation is still in the high single digits, with monetary growth
yet to slow. Without a rapid increase in exports, continued import growth at the current pace
could result in an unsustainably high current account deficit.
A modest tightening of monetary and fiscal policies is therefore needed. This
39.
would lessen the risk of an increase in the external imbalances and would reduce inflationary
expectations without hurting growth too much, given that the economy is operating close to
potential. It is appropriate that the SBP has now put achieving low inflation at the top of its
agenda and has raised interest rates significantly. Rates should continue to be increased until
lending and T-bill rates are firmly positive in real terms, and there is evidence that
inflationary pressures are abating. On the fiscal side, the government has already taken
welcome steps to protect their fiscal deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP in the wake of
recent international oil price hikes. Additional pass-through of oil price increases as required
(including through reinstating the automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism), some limited
further effort on the revenue side, and expenditure restraint could keep the deficit to last
year’s level of 3.3 percent of GDP and avoid too much of the burden falling on monetary
policy.
External competitiveness needs to be monitored closely. Exchange rate policy has
40.
served Pakistan relatively well in recent years, contributing to strong export growth and
reduced external vulnerabilities, accompanied by only a limited build-up of inflationary
pressures. Despite some minor recent real appreciation, the level of the real exchange rate is
still broadly appropriate. Nevertheless, there appears to be limited room for further real
appreciation, and some nominal exchange rate flexibility could be needed quite soon to
protect competitiveness, if the inflation differential is not reduced.
The structural reforms agenda needs to be pursued forcefully. While the overall
41.
business climate and governance in key macroeconomic institutions have clearly improved,
problems in the energy sector, judiciary, and some other areas make Pakistan a challenging
environment for many investors. Improving governance in all public institutions should
therefore be a government priority. The sharp acceleration in the privatization program is
welcome and should result in better service delivery and cheaper inputs in some key sectors.
But it is also important to finally complete the reforms of the regulatory and tariff framework
for the power sector. This would allow privatization in this sector to start in earnest and
would help ensure competitive and reliable power supply. Reforms of fiscal reporting and
expenditure management should be accelerated, and the efficiency of expenditures monitored
closely.

- 26 -

Impressive financial sector reforms have resulted in a healthier and more
42.
competitive banking system. However, rapid private sector credit growth could be a source
of vulnerability in the future. Given the current position of strength, this is an opportune time
to tighten provisioning requirements. Steps to stabilize short-term interest rates and make
them the key intermediate monetary policy target are welcome and should be pursued
aggressively.
Some gains appear to have been made, but poverty reduction needs to be at the
43.
top of the policy agenda. Some reduction in poverty, and improvement in social indicators,
appears to have taken place. Looking ahead, larger increases in health and education
spending than budgeted for 2005/06 and better service delivery at the local level are needed
if substantial progress toward the Millennium Development Goals is to be made.
Pakistan maintains an exchange restriction on payments for current
44.
international transactions that should be lifted. Under this restriction, advance payments
for certain imports are limited to 50 percent (see Appendix I). Staff is not proposing approval
given the lack of a timetable for lifting the restriction, even though the authorities are
working to ease the restriction.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation take place within the
45.
standard 12 month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

Sources: Pakistani authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2006-10 4/

A. Alternative Scenarios

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Exchange rate appreciation (US dollar value of local currency,
change in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)

Growth of imports (US dollar terms, in percent)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

APPENDIX I

A. Nonfinancial Relations

VII.

Exchange System

Prior to mid-1998, Pakistan implemented a fixed exchange rate system with periodic step
devaluation to compensate for the inflation differential with major trading partners. On
July 21, 1998, a dual exchange system was introduced consisting of a fixed official exchange
rate at PRs 46 per $1 and a floating interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). Under this
system, all authorized transactions were effectively conducted at the so-called “composite
rate” which was the weighted average of the FIBR and the official exchange rate. On
May 19, 1999, the official exchange rate was eliminated and the exchange rate system
unified, with all international transactions conducted at the FIBR. As of July 20, 2005, the
FIBR was PRs 59.56 per $1. Pakistan’s exchange regime is classified as managed floating
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Pakistan maintains a minor exchange
restriction on payments for current international transactions subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, Section 2a, resulting from limitations on advance payments for certain imports.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Islamabad in August/September
2004. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 04/411) was discussed by the Executive
Board on December 1, 2004.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

In accordance with the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) was subject to a full safeguards assessment under the Stand-By Arrangement that
expired on September 30, 2001. This assessment, which included a safeguards mission to the
SBP, was completed on February 13, 2001. The staff’s findings and recommendations were
reported in IMF Country Report No. 01/58, Appendix IV. The authorities have implemented
all of the recommended remedial measures that were included under SBA conditionality, and
no new critical vulnerabilities were identified under Pakistan’s subsequent PRGF
Arrangement.

the Board of the IMF on March 8, 2004 and the Board of the World Bank on March 11,
2004, endorsed the PRSP and indicated it provides a good policy framework for the
implementation of a reform program which can accelerate progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).
The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue with Pakistan on macroeconomic
2.
policies including overall fiscal and monetary policy. As outlined more fully below, the
World Bank has complemented the Fund’s work through support to structural reforms in
governance and social sectors and support of the growth agenda through reforms and
investments in key sectors, such as power, oil and gas, transport, water and banking reforms.
World Bank Group Strategy

3.
The objective of the World Bank Group’s assistance strategy is to help Pakistan
reduce poverty through support of the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The World
Bank Group’s program priorities are focused on the reforms to (a) strengthen
macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (b) improve the business
environment for growth; and (c) improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender
equity policies. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the World Bank’s
Board of Executive Directors on June 11, 2002. A CAS Progress Report, which was
presented to the Board on April 20, 2004, confirms that the strategy set out in the 2002 CAS
remains valid in light of the full PRSP. A new CAS for FY2006-2009 is being prepared.
The World Bank works closely with the Fund and the government on structural
4.
reforms underpinning macroeconomic stability. In this context, the World Bank’s lending
program has featured development policy lending to support the government’s actions in the
areas of improving public expenditure management and supporting reforms of tax
administration, safe and sound banking, efficient public utilities, and structural fiscal and
governance reforms. A Tax Administration Reform Project was approved in FY 2005. The
Project to Improving Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA) II project was approved in

September 2005. The World Bank has also approved structural and sector adjustment credits
for three provinces (Punjab, Sindh and North West Frontier Province (NWFP)) supporting
provincial reform strategies to improve resource management and strengthen provision of
public services by local governments and communities. The first in a series of annual Poverty
Reduction Support Credits was approved in September 2004. Further development policy
lending at the provincial level is also planned.
The World Bank Group’s support to strengthening the investment climate includes a
5.
combination of analytical work and financial assistance targeted to reforms in key sectors as
well as investment lending in key infrastructure sectors including water, power, and
transport. The World Bank Group continues to perform analytical work to support the
ongoing liberalization and modernization of trade, industrial, business, and labor regulations.
The Bank is also providing assistance to strengthen the capacity of regulatory bodies.
In the social sectors, the World Bank Group’s assistance is geared toward improving
6.
access to and quality of education and strengthening public health programs and maternal
and child health and family planning. Inasmuch as social services are primarily the
responsibility of provincial and local governments in Pakistan’s federal structure, World
Bank assistance is geared toward strengthening provincial and local governments’ ability to
deliver services while encouraging the development of appropriate supportive policies at the
national level. In education, the emphasis is on assisting provincial governments to realign
public spending towards education while implementing sector reforms to improve quality,
access and governance. These programs have been supported through province-level
development policy credits, particularly in Punjab. World Bank Group assistance to health
sector includes support for the national HIV/AIDS control program, the national polio
immunization program, and the National Program for Family Planning and Primary Health
Care.
Supporting the rural sector through community-based infrastructure projects
7.
(particularly for water supply and sanitation services), investment projects in irrigation, and
the increased availability of micro-credit have been part of the World Bank Group’s strategy
to improve the welfare and reduce and mitigate risks for Pakistan’s poor. The World Bank
will continue to pilot new approaches, and also help scale up those which have proven
effective such as the Community Infrastructure and Services Project (CIP) and the Pakistan
Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF). Follow-on PPAF, CIP and on-farm water management
projects were approved in FY 2004. In addition, the Bank is providing analytical support to
the government’s efforts to improve the targeting and efficiency of its safety net programs.
IBRD and IDA have approved 88 loans and 125 credits to Pakistan since 1952,
8.
totaling $7,372.7 million and $8,501.2 million, respectively. Since 2003, Bank lending has
totaled $2,088.3 million (see Table 1). As of July 30, 2005, there were 169 outstanding IBRD
and IDA loans and credits representing a total obligation of $9,070 million. The World Bank
active portfolio in Pakistan consists of 17 lending operations with a total commitment of
$1,089 million of which $874 million is undisbursed. In 2004/05, $984 million were
disbursed, and for 2005/06, a disbursement of $936 million is expected.

Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas

9.
As part of its overall assistance to Pakistan—through lending, country analytic work,
and technical assistance—the World Bank supports policy reforms in the following areas in
collaboration with the Fund:
Financial sector reforms. A major achievement of the reform process has been the
a.
transformation of a predominantly state-owned and weak banking system into a healthier,
market-based system, owned primarily by the private sector. This has been supported by a
considerable strengthening of the legal and regulatory environment and significant
improvements in transparency, corporate governance, and credit culture. World Bank support
is being provided through implementation of the Technical Assistance to the Banking Sector
project. Privatization of state-owned banks was supported through the Banking Sector
Restructuring and Privatization Project (FY 2002) and the Banking Sector Adjustment Credit
(FY 2005). A joint World Bank/Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was
completed in FY 2004.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

Power sector reforms. The Fund PRGF arrangement included conditionality related
b.
to energy tariff adjustments and other power sector reforms with the aim of reducing the
sector’s fiscal burden. In the context of the structural adjustment operations approved in
FY 2001, FY 2002, and FY2005, the World Bank has taken the lead in working with the
government of Pakistan to unbundle and corporatize the state-owned Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) with the eventual aim for privatizing the generation and
transmission of electricity. The World Bank has also supported the development of a
comprehensive medium-term adjustment program to improve the electric services to
Pakistan's industry and households at lower cost and higher reliability. Planned investment
lending will focus on modernization of distribution systems to improve efficiency and reduce
technical losses.
Public expenditure management. The World Bank is taking the lead in supporting
c.
implementation of a reform program to improve the timeliness and accuracy of financial
reporting and auditing while strengthening the overall framework of accountability for the
use of public resources. World Bank support is being provided in the context of the ongoing
PIFRA project through which the national accounting and audit systems are being
modernized. A follow-on PIFRA II project will further these efforts. Analytical and
diagnostic support is being provided in the form of a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), which was completed in FY 2003, as well as provincial financial
accountability assessments for the provinces of Sindh, Punjab, and NWFP. Policy measures
relating to financial management have been included as prior actions for World Bank
structural adjustment lending at both the national and provincial level. Procurement reforms
are being supported through technical assistance and development policy lending.
Tax policy and administration reforms. The Fund has taken the lead in supporting
d.
tax policy reforms, providing technical assistance leading, inter alia, to the formulation of an
income tax reform package which became effective July 1, 2002. In consultation with the
Fund and the World Bank, Pakistan has also launched a program for the fundamental
restructuring of the Central Board of Revenues (CBR) in order to improve the efficiency of
tax administration. The CBR reform effort is being supported by both the World Bank and
the Fund. The structural performance criteria of the PRGF included adoption of tax policy
changes and implementation of CBR reform. A World Bank tax administration reform
project to support CBR reforms was approved in FY 2005.

APPENDIX III

PAKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
The staff believes that data reporting and accounting procedures are broadly adequate
for effective surveillance and program monitoring purposes. The authorities are responsive to
data requests and report to the Fund, on a routine and timely basis, monthly data on external
trade, prices, federal government expenditures and tax revenues, government bank
borrowing, and money. Moreover, the authorities provide daily data through the resident
representative’s office on international reserves, exchange rates, and the Karachi Stock
Exchange index. A data ROSC was published in December 2004. Follow-up STA technical
assistance missions have assisted the authorities address some of the ROSC’s key
recommendations.
2.
The Pakistani authorities are strongly committed to adhering to internationally
accepted standards and good practices, as demonstrated by their participation in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003. Pakistan meets the recommendations for the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of most GDDS data categories. The only exceptions are
the timeliness of the GDP and the lack of annual data on wages/earnings. For subscription to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), Pakistan will need to disseminate (a) the
monthly analytical accounts of the SBP with a timeliness of two weeks; (b) monthly
transaction data on central government operations with a timeliness of one month;
(c) quarterly data on the national accounts, employment, unemployment, wages/earnings, and
external debt, all with a timeliness of one quarter; (d) more detailed breakdown of data on
central government debt and external debt; (e) annual data on its international investment
position; and (f) update and expand the metadata on compilation and dissemination practices.
3.
The Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) recently completed a revision of the national
accounts, to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). As part of this exercise, the base year was moved from
1980/81 to 1999/2000. There remains room for further improvement. As noted by the data
ROSC, informal economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging
activities, such as in the information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. Some of
these gaps are being identified in the analysis of the results of the 1999/2000 Economic
Census already available for agriculture, manufacturing, electricity, and education. The FBS
intends to carry out another rebasing for 2004/05. Meanwhile, the FBS is also preparing the
compilation of quarterly GDP data. Following up on the recommendations of the data ROSC,
an IMF Quarterly National Accounts (QNA) mission visited Pakistan in April–June 2005 to
assist the FBS in the development QNA and to advise on the dwelling rent component of the
consumer price index (CPI). The compilation methods for QNA are very similar to those for
the annual accounts. However, quarterly data sources are very limited and considerable use is
made of forecasts and quarterly allocations in line with production calendars. In the process
of reviewing the sources and methods used to compile QNA, a number of deficiencies in the
annual compilation methods were discovered. The mission provided recommendations to
address these shortcomings. With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS is investigating

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

the feasibility of compiling quarterly employment/unemployment data and of disseminating
data on wages/salaries.
4.
The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and
the sensitive price indicator (SPI)). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The
SPI is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are
consumed by the lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI
follow international guidelines. For prices, plans are to introduce classification of individual
consumption by purpose (COICOP) and complete work on development of a Producer Price
Index (PPI), with base year 1999/2000; an IMF mission also provided some advise in this
regard.
5.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) suffer from a lack of data on general
government finances due to inadequate reporting by provinces and local governments on
their fiscal operations. The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS are broadly
based on the methodology prescribed in A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986
(GFSM 1986), except that the treatment of privatization proceeds resembles the methodology
of the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). The scope of GFS is
budgetary central government, which does not cover the activity of extra-budgetary funds.
Classification and sectorization systems follow GFSM 1986 standards only to a limited
extent. Institutional sectors are not explicitly defined, since only budgetary data are covered
in GFS. Although central and provincial governments are distinguished, local governments
are included with the provincial governments. The classification of expenditure departs
substantially from GFSM 1986 methodology, because the economic and functional
classifications are mixed in reporting, with defense and government administration
expenditures not clearly distinguished according to economic classification. The basis of
recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis, as required by the GFSM 1986 guidelines.
Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made
in the original period, as required by GFSM 1986. Plans for improvement of GFS are taking
place within the context of the Project for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and
Auditing (PIFRA). Although there are no specific plans to migrate to the GFSM 2001
standard—as recommended by the data ROSC—the MOF will consider adopting the GFSM
2001 in the long term.
6.
The analytical framework for monetary statistics reflects concepts and definitions that
are based on the IMF’s Guide to Money and Banking Statistics in International Finance
Statistics of December 1984. The scope of the monetary statistics is comprehensive. The
classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by SBP’s Statistics
Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are broadly in line with the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for recording flows and stocks
is largely consistent with MFSM and the SBP will continue to adopt the MFSM in order to
further improve monetary statistics. In particular, the SBP plans to (a) disaggregate data on
nonfinancial corporations and households within the private sector; (b) collect data on
nonbank financial institutions to expand the coverage of the monetary aggregates; and

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

(c) disseminate the analytical accounts of the SBP within two weeks after the end of the
reference month.
7.
Pakistan’s balance of payments statistics are compiled broadly in accordance with the
concepts and definitions of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5)..
However, the presentation of the balance of payments on the web and in the publications of
the SBP is still mostly based on the BPM4; recently, the SBP has commenced publishing the
balance of payments based on BPM5 on its website. In general, the scope of the balance of
payments pertaining to residency conforms to BPM5. The exceptions include the enterprises
operating in the export processing zones and offshore banks, which are regarded as
nonresidents, and Pakistani nationals residing abroad but owning a dwelling in Pakistan, who
are considered residents. Classification and sectorization systems also follow BPM5 to some
extent while the basis for recording transactions follows best international practices. The
2004 ROSC identified shortcomings in the treatment of oil exports under product sharing
agreements and the estimation of reinvested earnings. The report also noted the absence of
revisions studies. International investment position data are now compiled. Regarding the
external sector, the SBP plans to (a) continue the implementation of the BPM5; and
(b) disseminate the metadata for the template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity on the SBP website.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
PAKISTAN
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Pakistan
Approved by Juan Carlos Di Tata and Michael T. Hadjimichael
November 1, 2005
1.
This supplement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report for the 2005 Article IV consultation (refer to www.imf.org) was circulated to the
Board on October 11, 2005. It changes the thrust of the staff appraisal by accepting that some
widening of the fiscal deficit now seems warranted and unavoidable in the aftermath of the
earthquake. The additional uncertainties stemming from the fiscal impact of the earthquake
and the delay in the privatization of the telecommunications company reinforces the need for
a monetary policy geared towards containing inflation and supporting the external position.
A. The Earthquake and its Impact
2.
The northern part of Pakistan was hit by a devastating earthquake (7.6 on the
Richter scale) on October 8, 2005, after the staff report was finalized. The death toll is
estimated to exceed 54,000, but could rise further; over 70,000 people were injured. Virtually
all houses, hospitals, schools, and government buildings in the affected areas have been
destroyed. Nearly 4 million people are affected in terms of loss of shelter and public
amenities. Adverse weather and the remoteness of the region have complicated emergency
assistance; with winter setting in, the immediate needs are for more tents and blankets to
prevent further human tragedy. It may also be necessary to move people down from the
mountains and house them in temporary shelters. Relief for the next six months (tents,
medical aid, helicopters, etc.) is likely to cost $1–2 billion. Initial estimates put the total
reconstruction costs at $5–10 billion over the next five to ten years. So far, international aid
pledges amount to $1.5 billion. A U.N. sponsored donor conference took place on
October 26, focusing on immediate relief needs. The World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank are conducting a needs assessment, and a high-level conference on
reconstruction is expected to take place in Islamabad on November 19. The authorities are
considering whether to request Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance from the Fund.
3.
In addition to the human tragedy, the earthquake will have some adverse impact
on Pakistan’s economy. The affected region accounts for a small fraction of national GDP.
Still, with economic activity having been virtually wiped out in these areas, there will be
some dampening impact on growth in 2005/06. This, together with downward revisions in

-2-

cotton and sugar production, suggest that GDP growth in 2005/06 could be at least
0.5 percent lower compared with the 7 percent projected prior to the earthquake. The relief
and reconstruction efforts may also add some further pressures on the prices of nontradable
goods, such as cement and other construction materials, but there should be little impact on
food prices because of ample stocks. Over the medium term, the reconstruction of fixed
assets may turn out to have a positive impact on growth. Capital markets have not reacted
negatively to the earthquake. Pakistan’s bond spread (over U.S. treasuries) has remained
stable and moved with the overall market, while the Karachi stock exchange has risen in
recent weeks.
4.
The fiscal deficit could be ½ to 1 percent of GDP higher than budgeted in
2005/06. There is much uncertainty about the costs of the ongoing relief efforts and
reconstruction needs. The government has made an initial allocation of PRs 5 billion (less
than 0.1 percent of GDP) for 2005/06, which will be increased over time as needs are
identified and costs assessed. The Pakistani army, international agencies, and
nongovernmental organizations are providing most of the emergency relief; in-kind foreign
grants and private donations will not be recorded in the budget and will be partly channeled
through off-budget funds, such as the President’s Relief Fund. Staff recognizes that an
increase in the fiscal deficit in 2005/06 will occur. The recent progress toward reducing the
debt burden has opened up fiscal space for additional relief and rehabilitation spending,
which should not threaten fiscal sustainability. Reflecting the authorities’ goal of maintaining
macroeconomic stability, monetary policy needs to contain inflation and support the external
position as public spending is raised.
5.
Reconstruction needs over the next five years will put pressure on the fiscal
position, even though the authorities intend to accommodate a part of the
reconstruction costs within the existing public sector development program allocation.
New grant pledges and additional loans from multilateral development banks will help to
finance some of the costs. Staff will be working closely with the Pakistani authorities to
prepare a revised macroeconomic framework.
6.
A possible widening of the external current account deficit in 2005/06 should be
largely balanced by additional grants. The relief effort could increase the trade deficit
relative to the staff report projections, given the need to import emergency supplies. Such a
widening should be covered in large part by emergency relief grants, fresh multilateral loans,
and possibly higher remittances. Some pressures on reserves could emerge in the short-run if
external assistance lags urgent spending needs; the overall balance of payments deficit and
financing needs are yet to be determined. Over the medium term, the balance of payments
will be affected by the timing and availability of additional external grants and concessional
financing as well as the import content of reconstruction activity.
B. Other Developments in the First Quarter of 2005/06
7.
Domestic developments in the first quarter of 2005/06 are consistent with the
projections in the staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation (refer to

-3-

www.imf.org). Year-on-year inflation in September was 8.5 percent (about the same as in
August). Central Board of Revenue collection increased by 19 percent in July–September
over the same period last year, slightly faster than projected. Broad money growth has
slowed to 17½ percent year-on-year at end-August, as the State Bank of Pakistan tightened
liquidity, though private sector credit growth remains high at 31 percent. Reserve money
growth has also slowed somewhat to 15 percent at end-August, despite the State Bank having
continued to meet part of the government’s gross financing need. Partial data for September
indicate that these trends have continued.
8.
The external current account deficit widened to $1.2 billion in July/August 2006.
Import growth increased further (reaching 52 percent in July–September over the same
period in 2004/05), but exports performed better than expected (19 percent growth in July–
September over the same period in 2004/05). As a result, the trade deficit increased, which
was only partly offset by higher than projected remittances. Foreign direct investment was
much more favorable than projected. During July–September, gross official reserves declined
by $0.5 billion, to $9.5 billion. Expected multilateral loans, additional grants, and the planned
Eurobond issue should help maintain official reserves in the coming months.
9.
Privatization of the telecommunications company has been delayed. The
October 28 deadline for the completion of the sale of 26 percent of the company has not been
met. The authorities are considering whether the deal can still be completed. If not, other
public assets would be sold to make up for part of the shortfall, possibly in the form of
Global Depository Receipts for some major public companies. On the positive side, an
agreement has been reached with a domestic investor group on the sale of the
Karachi Electric Supply Company. This would constitute a major landmark in Pakistan’s
privatization process.

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
1.
Pakistan has been one of the most prolonged users of Fund resources. In the last
46 years, the country has been under Fund-supported programs for about half of the time
(Figure 1). Before 1988, Fund-supported programs were infrequent and mostly short term in
nature. But as growth faltered in the late 1980s, and the failure to redress fiscal and external
imbalances resulted in an unsustainable debt burden, Pakistan became more heavily
dependent on Fund support. The period 1988–99 was marked by regional problems and
political instability—there were as many Fund programs as governments (eight each).
Economic growth slowed, poverty increased, and governance problems became increasingly
evident. However, from 1999, the new government of General Pervez Musharraf began
addressing the economic difficulties with a new commitment to turn around past trends. The
economy started to recover and progress has been made in structural reforms, including in
building institutions.

All but the last two Fund-supported programs suffered from substantial policy
slippages. Of the SDR 3.6 billion committed during 1988–99, 55 percent was not drawn as
programs went off-track soon after their start (Table 1). Programs were either extended to
accommodate delays in the completion of reviews, or were ended prematurely, to be replaced
by new arrangements. In contrast, both the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) and the 2001
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were
successfully completed without any extensions. All disbursements were made available upon
completion of the program reviews, but the authorities decided not to draw the last tranche
under the PRGF arrangement or seek a successor arrangement in light of Pakistan’s
improved external situation (Figures 2 and 3). The improved economic situation enabled
Pakistan to re-enter the international financial markets in 2004 to help cover its financing
needs, in addition to ongoing support from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) and a few bilateral donors.

The Independent Evaluation Office (IEO), in its 2002 report evaluating the
prolonged use of Fund resources (refer to www.imf.org, Vol. II), assessed Pakistan’s
program performance until 1999. It found that the limited achievements of successive
programs before 1999 were associated with considerable political and regional instability,
but also reflected design and implementation problems. A basic problem was that successive
governments did not have sufficient ownership of the programs and were often unable to
sustain the reform and adjustment effort for more than a short period of time. In addition,
programs typically suffered from overoptimistic macroeconomic assumptions and proved to
be unrealistic about the pace and breadth of the structural reform agenda that was likely to be
implemented by the government. Notably, limitations in implementation capacity were not
sufficiently taken into account in program design, and the reform agenda was not prioritized
enough.
4.
According to the IEO, most of the design and implementation problems had
their roots in institutional factors. In particular, decisions regarding the Fund’s
involvement in Pakistan appeared to have been heavily influenced by (a) geopolitical
considerations; (b) the difficulty of not giving a new government the initial benefit of the
doubt as regards its stated policy objectives; (c) a reluctance to disengage when a country
faces difficulties; (d) the presumption of a short- to medium-term involvement only; and
(e) collaboration with the World Bank that did not always produce an effective integration of
priorities and timeframes in dealing with key structural issues. More generally, the IEO
concluded that there had been too few attempts to “step back” and reconsider the overall
strategy on the basis of a candid assessment of previous programs. The IEO considered the
main lesson from Pakistan’s prolonged-use experience to be a need for greater selectivity,
based on a candid assessment of ownership, and disengaging from a country, if necessary.
Also, greater efforts were needed to tailor program design to the specific circumstances and
long-term needs of a country, focusing on key institutional changes.
5.
This report mainly focuses on the post-1999 period, where the IEO left off. After
a brief description of conditionality in Fund-supported programs during 2000–04
(Section II.A), economic achievements as well as those areas where progress has been
limited or absent are discussed (Section II.B). The main issues addressed by the Ex Post
Assessment are covered in Section III, starting with what caused the change in performance
after 1999 (Section III.A). Section III.B asks whether Fund conditionality was appropriate
and Section III.C focuses on the design of the monetary program. Other issues discussed are
whether Fund-recommended policies helped to reduce poverty (Section III.D); was the size
of Fund financial support appropriate (Section III.E); did Fund-Bank collaboration contribute
to the success of the program (Section III.F); and whether the Fund’s involvement in
Pakistan changed following the 2002 IEO report (Section III.G). Section IV concludes with
lessons for the Fund that can be derived from Pakistan’s experience.

II. THE FACTS
A. Program Conditionality
6.
Conditionality in Pakistan’s Fund-supported programs became increasingly
extensive after 1999. In the 1990s, programs included fairly standard quantitative
conditionality: a floor on the net foreign assets and ceilings on the net domestic assets of the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the overall budget balance, government bank borrowing, and
net banking sector claims on public sector enterprises, as well as on government external
borrowing and the accumulation of external arrears. To address shortcomings in performance
in key areas, quantitative conditionality was augmented in the 2000 SBA and 2001 PRGF by
a floor on Central Board of Revenues (CBR) revenues and a ceiling on the accumulation of
budgetary arrears to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA); and—in the
PRGF—limits on SBP’s foreign exchange reserves held with banks and on foreign currency
swap and forward sales between the SBP and residents.2 Nevertheless, the amount of
quantitative conditionality was not out of line compared with the average PRGF program.
7.
In the 1990s, structural conditionality had typically been set in the form of broad
commitments in the letter of intent or structural benchmarks. But as ownership and
implementation was often weak, the response of the staff was to gradually try and close as
many loopholes as possible, through an increase in the number of both macroeconomic and
structural conditions, especially through much larger recourse to prior actions and
performance criteria (PCs).
8.
Structural conditionality peaked in
the 2000 SBA. The total of 56 PCs,
benchmarks and prior actions in this
arrangement was nearly three times the
Fund-wide average of 19 conditions in
GRA-supported programs (Table 2 and
Figure 4).3 The large number of conditions
was justified on grounds of a need to establish
a strong track record by making up for past
policy slippages within a relatively short time
frame (see below).

In addition, indicative targets were set for the net domestic assets of the banking sector (SBA only), federal tax
revenues (SBA only), and social- and poverty-related expenditures. Halfway during the PRGF arrangement, the
quantitative conditionality related to WAPDA was replaced by indicative targets for the accrual balance of
WAPDA and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC).

Fund-wide averages for GRA- and PRGF-supported programs were obtained from the report on the “Review
of the 2002 Conditionality Guidelines” (refer to www.imf.org).

9.
Following the 2000 SBA, structural conditionality was reduced gradually
because of Pakistan’s improved performance, as well as rising doubts in the Fund about
the effectiveness of large policy matrices of conditions. The new government generally
delivered on its commitments and the number of structural conditions was steadily reduced
during the 2001–04 PRGF arrangement. This steady decline in the number of conditions also
reflected the overall drive in the Fund to streamline conditionality. Nevertheless, only in the
last program year did the number of structural conditions (15) approach the Fundwide
average for PRGF-supported programs (14).

-8-

10.
Structural conditionality became increasingly focused. Measures to improve the
tax system dominated conditionality in the 2000 SBA and the 2001 PRGF arrangements,
reflecting the critical importance attached to increasing the revenue intake (Figure 5).
Measures falling in the category of general economic management—such as the
promulgation of a budget consistent with program understandings or a depreciation of the
exchange rate—were numerous in the 2000 SBA, but declined sharply as macroeconomic
performance strengthened. During the PRGF arrangement, conditionality focused also on
financial sector reforms and public enterprise reforms. While efficiency factors were
considered, ultimately these measures aimed to achieve budget savings, by reducing the
financing costs of the government by aligning yields on National Savings Scheme (NSS)
instruments to market rates, and by restructuring the energy sector, thus reducing its reliance
on budget support.

Program implementation in 2001–04 compared favorably to the average GRAand PRGF-supported programs. However, no review of the 2000 SBA or the 2001–04
PRGF arrangement was completed without requesting at least one waiver. On average,
two waivers were requested per review. Still, waiver rates, on average, were comparable to,
or even lower than, those in average Fund-supported programs (Table 3 and Figure 6).4 In
part, the frequency of waiver requests was a reflection of the large number of conditions.
Moreover, waivers were often needed because of delays in implementation rather than an
outright lack of implementation. This was particularly true for energy sector measures, which
typically required more time to overcome political or technical hurdles, causing an increase
4

Fund-wide average waiver rates for quantitative performance criteria were 11 percent and 16 percent for
GRA- and PRGF-supported programs, respectively, during 2001–03, compared to a waiver rate of 10 percent
during Pakistan’s SBA and 4 percent on average during its PRGF arrangement. For structural performance
criteria, the Fund-wide average waiver rates for GRA- and PRGF-supported programs during 2001–03 were
50 percent and 42 percent, respectively, compared to a waiver rate of 25 percent during Pakistan’s SBA and
45 percent during its PRGF-supported programs.

-9-

in the waiver rate for structural conditions in the last year of the PRGF arrangement. Looking
at the share of lapsed measures—measures that never got implemented—implementation in
Pakistan compared favorably relative to the average Fund-supported program during this
period: only 6 percent of structural performance criteria were not implemented at all,
compared to a Fund-wide average of 14–15 percent. Compliance with quantitative
macroeconomic conditionality was also, on average, better than the average for
Fund-supported programs.

B. Goals and Achievements
Program objectives
12.
By the late 1990s, Pakistan’s economy had run aground. Per capita GDP growth
had slowed to below 1 percent on average during 1996/97–1998/99. By end-1998/99, the
country’s foreign exchange reserves were virtually exhausted and covered only four weeks of
imports. Public debt had risen to about 90 percent of GDP and debt service obligations could
not all be met in 1998 when Pakistan came under sanctions following its nuclear tests. Using
the official poverty line as a yardstick, the headcount poverty rate increased from 25 percent
in the early 1990s to 32 percent in 2000/01.
13.
The new government that assumed office in 1999 aimed to make a clean break
from past weak and erratic policy implementation. In late 1999, the government
formulated and started to implement policies aimed at reducing Pakistan’s high debt burden
to achieve sustainability and create more room for social spending. The government also
requested support from the Fund and a SBA was approved in November 2000. The
immediate objective of the SBA was to reduce quickly macroeconomic imbalances through a
tightening of both fiscal and monetary policies. The exchange rate was to be allowed to
adjust to market forces to help strengthen the external position. The authorities were also to
press ahead with structural reforms to enhance the economy’s growth potential and reduce
poverty. As it was recognized that addressing Pakistan’s deep structural problems required a
long-term effort, the 2000 SBA was intended to establish a track record and pave the way for
a medium-term program that could be supported under the PRGF.
14.
Pakistan’s request for a PRGF arrangement was approved in December 2001.
The PRGF arrangement had three main objectives: increasing growth, reducing vulnerability
to shocks, and improving social indicators. Accordingly, macroeconomic policies aimed at
further fiscal adjustment to reduce the public debt overhang, while simultaneously increasing
the revenue intake and reducing transfers to state-owned entities to create additional room for
social spending. External support, including a Paris Club rescheduling, was obtained to
alleviate Pakistan’s external debt burden. Monetary policy aimed at low inflation, with a
view to replenishing foreign exchange reserves and thus reducing external vulnerabilities.
Structural reforms were aimed at improving investor confidence and creating an environment
in which the private sector could flourish.
What has been achieved?
15.
Economic growth has recovered convincingly from the crisis of 1998. The rate of
real per capita GDP growth accelerated from close to zero in 2000/01 to over 6 percent in
2004/05 (Table 4 and Figure 7). Initially, growth was driven by a strong rebound in exports,
which recorded double-digit growth rates, and virtually closed the gap between exports and
imports of goods and nonfactor services. Reflecting this, manufacturing recorded high
growth rates. In later years, favorable weather conditions also contributed to a strong pick up
in agricultural production adding to the overall strong growth performance. Although the

- 12 -

investment ratio has remained broadly unchanged at 16–17 percent of GDP since 1999/2000,
the contribution of total factor productivity to growth has increased sharply. Rising real
incomes eventually contributed to a strong pick up in private consumption and in 2004/05
domestic demand took over as the main driving force of growth. With the economy heating
up, imports surged—showing a sharp increase in shipments of consumer goods, as well as of
machinery—resulting in a shift of the current account balance (excluding official transfers)
from a surplus of almost 4 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to a deficit of almost 2 percent of GDP
in 2004/05 (Figure 8).

The fiscal position was strengthened to reduce indebtedness and to create
additional room for social spending. Fiscal consolidation was achieved to a large extent by
increases in nontax revenues and savings on the interest bill. The latter reflected the
restructuring of external debts, falling domestic real interest rates, and the decline in the
government debt ratio from almost 90 percent of GDP in 2000/01 to 60 percent of GDP in
2004/05. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) declined from 6.6 percent of GDP in
1999/2000 to about 3 percent of GDP in 2004/05 (Figure 9). Despite this adjustment,
social- and poverty-related expenditures were raised by over 1 percentage point of GDP over
the last three years, or by over 30 percent in
real per capita terms. Nevertheless, the level of

Inflation remained low and stable until mid-2003, but has become a concern
more recently. Initially, slack in the economy, that reflected the slow growth experienced in
the late 1990s, and a steady increase in money demand, as confidence recovered, allowed the
SBP to reduce interest rates, while inflation was kept in the low single digits (Figure 11). In
the second half of 2003, however, with the economy starting to grow strongly, inflation
began to pick up (from a low level). The SBP was slow to respond by tightening monetary
policy, mindful not to choke off the economic recovery. As a result, key policy interest rates
have been negative in real terms since 2003. The 12-month rate of inflation reached double
digits in March 2005 for the first time since September 1997 and is currently at 8.4 percent.

Good progress was made in some areas of structural reform. In the years prior to
1999, structural reforms had been started in the areas of interest rate, trade, and capital
account liberalization. After 1999, the authorities continued to move ahead with liberalizing
Pakistan’s trade and exchange regime, and strong progress was made in financial sector
reform. The banking sector is now largely privately owned and has become more competitive
and efficient, following restructuring and privatization. This was complemented by a

- 15 -

strengthening of supervision and prudential regulations, as noted in the recent Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA; IMF Country Report No. 04/215). With reforms and
improving macroeconomic performance, banks’ financial soundness indicators improved and
dollarization was reduced substantially. The tax and customs administration has been
strengthened and made more taxpayer-friendly, while customs tariffs and tax rates were
reduced and rationalized. The Fiscal Responsibility Law, which established legal targets for
reducing the public debt burden and for reporting requirements, was approved in 2005. In
addition, the role of the state in the economy has been reduced and governance improved
through strengthening macroeconomic institutions, an extensive privatization program, and
the establishment of improved regulatory frameworks in such sectors as telecommunications,
electricity, and oil and gas.
What has not been achieved?
20.
A major disappointment has been the lack of progress in raising tax revenues as
a share of GDP. One of the objectives of the last two programs was a significant expansion
of the tax base to create room for achieving the twin goals of higher social spending and debt
reduction. However, the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained broadly unchanged at about
11 percent since the late 1990s and dipped in
Figure 12. Pakistan: Tax Revenues, 1993/94–2004/05

reflecting political difficulties in taxing these
sectors (see below).
21.
Progress was also disappointing in addressing the quasi-fiscal deficit of public
utilities. The largest recipients of budget support by far are the companies in the power
sector. The sum of subsidies and net lending to these companies has remained well over
1 percent of GDP. Large technical losses remain, tariffs do not cover cost, and allegations of
corruption are widespread.
22.
Governance problems remain. Governance has been improved in fiscal and
monetary management, the financial sector, the exchange and trade system, and to some
extent in tax administration. However, more broadly, while survey data show some
improvement in governance and the control of corruption in Pakistan in recent years, the
country still lags behind most of its South Asian neighbors. Corruption is widespread in
public service delivery, with almost all respondents in a World Bank survey reporting
corruption of one form or another. In particular, governance problems contribute to the large
losses made by the power sector entities noted above, as well as to the low tax ratio.

- 16 -

What is still open?
23.
Despite the economic recovery and increased social spending, it is as yet unclear
whether poverty has declined. Comparable data to the 2000/01 household survey will
become available only toward the end of 2005. However, a decline in poverty rates is
expected, as average per capita incomes have risen by over 40 percent in U.S. dollar terms
since 2000/01. Moreover, agricultural production has increased, though it is still unclear how
well the benefits of higher growth have been distributed across the population in rural areas.
24.
Some recently available key social indicators show a significant improvement
over the past three years (Table 5). Survey results show a considerable improvement in a
number of health and education outcomes, such as immunization, school enrollment, and
literacy rates, reflecting the increase in social spending in recent years. But while social
spending has increased, levels are still relatively low compared to some other countries in the
region. In line with this, some social indicators remain modest compared with other low
income countries (including in South Asia) (Table 6).

III. MAIN ISSUES
A. Why the Change Between Pre- and Post-Crisis Period?
25.
The weak economic performance and poor implementation of the pre-2000
programs largely reflected political instability in Pakistan, as well as the limited
program ownership by eight successive governments. The main motivation for engaging
the Fund tended to be short-term alleviation of foreign exchange shortages rather than
sustained reforms for macroeconomic stability and long-term growth. Vested interest groups
resisted deeper structural reforms while the quality of institutions eroded steadily. The top
political leadership was either not committed or not able to overcome opposition to economic
reforms.
26.
The government that came to power in 1999 put the economy at the top of its
agenda. President Musharraf took a personal interest in economic matters. Experienced
technocrats, often expatriates, were recruited for key economic posts, such as the minister of
finance and the central bank governor. The government did not face the same political
constraints as earlier elected ones, and could take unpopular decisions, including reducing
subsidies. It also dealt more efficiently with corruption at the top. Nevertheless, it still had
great difficulties in expanding the tax net and getting the population to pay utility bills.
27.
The initial reform efforts in 2000–01 took place against the background of
relative international isolation, reflecting sanctions because of nuclear tests and
opposition to the military takeover. However, with the government joining the coalition
against terror in September 2001, considerable external financial support was mobilized,
including more grants and a Paris Club debt rescheduling on very favorable terms. Pakistan
was also compensated for costs incurred in the war on terror.

- 18 -

28.
A frequently asked question is whether Pakistan’s improved economic
performance after 1999 was the result of domestic policies or external support, and
hence whether the gains are sustainable. In practice, it is impossible to precisely
disentangle policy and external effects. International financial support certainly created a
favorable external environment for domestic policy adjustment. It would have been
impossible to secure financing assurances for the first year of the PRGF program without the
change in sentiment among donors that followed the September 11 events. The agreement by
the Paris Club to provide an exceptional debt treatment and the willingness of major donors
to contribute fresh cash contributed to the improvement in the fiscal and external positions in
2001/02 (Tables 7 and 8). The increase in defense-related receipts provided extra resources
but these were used to cover additional costs incurred in the war on terrorism (Table 9).
However, without the change in policies, instigated in 1999, the international support would
have fallen on infertile grounds. Instead, the increased support helped the government to
advance its reform agenda and to reduce the fiscal deficit substantially. There was some early
success in raising tax revenues in 2002/03–2003/04, nontax revenues (excluding defense
receipts) were raised substantially, and domestically financed defense expenditures (defense
spending minus defense receipts) were reduced quite sharply.

The combination of external support and policy adjustment helped to restore
confidence, resulting in lower interest rates and a reduction in the huge domestic
interest bill. On the external side, the increase in private transfers, rather than official
support, was the main factor behind the increase in foreign exchange reserves. This may have
partly reflected tighter scrutiny of bank accounts of Pakistanis abroad following the
September 11 events, but also, to a large extent, resulted from increased confidence.5 An
even more pronounced surge in remittances had occurred during an earlier period of relative
political and economic stability in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The considerable
improvement in the balance of goods and services reflected weak domestic demand and
improved competitiveness, as well as growing demand in partner countries.
B. Was Structural Conditionality Appropriate?
30.
The 2002 guidelines on structural conditionality emphasized national ownership,
parsimony and criticality, tailoring to circumstances, coordination with other
multilateral institutions, and clarity in specification. Although the 2000 interim guidance
note, which advised to limit structural conditions to macrorelevant measures in the Fund’s
core areas, had not yet been finalized when Pakistan’s 2000 SBA was negotiated, the drive to
streamline Fund conditionality was already well underway.

5

A part of the increase in recorded remittances represented a shift into formal channels as a result of the
economic reforms.

- 20 -

31.
Conditionality in the 2000 SBA clearly did not meet the test of parsimony. In
terms of numbers, structural conditions exceeded Fundwide averages by a wide margin.
Moreover, conditions were not limited to just those areas that were macrorelevant and critical
to the success of the program.6
32.
The wide array of structural conditions in the 2000 SBA appears to have been a
response to Pakistan’s weak performance under earlier Fund-supported programs.
Executive Directors at the Board discussion of the 2000 SBA request in November 2000
generally considered the program to be a way for Pakistan to establish a good track record—
previously it had been known as a “one tranche country.” Directors emphasized the need for
prior actions and structural conditions, including at informal Board meetings prior to the
approval of the program. The Acting Chairman noted that: “the uncertainty that remains has
been the reason for the program to include many structural benchmarks and quantitative
performance criteria.” The view that the inclusion of so much conditionality entailed
unnecessary risks for program implementation was clearly not valued sufficiently.
33.
In the end, the 2000 SBA was successful in establishing a good track record and
in the subsequent PRGF arrangement conditionality was increasingly streamlined. But
because of the large number of conditions, the impression among some Pakistani officials
was that the program was punitive and imposed. In their view, the fact that it broadly
succeeded had more to do with the government, with no other options available, having to
accept the conditions and do whatever it took to meet them. Others, however, stressed that
most, if not all, of the SBA conditions were measures the government aimed to implement in
any event, regardless of the Fund. The 2001 PRGF arrangement, by contrast, was publicly
claimed by the government as its own program,7 and structural conditionality was more
limited and focused. It focused on three areas that were considered critical for the success of
the program: (a) strengthening the tax system and expenditure management; (b) increasing
the role of markets in the financial system; and (c) improving the performance of stateowned enterprises and governance, notably in the energy sector. While not a core area of
Fund responsibility, the energy sector was deemed critical to achieve the program’s fiscal
goals because of its large drain on budget resources.
34.
But while conditionality became more parsimonious in the PRGF, it is
questionable whether the chosen conditions sufficiently met the criteria of criticality,
tailoring, and even ownership in some sectors. As noted above, the revenue intake did not
increase as planned, and transfers to the energy sector remained large. At the same time,
however, the program’s objectives in terms of reducing the debt burden and creating room
6

Measures that can hardly be deemed macrorelevant and critical to the success of the program included, inter
alia, the adoption of a plan to improve national accounts; implementation of an orderly process to resolve a
dispute between two energy companies; elimination of nostro limits on banks’ foreign exchange holdings with
correspondent banks; and the publication of quarterly fiscal reports.

for social spending were met. While tax and energy sector reforms as a whole could be
considered as critical ex ante, many of the individual structural conditions were not (see
below).
35.
Fiscal conditionality placed emphasis on both streamlining taxation of existing
taxpayers and on broadening the tax base. The authorities enthusiastically embraced
efforts to make the tax system more efficient and taxpayer-friendly, including as a way to
improve compliance. However, efforts to widen the tax base—by eliminating numerous
exemptions and expanding sales and income tax coverage—ran into resistance from interest
groups, especially as regards extending the tax net further into the agricultural and services
sectors. PCs were often breached, especially the one on no new tax exemptions, but waivers
were granted as the impact of the measures was minimal, which raises the question of the
choice of individual measures subject to conditionality. But it is doubtful whether tougher
conditionality, or implementation of conditionality, would have been successful in the
absence of full ownership, including at lower levels of government, as extending the tax base
into agriculture and services required cooperation from provincial authorities. A system to
tax agricultural incomes, for example, pursued through Fund-supported programs since 1981,
had been put into place during the 2000 SBA, but actual collection fell short of expectations,
reflecting a lack of political will at the provincial level to fully implement the new laws.
36.
Political constraints also prevented the government from moving faster and
more decisively on power sector reforms. Electricity tariffs and bill collection remain
among the most difficult political issues in many developing countries—Pakistan is not
unique in this respect. Tariffs have been raised over the past decade, but not enough to cover
rising costs, let alone much-needed investment to repair and expand the system. Heavy Fund
conditionality in the energy sector stemmed from the fact that the World Bank’s efforts to
push reforms had limited success. With the Bank stepping back at the time (see below),
energy sector conditionality was included in the SBA and PRGF with a view to reducing the
large drain posed by this sector on the budget.
37.
With limited understanding of power sector issues, it proved difficult to select
the structural conditions best suited to advance reforms. Fund conditionality focused
mostly on tariff structures, financial performance of companies, and privatization. Conditions
were often met, albeit mostly after delays. But slippages were never deemed serious enough,
though, to warrant program interruption and waivers were frequently requested and obtained.
Progress was made—including putting up KESC for sale, the break-up of WAPDA, and the
design of a new tariff and subsidy regime—but technical losses in the system remained high,
tariff collection weak, and as a result the sector’s overall performance did not improve much.
Thus, here too, one can argue that conditionality was not sufficiently tailored to address the
sector’s deep-rooted problems. Moreover, the reform of the power sector is a long-term
process, with limited scope for quick results within a program’s horizon.

- 22 -

38.
Overall, it appears that Fund structural conditionality was not well-suited for
areas that require longer-term institution building and the cooperation of more than
just the central government. Looking back also to the pre-1999 programs, various
approaches have been tried to achieve the desired results in the tax and energy areas, ranging
from developing broad sectoral plans, to large numbers of detailed measures, and to setting
quantitative targets for tax collection or quasi-fiscal deficits. But without the adequate
involvement of the World Bank (see below), and full government ownership at all levels,
each of these approaches failed to deliver.
C. Should the Monetary Program Have Been Designed Differently?
39.
Throughout much of the period under review, the SBP succeeded in keeping
inflation in the low single digits. As noted above, however, in late 2003 inflation started to
pick up, reaching double digits in early 2005. This raises the question whether the monetary
program had become too accommodating toward the end of the PRGF arrangement.
40.
The monetary program followed the standard approach of setting floors for the
net international reserves (NIR) and ceilings for the net domestic assets (NDA) of the
central bank. Initially, large post-September 11 inflows of capital (in particular
unexpectedly high private transfers) facilitated overperformance on the NIR target, while the
NDA target was met through partial sterilization of the associated liquidity growth. Monetary
growth accelerated significantly in 2001/02 and eventually led to strong credit growth and a
pickup in inflation, as the exchange rate was not allowed to appreciate substantially and
sterilization was reversed (Figure 13). Should staff have insisted on greater exchange rate
flexibility to contain inflation? Should the program instead have set ceilings for reserve
money rather than NDA?

The authorities initially viewed economic conditions as favorable to a relatively
accommodating monetary policy stance. With the economy starting to recover, they
wanted to maintain the momentum and feared that an appreciation of the nominal exchange
rate, as well as an increase in interest rates, would dampen the expansion. They believed that
the increase in liquidity was essentially demand driven, thereby negating the need for
aggressive sterilization. Caution on exchange rate appreciation was supported by the initial
expectation that the surge in both official and private inflows would prove temporary, and
fears that the war on terror and the termination of the system of quotas under the multi-fiber
agreement may adversely affect exports. These factors combined helped shape the
authorities’ view that a nominal appreciation could result in pressures on reserves.
42.
An assessment of external competitiveness fails to find evidence of a real
exchange rate undervaluation. There appears to be a strong relationship between the real
exchange rate and the trade balance, and the 2003–04 levels of the real exchange appear
broadly consistent with a sustainable balance (Figure 14).8 The CPI-based real effective
exchange rate (REER) had, on average, been depreciating by about 1 percent per year since
mid-1990s in part explaining the strong growth of exports in 2001–04. While other factors
have also been at work, the 2001–04 REER—unlike in the 1990s when the REER seems to
have been overvalued—does not lend support to an undervaluation hypothesis.

Had reserve money been a performance criterion under the program, together
with a NIR floor to ensure a sufficient reserve position, monetary expansion could have
been contained through a more aggressive sterilization policy and higher interest rates.
This would have entailed greater exchange rate flexibility with less build-up of foreign
reserves—an option that would not have enjoyed much ownership in view of the authorities’
objectives to establish a strong reserve position, preserve competitiveness, and keep interest
rates low. Thus, a reserve money target could have been counterproductive in the absence of

any obvious initial misalignment of the real exchange rate. Rather than reflecting the
architecture of the quantitative conditionality, the root of the acceleration of inflation was the
emphasis placed by the authorities on growth compared with control of inflation.
44.
In August/September 2003, when understandings on performance criteria for
the final program year were reached, the authorities and the staff still believed that
there had been a structural upward shift in money demand. This view was supported by
the observation that sustained increases in money growth continued to be accompanied by
little evidence of rising inflation (inflation was below 2 percent in June–August 2004). In
these circumstances, fiscal policy correctly aimed at ensuring that the bulk of the official
grants were either saved (i.e., the budgetary deficit excluding grants was unchanged) or
allocated to development expenditures (within the spending envelope) while other
expenditures were contained. The resulting fiscal consolidation was believed to keep
inflationary expectations low while ensuring that the ceiling on central bank NDA would be
met.
45.
Since mid-2003, however, the monetary expansion was driven by domestic
sources, as opposed to capital inflows earlier (Figure 15). Before, the SBP opted for
accumulating foreign reserves and sterilized at least part of the liquidity effects. Starting in
2003/04, however, the SBP slowed the accumulation in reserves and cut sterilization
operations. In fact, NDA became the source of monetary expansion as the central bank began
financing the budget when commercial banks were no longer willing to roll-over treasury
bills as interest rates were held negative in real terms. Indeed, the expansion of NDA
sustained the growth in reserve money through 2004/05, thus accommodating the rising
demand for private sector credit fueled by negative real interest rates. Private sector credit
growth accelerated from 2.5 percent of the initial broad money stock in 2002/03 to
14.3 percent in 2003/04.

In late 2003, staff became concerned with the steady increase in inflation, but the
authorities still preferred not to tighten monetary policy to avoid choking off the
growth momentum. Their view was that the increase in inflation largely reflected temporary
supply side factors, especially the rise in the wheat support price. Only in 2005 did the
continued increase in inflation lead the central bank to start tighten monetary policy more
forcefully, although interest rates were still left negative in real terms.
47.
In retrospect, with the acceleration of inflation since June 2003, the program’s
NDA targets turned out insufficiently restrictive. From the program design perspective,
however, inflation was below the program target of 5 percent until March 2004, while the
quantitative targets for the last PRGF review were set in August/September 2003. Staff did,
beginning in December 2003, consistently advise the authorities to tighten monetary policy
more aggressively by raising interest rates faster. The policy dialogue recognized the
inflation risk but the evidence on program ownership—and thus the expected readiness to
tighten policy, if needed—was strong
enough, so that the actual design of the

bank’s NDA could have helped to slow the
rise in inflation, forcing a more rapid
increase in interest rates.
D. Did Fund-Supported Policies Help to Reduce Poverty?
48.
The PRGF-supported program aimed to contribute to reducing poverty by
establishing conditions for higher, sustainable economic growth, and, more directly, by
creating room for higher social spending. Beyond that, the program did not include any
specific measures to aid the poor. A poverty reduction strategy was developed, and if
implemented is expected to result in poverty reduction over the medium and long term.
49.
Who benefits from higher growth depends to a large extent on the prevailing
socio-economic structure. Pakistan is a society with a small, very well-educated upper
class, a still relatively small middle class, and a very large, mostly rural, lower class that is
poorly educated and has little or no assets. The economic well-being of the poor largely
depends on developments that are external to them, leaving them vulnerable to adverse
circumstances. It will require a prolonged period of strong growth to enable low income
groups to start accumulating assets, thus reducing the risk that they will fall below the
poverty line if economic conditions worsen. In this regard, the past two Fund arrangements
can be said to have contributed to poverty reduction, albeit over a somewhat longer horizon,
by helping to establish conditions for continued strong growth of per capita incomes.

- 26 -

50.
Considerable emphasis was placed on increasing social spending. The
improvement in social outcomes could have been greater if not for the still weak
administrative and institutional capacity at the local government level. At the time of the
PRGF request, major efficiency gains in the delivery of key social services were expected
from the devolution process. However, devolution, as well as capacity building, takes time. It
would have been difficult for the Fund to place a greater emphasis on social outcomes, as this
would have implied entering into areas that are well outside its areas of expertise, and where
support was already forthcoming from the World Bank and the AsDB. A constraining factor
has been that political devolution has yet to be fully followed up with financial and
administrative devolution, to ensure that local governments have the financial means and
administrative authority to carry out their increased responsibilities. The Fund could have
become more involved in financial devolution issues, but it would have required taking
positions on the division of resources among the provinces and districts. This is a highly
complex and sensitive internal political issue, and it is unlikely that any Fund involvement
would have been helpful or successful.
51.
A number of specific measures may have had an adverse impact on the poor.
These measures include, for example, adjustment of energy prices, reducing subsidies on or
taxation of agricultural inputs, expanding the coverage of the sales tax, and the alignment of
NSS instruments with market interest rates. No social impact analyses were conducted,
however, and no specific consideration was given to strengthen the social safety net. The
existing social safety net schemes—the Kushal Pakistan Program, the Food Support
Program, and Zakat—were largely viewed as black boxes by the staff. To the extent that
these programs received budget support, it was left to the government to determine whether
part of the increased room for social spending was allocated to them.
52.
In sum, during the period of the PRGF, growth has resumed, a poverty
reduction strategy was developed, social spending was increased in line with
expectations, some social indicators have improved, and it appears likely that poverty
was decreased. These developments are welcome, but poverty remains widespread in
Pakistan. Given the prevailing socio-economic structure, it is to be expected that government
efforts, supported by the World Bank and Fund, can produce results only gradually in
Pakistan.
E. Was the Size of the 2001 PRGF Arrangement Appropriate?
53.
Pakistan’s 2001 PRGF was by far the largest PRGF ever in nominal terms, and
one of the five largest in terms of quota (100 percent).9 In view of the quick recovery of
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in 2001–03 and the scarcity of PRGF resources, was
such large access necessary?

9

The other large access members were Democratic Republic of Congo, Honduras, Djibouti, and Sierra Leone.

- 27 -

54.
In the fall of 2001, Pakistan faced a perilous external environment. The world
economy was weakening in the wake of September 11, and war was expected in neighboring
Afghanistan. Orders for exports were shrinking, and shipping costs increasing because of war
risks. Export growth projections were revised downwards, resulting in a sizable balance of
payments need.
55.
Under these circumstances, the large size of the PRGF arrangement clearly
reflected not just international political considerations but real economic needs. The
briefing paper for the mission that negotiated the PRGF called for access of 60 percent of
quota. The Pakistani authorities asked for higher access, and received the political support of
major shareholders after the events of September 11. But the increased support was also
consistent with the need to close a larger financing gap and additional uncertainty. At the
Board meeting, some Executive Directors argued that access should have been even higher
based on the recent strong track record of policy implementation and the strength of the
program.
56.
The exceptionally large PRGF loan was very effective in signaling the confidence
of the international community in Pakistan, and catalyzing public and private financial
flows. This support, together with political factors, encouraged Paris Club creditors to
provide generous debt relief, and the World Bank and the AsDB to commit major financial
support packages. Even more importantly, the signal of support from the international
community helped rebuild confidence at home and encouraged large private inflows,
especially remittances, which made a major contribution to the recovery of the external
position.
57.
In hindsight, Pakistan’s balance of payments appears overfinanced. The
combination of large official and private inflows contributed to high money growth,
eventually resulting in inflationary pressures. And in the end, Pakistan only drew 83 percent
of the PRGF loan. Although the financing outcome was impossible to predict under the
difficult circumstances of 2001, a substantially larger-than-targeted increase in official
reserves could have allowed the authorities to refrain from drawings on PRGF resources or
repay more expensive external debt ahead of time, thus accelerating debt reduction and
entering on a faster track to debt sustainability. A few Directors pressed for (and staff
discussed) Pakistan ceasing to draw on PRGF resources earlier in light of the strong foreign
exchange reserves. Regarding the access, however, the balance of payments outcome was
partly endogenous—smaller financial support might not have had the same confidence effect
that contributed to the outcome. Also, while vulnerabilities have diminished, they still exist,
which suggests that Fund support for the balance of payments was justified also on economic
grounds.

- 28 -

F. Did Fund-Bank Collaboration Contribute to the Success of the Program?
58.
There appears to have been good cooperation between World Bank and Fund
staffs, especially during the crisis period of 2000–02. In the financial sector, the World
Bank took the lead in supporting bank reforms (especially privatization) through a sectoral
loan, key elements of which were incorporated in the PRGF; the Fund focused on reform of
the NSS. In tax policy and administration, the Fund took the lead in providing strategic
advice, while the World Bank has provided financial resources to modernize the tax
administration. As regards poverty alleviation, Fund staff pressed for an increase of spending
at the macroeconomic level and improved reporting, while the World Bank focused on
building capacity in the regions, where health and education services were delivered.
59.
Cooperation on energy sector issues was intense, but more difficult than in other
structural areas. This largely reflected the different objectives of the two institutions. World
Bank staff were intent on Pakistan developing a power system based on international best
practices in the medium term and stepped away when they felt that the authorities lacked
commitment. Fund staff, on the other hand, were keen to reduce electricity subsidies in the
short-run and could not step away as these subsidies were a major cause of the fiscal
imbalance. Although World Bank staff worked closely with Fund staff and were on board
with program measures in the power sector, they tended to be skeptical of the impact of
partial measures and kept a distance in view of what they perceived as the lack of ownership.
This may in itself have weakened the measures. A more systematic effort to reconcile long
and short-term objectives in structural reform might have helped, but ultimately it was the
lack of commitment to reform by several energy sector stakeholders (outside the Ministry of
Finance) that undermined reform in the power sector.
G. How Did the Work of Fund Staff on Pakistan Evolve Following the IEO Report?
60.
In contrast to the IEO’s findings for the period until 1999, program design in the
successor arrangements was no longer affected by pressures to overpromise and
downplay risks. Staff working on Pakistan from 2000 felt no pressure to conclude programs
or reviews, regardless of the possible catalytic effects, even after the events of September 11.
In fact, there was considerable skepticism at the Board regarding Pakistan, especially in
2000/01. This situation was, for example, reflected in the wide array of conditionality in the
2000 SBA. The lack of political pressure on Fund staff was not recognized either in Pakistan
or outside, and many observers felt that political factors were the key to Fund support.
61.
The recent programs did not overpromise in terms of macroeconomic performance.
The IEO had noted a tendency for overly optimistic projections for key program parameters
(such as GDP growth, exports, and domestic savings and investment) and for some program
targets (such as budgetary revenue) prior to 2000. But unlike the preceding period, program
projections after 2000 were satisfactory. The trend in growth projections closely mirrors the

- 29 -

trend in actual data (Figure 17).10 On average, the growth rate of GDP was overestimated by
only 0.3 percentage points (compared to 1.5 percentage points in the previous programs
according to the IEO). Projections for the external sector also conformed well with the time path
of the actual data. The current account tended to overperform, mainly because of the abrupt and
sustained increase in private transfers that was picked up by the projections only with a delay.
For merchandise exports, the average forecast error was close to -4.5 percent, mostly due to
conservative projections over the last two years. Fiscal balance projections under both the SBA
and the PRGF were satisfactory although revenue forecasts were overly optimistic.
62.
High expectations may have been created as regards poverty reduction and
improved governance, in response to Board and management concerns for these issues.
Even in the absence of specific targets, the heavy emphasis in staff reports on poverty
reduction and improved governance may have suggested that major and prompt progress was
possible. As noted above, some progress was made, but the challenges remain significant,
and disappointment was often expressed by the Board. Staff could perhaps have emphasized
more the socio-political factors constraining progress in poverty reduction and governance,
and emphasized more that a longer time period would be needed to address these problems.
63.
Regarding selectivity in committing Fund resources, it could be argued that the
Fund should not have granted waivers for frequent breaches of structural performance criteria
and interrupted the SBA and PRGF-supported programs in the view of the generally
disappointing performance in the tax and energy reforms. However, macroeconomic
objectives and fiscal targets were being met or exceeded, structural policies were making
progress in many other areas, and overall waiver rates were lower than average in Fund
programs, which appears to justify the waivers. Moreover, program interruption could have
been highly disruptive, undermining the government’s reform efforts.
64.
Despite the problems to which the IEO has drawn attention, without Fund (and
World Bank) support during the 1990s, the economic situation at the end of that decade
might well have been worse than it was. The country could have accumulated sizable external
arrears or had more severe macroeconomic imbalances. By 2000, Pakistan already had a fairly
liberal trade and exchange system as opposed to protectionism and exchange controls. Thus,
continued Fund support probably ensured that when a more committed government came to
office, it had fewer hurdles to overcome than otherwise. The counterfactual—that an economic
crisis, triggering reforms, might have occurred earlier, had the Fund disengaged in the 1990s—
can, of course, only be speculated at.

10

In the accompanying figure, the first data observation on each program/review line is the point estimate for the
preceding (pre-program) period. Thus, the starting point for the 2000 SBA (November 2000–September 2001) is
the 1999/2000 preliminary estimate; the starting point for the 2001 PRGF (October 2001–September 2004) is the
2000/01 preliminary estimate; and the starting point for the fourth review of the PRGF (incorporating data
available at November 2002) is the 2001/02 preliminary estimate. Therefore, the program projections start with the
second data point in each program/review line, and a starting point, which is off the “actual” line, indicates
subsequent revisions to the most recent data on which the program projections were based.

65.
The recent programs by and large appear to have pursued the right goals.
Stabilizing the macroeconomic situation was of immediate concern in 2000. The 2001
program design appropriately took a longer-term view, aiming to increase Pakistan’s growth
potential, improving social outcomes, and reducing external vulnerabilities. The quantitative
conditionality (as well as some prior actions) focused on consolidating macroeconomic
stability, reducing vulnerability, and ensuring an increase in social spending. Unlike in the
previous period, public debt sustainability was a central issue in the PRGF-supported
program, and indeed was the key factor in determining the required amount of fiscal
adjustment.
66.
Structural conditionality focused on critical issues, but could have been more
selective—individual measures subject to conditionality were often not critical. The
results varied according to the authorities’ commitment in particular areas and their ability to
overcome vested interests. Especially in those areas where success would have required
cooperation at lower levels of government, or in public enterprises, progress appears to have
been less satisfactory.
67.
Article IV reports from 2000 on made a greater effort to identify risks and
vulnerabilities. Issues on which the authorities and staff differed were discussed in the
reports. The 2002 Article IV report was considered a good example of how to treat program
review and Article IV issues in the same report, without neglecting the surveillance side.
Nevertheless, to what extent the staff were able to step back and take a broader view is
debatable. Alternative strategies to the PRGF were not discussed.
IV. LESSONS FOR THE FUND
68.
The Pakistan experience during 2000–04 confirms that program ownership is
decisive. But even in one country, it can vary widely across issues, depending on a complex
set of political, economic, and security factors. The more difficult question is whether the
Fund should be selective and step back, as the IEO report suggested, in cases where the
political environment is not right for reform and ownership is lacking. In the case of
Pakistan, it is quite possible that it would have had been more difficult for the country to take
advantage of the change in government and external environment that came about in 2001 if
the Fund (and other international institutions) had had disengaged earlier because of the past
weak program implementation.
69.
The staff experience with Pakistan underscores the complexities involved in
designing structural conditionality under the Fund programs that achieves both
country ownership and the objectives of the program. First, while it is relatively
straightforward to identify critical issues (e.g., tax collection) it is much more difficult to find
individual measures that are macrorelevant, let alone critical, to the success of a program.
This is partly because many structural reforms show effects only well beyond the program
horizon. Second, overall ownership of policies by a government is important, but ownership
and political constraints need to be assessed also with respect to specific reforms. Without
ownership at all necessary levels, it is virtually impossible to ensure effective

- 32 -

implementation of many reforms, and there is little point in adding more conditions and
trying to close every possible loophole. Third, if a measure is truly critical and there is no
political will, there may be a case for stepping back, but caution, and some humility, needs to
be exercised by Fund staff in determining what is truly critical.
70.
Fund structural conditionality is best suited to areas where a few individual
measures taken by the central government can bring progress. Where prolonged
institution-building and capacity-enhancement are needed, particularly in areas outside the
Fund’s core expertise, World Bank (and other IFIs) involvement is essential, and the Fund
should not embark on such reforms without the World Bank fully on board. Areas that
require cooperation at lower levels of government may also pose considerable difficulties,
particularly when special interest groups are strong. All these considerations suggest a
greater need for selectivity and leaving more areas of reform to be treated as less time-bound
commitments.
71.
Fund advice on tax reforms needs to balance the requirement to increase tax
ratios with the need to develop an efficient, client-friendly system based on best
practices. Political will and implementation capacity to bring new taxpayers into the net
need to be assessed explicitly when setting conditionality. If either true commitment or
technical capacity to implement revenue-gaining reforms is lacking, other reforms that
enhance efficiency but are revenue-losing in the short-run may need to be delayed. With the
benefit of hindsight, the reduction of tariffs and other revenue-losing measures could have
been delayed until alternative sources of revenue were fully implemented. In coming years,
as interest costs are likely to rise and nontax revenues may not continue to increase at the
same pace as in the last few years, broadening the tax base will be crucial to meet the rising
demand for social and development spending, while continuing to reduce the debt burden.
72.
Pakistan’s experience with strong foreign exchange inflows raises the question of
whether exchange rate adjustment should always be the preferred option to maintain
price stability. This is a fairly common problem, for which there are no easy answers.
Pakistan’s real exchange rate does not appear to have been significantly undervalued. A real
appreciation could have made it more difficult for Pakistan’s textile manufacturers to
position themselves ahead of the elimination of the quota regime. Thus, with hindsight, the
SBP appears to have made the right choice when it was leaning against a nominal
appreciation. However, the SBP should have moved faster in raising interest rates once
inflation started to pick up, as was recommended by the staff.
73.
The experience with Pakistan’s recent programs suggests that Fund staff should
not overpromise in terms of short-run poverty reduction. Poverty is often caused by
deeply ingrained socio-economic factors. Apart from focusing on growth in average per
capita incomes, Fund staff can press for more and better targeted social spending, as well as
better management of such spending programs. But these are not the only elements in a
successful poverty reduction strategy, and they may not be sufficient to address poverty in
the short-run.

- 33 -

74.
Better macroeconomic governance and transparency can be achieved even in the
most difficult program cases. However, overall perceptions of governance in a particular
country are often determined by performance in areas such as utilities, civil service, law and
order, and the judiciary, which are outside the Fund’s mandate. As the Pakistani experience
shows, achieving tangible results in governance through Fund-supported programs should
not be oversold.
75.
Even in cases of very successful World Bank-Fund collaboration, the issue of
short versus long-term reforms needs to be addressed. Rather than setting its own specific
conditionality for the power sector, Fund staff could have focused more forcefully on the
overall quasi-fiscal deficit of the sector and asked the World Bank staff to design the specific
measures that would improve performance in the short-run, by raising the average tariff,
strengthening bill collection, and reducing losses, even if there was a lack of commitment for
fundamental energy sector reform. This would have required a clear accord at the senior
management level.
76.
The Pakistani experience shows that large, up-front Fund financial support,
together with strong domestic policy implementation, can be very effective in catalyzing
public and private sector support even in a very uncertain political and security
situation. To consolidate success in Pakistan requires perseverance and the authorities and
Fund staff need to be prepared to deal with shocks and avoid policy slippages. On the
macroeconomic front, the risk of excessive inflation has become apparent and tax revenue
continues to lack buoyancy. Energy sector reforms are not yet complete. Governance needs
to be further strengthened in public institutions, which would also help to ensure that the
benefits of growth reach the poor.
77.
Pakistan and the Fund will need to continue to cooperate closely. In the context of
surveillance and technical assistance, Fund staff will continue to provide advice to the
authorities on the macroeconomic policy mix; financial, fiscal, and external vulnerabilities;
and the creation of fiscal space to allow for increased social and development spending.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Pakistan
and Iqbal Zaidi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 2, 2005

Key Points:


Steadfast implementation of prudent financial policies and bold structural reforms
has led to a remarkable turnaround in the economy, which went from the brink of
financial crisis to one of the highest growth rates in the world;



The authorities have taken welcome steps to protect their fiscal deficit target in the
wake of recent international oil price hikes, including significant increases in
domestic petroleum retail prices. The CBR reform project should enhance revenue
collection significantly. Various indicators point to progress toward poverty
reduction;



The overriding objective in the conduct of monetary policy is to contain inflation, and
the SBP has tightened monetary policy in recent months to combat inflation;



Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the financial sector, and
banks’ financial soundness indicators have improved;



The authorities scaled new heights in their ambitious privatization program, with the
completion of the largest privatization transaction in Pakistan’s history;



The main findings of the ex post assessment are that Pakistan’s Fund-supported
programs during 2000–04 were successful because of the authorities’ strong
ownership. Considerable progress was made in most areas, including some difficult
structural reforms, such as financial sector and public enterprise reforms; and



In answering the question whether structural conditionality was appropriate, staff
have noted that the “conditionality in the 2000 SBA clearly did not meet the test of
parsimony.” Although recent experience with Fund-supported programs has shown
that judicious streamlining of conditionality provides the welcome result that ‘less is
more,’ unfortunately, this valuable lesson was not applied to Pakistan.

The Pakistan authorities express their sincere appreciation and gratitude for the
compassionate response by the international community in the aftermath of the devastating
earthquake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale. The earthquake has caused untold suffering
and unprecedented damage, taking 80,000 lives, severely injuring over 70,000, and breaking
up hundreds of thousands of homes and families. The infrastructure damage will take billions
of dollars and five to ten years to rebuild, according to the UN relief mission. But even with
many countries responding in a timely and significant way to provide material help in the
wake of this calamity, it is clear that this is a devastating humanitarian disaster that requires a

-2scaled-up response from the international community. Medical relief teams have predicted
that thousands of earthquake victims could die from the effects of cold weather as winter
approaches and as illnesses and infections go untreated. The biggest problem is that
3.3 million have become homeless, and thousands of survivors face death from exposure;
entire villages have been living outdoors in increasingly harsh conditions, with many,
including children, lacking warm clothing or blankets. The authorities and volunteers from
all over Pakistan are doing their utmost, but they need help.
I. Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
The authorities wish to convey to Fund management and staff their appreciation for the
continued support to Pakistan through policy dialogue and technical advice over the years,
and, until recently, Fund-supported programs. This relationship, based on mutual trust and
respect, has been of considerable value to the authorities in implementation of their
“homemade” policies—supported by a strong commitment from all segments of the
society—that has led to a remarkable turnaround in the economy, which went in the short
spate of five years from the brink of financial crisis to one of the highest growth rates in the
world.
As noted in Chapter II of the Selected Issues paper, economic growth reached 8.4 percent
in 2004/05 and is expected to remain high despite the deterioration in the terms of trade.
Economic growth has averaged 5½ percent per year since 1960, meaning that real per capita
GDP has been growing at about 2¾ percent per year, or that real incomes have more than
tripled during this period. It is noteworthy that the recent growth acceleration has come
largely from an increase in total factor productivity (TFP). The robust TFP growth may be
attributed, in part, to the growing contribution of the services sector to growth, and that there
was not much need for new investments due to the slump of the late 1990s and the excess
capacity in the economy. However, it should be stressed that structural reforms aimed at
fostering both productivity gains and higher investment, including in the domain of
infrastructure and governance, were major factors behind this growth performance.
Furthermore, many indicators show that investment rose last year and new capacity will
come on stream during 2005/06, even though the national accounts data appear to understate
private investment because of incomplete coverage of firms.
Fiscal Policy
Staff have noted that the government has taken welcome steps to protect their fiscal deficit
target of 3.8 percent of GDP in the wake of recent international oil price hikes, including
significant increases in petroleum retail prices in September and October. The authorities are
well aware that tax buoyancy has been low, and Central Board of Revenue (CBR) tax
collection declined when measured as a percent of GDP in 2004/05. The decline reflected
mainly the transition costs of streamlining the tax system to improve the business climate,
but they are taking corrective measures to bolster tax collection. Recent work done at CBR
has shown that two-thirds of corporate tax filers had reported declining or unchanged income
in 2004/05 even though overall growth had accelerated. While some of this inconsistency
may be explained by differential growth rates and varying tax coverage across sectors, the

-3authorities are confident that additional efforts should lead to higher collections from existing
taxpayers. The authorities recognize that medium-term fiscal objectives can only be met with
a marked improvement in revenue performance, and they have taken important steps toward
that goal. In particular, the CBR reform project, supported by the World Bank, should
enhance revenue collection, and the move to a greater reliance on self-assessment and
risk-based auditing should make the tax machinery more efficient and taxpayer-friendly;
taxpayer disgruntlement with the heavy tax machinery and low tax compliance have been
perennial problems. The need for further extending the tax net into the service and
agriculture sectors in a meaningful way has been recognized by the authorities, but this has
been a laborious process that has required the cooperation of the provincial governments;
past strenuous efforts at the federal level have resulted in only limited gains.
The government is targeting higher social and development spending, while further reducing
the debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities and staff agreed that it was crucial to increase the
quality and effectiveness of social spending, including through the implementation of a
medium-term budget framework, and enhancing administrative and financial capacity at the
district level. To build up on the progress in poverty reduction, the authorities have planned
further increases in social spending, particularly on health and education. Debt dynamics are
distinctly favorable over the medium term: staff projects domestic and external debt to
continue on their downward path, and international reserves to remain at adequate levels. The
recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Law should provide additional confidence to official
donors and private investors because it mandates continued debt reduction by at least
2½ percent of GDP per year.
Poverty Reduction
Although various indicators point to progress toward poverty reduction, the authorities have
reiterated their commitment to make further inroads in this top priority issue. In particular,
they are determined to increase spending in health and education because that is a sine qua
non for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It is comforting to note that results
from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey show improvements in
various health and education outcomes. Recently, there has also been significant increases in
indicators for wages and employment, while the high growth in agriculture is estimated to
have raised disposable incomes in rural areas. Pakistan has further improved its ranking in
the 2005 United Nation’s Human Development Index.
Monetary Policy
The overriding objective in the conduct of monetary policy is to contain inflation. The
authorities have tightened monetary policy significantly, which, combined with measures to
increase domestic food supply, should be sufficient to achieve the 8 percent inflation target
in 2005/06. Since the beginning of 2005, the SBP has raised the six-month treasury bill (Tbill) rate by more than 4 percentage points to 8 percent in May. Nevertheless, as stated in the
July 2005 monetary policy statement, the SBP stood ready to raise T-bill rates further, if
necessary.

-4Exchange rate policy has served Pakistan well in recent years, contributing to strong export
growth and reduced external vulnerabilities. The SBP is committed to exchange rate
flexibility; intervention in the foreign exchange market is limited to preventing excess
volatility. The sharp increase in international reserves since 2001 has allowed Pakistan to
catch up with levels maintained by similarly-placed countries, and a further increase in
reserves should be realized in 2005/06.
External competitiveness has been enhanced, as the real effective exchange rate has been on
a depreciating trend for the last five years. The modest appreciation in the first half of 2005
and the shift of the current account into deficit should not raise concerns about the
appropriateness of the real exchange rate. The strong performance of Pakistan’s exports,
including the shift toward manufactured exports and the increase in market share, is an
important, if not definitive indicator, of competitiveness. Furthermore, the widening trade
deficit has been partly financed by a significant increase in private transfers, and the recent
surge in imports has been mainly due to imports of machinery, which suggests that once the
equipment is installed, there should be a major boost in the export-oriented industries.
Financial Sector
Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the financial sector. The banking
system has become more competitive, banks’ financial soundness indicators have improved,
and the sector shows resilience in standard stress tests performed by Fund and SBP staff.
Although the high rate of credit growth may raise concerns about prudential standards
because of a rebound in corporate indebtedness, the stress tests show that, in general,
corporate vulnerabilities were declining and in line with comparator countries. Even though
the authorities were confident that banks had strengthened substantially their risk
management, SBP has again demonstrated its willingness to err on the side of caution, and
recently mandated special provisioning requirements for secured and unsecured consumer
financing of 1.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
Investment Climate and Governance
The authorities have pursued their structural reform agenda forcefully: staff have noted that
the overall business climate and governance in key macroeconomic institutions have clearly
improved, as attested to the data on fiscal transparency and various financial ROSCs. Also,
according to the 2005 Doing Business survey of the World Bank, Pakistan has made progress
in enhancing the business climate and compares well within the region. Notwithstanding this
progress, the authorities have stressed that improving governance in all public institutions
remains a high priority, and they are determined to create an environment conducive to
investment.
Privatization
The authorities scaled new heights this year in their ambitious privatization program when
the largest privatization transaction in Pakistan’s history took place, with the sale, together
with management control of 26 percent of the telecommunication company. The winning bid

-5amounted to $2.6 billion (2¼ percent of GDP). The sale of other major companies—large
and strategic companies, such as Pakistan Steel and Pakistan Petroleum—is underway.
II. Ex Post Assessment of Pakistan’s Longer-Term Program Engagement
The main findings of the ex post assessment are that Pakistan’s Fund-supported programs
during 2000–04 had been successful because of the authorities’ strong ownership.
Recognizing that the previous programs had suffered from substantial policy slippages, the
new government addressed the economic difficulties with a new commitment to break away
from past trends. Considerable progress was made in most areas, including some difficult
structural reforms, such as financial sector and public enterprise reforms. The economy not
only recovered, but entered a high growth with low inflation phase. The 2000 Stand-by
Arrangement (SBA) and the 2001 three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) were successfully completed without extensions.
Notwithstanding the noteworthy progress made in most areas under the last two
Fund-supported programs, staff have noted that progress was slower in areas where broader
institution building or cooperation from lower levels of government was needed. One of the
objectives of the last two programs had been a significant expansion of the tax base to create
room for achieving the twin goals of higher social spending and debt reduction, but tax
collection remained disappointing. Another area that has been subjected to much criticism in
the review by staff is conditionality in Pakistan’s Fund-supported programs, which became
increasingly extensive after 1999. Structural conditionality peaked in the 2000 SBA: the total
of 56 PCs, benchmarks and prior actions in this arrangement was nearly three times the
Fund-wide average of 19 conditions in GRA-supported programs.
Staff note that following the 2000 SBA, structural conditionality was reduced gradually not
only because of Pakistan’s improved performance, but also because of rising doubts in the
Fund about the effectiveness of large policy matrices of conditions. Nevertheless, it is worth
noting that, notwithstanding the overall drive in the Fund to streamline conditionality,
Pakistan had remained burdened with an excessive number of structural conditions, and only
in the last program year did their number approach the Fundwide average for PRGFsupported programs, but even then it was slightly higher. It is a tribute to the authorities’
dedication and steadfast adherence to program implementation in 2001–04 that their program
compared favorably to the average PRGF-supported programs. For example, waiver rates
were comparable to, or even lower than, those in average Fund-supported programs despite
the larger number of conditions attached to the program. Furthermore, not only was the
frequency of waiver requests lower than the average for all programs, but most of the waivers
were needed because of delays in implementation rather than an outright lack of
implementation. This was particularly true for energy sector measures, which typically
required more time to overcome political or technical hurdles.
In answering the question of whether structural conditionality was appropriate, staff have
noted that the “conditionality in the 2000 SBA clearly did not meet the test of parsimony. In
terms of numbers, structural conditions exceeded Fundwide averages by a wide margin.
Moreover, conditions were not limited to just those areas that were macrorelevant and critical

-6to the success of the program.” Staff are correct in stressing that “[s]tructural conditionality
focused on critical issues, but could have been more selective—individual measures subject
to conditionality were often not critical.” A main conclusion of the ex post assessment is that
“[o]verall, it appears that Fund structural conditionality was not well-suited for areas that
require longer-term institution building and the cooperation of more than just the central
government.” All in all, it would be fair to say that although the recent experience with
Fund-supported programs has shown that judicious streamlining of conditionality provides
the welcome result that ‘less is more,’ this valuable lesson was, unfortunately, not applied to
Pakistan.
In light of staff’s criticism on the conditionality attached to the programs, one comes away
from reading this review with all the more admiration for the authorities for their
perseverance with program implementation. The authorities and staff are rightly satisfied that
all disbursements were made available upon completion of the program reviews. In fact, the
authorities decided not to draw the last tranche under the PRGF arrangement or seek a
successor arrangement because of the vastly improved external situation, reflecting that
growth in 2004/05 was among the highest in the world, vulnerabilities had been greatly
reduced, and Pakistan had successfully re-entered the international financial markets.
That said, the authorities have expressed frustration with the frequent need for waivers of
structural performance criteria, even for minor deviations or brief delays. They are correct to
ask the Fund to review its procedures for deciding whether a performance criterion has been
met, or not. This also leads us to today’s report on the noncomplying disbursements and
recommendation for waiver of nonobservance of performance criterion, which is truly
bewildering, and we discuss it in a separate statement. How could there be a misreporting in
this case, even if one only juxtaposes the following two quotes from staff and the authorities?
Staff note in the ex post assessment that “[m]easures to improve the tax system dominated
conditionality in the 2000 SBA and the 2001 PRGF arrangements, reflecting the critical
importance attached to increasing the revenue intake.” The authorities note in their letter to
the Managing Director on the purported misreporting: “…it is hard to understand why there
would have been no reference to SRO 207 in the communication between the Resident
Representative and Central Board of Revenue (CBR) officials, because there were several
use of Fund resources missions to Pakistan in 2002, and it is routine to ask for this
information in advance of the arrival of the mission.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Pakistan
On November 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultations with Pakistan.1
Background
In 2004/05 (July/June), Pakistan’s macroeconomic performance continued to be favorable,
despite some inflationary and external pressures. Economic growth is estimated to have
reached 8.4 percent in 2004/05, driven by manufacturing, and bumper harvests that
benefited from timely rains. However, 12-month inflation reached 11 percent in April 2005,
before easing to 8.4 percent in August. Strong growth, including in agriculture, combined
with rising wages and employment according to some indicators, is expected to have
yielded some reduction in poverty. Data from a household survey to be released later this
year will provide further information in this regard.
Fiscal targets for 2004/05 were broadly met, with the overall deficit (excluding grants) at
3.3 percent of GDP. Government debt was reduced to just below 60 percent of GDP.
The tax-to-GDP ratio fell because of the elimination of excises on petroleum products to
offset the impact of rising international oil prices, and a number of tax relief measures in the
2004/05 budget.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2Concerned with double digit inflation and high capacity utilization, the State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) has tightened monetary policy. Since the beginning of 2005, the SBP has
raised the six-month treasury bill rate by more than 4 percentage points to 8 percent in May,
but has kept it broadly unchanged since then; key interest rates remain slightly negative in
real terms. Despite the tightening, reserve money growth has not slowed down because the
SBP provided substantial budget financing during the year as the government’s gross
financing needs could not be fully met from the market at prevailing rates.
Despite higher worker’s remittances, the current account moved into deficit in 2004/05.
Exports, and in particular textile exports following the end of the textile quota system, have
performed well in the first six months of 2005. But import grew even faster, reflecting higher
oil prices and strong demand, including for machinery. Gross reserves fell somewhat in
2004/05, notwithstanding a continued increase in non-debt-creating inflows and substantial
concessional financing. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated modestly over the
last few months given the stable U.S. dollar–Pakistani rupee exchange rate and the
substantial inflation differential.
The 2005/06 budget targets a deficit (excluding grants) of 3.8 percent of GDP. The budget
shows little revenue buoyancy; again, a number of tax relief measures were introduced for
exporters and the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, even with the increase in the fiscal
deficit, government debt would fall to 52 percent of GDP. The government has taken steps
to offset pressures on fiscal policy from rising international oil prices and should be able to
achieve the budget target. In particular, significant increase in domestic retail prices of
petroleum products was implemented in September and October. Expenditures will be
tightly controlled, but priority will be given to achieving the development expenditure target.
Progress has been made on the government’s structural reform agenda, in particular in the
area of privatization. In June 2005, the largest transaction so far in Pakistan’s privatization
program took place, with the sale of 26 percent, together with management control, of a
large telecommunication company. The sale of several other major companies is underway.
Energy sector reforms have again proven to take longer than envisaged. While the
unbundling of the other large power utility is almost complete, the individual distribution
companies cannot start to operate independently because regional tariffs have yet to be
notified.
Cooperation with the Fund has been fruitful. In contrast to earlier experience, the 2000
Stand-by Arrangement and the 2001–04 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
were in large part implemented steadfastly. Moreover, many recommendations made at the
time of the 2004 Article IV consultations have been implemented. In analyzing policy
implementation under the PRGF arrangement, it was noted that the correction of a tax
anomaly that had not been previously discussed between the authorities and the Fund had
resulted in an insignificant deviation from a structural performance criterion but without any
effect on fiscal outcomes. This does not change the Fund’s favorable assessment of policy
implementation under the program.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed their sympathy and condolences for the loss of life and the
large-scale destruction caused by the recent earthquake that hit the northern parts of

-3Pakistan. They welcomed the pledges of support that have been made by the international
community to address urgent needs and assist with the reconstruction, and called for
substantial additional assistance, especially grants, to help the government overcome the
crisis without adversely affecting implementation of broader economic policies. In this
regard, several Directors noted that they would support a request for Emergency Natural
Disaster Assistance from the Fund, if the Pakistani authorities were to make such a request.
Directors commended Pakistan’s impressive macroeconomic results in recent years—in
particular, the acceleration of economic growth—which have laid the ground for a decline in
government debt, financial market stability, and the recent re-access to international capital
markets. Directors noted the significant improvement in various health and education
indicators. At the same time, they observed that poverty remains widespread, and that
achieving the Millennium Development Goals will be a challenge, particularly given the
added need to rebuild northern Pakistan. Going forward Directors considered that the key
challenge for the medium term will be to sustain the high growth rate and reduce poverty in
the context of price stability. Directors therefore welcomed the Pakistani authorities’
determination to maintain macrostability in the face of the earthquake. They also
emphasized the importance of continued structural reforms, particularly the need to create a
business climate conducive to investment.
Directors noted that, in light of the earthquake, some widening of the budget deficit in
2005/06 might be unavoidable. However, they did not expect this to alter significantly the
declining trend of Pakistan’s debt indicators. They cautioned, however, that the overall debt
burden continues to be high and needs close monitoring, and welcomed the adoption of the
Fiscal Responsibility Law that requires a further reduction of the debt burden. Directors
commended the authorities for having passed on much of the increase in international oil
prices to consumers to help contain fiscal pressures, and recommended a continuation of
this policy.
Directors stressed that meeting the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives will require a
marked improvement in revenue performance. In this regard, they were disappointed by the
lack of progress made over the last five years in raising the ratio of tax revenue to GDP.
A few Directors expressed concern that the authorities have returned to the past practice of
granting exemptions and zero ratings. While agreeing that improving compliance by existing
taxpayers is important to increase tax collections, Directors urged the authorities to extend
the tax net to the services sector and to work with provincial governments to have the
agricultural sector pay its fair share of taxes.
Directors expressed concern about the increase in inflation in the last two years and the
widening of the current account deficit. They cautioned that relief and reconstruction efforts
could add further pressures on both prices and the balance of payments. Directors
commended the State Bank of Pakistan for raising interest rates sharply in the first half of
2005, and some urged the central bank to raise interest rates further if inflationary
pressures persist. Directors stressed the need to sterilize effectively central bank financing
of the budget. Directors welcomed the continuing improvement in the health of the financial
sector. While noting that the strong credit growth currently appears in part to be the
encouraging outcome of financial liberalization, Directors cautioned that this could be a
source of vulnerability in the future. They advised the State Bank of Pakistan to monitor

-4credit development carefully. Directors generally considered that the current exchange rate
regime has served Pakistan well.
Directors were impressed by the overall progress made in privatizing state-owned
enterprises, and welcomed the authorities’ plans for further sales. However, they expressed
concern about the electricity sector’s sizable drain on the budget and urged stepped-up
reform in this sector. They urged the authorities to complete the new tariff framework so that
the successor companies of the Water and Power Development Authority could start
functioning independently. Directors were encouraged by the prospects of the Karachi
Electric Supply Corporation being transferred into private hands. More generally,
Directors urged the authorities to continue with structural reforms aimed at improving the
business environment and governance.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality and timeliness of data,
including data on the domestic debt, in order to allow better analysis and policy formulation,
and with a view to subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Directors welcomed the ex post assessment of the Fund’s involvement in Pakistan.
They noted the dramatic change in ownership of economic policies compared to much of
the 1990s. While acknowledging the importance of international support, Directors
emphasized that steadfast implementation of sound policies and broad-based structural
reforms were mainly responsible for the economic recovery. Directors agreed that
conditionality under the 2000 Stand-By Arrangement had been extensive; nevertheless,
the authorities demonstrated commendable perseverance in the implementation of strong
policies and established a strong track record that paved the way for the 2001 arrangement
under the PRGF. Directors note that Pakistan’s program performance since 2000 compared
favorably to the average Fund-supported program, and even though Pakistan had a larger
number of structural conditions, the waiver rates were lower than the Fund-wide average,
some of which involved minor or temporary deviations from program targets.
Directors supported management’s recommendation to waive the nonobservance in 2002 of
the performance criterion precluding new tax exemptions, stemming from a minor sales tax
adjustment that has had no revenue impact and which had not been previously discussed
between the authorities and the staff. Many Directors, although not representing a majority
of the vote, questioned, however, whether there had been a breach of a performance
criterion, since the sales tax exemption was immaterial as it had no revenue implication,
and saw no need for the Board to grant a waiver.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
