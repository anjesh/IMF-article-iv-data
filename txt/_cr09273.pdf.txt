Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with South Africa
Approved by Mark Plant and Aasim Husain

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The global financial crisis has sharply altered the outlook for an already slowing
economy. Large capital outflows lowered stock prices and depreciated the rand in late 2008. A sharp
decline in external demand and a slump in commodity prices have pushed the economy into a
recession. Inflows have returned and the rand has appreciated recently, but inflation risks have
increased and the current account deficit is projected to widen again. The risks to the outlook are
mainly on the downside. The banking system has remained liquid and well-capitalized, but impaired
loans are rising as the economy weakens. Policies have been countercyclical, with a large
investment-centered fiscal stimulus in FY 2008/9 followed by further easing in FY2009/10, and
substantial monetary easing in the first half of 2009. Medium-term budget plans envisage a
moderation in spending growth over the medium term.
Challenges: In the near term, the key challenge for macroeconomic policies is to strike the right
balance between supporting domestic demand and maintaining price and external stability. A strong
push for structural reforms to address the long standing barriers to growth and employment is
urgently needed, also to insulate macroeconomic policies from recession-induced pressures.
Staff views: The expansionary fiscal stance is appropriate given the weak economic outlook, and
strikes the right balance between supporting demand and preserving medium-term sustainability. If
output turns out weaker than staff projects, the automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate in
FY2009/10 and FY2010/11, but spending growth would need to be moderated further when the
economy recovers, in order to stabilize medium-term public debt at a prudent level. There are risks
to the medium-term fiscal position, particularly if complementary reforms to improve public service
delivery and enhance efficiency in infrastructure provision are delayed. The monetary policy stance
has been appropriate. The scope for easing may have been exhausted if inflation is to be brought
within the target range by end-2010, as the authorities intend.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment. They acknowledged the
risks to their medium-term fiscal position, but emphasized that they intend to run a disciplined and
pragmatic fiscal policy, including to take action well before net government and government
guaranteed debt reaches their debt limit of 50 percent of GDP. They are also focusing on improving
public service delivery. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) noted inflation risks and indicated
its intention to use monetary policy as needed to anchor inflation expectations and bring inflation
within its target band. Supervisors intend to continue to ensure that banks’ provisioning and capital
buffers remain adequate to meet increasing risks, while strengthening the regulatory framework.

I. BACKGROUND: A RECESSION BRINGS NEW CHALLENGES1
1.
South Africa enjoyed a buoyant economy in the mid-2000s. A favorable external
environment and strong domestic demand, accommodated by rapid credit expansion, raised
growth to 5 percent on average in 2004–07 and lowered the unemployment rate by
5 percentage points, despite growing labor force participation (Figure 1). Sound
macroeconomic policies, underpinned by a consistent and transparent policy framework,
contributed significantly to the expansion by strengthening public finances, maintaining
single digit inflation, and improving external reserves. Rising employment, personal income,
and wealth effects buoyed household consumption, while strong business confidence and
high commodity prices supported private investment. Surging investment and a falling saving
rate resulted in a widening current account deficit, which was financed largely by portfolio
inflows. However, the demand-led expansion, together with soaring international food and
fuel prices, also created inflation pressures and led the SARB to embark on a tightening cycle
in mid-2006. The slowdown in the global economy, power shortages, and rising interest rate
dampened growth starting in mid-2008.
2.
The global financial crisis of late 2008 sharply changed the outlook for an
already slowing economy and posed new challenges for macroeconomic policies.


Large capital outflows, triggered by investor withdrawal from emerging market
assets lowered stock prices and depreciated the rand (Figure 2). South Africa-specific
factors, such as the high current account deficit and policy uncertainties created by
the upcoming national elections in April 2009, also contributed to an elevated
perception of risk.



A sharp decline in external demand and a slump in the prices of some major export
commodities weakened the economy further.

These shocks pushed the economy into a recession while the costs of borrowing in
international markets rose significantly, as for other emerging market economies (EMEs).
3.
The national elections in April 2009 returned the African National Congress
(ANC) to power. The ANC won the elections by a comfortable margin and Parliament
elected Mr. Zuma as President. The new government has emphasized its commitment to
policy continuity in key areas and to improving the delivery of public services.

1

The discussions were held during June 17–July 2, 2008. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, the
Registrar of Banks, the Chief Economist of the South African Reserve Bank, other senior officials, and
representatives of the financial and business sectors, trade unions, and the academic community. The staff team
comprised Ms. Coorey (head), Messrs. Gueorguiev and Ramcharan and Ms. Aydin (all AFR), Ms. Stuart (SPR),
and Mr. Espinosa (MCM). Mr. Nolan (senior resident representative in Pretoria) and Mr. Aboobaker (OED)
also attended the meetings.

6
4.
Financial markets have begun to stabilize recently, driven by global shifts in
financing to emerging market economies, rather than South Africa specific factors.
Starting in early 2009, portfolio inflows have returned, netting some US$6 billion for the
year by end-June. The rand has now recovered its losses, returning in early June to its level
(in nominal effective terms) as of mid-September when the acute phase of the crisis began.
Similarly, the main stock market index, which first declined sharply as weakness in financial
equities was compounded by weak commodity stocks, has recovered strongly since early
March. After widening significantly, credit default swap and EMBI spreads have declined to
pre-September 2008 levels (Figure 3).
5.
By contrast, output and demand remain weak, but recent indicators suggest that
the pace of deterioration may be slowing. Output fell by 1.8 percent (q-o-q, saar) in
Q4:2008 and by a larger-than-expected 6.4 percent in Q1:2009. Manufacturing and mining
output have contracted dramatically, but seemed to have bottomed out recently. Residential
property prices have continued their downward trend. Consumer spending has fallen, but
investment has remained resilient, partly due to higher public infrastructure spending. Indices
of leading indicators and business and consumer confidence remain weak, but have shown
some improvement recently. The economy lost over 200,000 jobs in early 2009, and
unemployment rose to 23.5 percent in Q1:2009 from a low of 21.9 percent in Q4:2008.

6.
South Africa continues to face formidable medium-term structural challenges
largely reflecting its apartheid legacy. Even during the economic expansion of 2004–07,
output growth was lower than that in many other EMEs. Despite strong employment growth
over the past several years, the unemployment rate is very high at over 23 percent, even as
labor force participation remains lower than in other emerging market economies. Income
inequality, amongst the highest in the world, has improved only modestly over the past
decade despite steadily rising public spending on social services and transfers.

7.
In the short term the central challenge for macroeconomic policies in this
uncertain global environment is to strike the right balance between supporting
domestic demand and maintaining price and external stability. In the medium term, the
challenge will be to ensure that the fiscal position remains sustainable given spending
pressures and large external deficits, while a renewed push on structural reform addresses
long-standing barriers that constrain growth and employment. Within this overarching theme,
discussions focused on:


assessing the economic outlook and risks;

and policies to:


support demand in the face of the large external shocks, while containing inflation
pressures and current account vulnerabilities;



ensure stability in the financial system given global and domestic risks; and



safeguard medium-term growth prospects by ensuring that key constraints which
also pose risks for the medium-term fiscal position are addressed, while existing
structural policies are not undermined by pressures from the downturn.
II. OUTLOOK: A SLOWLY RECOVERING ECONOMY WITH
SUBSTANTIAL DOWNSIDE RISKS

8.
The short-term outlook for South Africa remains subdued. Output is expected to
gradually recover, while inflation and the current account deficit are likely to remain
elevated. Staff projects output to contract by about 2 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 1), with
a gradual recovery in the latter part of the year, supported mainly by the strong
countercyclical policy response, but constrained by the still feeble recovery of partner
country demand. Twelve-month inflation would slow through Q3:2009 due to weak activity
and base effects, but then will pick up again, pushed by rising international energy prices,

8
increases in regulated electricity prices, higher inflation expectations, and as base effects
from 2008 wear out. The current account deficit would narrow to about 6 percent of GDP
in 2009 with the moderation of dividend payments in line with corporate profits, but would
resume its widening to about 7–7½ percent of GDP over the medium term—provided
external financing remains available—as private demand recovers and the public investment
program unfolds.
9.
The restrained external financing environment resulting from the global
financial crisis has affected potential output growth. Staff has reduced its estimate of
potential growth to 4 percent (from 5 percent previously), as private investment is not
expected to continue growing at 2007–08 rates, given current projections for partner country
demand, commodity prices, and diminished capital flows to EMEs. Medium-term growth
remains underpinned by the large public infrastructure investment program to relieve
bottlenecks in electricity, rail, and ports that could constrain growth as the economy recovers
in 2010 and beyond.

10.

The risks to the outlook are mainly on the downside:



The downturn in South Africa’s major trading partners may prove deeper and more
protracted than currently anticipated, resulting in a concomitant decline in exports.



Another bout of global financial market turbulence could trigger capital outflows
and a sharp, potentially destabilizing exchange rate depreciation.



Deteriorating loan quality could prompt banks to further raise lending standards and
squeeze credit, worsening the recession.



On the upside, the impact of decisive macroeconomic policy actions may provide a
larger and quicker-than-expected demand impulse and resumption of growth,
particularly if global growth also turns out to be stronger than expected.

9
Box 1. Current Account Vulnerabilities
South Africa’s current account deficit is high relative to that of other EMEs and is financed by relatively volatile
capital inflows.1 Foreign direct investment has typically been smaller than in other emerging markets, averaging just
over 1 percent of GDP in the past ten years compared to around 3 percent of GDP for the median of EMEs. Instead,
South Africa has been more reliant on portfolio flows, which are volatile in comparison to other EMEs.

The global market turmoil of late 2008 also had a significant, if temporary, impact on South African financial
market variables. Spreads widened by 440 basis points in October 2008, more than in some other EMEs with smaller
current account deficits. Portfolio outflows accelerated while the rand depreciated by around 30 percent against the
U.S. dollar, and the stock market fell by 26 percent. Although spreads have fallen back substantially since then and the
exchange rate has appreciated strongly in recent months—more than reversing the earlier depreciation (Figure 3)—the
episode is a reminder of the pressures that South Africa can face, as a bellwether for emerging markets, and because of
the vulnerabilities arising from its current account deficit.

The weak domestic economy is expected to narrow the current account deficit in 2009 and concerns about
financing have receded with the recovery of capital inflows since February, but South Africa remains vulnerable
to a sudden stop. The current account deficit is expected to remain sizable over the medium term as the recovery in
investment would need to be financed externally given the country’s low saving rate.2 With rising inflows, factor
income payments will also tend to rise contributing to a wider deficit.
1
2

See Selected Issues paper, “South Africa and Other Emerging Markets: Response to the Global Financial Crisis.”

The factors underlying the low saving rate are discussed in the 2008 Article IV Consultation Report for South Africa, IMF
Country Report 08/348, 10/22/08.

10


In the medium term, the still large current account deficit—in part stemming from
the large public investment program—makes the recovery vulnerable to investor
sentiment (Box 1), even if in the long run the large investment projects could
strengthen the economy’s export-generating capabilities.

11.
There are, nevertheless, important mitigating factors. External debt is low
(26 percent of GDP at end-2008),
70
over 40 percent of which is

significant general salary increase.
The FY2009/10 budget provides for a further sizable discretionary fiscal impulse based on a
continued increase in infrastructure investment and an expansion of the social safety net
(Tables 2 and 3). The cyclically-adjusted public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is
expected to narrow over the next few years as the growth of public investment and consumption
spending slows. The authorities observed that prudent fiscal policies during the previous
economic expansion had resulted in a sharp decline in debt and debt service, which created the
fiscal space to invest in public infrastructure. They stressed that their investment plans, which
had been formulated before the current downturn, would relieve critical bottlenecks in
electricity and transportation, and have large long-run fiscal multipliers. With the economic
downturn, their budget plans would also support demand in the short run. They indicated that if
the downturn were to turn out steeper than anticipated in the budget—as now seems likely—
they would continue to allow the operation of the stabilizers while keeping spending broadly on
current plans.2

retaining the confidence of
domestic and external sources of finance needed to fund the still-high headline PSBR.3
Staff’s model simulations (Box 2) indicate that these fiscal policies would play an important
role in supporting output and employment in 2009 and 2010. Staff’s debt sustainability
analysis confirms that the envisaged nominal spending path is consistent with medium-term
fiscal sustainability, with public debt (general government and public enterprises) expected to
stabilize at about 51 percent of GDP by 2014.4 In addition, sensitivity of public debt to
standard shocks appears low (Appendix I). If the economy turns out weaker than staff’s
current projections, staff would support the continued full operation of the automatic
stabilizers in FY2009/10 and FY2010/11, within a sustainable medium-term fiscal path that
would require spending growth to be moderated further as the economy recovers. The burden
could be borne mainly by the wage bill—which has grown rapidly in the last two years—and
spending on goods and services, while protecting investment and well-targeted social safety
net programs. Current spending could also be prioritized more stringently by improving
service delivery in key areas through reform, rather than higher spending.
15.
Staff noted, however, that there are significant risks that the structural fiscal
deficit could be higher over the medium term than currently anticipated:


The public debt service burden is likely to be higher than budget projections, as the
assumed yields in the budget appear to be too low. Interest rates on medium- and
long-term government bonds have trended up since the beginning of this year despite
Approximately 70 percent of the PSBR is expected to be financed domestically.

E. Mendoza and J. Ostry, 2007, “International Evidence on Fiscal Solvency: Is Fiscal Policy “Responsible”?”
IMF WP 07/56, find that the ability of emerging market countries to maintain fiscal solvency appears to wane
when public debt reaches 50–60 percent of GDP. Given the lack of consistent cross-country data, the study uses
different definitions of debt for different countries. If the South African authorities’ preferred aggregate—net
government and government-guaranteed debt—is used, the medium–term debt would stabilize at about 43 percent of GDP, given current expenditures plans (in nominal terms) and no further net issuance of guarantees.

13
the sharp decline in short-term rates, signaling rising borrowing costs and a
potentially higher-than-projected debt service burden (Figure 5).
Box 2. Quantitative Effects of Macroeconomic Policies
Staff’s model simulations find that the authorities’ fiscal and monetary policies strike
broadly the right balance between supporting demand and maintaining macroeconomic
stability. The IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model is used for simulating the
dynamics of the economy under a package of already adopted or announced fiscal and
monetary policies aimed at countering the negative external demand and commodity price
shocks brought on by the global crisis.1 We find that these policies would raise output and
employment by about 2 percentage points, at the expense of higher inflation (by about
2 percentage points), higher trade deficit (by about 0.5 percentage point of GDP), and a mild
crowding out of private investment, relative to a counterfactual of no discretionary policies.
These results cannot be extrapolated, however, for a larger fiscal expansion than is currently
planned, as it would lead to rising real interest rates that would diminish and eventually
eliminate output and employment gains.



Slow improvement in public service delivery and rising public pressure could make it
difficult to moderate the planned spending growth over the medium term. Also, the
limited competition in many of South Africa’s product markets and rigidities in its
labor market could magnify the employment cost of the current recession, creating
pressure for more public employment and government consumption spending.5



Failure to implement accompanying sectoral structural reforms (see paragraph 29)
could limit the potential growth impact, and hence the fiscal revenue payoff, from
higher public infrastructure investment. Given publicly-owned infrastructure
monopolies, it may also force the government to share the cost of the additional
infrastructure investment needed to maintain medium-term growth prospects.

16.
Staff also cautioned that higher-than-anticipated medium-term fiscal deficits
would exacerbate external current account vulnerabilities. If the current account deficit
continues to widen over the medium term as public investment rises, structural government
saving would need to be gradually raised again to reassure investors that the public sector is
not adding to the large external imbalance.6 As noted above, moderating the government
wage bill and improving the efficiency of public service provision should yield significant
savings.
Box 3. Summary of Previous Consultation Discussions
There has been broad agreement on policies, as the Fund has generally supported the authorities’ stance on
fiscal policy, inflation targeting, exchange rate policy, and international reserve accumulation. At the 2008
Article IV consultation, Directors suggested that external current account vulnerabilities be addressed by raising
government saving over the medium term to balance the structural PSBR. The FY2009/10 budget envisages
somewhat higher spending, but the economic outlook has weakened significantly more than anticipated. In past
consultations, Directors have also encouraged structural reforms to raise medium-term growth and employment,
but progress has lagged. The 2008 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update found South Africa’s
financial system to be broadly sound and well regulated, but facing some risks. The authorities’ follow up on
these recommendations is outlined below.

17.
The authorities acknowledged that there are risks to budget plans, but
emphasized that they intend to run a disciplined and pragmatic fiscal policy. They
agreed that spending growth will need to be moderated over the medium term. This could be

15
done in part by improving public service delivery and the efficiency of government spending
(see paragraph 29). In addition, they noted that much of the infrastructure investment
program could be prolonged if deficits became too large or financing risks materialized.
Moreover, as noted in the FY2009/2010 budget, they have a debt limit for net government
and government guaranteed debt of 50 percent of GDP, which would provide an anchor for
fiscal policy, and they intend to take action on spending well before that limit is reached.
Staff supported these intentions, while suggesting that the authorities also monitor and
publish consolidated gross public sector debt data.
Monetary policy focused on low inflation
18.
Weakening economic activity and falling global commodity prices have
lowered inflation, but the pace of disinflation remains slow. Inflation, which has remained
outside the 3–6 percent target band since April 2007, peaked in August 2008 and slowed to
8 percent in May 2009. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation excluding food, petrol, and
energy has continued to trend upward.7 The slower-than-expected disinflation reflects a
confluence of factors, including the large exchange rate depreciation in Q4:2008, the strong
increase oil prices in the first six months of this year, and backward-looking wage indexation
that has resulted in substantial wage demands (annual wages grew by over 10 percent on
average in Q1:2009).
19.
The SARB eased monetary policy decisively starting in late 2008, but rising
inflation risks led it to leave the policy rate unchanged in June 2009. As economic
activity weakened and the inflation outlook improved, the monetary policy committee (MPC)
reduced interest rates by 450 basis points between December 2008 and May 2009. In a move
that surprised markets (which had expected a 50 basis point cut), the MPC left the policy rate
unchanged at its June meeting, citing upside risks to inflation and the already significant
monetary accommodation since end-2008. The Committee noted that the downside risks to
inflation from the wider output gap and weaker domestic demand were offset by the
deterioration in inflation expectations and rising inflation risks from increases in electricity
and other administered prices, and nominal wage increases in excess of inflation.8 Staff noted
that its model simulations also suggested that the policy rate may have bottomed if inflation
is to be brought within the 3–6 percent target band by end-2010 as the SARB intends, unless
the output slowdown and exchange rate appreciation exert stronger-than-expected downward
pressure on inflation.

7

Since January 2009, a reweighted and rebased CPI replaced the CPIX (the consumer price index excluding the
interest component of mortgage payments) as the main measure of inflation, targeted by the SARB.

8

In June 2009, the energy price regulator approved an electricity tariff increase of 31.3 percent.

20.
Given South Africa’s large current account deficit and reliance on equity
inflows, the effects of monetary policy on capital flows are of interest. Staff’s analytical
work suggests that expected policy rate changes have little effect on South Africa’s capital
flows while unexpected rate cuts are associated with rand depreciation and a small inflow of
equity, likely due to foreign investors rebalancing their portfolios.9 Staff estimates suggest,
on the other hand, that policy rate cuts have a significant positive effect on real economic
activity beginning with a two quarter lag.10 Taken together, the finding suggest that monetary
policy actions in South Africa can have a strong countercyclical impact and entail little risk
of destabilizing capital movements, at least over the business cycle.
21.
South Africa’s inflation targeting framework has been criticized by some groups
in recent months. Labor unions, for instance, have argued that the SARB’s mandate should
include growth and employment and that interest rate increases have had harsh effects on

17
workers. The authorities indicated that while public debate on the issue was constructive,
they did not have plans for any significant changes to the inflation targeting framework. The
Minister of Finance and the Governor of the SARB have publicly defended inflation
targeting as fully appropriate for South Africa. Financial market analysts also strongly
supported inflation targeting and believed that substantive changes to the framework were
unlikely. Staff agreed that inflation targeting had served South Africa well and observed that
the primacy of inflation in the SARB’s mandate is critical for the transparency of monetary
policy decisions and the SARB’s effectiveness in anchoring inflation expectations.
External policies to mitigate current account vulnerabilities
22.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a floating exchange regime.
The SARB did not intervene to support the rand during the global market turbulence, in
line with previous statements that it would allow the rand to depreciate in the event of
capital outflows. Neither did it intervene in the other direction when the rand strengthened
sharply in the first six months of 2009. Staff agreed that the flexibility of the rand is an
important buffer against external shocks. In particular, it has discouraged the South
African private sector from borrowing in foreign currency, despite significant capital
inflows, and facilitated foreign investors sharing in the adjustment burden in the event of
rand depreciation.

Box 4. The Real Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
The exchange rate assessments based on the IMF’s methodology adapted for South Africa’s specific circumstances suggest
that the rand is moderately overvalued as of early July 2009.1 The macroeconomic balance approach, which compares South
Africa’s medium-term current account stripped of temporary factors, to a norm derived from cross-country analysis of other EMEs
indicates an overvaluation of about 12 percent as of early July.2 The external sustainability approach, which compares a projection
of South Africa’s net foreign assets to an average of other EMEs suggests that the rand is about 16 percent above its equilibrium
rate.3 The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER) approach—a single equation method relating the REER to its
fundamental determinants—pointed to an overvaluation of 6–8 percent.

Although South Africa’s exports, excluding gold, have grown steadily, market share has remained broadly stable. Specific
factors have affected gold exports, including the increasing costs of deep mining as ore is depleted. Survey-based evidence
suggests there is scope to improve competitiveness in other exports. South Africa ranked 45th in the World Economic Forum
(WEF) Global Competitiveness Report in 2008 and improved its ranking to 48th in the 2009 IMD World Competitiveness
rankings. South Africa tends to rank relatively highly on macroeconomic policies and government institutions but scores weakly
on health and education and labor market indicators. The ranking for infrastructure is weighed down by the problems in the
electricity sector.

B. Financial Sector: Remaining Vigilant
25.
Money markets remained orderly and financial institutions stable when the
global financial crisis intensified last year. Interbank interest rate volatility remained
within normal bounds in late 2008 and early 2009, reflecting generally adequate market
liquidity. South African banks’ low leverage, high profitability, and limited exposure to
foreign assets and funding allowed them to remain liquid and well-capitalized, obviating any
need for extraordinary liquidity or state support, in contrast with the experience of some
other countries. Banks’ foreign currency funding represents less than 7 percent of their
liabilities and their exposure to foreign assets is low in part due to attractive domestic returns
and capital controls.

high and banks’ profits have declined somewhat (Box 5). Nevertheless, staff’s analysis of
macro financial linkages suggests that the market’s overall assessment of solvency risks to
South African banks, as well as feedback effects from the real sector, remain small, likely
reflecting their strong capital position and generally high profitability (Table 7).

20
Box 5. Banking Sector Risks
The sharply rising level of impaired loans is a key conjunctural risk faced by the South African banking
system. Since 2006, total and mortgage impaired advances have accelerated from low levels spurred by rising
interest rates (from 2006–2008) and, subsequently, a weakening economy and rising unemployment (in 2009).
Total impaired advances rose to 5.1 percent in April 2009, more than doubling since January 2008. The rising
unemployment rate, deterioration in household’s disposable income, and other relevant indicators tracked by
the SARB suggest that impaired advances could continue to rise over the next few months.

Credit risks to the banking system are mitigated by supportive macroeconomic policies coupled with
features of the South African financial system. Significant monetary policy easing has lowered lending rates
while more stringent bank loan origination standards and a decline in the demand for credit have moderated
credit growth (Figure 5). In addition, South African banks hold most of the mortgages they originate, which
encourages them to engage in workouts with distressed homeowners. Also, under South African law, banks can
claim other assets of defaulting borrowers, lowering incentives to default, including on foreclosed properties
with negative equity.
The South African banking system also faces long-standing structural risks, including the reliance of its
funding base on short-term wholesale corporate deposits. Retail deposits represent only about 25 percent of
total deposits, while deposits with less than one year maturity represent close to 80 percent of total deposits.
The FSAP Update recommended implementing a deposit insurance system to counter such risks. Such a
system could also have the added benefit of inducing household saving to migrate from unguaranteed liquid
financial instruments to competing bank deposits, thus strengthening the retail base of banks.
The dominance of the financial system by a few large financial conglomerates with cross-border share
holdings and cross-sector activities poses another structural risk. These conglomerates combine banking,
securities trading, and insurance in a single organization. As the recent global crisis has illustrated, even when
banks are well managed—as in the South African case—there is a risk that the sectoral supervisory
arrangements could miss potentially systemic linkages. Therefore, in line with FSAP Update
recommendations, it would be important to seek to identify potential information and regulatory gaps relating
to conglomerate activity.

21

Staff estimates suggest that, on balance, markets have a positive outlook for South African banks’
credit risk. A staff paper estimates probabilities of default for the four largest banks and macro-financial
linkages for the 2000-2009 period, based on equity price data. 1 The paper finds that although South African
banks’ probabilities of default increased recently, they are significantly lower than those of several large
international banks based in mature economies. Furthermore, feedback from the real economy to solvency
risk in the banking sector is limited, but shocks from the banking sector have significant effects on the
exchange rate and GDP growth.

27.
The authorities indicated—and the banks confirmed—that they have stepped up
bank supervision since late 2008, in response to rising financial sector risks. They have
intensified on site supervision, including assessing the stress testing, risk models and risk
management practices of banks, while also conducting, twice a year, off-site stress testing
using supervisory data, in line with the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update. They
indicated that the end-2008 exercise showed that, even under a severely unfavorable
macroeconomic scenario, none of the systemically-important banks would see their capital

22
ratios fall below the regulatory minimum. Overall, the authorities were of the view that
banks were provisioning adequately against rising impaired loans and that banks’ capital—
which comprised mostly Tier 1 capital—remained at comfortable levels to meet the
increasing risks.
28.
Despite its resilience, South Africa’s financial system has a number of longstanding structural risks that were also reviewed during the 2008 FSAP Update: the
dominance of financial conglomerates, the reliance of banks on short-term wholesale
deposits, and the governance framework for pension funds. In this regard:


The authorities noted that in line with FSAP Update recommendations, and as a
complement to the existing high-level SARB- FSB committee,11 they have
established a working-level joint SARB-FSB committee to help guide the work of
supervisory colleges covering individual financial conglomerates. Staff suggested
regular reporting of the work of these committees to senior policy makers in order to
assess whether further action, including possible changes to legislation, would be
needed to minimize regulatory gaps and strengthen consolidated supervision. It also
suggested formal analysis of systemic linkages based on a matrix of exposures within
and across financial conglomerates.12



It would be useful for the SARB and the FSB jointly to explore ways to reduce the
risks associated with banks’ reliance on short-term wholesale deposits. Staff also
suggested analyzing the extent to which deposit insurance could provide incentives
for increasing the scale of retail bank deposits.



Staff urged the speedy completion of the work of the interministerial task force on
pension system reform, so that the FSAP Update recommendations on strengthening
governance and risk management in this sector could be implemented without delay.
The authorities noted that pension reform was likely to be lengthy process and that
they were looking into measures that could be taken in the meantime to strengthen
the governance and supervision of this sector.
C. Structural Policies to Consolidate Gains and Accelerate Growth

29.
The recession and resulting pressures on macroeconomic policies and the policy
framework underscore the urgency of pressing ahead with structural reform and
improving public services in order to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth.
11

The SARB supervises commercial banks, while the Financial Services Board (FSB) supervises insurance and
pensions funds and oversees capital markets.
12

Staff presented methodologies developed for the April 2009 Global Financial Stability Report and offered to
provide the network analysis model to the authorities in order to analyze possible spillover effects of financial
conglomerate risks.

23
Rising job losses and unemployment and falling real disposable incomes, amidst significant
income disparities, has renewed pressures for higher government consumption spending and
sector-specific support. In this context:


The authorities underscored the commitment of the new government to improving
public service delivery—a centerpiece of its election platform. They recognized that
in education, for instance, South Africa already spends comparatively generously, but
student achievement has lagged behind international standards and labor skill levels
remain a binding constraint on growth. They noted that the cabinet had been
restructured to strengthen the planning and oversight capabilities of the Presidency,
lending greater coherence to cross-cutting policy design and implementation. The
government was also reviewing ways to improve the quality of public services,
including improving capacity at the provincial and local government levels, where
key decisions were made.



On trade policy, the authorities noted that they would be reassessing scope to take
action, consistent with WTO rules, in specific sectors that have been prioritized in
the context of the government’s industrial policy (e.g., possibly by increasing tariffs
up to bound levels). To the extent that some of this reassessment may be driven by
protectionist pressures, staff urged the authorities to ensure that the benefits brought
to South Africa by international trade—including increased competition in domestic
markets—are preserved and pursued further.13 Moreover, protectionist actions could
result in retaliation by other countries, potentially amplifying the costs of the global
recession. As in past years, staff suggested proactively increasing the transparency
and efficiency of the trade regime by simplifying the tariff structure, without
increasing overall protection, for instance by limiting tariffs to four or five bands.



Calls have increased for providing exceptional support to companies and industries
in difficulty, including through public financial institutions such as the Industrial
Development Corporation and the Development Bank of South Africa. Staff
cautioned against special support that would create fiscal or quasi-fiscal costs and
undermine the balance sheets of these institutions as well as the efficiency of
domestic markets. Any support should clearly identify the specific market distortion
that would justify government intervention, be explicitly temporary, and include strict
conditions for burden sharing with beneficiaries.



Staff noted that productivity growth from increased public investment spending
would depend, among other things, on sector-specific regulatory reform and

13

Barriers to entry in key sectors have been identified as an important constraint to growth by the previous
government’s medium-term growth strategy, Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa
(ASGISA), and last year’s OECD report. OECD, Economic Assessment of South Africa, July 2008.

24
strategies, including with regard to the role of the private sector. Creating the
conditions for private sector participation in infrastructure investment and service
provision could help relieve fiscal pressures and improve efficiency, particularly in
electricity generation, port services, and rail transport. To make best use of publicprivate partnerships, the government would need to ensure that projects are rigorously
evaluated and risks are properly shared between the public and private sectors.
30.
The authorities underscored their commitment to regional integration, but noted
recent challenges. In particular, they voiced concern over the potential inconsistencies
between Botswana’s, Lesotho’s and Swaziland’s recent signing of interim economic
partnership agreements (EPAs) with the EU and the rules of the Southern Africa Customs
Union (SACU), which also includes Namibia. They noted that the interim EPAs contain
different rules of origin and tariffs structures and are difficult to harmonize with South
Africa’s trade regime. The authorities intend to continue negotiating with the other SACU
members and the EU to resolve these inconsistencies. They noted that the gradual expansion
of SACU was a central pillar of regional integration within the broader South African
Development Community.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Until recently, South Africa enjoyed a robust economic expansion that created
strong income and employment growth. While a favorable external environment buoyed
the economy, sound macroeconomic policies, underpinned by a consistent and transparent
policy framework, contributed importantly to the expansion—an impressive achievement
considering the challenges faced following the end of apartheid only 15 years ago. Prudent
fiscal policy created fiscal space for a steady increase in public spending to address social
needs. The inflation targeting framework—with low inflation as the primary objective—
made monetary policy more focused, predictable, and credible. And effective banking
supervision allowed a modern banking sector to flourish while keeping risks in check.
32.
The economic outlook has changed sharply as a result of the global financial
crisis in late 2008, even though the direct effects of the shock on the domestic financial
system were modest. The economy, now in a recession, is expected to begin recovering later
this year, but the pace of growth next year is projected to be below potential. Inflation risks,
however, have increased. Over the medium term, the current account deficit is projected to
widen again to levels that keep the economy vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment.
There are downside risks to the outlook: a deeper or more protracted global downturn than
currently anticipated, another bout of global financial market turbulence, or deteriorating
domestic credit quality could lower growth. But on the upside, there could be a strongerthan-anticipated economic response to supportive macroeconomic policies. The impact of
any shocks, however, would be mitigated by the low external debt, the limited foreign
currency exposure on balance sheets, and the floating exchange rate regime.

25
33.
Fiscal policy is appropriately countercyclical and will support output and
employment in 2009 and 2010. The three-year spending envelope in the FY2009/10 budget,
which envisages a moderation of future spending growth, strikes the right balance between
supporting output and preserving medium-term sustainability. Given the well-known
weaknesses in South Africa’s infrastructure, the size and composition of the package is also
likely to relieve binding constraints on the country’s potential growth rate. The significant
discretionary easing planned for this year is appropriate. If the economy turns out weaker
than currently projected, the automatic stabilizers should continue to be allowed to operate,
but spending growth would need to be moderated further when the economy recovers in
order to stabilize public debt at a prudent level over the medium term. Investment and welltargeted social safety net programs would need to be protected at the expense of wages and
other current spending.
34.
Nevertheless, it may be difficult to rein in medium-term spending growth as
envisaged in budget plans. The debt service burden may turn out higher than projected,
particularly if bond yields are higher, or revenue weaker than expected. Slow improvement in
public service delivery, and structural rigidities in product and labor markets that inhibit
employment creation, could increase pressure for more government consumption spending.
In addition, the growth and revenue payoff from infrastructure projects may be limited by
delays in sectoral reforms.
35.
The SARB’s decisive easing of monetary policy since December 2008 has been
appropriate, and a pause is justified as inflation risks have intensified. Based on the
current assessment of inflation risks, the scope for monetary easing may have reached its
limit if inflation is to be brought below 6 percent by end-2010, as the SARB intends—unless
downward inflation pressures prove to be stronger than expected because of a sharper
recession or stronger rand appreciation than currently projected.
36.
South Africa’s floating exchange regime is an important mitigant of external
shocks and risks. The floating currency inhibits the accumulation of foreign currency
liabilities by South African residents and, in the event of large outflows, helps ensure that
foreign investors share some of the adjustment burden. On the basis of current projections,
the exchange rate appears moderately overvalued after its appreciation in recent months,
although this estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. Efforts to actively manage the
exchange rate are likely to be ineffective and costly, given the large scale and volatility of
capital inflows.
37.
The gradual build up of net international reserves from low levels in the
late 1990s has strengthened private sector confidence. Given that reserves are still below
traditional benchmarks of reserve adequacy, there is room for further accumulation. The
SARB’s policy of gradually building reserves through market purchases without seeking to
influence the exchange rate thus remains appropriate.

26
38.
The financial sector has weathered the immediate impact of the global crisis
well, but risks have been rising as the economy weakens. The authorities’ assessment that
the banking sector remains well-capitalized and adequately provisioned is reassuring. They
would need to continue engaging with banks to ensure that provisions and capital buffers
remain adequate to meet increasing risks. However, even when banks are well managed there
is a risk that the sectoral supervisory arrangements could miss potentially systemic linkages
within large financial conglomerates, including across borders. The authorities’ welcome
efforts to further strengthen consolidated supervision—as recommended in the 2008 FSAP
Update—could be enhanced through formal analysis of systemic linkages and regular
reporting to senior policy makers, so that any further necessary actions to minimize
supervisory gaps could be taken. It would also be useful to explore ways to reduce banks’
reliance on short-term wholesale funding, including to analyze the potential effects of
introducing deposit insurance on improving the stability of banks’ funding bases. Measures
to strengthen the governance and supervision of the pension sector should also be expedited.
39.
A strong push on structural reform is critical to accelerate growth and
employment creation. The government’s emphasis on improving the quality and efficiency
of public services is welcome and would need to be pursued decisively. In this context, it
would be useful to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of government spending. Pressures
to provide trade protection should be resisted and the transparency and efficiency of the trade
regime enhanced by simplifying the tariff structure. It would be important to clearly identify
the specific market distortions that would justify any sector-specific support—with any
support made explicitly temporary and subject to conditions to protect taxpayers. To enhance
the productivity of public infrastructure investment, sectoral reforms could be implemented,
including to encourage private participation in the provision of electricity, rail and port
services, with appropriate risk sharing between public and private sectors.
40.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. SOUTH AFRICA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
South Africa’s external debt is projected to rise to 37.6 percent of GDP by 2014. The
current account deficit widens again to 7–7.5 percent of GDP from 2011–14 reflecting a
larger trade deficit as growth recovers, the import-intensive infrastructure investment
program progresses, and dividend payments abroad pick up. Given South Africa’s deep
domestic financial markets, a significant part of the deficit is expected to be financed—as in
the past—by nonresident portfolio flows, around 60 percent of which are equities and
nondebt creating. Although portfolio flows were disrupted in 2008 Q4, they have recovered
strongly since then, with net inflows amounting to almost $6 billion in 2009 H1. Part of the
public sector borrowing requirement is also expected to be financed by nonresidents through
Eurobond issuance ($1.5 billion was raised in May 2009), purchases of domestic securities,
and multilateral loans for infrastructure. The financing of the current account deficit by this
mix of non-debt-creating and debt creating capital flows results in an 11 percentage point
increase in the external debt ratio to 37.6 percent in 2014.
The rising external debt ratio makes it somewhat more vulnerable to external shocks
and rollover risk, although it looks manageable against a range of other shocks
(Figure 6). The stress tests indicate that the largest adverse impact is from a further widening
of the non-interest current account deficit by 1.7 percentage points on average over the next
five years (under the assumption that this is debt-financed); this raises the external debt-GDP
ratio to around 45 percent in 2014. By contrast, a large (one standard deviation) permanent
adverse shock to real GDP growth has only a minor effect. The standard shocks to real
interest rates, the exchange rate, and the combined shock have either only minor or moderate
effects. Resilience to the exchange rate shock reflects the significant proportion of
rand-denominated debt (41.5 percent of external debt at end-2008). Rollover risk looks
relatively comfortable in 2009, with reserves at 81 percent of the current account deficit plus
short-term debt at remaining maturity, but the position becomes tighter in the medium term.
South Africa’s public debt position appears sustainable. Under the policies outlined in
the 2009/10 budget and the medium-term expenditure framework, the ratio of government
debt to GDP is expected to rise over the short term, from 27.3 percent in 2008 to a maximum
of 33.8 percent in 2013—of which, 4.4 percent of GDP is expected to be denominated in
foreign currency—before declining gradually thereafter (Table 12). Gross financing needs
should also stabilize at around 6–7 percent of GDP in the medium term, albeit at a level
higher than the average of the past five years (Figure 7). Total public debt is also projected to
rise in the short term, as public enterprise borrowing increases to help finance the accelerated
investment expansion, but total public debt is projected to stabilize at around 51 percent of
GDP by 2014 (Table 12).
The ratio of government debt-to-GDP ratio appears broadly robust to a variety of
shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower primary balance, a 30 percent real

42
depreciation of the exchange rate, and a 10 percent increase in the debt stock (Figure 2).
Under most of these scenarios, the government debt ratio rises above the baseline over the
projection period, and in the case of the “no policy change” scenario, the debt ratio falls well
below the baseline owing to the surpluses in the last four years. However, the government
debt ratio does rise sharply in the case of a hypothetical 10 percent contingent liability shock,
but remains manageable over the projection horizon.

2/ The authorities' monitored debt concept--net government and government-guaranteed debt--is equivalent to government debt plus government contingent liabilities minus government cash reserves.
It is projected at about 43 percent of GDP at end-2014 on the assumption that contingent liabilities, which include the large guarantee to Eskom, are kept at their 2008 level.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The South African rand floats against other currencies. South Africa maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. Nonresidents are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets without
restriction and to repatriate dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as
well as the original investment capital. Foreign companies, governments and institutions may
list on South Africa’s bond and securities exchanges.
Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transactions by residents have also been relaxed.
Rather than completely liberalizing particular types of capital transactions, the authorities
have pursued a strategy of allowing an increasing array of transactions, with each subject to a
quantitative cap that has been progressively raised over time. Regarding outward foreign
direct investment by South African corporates, application to the South African Reserve

3
Bank’s Exchange Control Department is still required for transactions above R 50 million a
year, for monitoring purposes and approval in terms of existing foreign direct investment
criteria, including demonstrated benefit to South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) reserves the right to stagger capital outflows relating to large foreign direct
investments so as to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market.
In 2008, the authorities initiated a process of replacing direct exchange controls on local
institutional investors with foreign exposure prudential regulations and relaxing their foreign
exposure limits.
Under the new system, the SARB will monitor these investors’ foreign exposure through
quarterly reports, abolishing the existing pre-transaction authorization requests; however,
substantial changes in foreign exposure will still require pre-notification. Institutional
investors are permitted to invest in foreign securities, subject to an overall prudential limit of
20 percent of their total retail assets for retirement funds and the non-linked policies of longterm insurers. Investment managers registered as institutional investors for exchange control
purposes, linked policies of long-term insurers and collective investment schemes
management companies are restricted to 30 percent of total retail assets under management.
There is an additional allowance of 5 percent of assets for portfolio investment in Africa for
all institutional investors. Banks’ macroprudential foreign exposure limit (which remains to
be precisely defined) has been changed to 40 percent of liabilities from 40 percent of capital.
Corporates are not allowed to undertake foreign portfolio investment at present using locally
sourced capital. Corporates may, upon application, establish Dual Listed Company Structures
provided certain conditions are met. Their currency proceeds from exports must be
repatriated within 180 days from accrual. All local entities are now allowed to participate in
the rand futures market, enabling them to hedge and diversify their portfolios.
Private individuals are allowed to invest up to R 2 million offshore. In addition to the above,
they can take out a further R 500,000 a year as a documented discretionary allowance (gifts,
donations, travel, etc.). There are restrictions on the transfer of funds abroad by emigrants
(blocked funds). The transfer of blocked funds in excess of R 2 million for individuals and R
4 million for families is allowed, provided a 10 percent exit levy is paid. Large amounts may
be staggered to manage any impact on the foreign exchange market. Dividends and interest
payments on the blocked funds are freely transferable abroad.

Technical Assistance

An FAD mission took place in 2003 to discuss with the National Treasury their draft royalty
bill. A monetary and financial statistics mission took place in 2003, followed up by a visit
during May–June, 2004.

4
A STA mission, supported by a labor statistics consultant funded by the World Bank,
undertook a review of South Africa Labor Force Statistics in March 2005. The mission
recommended steps to produce statistics that are more reliable, better quality, and more
closely aligned with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards.
A number of LEG missions in 2007-08 assisted the authorities in the ongoing process of
rewriting the Income Tax Act and drafting a new Tax Administration Act.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes. South Africa subscribed to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2, 1996 and is in observance of
specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, although using a flexibility
option on the timeliness and periodicity of unemployment data. A Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes—Data Module, Response by the Authorities, and Detailed Assessments
Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) was published on October 16, 2001.
Real sector
The national accounts are compiled according to the SNA 1993. In November 2004, the base
year of the national accounts was changed from 1995 to 2000. At the same time,
benchmarking was undertaken to reflect more accurately the structure of the economy and to
introduce other methodological changes to the compilation of data. These changes resulted in
an upward revision of the average annual growth rate of real GDP for the period 1998 to
2003 from 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent. Reporting of real sector data for International
Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely.
Labor market statistics are published with lags of three months. Given the seriousness of the
unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design would benefit from better,
more frequent and timely labor market data. A new quarterly Labor Force Survey has been
conducted January 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas,
which represent approximately 56 percent of the total number of households and 75 percent
of private consumption expenditures. The CPI weights are re-based in January 2009
according to the new weights published in July 2008. New price indices, which are re-based
to 2008=100, are calculated according to these weights published in July 2008. These indices
form the basis for calculating the year-on-year changes in the CPI for 2009 and the monthon-month change between December 2008 and January 2009 At the same time, Statistics
South Africa changed the way of measuring housing costs. The concept of owners’
equivalent rent are used to more accurately reflect the cost of the accommodation services
derived by owner occupiers from their own homes.
Government finance
Data are compiled and disseminated according to the GFSM 2001 framework. Data for social
security funds and central government’s extra budgetary funds have been reported on an
accrual basis, starting in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities have
included additional noncash data, consistent with their migration to accrual accounting.
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general government for publication
in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the
cash operations of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS.

7
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by SARB are consistent with the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. South Africa regularly reports good quality
monetary statistics for publication in the IFS and the IFS Supplement, although there is room
for improving the timeliness of the data on non-depository financial institutions.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). The authorities are also working with their partners in the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) to improve the coverage of intra-SACU trade
flows. Data reported for Direction of Trade Statistics differ substantially from external trade
data reported for IFS, particularly exports, due to balance of payments adjustments.
The banking sector holdings of foreign-currency assets have been removed from the official
measure of reserves, in accordance with international practice. Data on international reserves
position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the IMF’s template on international
reserves and foreign currency liquidity.
Net errors and omissions in the balance of payments are large, averaging 2 percent of GDP
during 2003–07. Work is ongoing to improve the reliability and accuracy of balance of
payments data.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 5, 2009

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments since the issuance of the staff
report (SM/09/196, 7/20/09). These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
In June 2009, annual CPI inflation declined to 6.9 percent from 8 percent in May. As
anticipated in the staff report, the decline largely reflects base effects resulting from the peak
in food and fuel prices in the middle of last year as well as weak activity. Inflation excluding
food and energy declined to 7.5 percent from 8.3 percent in May.
3.
The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 23.6 percent in the second quarter of
2009. However, the rate reflected a sharp decline in labor force participation as job losses
reached 267,000 in the second quarter, bringing net job losses to about 475,000 in the first
half of the year.
4.
Notwithstanding the weakening labor market, there has been a marked increase in
strikes and other labor action. Municipal workers agreed to a 13 percent pay increase after a
strike in July. Following threats of labor action, mining sector workers settled for wage
increases of between 9 and 10.5 percent. Other sectors that have been affected by labor
action in July include communications and construction. Thus far, wage settlements have
averaged above 9 percent in July.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 10, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On August 5, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa.1
Background
South Africa enjoyed a buoyant economy in the mid-2000s. A favorable external
environment and strong domestic demand, accommodated by rapid credit expansion,
raised growth to 5 percent on average in 2004–07 and lowered the unemployment rate
by 5 percentage points. Rising employment, growing personal income, and wealth
effects from rising asset prices buoyed household consumption, while strong business
confidence and high commodity prices supported private investment. The current
account deficit widened sharply and was financed mainly by robust portfolio inflows.
However, the domestic demand-led expansion, together with surging international food
and fuel prices, also created inflation pressures and led the SARB to embark on a
tightening cycle in mid-2006. The slowdown in the global economy, power shortages,
and rising interest rates dampened growth starting in mid-2008.
The global financial crisis of late 2008 sharply changed the outlook for an already
slowing economy. Large capital outflows triggered by investor withdrawal from emerging
market assets lowered stock prices and depreciated the rand. A sharp decline in
external demand and a slump in the prices of some major commodity exports weakened
the economy. These shocks pushed the economy into a recession: output fell by
1.8 percent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4:2008 and by 6.4 percent in Q1:2009.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
Financial markets have begun to stabilize since early 2009. Portfolio inflows have
returned, the rand has retraced its losses, the main stock market index has recovered,
and—after widening significantly—credit default swap and EMBI spreads have declined
to pre-September 2008 levels.
Weakening economic activity and falling global commodity prices have lowered inflation,
but the pace of disinflation remains slow. Inflation, which has remained outside the 3–
6 percent target band since April 2007, peaked in August 2008 and slowed to 8 percent
in May 2009. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation excluding food, petrol, and energy
has continued to trend upward. Large exchange rate depreciation in Q4:2008, the sharp
increase in oil prices in the first six months of 2009, substantial wage demands, and
high inflation expectations played an important role in slowing the decline in inflation.
Fiscal policy has been strongly countercyclical. The authorities implemented a large and
front loaded easing in FY 2008/09 delivered through both the government budget and
the public enterprise investment program. The FY2009/10 budget provides for a further
sizable discretionary fiscal impulse based on a continued increase in infrastructure
investment and an expansion of the social safety net, which would support demand in
the short run and could raise the economy’s potential growth rate in the long run.
The SARB eased monetary policy decisively starting in late 2008. As economic activity
weakened and the inflation outlook improved, the monetary policy committee (MPC)
reduced interest rates by 450 basis points between December 2008 and May 2009.
However, rising inflation risks led it to keep the policy rate unchanged at its June 2009
meeting.
Money markets remained orderly and financial institutions stable during the global
financial crisis in late 2008. However, household debt remains near historic highs and
borrowers have been hit by the unfolding recession and rising interest rates
during 2006-2008. As a result, impaired loans have risen to a multi-year high relative to
total loans. Although banks’ profits have declined somewhat, their capital remains well
above the regulatory minimum.
South Africa maintains a floating exchange regime. The authorities have been gradually
building up international reserves as market conditions permit, without seeking to
influence the exchange rate. Gross official reserves stood at US$ 35.8 billion at endJune 2009 or some 134 percent of short-term external debt.
The short-term outlook is for output to begin a gradual recovery in the latter part of 2009,
with the pace of growth next year remaining below the economy’s potential. Inflation
would continue to slow due to weak activity, but is expected to start rising again toward
the end of 2009, pushed by rising international energy prices and increases in regulated
electricity prices, among other factors. After narrowing temporarily, the external current
account deficit is expected to resume widening over the medium term as private
demand recovers and the public investment program unfolds.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive directors noted that the economy has weathered the immediate effects of the
global crisis well mainly due to sound macroeconomic policies underpinned by
consistent and transparent policy frameworks, the floating exchange rate regime, and a
well supervised financial system. Nonetheless, the global crisis has pushed the
economy into a recession in 2009, and below potential growth is projected for 2010.
Downside risks to this outlook prevail, and the economy remains vulnerable to changes
in investor sentiment, particularly in light of the projected current account deficits.
Directors observed that South Africa continues to face challenges in addressing high
levels of unemployment and income inequality. They saw the immediate challenge as
supporting domestic demand with well-calibrated counter cyclical macroeconomic
policies, while preserving price and external stability.
Directors noted that fiscal policy is appropriately countercyclical in 2009 and 2010,
striking the proper balance between supporting output and preserving medium-term
sustainability. They supported higher spending on public investment, given its large
multiplier and the need to boost South Africa’s potential growth rate. Directors observed
that if the economy turns out weaker than currently projected, automatic stabilizers
should continue to be allowed to operate, although to ensure fiscal sustainability,
spending growth would need to be moderated further when the economy recovers.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep public debt at prudent levels. They
cautioned against a large public sector wage bill that would raise spending beyond
budgeted levels and limit scope for future spending moderation. They also noted that
public debt service may turn out higher than expected. Directors stressed that
improvements in public service delivery and progress in structural reforms are needed to
ease pressures on government spending.
Directors considered that the inflation-targeting framework has served South Africa well.
They welcomed the decisive easing of monetary policy since December 2008, agreeing
that a pause is justified and the scope for further easing may be limited—unless
downward inflation pressures prove to be more pronounced than expected.
Directors supported South Africa’s floating exchange-rate regime, which is an important
buffer against external shocks. They noted staff’s assessment that the exchange rate
may be moderately overvalued and the uncertainty surrounding this assessment.
Directors recommended that steps be taken to improve competitiveness, particularly
through reforms of labor and product markets. They supported the authorities’ policy of
gradually building up international reserves without seeking to target an exchange rate
level.
Directors found reassuring the authorities’ assessment that the banking sector remains
well capitalized and adequately provisioned. Nonetheless, to meet increasing risks, they
recommended that the authorities continue engaging with banks to ensure that
provisions and capital buffers remain adequate. Directors welcomed efforts to follow up
on the 2008 FSAP Update recommendations, and encouraged further strengthening
consolidated supervision and exploring ways to reduce banks’ reliance on short-term
wholesale funding. They also recommended measures to strengthen the governance

4
and supervision of the pension sector.
Directors encouraged strong action on structural reform to accelerate growth and
employment creation and reduce poverty. They noted that public investment aimed at
eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks could be complemented by more private sector
involvement in infrastructure investment and service delivery, with appropriate risk
sharing. Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen product market
competition, including by resisting trade protectionism and limiting sector-specific
support to identified market distortions.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for South Africa
August 5, 2009
Introduction
1.
My authorities would like to thank staff for the well-written staff report
complemented by clearly thought out Selected Issues Paper that add considerable depth to
the discussion on fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies. They welcome and appreciate
the rigorous interrogation of their policies by Fund staff, even when they do not always agree
with them. Since the Board discussion of the last staff report on South Africa’s Article IV
consultation, the country held very successful general elections. In fact, South Africa had a
very successful transition of three different Presidents in a period of less than 9 months,
testimony to the strength of institutions of democratic governance that have been established
following the dismantling of apartheid.
2.

My authorities agree with the broad thrust of the staff report.

Recent economic developments
3.
South Africa experienced robust economic growth between 2004 and 2007, but the
economy has decelerated since mid-2008 and entered its first recession since 1992 in Q4 of
2008. This ended more than a decade of growth that constituted the longest expansion on
record. The global contraction has adversely affected the mining, manufacturing and trade
sectors through lower commodity prices, falling exports and slowing domestic demand. In
Q1 2009, the financial sector recorded its first contraction since Q1 1994, when growth was
stagnant. Construction, buoyed by the large public infrastructure investment program, is the
only sector that has consistently recorded growth. The recession has made a huge dent on the
employment numbers, with the unemployment rate rising sharply.
4.
Private investment growth, which had decelerated quite significantly in 2008, had
continued to decline in Q1 2009, led largely by contractions in the finance and residential
buildings/construction sectors. However, public sector investment is emerging as the
mainstay of economic growth, with investments in power-generating projects, ports, roads
and rails. Business confidence extended its decline to a ten-year low in Q1 2009 but,
according to the Bureau of Economic Research (BER), business sentiments appear to be
changing for the better.
5.
Real household consumption has been decelerating since the interest rate hike began
in 2006, and started contracting in Q3 for the first time since Q4 1998. Household spending
has also weakened due to declining disposable income, increases in food and fuel prices in
2008, negative wealth effects from declining equity and house prices, high household debt
levels, and reduced credit extension due to tougher credit conditions (the National Credit Act

2
and global credit crunch). However, consumer confidence, which had plummeted in 2008
began to improve in first quarter of 2009.
6.
The current account deficit widened to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2008 from 4.0 percent
in 2005. Although it narrowed to 5.8 percent largely because of a decline in imports and
reduced dividend outflows in Q4 2008, the current account deficit widened again to 7.0
percent in Q1/2009 and is expected to remain high over the medium term. The main reason is
that the infrastructure investment program continues to stimulate demand for capital imports
and the global recession continues to dampen demand for South African exports. However,
the trade balance in May and June of this year has been better than expected, with the
average monthly deficit for the first half year being less than half the monthly average of the
past three years.
7.
During the past five years, South Africa has relied heavily on portfolio inflows into
equity and bond markets to finance the current account deficit. While the global market
turmoil has led to outflows from equities, capital inflows were still adequate to finance the
current account deficit in 2008 and Q1/2009. It is perhaps worth noting that the composition
of capital inflows changed substantially in 2008, with FDI and other capital inflows rising
relative to portfolio flows. Portfolio flows appear to have normalised in 2009 with significant
foreign investments into both equities and bond markets. My authorities remain concerned
about the current account deficit, but accept the argument made in the Selected Issues Paper
(page 72) that there are some important mitigating factors, particularly “the high proportion
of rand-denominated capital flows and the floating exchange rate.”
8.
The slowdown in economic activity would result in a decline in total tax revenue. In
order to sustain current expenditure, as well as to carry forward a more expansionary stance
to the economic contraction, the authorities responded with a strong counter-cyclical policy.
This entails a large fiscal stimulus complimented by appropriate monetary policy in line with
the reduced inflationary pressures.
Fiscal policy response
9.
Prudent fiscal management over several years, a key feature of which was reduced
deficits that lowered debt service costs from over 20 percent of total national government
expenditure in 1998/99 to just 7.5 percent in 2009/10, created space for a strong countercyclical policy. A strong fiscal stimulus package was announced with the 2009 budget that
broadly aims at guarding against a reversal of the hard won improvements in living standards
achieved during the past decade; cushioning the impact of slower growth and job losses on
the poor; and sustaining the public infrastructure investment program, particularly those
related to easing electricity supply constraints and transport bottlenecks. The authorities
projected a budget deficit of 3.8 percent but with early signs indicating that revenue
collection would come out weaker than originally projected, this target may be exceeded.

3
10.
The key element of the government’s stimulus package is to sustain the strong public
sector investment growth through improvements in South Africa’s power supply and public
transport capacity. Large public investment over the medium term will help to maintain
economic growth in various sectors. Furthermore, it will strengthen the long-term growth
potential of the economy and lower the cost of economic activity, compensate partially for
lower levels of private investment, and act as part of the broader countercyclical fiscal
stimulus.
11.
A number of fiscal measures to support poverty relief were also announced in the
2009 budget. These include:


Employment support through the expanded public works program that is focused on
creating long-term public-sector jobs in home-based and community care, as well as
project-based employment in infrastructure and environmental protection;



Unemployment support that is able to meet a projected increase in claims;



Human capital and skills development as core objectives of government spending
and, thus, new funding will be allocated to further education and training; and



Income support through social grants is being expanded to a projected 13.6 million
South Africans in 2009, thus providing an important safety net for low-income
households.

Accommodating monetary policy
12.
Inflationary pressures first came to the fore in 2006 and continued to rise until August
2008, largely as a response to buoyant domestic growth and the global increases in food and
fuel prices. This had prompted the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to raise the policy
interest rate by a cumulative 500 basis points in the two years since June 2006.
13.
However, lower household spending and slower credit extension, alongside lower
food and fuel prices, have contributed to a decline in inflationary pressures. In fact, slower
credit growth dampened broad money expansion at end December 2008 to 14.5 percent from
over 20 percent a year earlier. In April 2009, money expansion had slowed to 8.5 percent.
These factors created monetary policy space for the SARB to support the domestic economy
through interest rate cuts. The improvement in the medium-term inflation outlook, on the
back of widening domestic and global output gaps and the negative outlook for the domestic
manufacturing sector, prompted the SARB to reduce the policy rate by a cumulative 450
basis points since December 2008 to 7.5 percent.
14.
The central bank has increased the frequency of the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) meetings from the bi-monthly to monthly meetings. This will enable the SARB to

4
respond more flexibly and effectively to the rapid unfolding of the ongoing global financial
and economic crises and its impact on the domestic economy.
15.
Producer price inflation (PPI) which had peaked at 19.1 percent in 2008 has also
declined quite considerably and at end-May 2009 stood at -3.0 percent. The declining trend
continued in June, when PPI came out lower at -4.1 percent. The newly targeted headline CPI
moderated to 8.0 percent in May 2009, declined further in June to 6.9 percent, and is
projected to be within the 3 – 6 percent target band for 2010.
Exchange rate
16.
The domestic currency depreciated in 2007 and 2008, in response to US dollar
movements, expectations of slower growth, increased risk aversion towards emerging
markets, decline in commodity prices and concerns about the financing of the current account
deficit. The floating exchange rate helped to cushion the impact of the commodity and capital
outflow shocks on the real economy.
17.
More recently, the rand appears to have benefited from increased risk appetite by
international investors for riskier emerging-market and commodity-exporter country assets.
There may also be other factors that are in play, including the uncertainty around the US
dollar and actual (and potential) FDI that is entering South Africa. Accordingly, the rand has
appreciated against a basket of currencies including the US dollar and the Euro; by more than
21 percent against the US dollar since the end of2008.
Financial sector stability
18.
South Africa is served by a sophisticated financial system that is well run, managed
and regulated. Oversight for the system is shared between the central bank (SARB)and the
Ministry of Finance. The financial system is highly profitable but also very concentrated,
being dominated by a few large banks and insurance companies. The authorities welcomed
the report based on financial sector assessment undertaken byte IMF and World Bank and
released last year. The SARB has made considerable progress in implementing the
recommendations made in the FSAP report and the progress made is reported in the Annual
Report of the SARB’s Banking Supervision Department that was released in July 2009 and is
available on SARB website.
19.
Global financial market turmoil has not posed serious challenges for the management
of domestic liquidity. Banks have built up sufficient liquidity buffers and money markets
were little affected by the tight global markets, showing no abnormal signs of strain. There
also has been no extraordinary demand for the SARB’s standing facilities or repo operations.
20.
The increase in interest rates from mid-2006 to mid-2008 and the softening in
property prices since 2008 have put some pressure on South African bank balance sheets.
These factors, as well as pressure on household disposable income, have dampened the

5
profitability of the banking sector. More stringent criteria are now being applied to new loan
approvals in response to the global credit crunch. Nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios appear
relatively low with substantial provisioning, but the doubling of NPLs to 5.1 percent in the
past year has also been due to the more stringent reporting requirements of Basle II. My
authorities reassure that these impaired loans or NPLs remain at manageable levels. Further,
South African corporations rely relatively less on debt financing, with corporate credit not
raising strong concerns.
Conclusion
21.
My authorities are well aware that the key challenge they have to confront relates to
creating jobs, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. It features high amongst the list
of government priorities announced by the President in his inaugural address to parliament.
The other priorities they have identified include an industrial policy action plan, a reduction
of the regulatory burden particularly on small businesses, improving public sector
performance, a more effective system to monitor the implementation of government’s
programme of action, and strengthened planning and policy coordination.
