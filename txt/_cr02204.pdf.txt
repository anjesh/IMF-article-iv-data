IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Rwanda
On July 24, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1
Background
Since the end of the war and genocide in 1994, Rwanda has made substantial progress in
rebuilding the country’s economic and social infrastructure, despite institutional capacity
constraints. After the immediate post-conflict recovery period, Rwanda’s economic performance
has remained strong. Real GDP grew 6.7 percent in 2001, as favorable weather conditions
stimulated agricultural output and external transfers, equivalent to 11.5 percent of GDP, spurred
manufacturing, construction, and transportation and communication activities. The current
account deficit (excluding grants) in 2001—at 16.4 percent of GDP roughly unchanged from
2002—was financed by continuing large external aid inflows. Consumer price inflation declined
to 3.4 percent in 2001 from 3.9 percent in 2000, helped by the favorable impact of increased
food supply on prices for agricultural products. Broad money growth in 2001, at 10 percent, was
largely fueled by foreign currency inflows. Helped by larger-than-anticipated foreign aid inflows,
the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) increased its level of gross reserves to cover 5.7 months of
imports of goods and nonfactor services.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The fiscal performance in 2001 was encouraging. With stepped-up efforts in revenue collection,
the revenue-to-GDP ratio rose to 11.4 percent in 2001 from 9.7 percent in 2000. Reflecting a
lower-than-envisaged implementation rate of foreign-financed capital projects, the deficit was
limited to 9.5 percent (excluding grants), nearly one percentage point lower than targeted.
The government initiated a number of structural reforms in 2001. Among major achievements
were the development of a system for the monitoring of poverty-reducing spending, the
introduction of a value-added tax, the start of weekly foreign exchange auctions of the NBR, and
the strengthening of the Office of the Auditor General. However, partly due to capacity
constraints, some actions remain to be taken.
In 2002, the government will limit the overall fiscal deficit to below 9.9 percent of GDP.
Programmed spending includes outlays for demobilization and reintegration of army soldiers
and ex-combatants, stepped-up efforts at fiscal decentralization, and jurisdiction of genociderelated trials. In order to accommodate these exceptional expenditures, revenue measures—
including an increase in the value-added tax rate to 18 percent from 15, and a harmonization of
the customs tariff structure to proposals for a common external tariff under the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)—are being implemented. At the same time, the
corporate income tax is being reduced in an effort to harmonize the tax system with neighboring
countries.
Rwanda’s medium-term macroeconomic strategy is to gradually reduce the fiscal and current
account deficits, and to arrest the deterioration of the debt sustainability indicators. While
increasing macroeconomic stability, these policies are expected to also improve private sector
confidence, which will be critical to improving economic growth and reducing poverty. For 2003
and 2004, the government plans to limit the fiscal deficit to 9.4 and 8.0 percent of GDP,
respectively. During this period, expenditure in priority areas will continue to grow substantially,
while growth in other spending will be moderated. Revenue measures, such as the introduction
of an excise tax on cars and a reform of the personal income tax, will accompany the package.
The external current account deficit is projected to decline to 13.6 percent of GDP by 2004.
Rwanda’s economic program also contains a comprehensive structural reform agenda,
including substantial improvements in the administration of public finances, the promotion of
governmental transparency and accountability, and the strengthening of the financial sector and
its supervision.
Rwanda’s program is backed by its first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), issued
in June 2002, which builds on a broad-based consultative process. In the PRSP, Rwanda lays
out in detail its strategy for substantially reducing poverty. Rwanda can reach the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in 2003.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ progress, over the past year, in laying the
foundations for robust growth and poverty reduction under difficult conditions. Directors cited in

-3this connection the major reintegration effort, the safety nets for survivors of the 1994 genocide,
the elections for local government, work on a new constitution, and the training of judges.
Directors stressed, equally, that sustained growth and enduring poverty reduction depend
crucially on a just and durable security settlement in Rwanda and more widely in the Great
Lakes region. Only in that setting can critically-needed advances in regional economic
integration be realized, and domestic resources in Rwanda be freed for productive use.
Directors therefore urged the authorities to pursue peace relentlessly. This would be crucial
also, in parallel with strong policy performance, to catalyze investor and donor support and
assure the financing of Rwanda’s program.
Directors laid particular emphasis on the need for fiscal transparency, including on defense
expenditures. They urged prompt action to establish effective expenditure tracking and financial
reporting systems, to be developed with direct World Bank engagement, so that the
demobilization and reintegration program would be subject to adequate monitoring and
accounting systems.
Directors noted that the progress achieved by the authorities over the past three years has
taken place in a setting of macroeconomic stability, and a progressive strengthening in
administrative capacity, under the PRGF programs. They viewed performance in 2001 as
broadly encouraging, with growth strong, inflation moderate—partly due to climatic conditions—
and an above-target rise in official reserves. Progress has been made with structural reforms—
such as the revised fees for public services; improved performance at the Rwanda Revenue
Authority (RRA); the auditing of public accounts transactions and of key ministries, as well as a
strengthening of the Office of the Auditor-General; a new civil service structure and code; and
strengthening of the national tender board. Taken together, these measures lay a strong basis
for moving forward.
Most Directors welcomed the authorities’ program for 2002-03 as underpinning the growth and
poverty reduction goals of the PRSP. A number of Directors, however, expressed strong
reservations as to whether the preconditions for a sustainable program were yet in place—
referring notably to risks arising from the security situation, and Rwanda’s implementation
capacity.
Directors stressed that macroeconomic stability is crucial for the attainment of sustained growth
and poverty reduction. A prudent fiscal stance is thus essential, to avoid a deterioration in debt
sustainability indicators beyond the projected levels. In this connection, most Directors were
encouraged by the limited rise in the deficit on domestic fiscal operations projected in 2002, and
the commitment to reverse this from 2003 onward.
Directors viewed success in the revenue effort under the program as critical—in this key phase
of nation-building—to secure financing consistent with continued stability. Recent increases in
the VAT rate to the regional average, and the adjustment of tariff rates in line with preliminary
COMESA proposals, were seen as contributing substantially to meeting revenue targets,
although further improvements to the capacity of the RRA remain essential.

-4Directors praised the authorities’ expenditure program, which encompasses fully the priority
actions needed for social, political, and economic transformation. In this regard, they pointed to
constitutional reform, government decentralization, and the strengthening of governance as bold
steps toward a sustainable and efficient foundation for the economy. Spending on local
(gacaca) courts and on demobilization and reintegration, as well as assistance to genocide
victims, support critical poverty reduction goals in the PRSP, Directors noted. They laid
particular emphasis on the importance of reducing unproductive expenditure. Some Directors
questioned whether, in present circumstances, the authorities would be in a position to fully
implement these expenditure plans.
Directors stressed the need to continue strengthening public financial administration—which is
crucial for the appropriate and efficient use of resources in support of program goals. They
commended new eligibility guidelines for domestic liability claims, improved processes for
establishing and monitoring government bank accounts, and the incorporation of off-budget
accounts. They noted also the importance of continued reinforcement of the Office of the
Auditor-General, publication of audit reports and data on government financial operations, and
inclusion of the demobilization and reintegration accounts for 2002 in the program of the
Auditor-General’s Office.
Directors considered that the current floating exchange rate regime continues to serve Rwanda
well. They welcomed the authorities’ continuing commitment to establishing low inflation as a
norm. Directors urged the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) to monitor closely liquidity
developments, and to tighten policy aggressively when needed.
Noting Rwanda’s extremely narrow export base, continued dependence on external financing,
and vulnerability to external shocks, Directors stressed that capital inflows and shifts in relative
prices must not be allowed to undermine market incentives for productive activities and
diversification of the economy. Directors also urged the authorities to strengthen their debt
management system. Several Directors stressed concerns about the lengthy period over which
Rwanda’s debt ratios are projected to decline to sustainable levels, and some emphasized that
the international community must continue to provide adequate financial assistance.
Directors expressed concern about the precarious health of the banking sector and urged
prompt action to deal with underlying issues. They called for a timely action plan, in consultation
with World Bank and Fund staff, to address problems in a commercial bank now under
provisional control of the NBR - to safeguard assets and limit the potential fiscal burden. They
welcomed the authorities’ interest in participating in the FSAP program.
Directors encouraged resolute movement forward with measures to combat money laundering
and financing for terrorism. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to develop, with the
assistance of anti-money laundering experts, a road map setting out required technical
assistance and major milestones.
Directors noted that Rwanda’s macroeconomic statistics suffer from many weaknesses,
especially in the areas of national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments.

-5While recognizing that some initial steps to address identified issues had been taken, they
stated that further strengthening remains a priority and advised the authorities to take
advantage of available technical assistance, including from the Fund, in the effort.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
