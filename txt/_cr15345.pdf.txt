IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Malawi
On December 11, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2015 Article IV consultation1 with Malawi.
Bold economic reforms undertaken in mid-2012, namely the devaluation of the currency, the
adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, the liberalization of foreign exchange markets, and
the introduction of an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism transformed the policy
environment and greatly improved the outlook of the economy. But uneven policy
implementation, high inflation, and a weak balance of payments position–dependent on a narrow
export base and financed by volatile donor inflows–continue to pose macroeconomic challenges.
Furthermore, the “cashgate” scandal uncovered in 2013 involving a large-scale theft of public
funds damaged Malawi’s economic outlook significantly. The subsequent withdrawal of donors’
budgetary support and fiscal and monetary policy slippages prevented the achievement of key
objectives of sustainable and inclusive growth, and low inflation under Malawi’s Growth and
Development Strategy. Over 2012–14, real GDP growth and inflation averaged 4.3 percent and
24.5 percent, respectively.
The economic outlook remains difficult reflecting the negative impact of weather-related shocks,
the ongoing suspension of budget support, persistently high inflation and weaker global demand
which could hurt Malawi’s exports. Real GDP growth is projected to fall by 2.7 percentage
points to 3 percent in 2015 due in large part to heavy floods in early 2015 followed by drought
which resulted in an estimated decline of about 30 percent in the maize harvest (the main staple).
As a result, an estimated 2.8 million persons remain at risk of food insecurity. Growth is
projected to rise gradually to about 5.5 percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to
rise to 25.4 percent at end-2015 and is estimated to ease in 2016 and reach single digits at end2017 if fiscal and monetary policies tighten, and international prices for food and petroleum
products remain low. The external current account deficit will remain in the 8 percent range over
the medium term reflecting the demand for imports associated with developmental projects,
rapid population growth, and the slow pace of export diversification.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.
A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors expressed concerns about the policy slippages that have prevented Malawi
from achieving sustained growth and low inflation. They agreed that the outlook is subject to
downside risks from continued weather related supply shocks, the interruption of donor budget
support, and weaker demand for Malawi’s exports. Accordingly, Directors emphasized that
restoration of macroeconomic stability was a critical near term priority. In this context, they
underlined the need for fiscal consolidation and tighter monetary policy. Going forward, with
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, Directors expected
growth to rebound gradually over the medium term along with a decline in inflation.
Directors underscored the benefits of improved revenue mobilization to respond to rising
demand for public services from a rapidly growing population and to reduce aid dependence.
Directors recommended broadening the tax base, strengthening tax compliance, and modernizing
tax administration. Directors emphasized that ensuring medium term fiscal sustainability while
safeguarding social spending will require improvements in the allocation and targeting of public
spending. Directors stressed the need to accelerate public financial management reforms to
restore trust and confidence in the budget process and foster donor re-engagement. Directors also
cautioned that the envisaged changes should not make public sector pensions fiscally untenable.
Directors welcomed Malawi’s commitment to the flexible exchange rate regime and the
automatic fuel pricing mechanism, both of which have served Malawi well. They cautioned that
changes to the fuel import regime involving a greater role for the state-owned company should
be transparent and include safeguards against the emergence of contingent liabilities for the
budget.
Directors called for intensified efforts to enhance financial sector resilience and its role in
fostering inclusive growth. They noted that credit and concentration risks pose a significant
threat to banking system stability and warranted continuous vigilance.
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement structural reforms to remove supply
bottlenecks, increase agricultural productivity and improve the business environment.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 30, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Malawi’s persistent macroeconomic problems arise from uneven policy
implementation, high inflation, and a weak balance of payments position that is financed
by volatile donor inflows. Inadequate adjustment following the “cashgate” scandal
involving the theft of public funds contributed to fiscal imbalances that damaged
Malawi’s economic outlook significantly. Fiscal and monetary policy slippages and the
lack of progress on key program-related PFM reforms put the Fund-supported
ECF arrangement off track and weakened donor confidence. Against this backdrop,
Malawi has so far been unable to achieve its key objectives of sustainable growth and
low inflation under its growth and development strategy.
Outlook and risks: The economic outlook remains difficult due to the negative
impact of weather-related shocks, the ongoing suspension of budget support, and
persistently high inflation. Short-term risks are tilted to the downside as a looming food
crisis—owing to a steep decline in the maize harvest—which is projected to impact
2.8 million persons, continues to weigh on the outlook. Additional risks arise from
weaker global demand which could hurt Malawi’s exports. The exchange rate and the
automatic fuel pricing mechanism would serve as shock absorbers in mitigating adverse
global developments.
Policy discussions: Discussions focused on restoring macroeconomic stability in the
near term through the pursuit of tighter fiscal and monetary policies geared toward
placing inflation on a declining trend. In addition, accelerating the implementation of
public financial management reforms is critical to re-establishing trust and confidence in
the budget process. Over the medium term, policies should concentrate on safeguarding
macroeconomic stability, improving the quality of spending, mobilizing revenues,
addressing supply-side bottlenecks, and mitigating negative feedback loops from
macroeconomic policies on the real and financial sectors.1 Continued vigilance over the
financial sector is warranted as credit risk poses a significant threat to financial stability.

CONTEXT
1.
Malawi’s long-lingering macroeconomic difficulties arise from uneven policy
implementation, high inflation, and a weak external position. As a result, Malawi has been a
long-term user of IMF resources, including most recently under the Extended Credit Facility
arrangement approved in July 2012. Bold economic reforms undertaken in mid-2012, namely the
devaluation of the currency, the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, the liberalization of
foreign exchange markets, and the introduction of an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism
transformed the policy environment and greatly improved the economic outlook (Annex I).
Nevertheless, heavy dependence on volatile aid flows, a narrow export base, and fiscal dominance
have had adverse effects on the rest of the economy, posing challenges for macroeconomic stability.
2.
Adverse shocks and policy slippages prevented the achievement of the key objectives
of sustainable growth and low inflation under Malawi’s growth and development strategy
(MGDS II). Against this background, real

resulted in increased recourse to domestic financing.
3.
Program implementation has proven to be difficult in the face of ongoing external
financing shortfalls and policy slippages which have put the program off track. While end-June
targets on net domestic assets (NDA) and net international reserves of the central bank were met,
net domestic financing (NDF) was missed by a large margin (2 percent of GDP). All PFM-related
structural benchmarks—the centerpiece of the program’s structural agenda—were missed, which
has contributed to delays in the resumption of budget support. However, good progress was made
in implementing those related to the financial sector. The seventh review has been postponed
pending the adoption of measures to bring the program back on track.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The newly elected government after the May 2014 elections committed to rebuilding
trust in public institutions and correcting macroeconomic imbalances. While it was initially able
to bring the Fund program back on track, responding to wage demands arising from persistently
high inflation and meeting unplanned recruitment in the education sector led to policy slippages.
5.

Recent weather-related shocks have negatively impacted the economy (Figures 1–4).



Growth: Heavy floods in early 2015 followed by drought have resulted in an estimated decline
of about 30 percent in the maize harvest (the main staple). Real GDP growth in 2015 has been
revised downward by 2.7 percentage points to 3 percent (Figure 1). GDP was rebased (Box 1).



Food insecurity: The steep decline in the maize harvest has created severe food insecurity for an
estimated 2.8 million persons (about 16 percent of the population).



Inflation: Annual inflation declined by 6 percentage points from end-2014 to 18 percent in
March 2015, owing to the effects of

the U.S. dollar. In response, the
central bank (RBM) introduced a
number of directives aimed at slowing the pace of depreciation and later intervened through
sales of foreign exchange. Expectations also played a role as average inflation has been stuck
above 20 percent since 2012, in addition to the second round effects from recent public wage
increases.



Credit: Growth in credit to the private sector—negative in real terms—continued its downward
trend due to persistently high inflation, economic uncertainties, and tighter bank lending
conditions.

The policy rate was raised by 250 basis points to 25 percent in November 2014, combined with a directive requiring
that the current liquid reserve requirement (15.5 percent) be imposed on the foreign currency deposit equivalent in
local currency.



External sector: The external current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to about
8 percent of GDP in 2014, compared to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2013 reflecting lower export
earnings, the impact of weaker aggregate demand on imports, and ongoing external financing
shortfalls.

Box 1. Rebasing Gross Domestic Product


The National Statistical Office (NSO) of Malawi recently rebased their nominal GDP series from
calendar year 2007 to 2010. The 2010-based national supply and use table has been used to derive
a new GDP series, which was revised upwards by 29 percent.



The rebasing has fundamental implications for economic analysis. Some key indicators have
changed significantly. The revenue-to-GDP ratio in FY2010/11 declined from 24.5 percent to
15.6 percent and the public debt-to-GDP in 2011 fell by 12 percentage points of GDP to 28.1.
The lower debt ratios provide additional fiscal space, but the revised revenue ratios underline the
scope for increased revenue mobilization.

7.
Despite increasing inflationary pressures, the RBM relaxed the stance of monetary
policy in July 2015 by lowering the liquid reserve ratio (LRR), adding to pressure on the
kwacha. The move was intended to stimulate the real economy by reducing nominal lending rates.
Although the policy rate remained unchanged, the cut in the LRR from 15.5 percent to 7.5 percent
caused excess banking system liquidity to rise by about 1¼ percentage points of GDP. As a result,
short-term market interest rates and returns on government securities, which had been positive in
real terms, fell sharply, opening a large gap with the policy rate. Sterilization efforts have now
absorbed the excess liquidity but key interest rates remained negative in real terms (Figure 2).
The RBM increased the policy rate by 200 basis points in early November.
8.
The various shocks to Malawi’s economy since 2012 had sizable spillover effects on the
financial system. The 2012 devaluation of

of banks to about 15 percent since mid-2012 and net interest margins that are significantly higher
than those of neighboring countries (Figures 3 and 4). Weak economic activity has meant that some
companies have experienced difficulties in remitting contributions to pension funds. Similarly, some
insurance companies have reported arrears in collection of rental income from government. At a
granular level a number of banks face a high degree of concentration risk, reflecting in part the
limited number of large creditworthy customers. The RBM reduced vulnerabilities by selling two
weak banks with significant state-shareholding, which are being recapitalized.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The economic outlook remains challenging in light of continued uncertainties related
to weather conditions, the resumption of budget support, and macroeconomic instability
stemming from persistently high inflation. The medium-term projections are predicated on
policy actions to reduce inflation, limited budget support (½ percent of GDP in FY15/16) pending
full donor re-engagement, a normalization of weather conditions, and implementation of the
structural reform agenda.


Growth is expected to pick up to 4.5 percent in 2016, rising to about 5½ percent over the
medium term (within the range of the average over the last 10 years), conditional on a recovery
in the agricultural sector, construction activity, and the wholesale and retail sectors. Credit to the
private sector is projected to pick up over the medium term as inflation falls to single digits.



Inflation is projected to be higher than expected due to the supply shock and the lagged
effects of looser-than-expected macroeconomic policies. Inflation is expected to ease in 2016 as
the policy stance tightens and will be facilitated by lower international prices for food and
petroleum products.



The external current account deficit will remain in the 8 percent range over the medium term
reflecting the demand for imports associated with developmental projects and rapid population
growth, and the slow pace of export diversification.



Short-term risks are tilted to the downside as the looming food crisis—the worst in the last
10 years—continues to weigh

Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities agreed with staff’s views on the outlook and noted that should some of
these risks materialize, there would be limited fiscal space for countercyclical policies. However, the

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

flexible exchange rate and automatic fuel pricing mechanism should serve as shock absorbers in
mitigating global spillovers (Annex II).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Policy discussions centered on measures to restore macroeconomic stability,
re-establish confidence in policy implementation and PFM systems, and address key mediumterm challenges.


Near-term priorities consist of (i) restoring macroeconomic stability by implementing tight fiscal
and monetary policies needed to place inflation on a declining trajectory; and (ii) accelerating
the implementation of priority PFM reforms to re-establish trust and confidence in the budget
process.



Over the medium term, policies should concentrate on safeguarding macroeconomic stability,
consolidating PFM and debt management reforms, improving the quality of spending,
promoting higher and inclusive growth, and reducing macroeconomic risks that spill over to the
real and financial sectors. Given large balance of payments and infrastructure needs, donor
re-engagement and revenue mobilization are critical to the achievement of these medium-term
objectives.

A. Key Priorities in the Near Term
Restoring Macroeconomic Stability
12.
An appropriately tight fiscal policy is needed to support monetary policy actions
aimed at placing inflation on a downward trajectory. The sudden stop in donor budget support
in 2013 opened up a large financing gap, which as a result of inadequate fiscal adjustment has been
filled through increased recourse to domestic financing (cumulative 7½ percent of GDP in FY13/14
and FY15/16). In particular, increases in the wage bill granted in FY14/15 in the absence of sufficient
offsetting measures have fueled the private sector’s perception that adherence to budget targets is
problematic and that domestic financing of the fiscal deficit will persist. This has had a detrimental
impact on growth as it fueled uncertainty and stymied investment.
13.
The pending adoption of a revised budget for fiscal year 2015/16 will constitute a
critical first step in restoring macroeconomic stability, given the changed macroeconomic
outlook. The sharp changes in the macroeconomic setting (¶5) and the carryover effects from fiscal
slippages (¶6) created a financing gap of about one percent of GDP in the FY15/16 budget.
The revised budget is based on realistic revenue estimates and proposes cuts in domestically
financed investment and goods and services while limiting net domestic financing (¾ percent of
GDP). The revised fiscal framework takes into account donors’ financial assurances and safeguards
social spending. Safeguarding social spending is critical to consolidate recent achievements in
improving the delivery of public services in health and education (Box 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALAWI

14.
A tight monetary policy is needed to achieve positive short-term real interest rates.
Prior to the change in the LRR, monetary policy had borne the brunt of the adjustment of the
disinflation effort (¶7). However, since then, the pursuit of the competing objectives of disinflation
and stimulating real sector activity by lowering prime lending rates resulted in an increase in
liquidity in the banking system. Looking ahead, the RBM has sufficient instruments to conduct
effective liquidity management provided fiscal policy is supportive. A clear communication of its
monetary policy stance to market participants will contribute to improved policy credibility and in
anchoring inflation expectations. Moreover, the RBM should closely monitor all forms of lending to
the government to remain within the limits fixed by the recently enacted amendments to the Central
Bank Act.
Box 2. Social Sector Progress
Initiatives to address gender disparity in education have borne fruit. Gender parity in primary
school enrollment has been achieved and female primary school completion rate has been above the
average for SSA LICs since 2008. However, pressures of early marriage and teenage pregnancy
continue to limit female retention at the secondary level.
Improvements in the delivery of health care services and higher allocations to the health sector
contributed to a sharp reduction in infant mortality rates. Infant mortality is now significantly
below the SSA LIC average and the 2015 MDG target is within reach. Life expectancy has also improved
over time, but remains below the SSA average.
Access to electricity and water—key indicators of social welfare—has improved substantially.
The implementation of a rural electrification program expanded the population centers connected to
electricity from 45 in 2005 to 182 in 2010 and the proportion of the population with access to
electricity has reached 9 percent since 2010. Access to improved water also rose from 72 percent in
2005 to 85 percent in 2012.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities considered that the uptick in inflation in 2015 was predominantly
due to supply shocks but recognized that fiscal retrenchment was necessary for disinflation.
In order to tame inflation, they noted that further domestic borrowing in FY15/16 should be limited
and that high real lending rates had choked off demand for credit.

Accelerating the Implementation of Priority PFM Reforms
16.
Progress in implementing priority PFM reforms has been slow and efforts need to be
redoubled. Although the sequencing and implementation of key reforms were supported through
IMF technical assistance (TA), bank reconciliations have not been successfully completed and
weakness in cash management and financial reporting has persisted. Nevertheless, some initiatives
aimed at improving the performance of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) and
strengthening the budgetary process have been undertaken (Box 3). Staff stressed that bank
reconciliations were critical to identifying and preventing the potential misappropriation of public
funds and therefore to reviving donor re-engagement. In addition, stronger commitment control will
mitigate the emergence of domestic payment arrears and permit domestic financing to be limited to
budgeted amounts. In this regard, there is need for regular oversight, accountability and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

application of sanctions on public sector officials in accordance with the PFM Act, if they fail to carry
out their responsibilities.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities underscored that some progress was made on the PFM front (Box 3).
However, they recognized that major challenges remained in areas of financial reporting and bank
reconciliations due to the huge backlog of transactions. In order to address this issue, a taskforce
comprising of the accountant general and RBM’s staff is meeting weekly to validate and clear the
backlog. A high-level committee chaired jointly by the Secretary to the Treasury and the RBM’s
Governor is scheduled to meet monthly to review progress and facilitate the reconciliation process.
Box 3. Recent Achievements in PFM Reforms
Progress has been made in rationalizing the government bank accounts at the RBM. 139 dormant
bank accounts at RBM have been closed and their balances transferred to government’s main operating
account (MG1). An additional 265 dormant bank accounts at RBM have been submitted to the
accountant general for review.
Concrete actions have been taken to increase the coverage of IFMIS. The main government bank
accounts have been incorporated into the IFMIS and the backlog of all transactional data for 2014/15
has been captured. Payments of budgeted expenditure that are generated outside of the IFMIS have
also been reduced. The ultimate goal is to integrate all bank accounts into the IFMIS to improve the
accounting and control of public resources.
Hardware and network upgrades have helped enhance the reliability of the IFMIS.
The procurement of additional servers and the network upgrade have increased processing speed and
reduced downtime. These upgrades will help accelerate bank reconciliations. An IFMIS security officer
has been appointed to manage the security of the system and provide security training.
Controlling Officers have been explicitly charged with improving financial discipline within
spending units. Mandated actions include ensuring that commitments and payments do not exceed the
released funds; providing cash flow forecasts; performing timely bank reconciliations; submitting the
annual financial statements in a timely manner for audit; and certifying monthly financial statements.
Additional initiatives are being taken to foster budget control and transparency. The authorities
have instituted independent audit committees, responsible for reviewing audit matters presented by
internal and external auditors. In addition, the authorities are in the process of introducing treasury
inspectors in ministries to oversee budget planning, monitoring and evaluation.

B. Key Priorities Over the Medium Term
Ensuring Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
18.
The pursuit of prudent fiscal policy is indispensable to safeguarding medium-term
fiscal and debt sustainability. To this end the medium-term fiscal anchor comprises a primary
fiscal balance that places domestic debt on a gradual declining path and limits non-concessional
borrowing given weaknesses in debt management capacity. The overall deficit would decline from a
peak of about 6 percent of GDP in FY14/15 to 2.5 percent of GDP in FY18/19.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

19.
Improving the allocation of public spending will create fiscal space and safeguard
the provision of critical social spending (Figure 5). Currently, there is limited fiscal space as the
wage bill, interest payments, pensions, and outlays on the farm input subsidy program (FISP)
account for about 75 percent of domestic revenues in FY14/15. The wage bill (35 percent of
revenues) has contributed to a worsening in expenditure rigidities and the crowding out of
domestically financed capital spending. In an effort to contain the wage bill, the authorities are
conducting a comprehensive payroll audit to eliminate ghost workers. Travel allowances, which have
been overly generous, were cut by more than 25 percent in FY15/16 budget relative to the previous
year.
20.
The authorities’ efforts to review the FISP (Selected Issues) are welcome given the
need for fiscal consolidation. In an effort to create fiscal space and increase expenditure efficiency,
the authorities intend to lower the subsidy rate from 97 percent to 79 percent and reduce
procurement costs. Staff developed a model with sectoral interlinkages to analyze the distributional
effects of the reform. While the reform would yield about one percent of GDP in savings, it would
reduce pro-poor spending and adversely impact income inequality. In order to mitigate the negative
impacts on the poor, staff recommended using part of the savings to increase cash transfers which
would boost growth and reduce inequality. Net savings would be in the range of 0.3–0.5 percent of
GDP.
21.
Greater revenue mobilization is needed to respond to the rising demand
for public services from a rapidly growing population and to meet Malawi’s sustainable
development goals. Malawi’s

require strengthening VAT
compliance, increasing audits of large taxpayers, broadening the tax base (telecoms, mining, and
property taxes), and modernizing tax administration through increased computerization.
22.
Fully funding the public sector pension scheme—one of the objectives of the 2011
pension reform—is fiscally untenable and should be revisited. Servicing benefits accrued under
the existing non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme requires disproportionately high
budget subsidies. Meeting these accrued liabilities would require assets exceeding 60 percent of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

GDP which would undermine fiscal sustainability and a debt issuance of such magnitude could not
be accommodated by Malawi’s capital markets. Reforms should concentrate on reducing the
liabilities of the current system by adjusting its parameters in line with recommendations from IMF
technical assistance.

containing the travel budget and reforms to the FISP were key measures to this end. On the revenue
front, identifying new sources of revenues, strengthening compliance, and migrating to a
computerized tax administration were key medium-term reforms.

Preserving Debt Sustainability
24.
External debt remains at moderate risk of distress. A staff update on debt sustainability
concluded that the public and publicly guaranteed external debt-to-GDP ratio in net present value
(NPV) terms is expected to follow a declining trend, just as envisioned in the previous WB/IMF DSA
(March 2015). GDP was recently rebased, which pushed some debt indicators (including the baseline
scenario debt-to-GDP ratio) below thresholds. External debt would evolve as expected in the
previous DSA. A debt monitoring committee has been established to oversee the debt management
process and identify risks associated with rapid debt accumulation and vulnerabilities to external
shocks.

Improving the Conduct of Monetary Policy and Commitment to the Flexible Exchange
Rate Regime
25.
There is scope to improve Malawi’s monetary policy architecture and to increase the
RBM’s capacity to fight inflation. Price stability should be the primary objective of monetary
policy over the medium term in order to prevent tensions in meeting competing objectives.
Currently the RBM operates a reserve money program but is also mindful of the potential impact of
interest rate policy on aggregate demand. In this context the policy rate is publicly announced to
convey its policy stance. However, building policy credibility requires the active use of open market
operations in order to align short-term market determined rates with the policy rate. Staff noted
that large and frequent differences between the de facto policy stance (represented by short-term
money market rates) and the policy rate undermine the credibility of monetary policy and weakens
the monetary transmission mechanism.
26.
Staff underscored the need to further improve the monetary policy framework to
support financial market development and enhance intermediation. Strengthening the RBM’s
capacity to forecast economic activity and inflation would help monetary policy become more
forward-looking. To increase the use of indirect instruments and interest rates to signal the
monetary policy stance, the RBM needs to strengthen its ability to forecast and actively manage
liquidity. A more active management of short-term liquidity in the banking system is a prerequisite
for developing the interbank market and, improving monetary transmission mechanisms.
27.
The flexible exchange rate regime has served Malawi well in addressing structural
balance of payments problems. The real effective exchange rate has depreciated over long
periods through end-2013. Despite a real appreciation in 2014 by 8 percent, staff’s assessment
suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals at end-2014 (Annex III).
Nevertheless, there is scope to improve competitiveness through the implementation of structural
reforms and to increase reserve cover given Malawi’s susceptibility to large external shocks.
Staff found that the authorities’ practice of determining the exchange rate of commercial banks
through moral suasion has ceased, thereby removing the official action that gave rise to the multiple
currency practice identified in August 2006 and manifested by the significant spread between the
commercial bank and foreign exchange bureau rates. Staff urged the authorities’ to review and

amend the recent foreign currency directives especially those provisions that potentially impede
price discovery and the functioning of the foreign exchange market.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the level of the exchange rate.
They indicated their commitment to allow the exchange rate to be market determined and stressed
that, going forward they intend to conduct only limited foreign exchange interventions to dampen
bouts of market volatility.
29.
Regarding the monetary policy architecture, the RBM noted that treasury bill rates are
determined by supply and demand and that aligning the policy rate with treasury bills rates is not a
daily operational objective. They maintained that, given the oligopolistic structure of the interbank
market, the interbank rate had no relationship with the policy rate or government paper beyond
90 day maturities. In their view, the fiscal costs of aligning the interbank rate with the policy rate
outweighed the monetary policy benefits and could not be justified as a daily operational objective.
However, as inflation decelerates, they foresaw the possibility of moving in this direction.

limited access to credit. The recently
completed railway linking Malawi to the Mozambican coast augurs well for lowering transportation
costs for exports.
31.
Reliability of fuel supply and the automatic fuel pricing mechanism are critical to
fostering growth. To this end, there is need to clarify the fuel import regime among the regulator,
state, and private suppliers of petroleum products to avoid supply disruption. If the reform includes
a greater role for the state-owned oil company, there will be a need for a governance structure that
safeguards transparency in order to mitigate the emergence of contingent liabilities to the
government.

32.
Efforts to improve Malawi’s business environment remain crucial to unlocking
growth. While staff’s assessment of the level of the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, nonprice factors continue to hamper competitiveness. Malawi’s rankings in the World Bank’s Doing
Business Indicators and World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report have both
undergone a continuous deterioration. Firms identify access to financing, corruption, crime and
theft, tax rates, and inflation, as the five major constraints to doing business in Malawi (Figure 6).
Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment. They also noted that macroeconomic
stability was important for the development of capital markets and that improved supervision of the
non-bank sector will strengthen the resilience of financial markets.

Economic Statistics
34.
Although the provision of economic data has some shortcomings, it is broadly
adequate for surveillance. There is scope to improve the coverage of the financial accounts of the
balance of payments, and the consistency of source data in government financial statistics.
In addition, more detailed monthly CPI data could serve as an important input to monetary policy
formulation (Information Annex).

C. Enhancing Financial Stability and the Role of the Financial Sector in
Fostering Inclusion and Growth
35.
Macroeconomic risks comprise an important source of spillovers to the financial
sector with feedback loops to the fiscal and real sectors. These spillovers arise from policy
slippages related to inadequate fiscal adjustment that lead to the accumulation of domestic
payment arrears to private suppliers who experience difficulties in servicing loans, leading to higher
NPLs. Increased recourse to domestic financing crowds out the private sector, increases banks‘ and
non-banks’ exposures to government and creates economic uncertainty.3 Volatile tobacco exports
receipts—the main export earner—and erratic maize harvests, are other sources of risks with
negative effects on banks’ and firms’ balance sheets that are amplified by exchange rate volatility.
Feedback to the fiscal and real sectors arises via higher interest costs.

Financial sector depth and inclusion have increased steadily through 2012, but have
since stagnated in the face of persistently high inflation (Figure 7). Standard metrics of financial

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

sector depth point to substantial improvement but Malawi has lagged behind its peers. Real GDP
growth in recent years has been driven mainly by rain-fed agriculture and services which accounted
for 45 percent of bank credit. Access to formal financial services increased from 26 percent of adults
in 2008 to 40 percent in 2014, but remains concentrated in urban areas while 50 percent of adult
population in rural areas remain un-served. Despite improvements in financial inclusion, Malawi
compares poorly relative to peers, underscoring the need to restore macroeconomic stability,
improve financial infrastructure, and foster greater financial literacy.
37.
Stress tests confirmed that credit risk stemming from high exposure to large
borrowers poses a significant threat to the banking system (Box 4; Selected Issues).
Globally, the banking system would be resilient to an increase in NPLs as well as liquidity and market
risks. Specifically, concentration risk arising from exposure to large borrowers represents the largest
source of credit risk. In addition, the system is not robust to a combined major shock to net interest
and foreign exchange income which would lower the tier 1 capital ratio below the norm of
10 percent.
38.
As the economy continues to face strong headwinds, continuous vigilance is
warranted to ensure appropriate and timely responses to potential adverse developments in
the financial sector and to minimize their economic and fiscal costs. Against this background,
there is need for continued stress testing, enhancing supervision, and enforcing compliance with
prudential norms. Strengthening creditor rights and reducing lengthy judicial processes in
recovering collateral are critical to the reduction of NPLs. The introduction of new provisioning
directives is a welcomed step in addressing low provisioning rates. Given the economy is prone to
large shocks, concentration risk linked to exposure to large borrowers and its implications for
liquidity, requires crisis contingency planning, and strengthening the resolution framework for
financial institutions in order to minimize costs in the event of insolvency.
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities agreed that a sound banking system and restoring macroeconomic
stability were critical to fostering financial inclusion. The authorities recognized that credit risk
and particularly concentration risk from exposure to large borrowers remain the largest threat to
financial sector stability. They underscored, however, that concentration risk will remain a feature of
the financial system given the role of large conglomerates in the economy and limited access to
both long-term external and domestic financing. They noted that going forward, higher capital
requirements, improving credit assessments, higher provisioning, and bank mergers were key to
mitigating these risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

MALAWI

Box 4. Banking Sector Stress Tests
The RBM’s stress testing framework, draws on the Cihak (2007) model and considers four
categories of risks, namely credit, liquidity, market (interest and foreign exchange risks), and
income risks. The results are published semi-annually. For each risk, the impact of minor, moderate,
and major shocks on bank’s capital adequacy is tested. IMF staff in collaboration with RBM staff
conducted stress tests covering the above risks but modified by a stronger assumption on provisioning
for new NPLs. The results are summarized below:
On credit risk:



The banking system is resilient to a moderate shock that increases NPLs uniformly across banks.
A major shock would push four banks and the whole banking system below the tier 1 capital
adequacy ratio (CAR).



The banking system is also resilient to differentiated sectoral increases in NPLs even in the case of
a major shock doubling NPLs in the five key sectors.



Banks are highly exposed to concentration risk. The aggregate tier 1 CAR would fall below the
benchmark of 10 percent following a default of the first largest borrower in each bank. Ten out the
eleven banks will fall below the prudential capital requirement in case of default by their first two
largest borrowers.

On liquidity risk:



Banks are largely resilient to liquidity risks. However, the survival period of all banks would be less
than one week in case of a major deposit run.

On market risks:



In aggregate, banks are resilient to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. A major foreign
exchange shock, however, would leave two banks with a tier 1 CAR below the current prudential
standard.

On income risk:



Banks were found to be quite sensitive to a combined shift in net interest income and foreign
currency income. The system’s tier 1 CAR would fall below 10 percent norm in the event of a major
shock and the tier 1 capital ratios of three banks would fall below the prudential norm in case of a
minor shock.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Policy slippages and adverse shocks have so far prevented Malawi’s achievement of
sustained growth and low inflation under the authorities’ growth and development strategy.
Growth remained below that of sub-Saharan Africa, while inflation persisted in double digits.
Nevertheless, progress has been made in improving social indicators in health and education.
41.
Restoring macroeconomic stability is the most critical near term priority. Given that
inflation has been stuck above 20 percent since 2012, tighter fiscal policy is needed to support a
monetary policy stance aimed at placing inflation on a downward trajectory. To this end, reducing

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

inflation will necessitate the implementation of a credible budget in line with sustainable financing
and a reprioritization of expenditures whilst safeguarding social spending. Low inflation is also a key
to restoring private sector confidence, and to fostering growth and financial inclusion.
42.
The accelerated implementation of PFM reforms is indispensable to restoring trust and
confidence in the budget process. Greater commitment control that contains voted expenditures
to available resources will mitigate the emergence of payment arrears and allow domestic financing
to be limited to budgeted amounts. The completion of bank reconciliations and the restoration of
basic fiscal reporting are critical to fostering donor re-engagement in light of Malawi’s structural
external sector weaknesses.
43.
Greater revenue mobilization is key to reducing aid dependency, mitigating policy
slippages, and the pursuit of Malawi’s sustainable development goals. In this regard, the
authorities are encouraged to increase collections from new revenue sources, strengthen
compliance, and to modernize their tax administration.
44.
Improving expenditure efficiency will create fiscal space, and safeguard previous quick
wins in health and education. The authorities are commended for initiating reforms to the farm
input subsidy program which is ill-targeted, and implementing a payroll audit to eliminate ghost
workers. The authorities should raise cash transfers to reduce the adverse impacts of the subsidy
reform on the poor.
45.
Pension reforms should be revisited in order to safeguard fiscal sustainability. This is
underscored by the sizable accrued liabilities and the inability of the capital markets to absorb a
large influx of savings.
46.
The flexible exchange rate regime and the automatic fuel pricing mechanism have
served Malawi well in addressing structural weaknesses in its balance of payments.
Staff cautions that any changes to the fuel import regime should be fully transparent and include
consultations with all stakeholders to avoid growth-damaging disruptions in supply.
47.
Mitigating policy slippages—a major source of macroeconomic risks—would reduce
spillovers to the real and financial sectors. Given recent shocks and the identification of
concentration risk as the most important threat to financial sector stability, staff urges continuous
vigilance to ensure appropriate and timely policy responses to minimize their economic and fiscal
costs.
48.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 14747, as amended.

Annex I. Responses to 2012 Article IV Consultation’s Key
Recommendations
Achieve macroeconomic stability and contain inflation. The floating exchange regime and
automatic oil pricing mechanism have helped in the adjustment to external shocks but large
shocks and uneven policies prevented the attainment of low inflation.
Increase international reserves. Foreign reserves cover has gradually risen, reaching three
months of imports towards end-2014.
Improving social indicators. Malawi had made good progress in (i) reducing child mortality;
(ii) gender parity in primary school enrollment; and (iii) access to water and electricity.
Strengthen public financial management. The “cash-gate” scandal exposed weakness in PFM
systems and highlighted the urgency of reforms. Implementation of reforms has been slow.
Ensure fiscal sustainability. Malawi’s risk of debt distress is moderate but ongoing external
financing shortfalls have led to increased recourse to domestic financing.
Strengthen the operational independence of the RBM. The RBM Act which limits credit to
government to a 10 percent of the previous year’s revenue has been approved by parliament and
enacted into law.
Safeguard financial stability. Good progress has been made in implementing monetary and
financial benchmarks, including the submission of amendments to the Banking Act and Financial
Services Act to parliament. Two weak banks were sold and are being recapitalized.
Enhance growth sustainability and inclusiveness. Progress has been made on access to finance
and health although the business climate has deteriorated and key supply-side bottlenecks still
constrain economic development.
Scale up social protection programs. Progress was made in: (i) increasing primary school
enrollment including gender parity; (ii) improving access to potable water; and (iii) declining infant
mortality rates.

Global Risks
A surge in global
financial volatility and
decompression of
credit spreads
following slow growth
as well as protracted
policy uncertainty in
Euro area.

High

Weak demand in key
advanced economies.

High

Increased volatility of
energy price due to
uncertainty about the
oil supply shock.

Medium

Low
Increased financial volatility could
cause foreign investors to become
more risk averse and reduce financial
flows, which could contribute to the
depreciation of the currency, elevate
inflationary pressures and
undermine growth prospects.
Medium
Weakness in external demand could
dampen Malawi’s exports and
contribute to lower real GDP growth.
Medium
The associated price fluctuation
could add to existing
macroeconomic uncertainties.

Keep fiscal discipline and make
monetary policy consistent
with growth and inflation
objectives, maintain adequate
foreign reserves and smooth
short term exchange rate
volatility.
Adopt policies to increase
fiscal space to respond to
contingences.
Tighten monetary policy to
send a clear signal to market
participants, and use the
automatic price adjustment
mechanism to smooth
excessive price movement and
ensure adequate fuel supplies.

Regional and Domestic Risks
Expansionary fiscal
policy.

Delay in PFM reform.

High

High
An unduly high fiscal deficit increase
domestic borrowing crowd out the
private sector and likely lead to the
reemergence of payment arrears.

Medium

High
Progress of PFM reform has been
uneven, which undermines donor’s
confidence in budgetary processes.

Deficiencies in the

Medium

Financial Stability.

Medium

High
Conflicting signals by the RBM could
cause market participants lose
confidence in the RBM’s
commitment to fight inflation.
Medium
The high level of non-performing
loans and high concentration risk
could ultimately undermine financial
sector stability.

Adopt corrective measures to
contain spending, exert better
commitment control and
increase revenue mobilization.
Accelerate the implementation
of PFM reforms and regularly
communicate progress to
donors.
Improve the communication of
monetary policy and adopt a
clear and effective monetary
operational framework.
Strengthen banking
supervision and inspection to
contain emerging risks by
developing early warning
systems.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline scenario path, which is most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff. The Relative Likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline scenario.

The policy response suggested by IMF staff assumes all other things unchanged. For a combination of shocks, policy responses would
need to be modified to avoid conflicts.

Annex III. External Stability Assessment
This annex evaluates the external competitiveness, possible misalignments of the exchange rate, and
the adequacy of external reserves. Standard exchange rate assessment methods point to the kwacha
being roughly in line with fundamentals in 2014. However non-price indicators suggest there is
scope to improve Malawi’s external sector competitiveness. An assessment of reserve adequacy
suggests a range of 3–6 months of import cover for precautionary motives, given high volatility of
external aid flows and the terms of trade.

A.

External Competitiveness and Exchange Rate Assessment

Malawi’s high external current account deficit reflects structural factors. Ongoing economic
development requires large investment-related imports, which alongside a narrow export base lead
to a structurally high deficit. The deficit also reflects the high growth rate of the population.
The deficit is mostly financed by foreign direct investment, public sector loans and aid flows
(although direct budget support has been volatile and has declined substantially in recent years).
Malawi lags behind its trading partners in productivity growth (Annex Figure 1).
Despite strong productivity during 2005–11, adverse external and internal economic shocks in 2012
and 2013 jointly dragged Malawi’s productivity back to its 2006 level. Relative productivity,
measured by the ratio of per-capita GDP of Malawi to the average of its trading partners, has
worsened in recent years.

Malawi’s exports are highly concentrated in agricultural commodities (Annex Figure 2).
The top three products account for about two-thirds of total exports. In 2013, exports of tobacco,
sugar, and tea yielded US$ 763 million (18 percent of GDP) while exports of manufactured goods
were only US$ 55 million (1.3 percent of GDP).

Notes:
1, The index of Sophistication of Exports, EXPY, is a measure for the level of technological sophistication
embodied in a country’s export portfolio. The larger the value is, the more sophisticated the export goods are.

Malawi has lagged behind SSA LICs in terms of export diversification and quality in recent
years (Annex Figure 3). Regarding product diversification, the normalized Theil index illustrates
that Malawi’ export goods are persistently less diversified than those of SSA LICs and have not
demonstrated a sustained improvement. For country diversification, Malawi appears to show similar
trends. Little progress has been made on trade diversification based on the extensive margin.1 This is
confirmed by the Hummels-Klenow index, although the number of trading partners of Malawi has
increased. Similar results were found for export quality (EXPY), which suggests that Malawi is at the
low end of the distribution of export sophistication of SSA LICs (highlighted by the green area).

The extensive margin refers to the degree of product diversification and trading partner diversification.

Estimates indicate the real exchange rate was roughly in line with fundamentals by the end of
2014 (Annex Figures 4 and 5).2 Malawi’s current account norm is estimated at a deficit of 10.7 percent of GDP for 2014. The actual current account was slightly below 10 percent of GDP and
the gap implies a very slight undervaluation of about 2 percent. Although controls for low income
countries have been applied, Malawi’s relatively low position within SSA means predictions from
such regression may have to be nuanced by Malawi’s particular conditions. Indeed, an approach
based on direct estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate (based on a commodity price
movement regression, “the commodity currency approach”) suggests the Kwacha was roughly in
equilibrium by 2014.3

Current account balance calculations are based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology
(IMF Working Paper, WP/13/272), and employ elasticities for the current account in the range of -0.47,-0.20 of the
current account balance to the exchange rate (IMF Working Paper, WP/10/180). Similar results are obtained through
alternative standard methods for exchange rate assessment.

Nonetheless, the high current account deficit warrants adjustment over the medium to long
term. The weak performance of exports is a matter of concern that needs to be addressed over the
medium term through structural transformation to increase economic productivity and
competitiveness, and improve the quality of domestic production to partly substitute imports.
Volatile capital account flows are also a concern that needs to be addressed as the country develops
and becomes less dependent on external aid flows, which have proven to be highly volatile.

Non-Price Indicators

Malawi’s business environment has been deteriorating in recent years (Annex Figure 7) In the
2015–16 Global Competitive Index (GCI) report, Malawi ranks 135th of 140 surveyed countries in
2015, a slight fall, and still behind the average level of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The World Bank’s
doing business indicators suggest a similar trend. The five major competitive constraints5 are access
to financing, corruption, crime and theft, tax rates, and inflation.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) with respect to the
2012 ECF arrangement was completed on December 27, 2012. The assessment reiterated the key
safeguards concern – the lack of operational autonomy - and recommended that already envisaged
amendments to the RBM Act to limit lending to government be expanded to strengthen RBM
autonomy more broadly. The assessment also reiterated the need to enhance oversight of foreign
reserves management along with measures to strengthen transparency of financial reporting.

Exchange Arrangements:
In May 2012, the government liberalized the foreign exchange regime, devalued the kwacha by
about 33 percent, and adopted a floating exchange rate regime. Since May 2012, the RBM has not
set a target rate and allowed substantial volatility in the exchange rate, including recent depreciation
to around MK 555 per U.S. dollar at end-September 2015. Official actions continue to play a role in
influencing the exchange rate, but the exchange rate movements are largely market determined and
staff found that the authorities’ practice of determining the exchange rate of commercial banks
through moral suasion has ceased, thereby removing the official action that gave rise to the multiple
currency practice identified in August 2006 and manifested by the significant spread between the
commercial bank and foreign exchange bureau rates. Malawi maintains a system free from
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV Consultation:
Malawi is on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the last
Article IV consultation with Malawi on July 23, 2012. The Article IV was delayed due to the program
going off track in the wake of the “cashgate” scandal involving the large scale theft of public funds
that came to light in October 2013.

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), Reports on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSCs), and Offshore Financial Center (OFC) Assessments:
A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund visited Malawi under the FSAP
program during two missions in July and December 2007. The Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was issued in June 2008 (SM/08/198).
Corporate Governance and Accounting and Auditing ROSC missions visited Malawi in February and
June 2007.
An update on the FAD mission on the fiscal transparency module was issued in March 2007. A ROSC
on the data module, based on a September 2003 mission, was published in October, 2004.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of September, 2015)
AfDB operations in Malawi date back to 1969. The Malawi Field Office was opened in 2007. As at
30th September, 2015, the Bank had provided significant and diversified support to Malawi, with
cumulative commitments worth UA 873.7 million (about US$ 1.2 billion) to finance 102 operations
including 12 studies and 2 lines of credit.
The AfDB Board of Directors on 30th January 2013 approved a new Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for
Malawi covering 2013–17. The Bank’s current CSP is fully aligned to the second Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS II) covering the period 2011–16, the Bank’s corporate priorities in the
Long Term Strategy (LTS, 2013–22) and the Regional Integration Strategy Paper for Southern Africa
(Southern African RISP, 2011–15). The CSP, currently under implementation, focuses on two pillars:
(i) addressing infrastructure bottlenecks to competitiveness and growth; and (ii) supporting actions
to expand private sector investment and trade. To ease challenges posed by Malawi’s landlocked
position and enhance competitiveness, the Bank has scaled-up support to regional infrastructure to
deepen the country’s integration with its neighbors. In 2014, the Bank approved the Nacala Road
Corridor Phase IV Project while other regional infrastructure projects are in the pipeline, including
the Malawi-Mozambique Power Inter-connector Project. The Bank will also support Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development. The CSP mid- term review was undertaken in
2015 and the strategic priorities have been maintained.
The Bank has deepened its support for PFM Reforms and capacity building in coordination with
other Development Partners. In September, 2015, the Bank approved a grant of US $ 2.61 million for
Phase II of the on-going PFM Institutional Support (ISP). ISP II is providing support for two
components: (i) enhancing transparency, control and compliance in the area of procurement and;
(ii) strengthening capacity in revenue administration. This was in addition to the US$ 4.2 million
approved in 2013 for the PFMISP I.
The Bank has also provided Malawi with quick disbursing budget support. Following Governments
reengagement with the IMF and the approval of a new US$ 157 million Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement for Malawi in July 2012, the Bank approved a new ADF Grant for the Crisis Response
Budget Support operation for Malawi in July 2012, in the amount of UA 26 million (US$ 36 million).
The Bank designed the Restoration of Fiscal Stability and Social Protection (RFSSP) program whose
objective was to contribute to restoring fiscal stability and enhancing public finance management in
Malawi, as well as support social protection measures to mitigate the adverse social impact of the
devaluation of the Kwacha and the increases in fuel and electricity prices. In order to support this
agenda, the RFSSP had two components: (i) strengthened PFM transparency and accountability, and
(ii) strengthened social protection system. The Bank disbursed UA 4 million (US$ 5.6 million) as
additional budgetary support in June 2013. In April, 2015, the Bank approved a grant of
US $ 30 million for the Protection of Basic Services Programme. This is a ring fenced Sector Budget
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

Support programme, which is designed to protect critical expenditures in health, education and
social protection and improve accountability following suspension of general budget support.
The grant was disbursed in one tranche in July, 2015.
Box. AfDB Ongoing Operations
The Bank’s ongoing operations comprise the following: two projects in the agriculture sector:
(i) Agriculture Infrastructure Support Project (AISP); and (ii) Climate Adaptation for Rural Livelihoods
and Agriculture Project (grant from Global Environment Facility). There are currently three projects
providing support to the social sector and for economic empowerment: (i) the Local Economic
Development project is developing infrastructure in four rural growth centers of Jenda, Malomo,
Monkey Bay and Chitekesa; (ii) the Competitiveness and Job Creation Project in Private sector which
aims to improve the capabilities and the competitiveness of the private sector as well as increase
export diversification and job creation ; and (iii) Support to Higher Education Science & Technology
Project aims to increase access to technical, entrepreneurship, vocational and training (TEVET) and
higher education in Malawi, with particular emphasis on Information and Communication Technology
(ICT). In the transport sector the Bank is providing support for the Mzuzu-Nkhata Bay Road
Rehabilitation Project and the Multinational Nacala Road Corridor Phase IV. As at 30th September 2015,
the overall Bank portfolio was rated satisfactory with an average disbursement rate of 30%. In the
water sector, the Bank is providing support for the Sustainable Rural Water and Sanitation for
Improved Health and Livelihood Project to improve access to water. In line with the CSP program, the
Bank approved three new operations in 2015; the Protection of Basic Services Programme
(US $ 30 million), the Public Financial Management Institutional Support II (US $ 2.61 million) and the
Mzimba Urban Water Integrated Project (US$ 5.0 million). The latter project is co-financed with OPEC
Fund for International Development.

The Bank has also provided support for non-lending activities, including feasibility studies and
analytic work to inform the design of new operations and policy dialogue. In 2013, the Bank
collaborated with the World Bank and other partners on the Public Expenditure Review. The Bank
has in addition provided support for the Public Expenditure Tracking Study in collaboration with
other DPs. In addition, the Bank is supporting the Private Public Partnership Commission (PPPC) with
a grant to implement the Capacity Building and Assessment of the Legislative and Institutional
Framework for PPPs in Malawi. The Bank also undertook the Domestic Resource Mobilization Study
for Malawi in 2013/2014 and provided TA to the Reserve Bank of Malawi to strengthen capacity in
macro-economic forecasting.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
MALAWI—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of November 2, 2015

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but it is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: STA is providing technical assistance (TA) to the National Statistics Office (NSO) on
strengthening the quality of national accounts statistics. The NSO has revised the national accounts
methodology to improve the consistency with the 2008 SNA and develop preliminary quarterly estimates
of GDP by economic activity. Further TA is being provided to develop quarterly GDP estimates by
expenditure components. Main operational challenges are the NSO’s continuing budget constraints, the
lack of funds to implement the requisite data collections, and low staffing levels in the national accounts
unit.
Price Statistics: An updated and revised consumer price index (CPI) was introduced in January 2013.
The weight reference period is 2010–11 (based on expenditure data collected from the 2010–11
integrated household survey), and an index reference period of 2012 (2012=100). In addition to new
weights and items, the updated CPI reflects improved index calculation methods, the implementation of
the internationally recommended Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), and
improved compilation methods. In April 2013, an updated PPI for manufacturing was released. The new
PPI reflects updated weights. There remains a need to expand the coverage of the PPI to include
additional economic activities. The NSO is in process of developing export-import price indexes.
Government Finance Statistics: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by source data
weaknesses. A key shortcoming in this area is the inadequate system of recording source data. In
addition, there are serious quality problems, including data inconsistencies, that complicate program
monitoring:



Due primarily to differences in coverage, published data for the budgetary central government
include a sizeable statistical discrepancy between above and below the line data. The coverage of
government for above the line data is considerably narrower than the information on financing
reported by RBM.



While tax revenue data are received in a timely fashion, it is not always possible to reconcile them
with deposits in the Malawi Government (MG) Account. This is a result of the way taxes are reported,
and timing differences between receipt of taxes and cleared funds being available for the
government. The finances and operations of the Malawi Revenue Authority are also unusually
opaque.



Nontax revenue, including capital revenues collected by line ministries, is not properly accounted for
in the fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAWI

The authorities have received significant technical assistance from the Fund and other donors to
strengthen expenditure monitoring and reporting, accounting, and statistical reporting, but results have
lagged. The government has pledged to strengthen public financial management and fiscal reporting,
and renewed efforts are being made to establish a work plan, including utilizing donor technical
assistance more effectively. The authorities are currently working with East AFRITAC to modify the chart
of accounts and output-based structures so that they could more easily be realigned to the national
strategy and be more readily understood.
Government finance data for the Budgetary Central Government in a GFSM 2001 presentation are
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and International Financial
Statistics (IFS). However these data are not disseminated domestically. An August 2005 and August 2007
STA mission that visited Lilongwe reiterated the importance of continued efforts to implement the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), and encouraged the authorities to improve
the coverage and sectorization of government financial operations and to correctly classify transactions
according to international guidelines. The last mission proposed, and discussed with the authorities, a
migration plan and timetable to adopt the GFSM 2001 methodology.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Despite recent improvements, monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
continue to have shortcomings. These includes irregular reporting to STA, lack of proper legislation to
grant the authority to the RBM to require reporting from other institutions1; the sectorization of the
domestic economy, and classification of financial instruments to ensure that the RBM adheres fully to the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010 STA
missions made a number of recommendations for addressing the above shortcomings. In addition to the
above tasks, the 2008, 2009, and 2010 STA missions assisted RBM staff in developing the standardized
report forms (SRFs) for the central bank accounts (1SR), other depository corporations (2SR), and
monetary aggregates (5SR).
The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) reports monetary data on a regular basis, with monthly data
disseminated through the IFS. The RBM recently revamped ODCs’ call report templates to ensure their
consistency with the methodology outlined in the MFS Manual. Despite these improvements, progress
toward full adoption of the SRF-based monetary statistics is hindered by the quality of the underlying
source data for ODCs, where ODCs’ balance sheets and their supporting data schedules do not always
match.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Malawi does not report FSIs to STA.
External sector statistics: The external sector statistics in Malawi exhibit some deficiencies. Concepts
and definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with the
guidelines presented in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The National
Statistical Office of Malawi (NSO) should now adopt the BPM6 methodology, on the basis of which the

1

Some legislation that is designed to address this issue has recently been approved.

13

MALAWI

Malawi balance of payments metadata should also be updated. The NSO balance of payments section
remains critically understaffed, as it has been since March 2008. Moreover, important data sources for
balance of payments compilation ceased to be available during 2006–07, for example exchange control
forms, which could supply information on imports of goods, services, and current transfers. Procedures
for assessing the accuracy of trade data need to be improved.
The NSO compiles balance of payments based on BOP survey, ITRS, and exchange control record as
primary sources of data. The NSO also compiles information from other important sources as well,
namely: a) the Foreign Private Capital and Investor Perception Survey, b) monetary statistics from the
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), c) other financial data provided by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), and d)
data from international organizations However, much remains to be done to improve the quality,
coverage, and timelines of the balance of payments statistics. Data on foreign direct investment and
portfolio flows remains weak. Project aid is currently classified as current transfers rather than in the
capital account, and several large in-kind projects are not captured in the balance of payments data
properly. To this end, the NSO is a recipient of substantial amounts of technical assistance from the Fund
and other organization. External support should be underpinned by providing adequate staffing and
budget resources to the NSO.
Due to capacity constraints and weak source data, the International Investment Position (IIP) is not being
compiled. Capacity building programs, including Fund-provided training and technical assistance, seek to
overcome these constraints to allow the compilation of the IIP in future. The RBM and Ministry of
Finance’s Debt and Aid Department need to improve reporting of monetary and external debt data
respectively.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Malawi is participating in the GDDS/PRSP and the
monetary and financial statistics modules of the
project. GDDS metadata have been posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since February 2007.

Data ROSC was published on February 17, 2005.

III. Reporting to STA
The authorities report the following datasets to STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics
(IFS): Monetary and financial statistics, balance of payments and international investment position
statistics, and government finance statistics; however timeliness is irregular.

Statement by Mr. Mkwezalamba, Alternate Executive Director for Malawi,
and Mr. Sitima-wina, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director for Malawi,
December 11, 2015

1.
We thank staff for the constructive engagement with the Malawian authorities during
the recent Article IV consultations. My authorities find the report to be a fair representation
of what was discussed and therefore broadly concur with the staff assessment and
conclusions.
2.
My authorities appreciate the fact that the staff report takes into account a series of
adverse shocks that hit the Malawi economy, heavily impacting on policy implementation,
and rendering the attainment of its national development objectives, articulated in the second
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II), increasingly challenging.
This notwithstanding, considerable progress has been made in improving social indicators in
health and education. My authorities remain committed to achieve macroeconomic stability,
reduce poverty, and attain sustainable and inclusive growth.
Recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook and policies
3.
In early 2015, while fiscally adjusting to the loss of public resources through theft,
which led to the suspension of donor budget support, the economy was hit by an unusual
combination of heavy floods followed by drought. This resulted in an overall decline in
agricultural output, with maize harvest declining by about 30 percent. The decline put an
estimated 2.8 million persons from 25 of the 28 districts in the country at the risk of food
insecurity. A response in terms of food distribution started in August this year in districts that
were affected by floods and in October, again this year, for the ones affected by drought.
The response is expected to continue till March 2016. The floods also disrupted energy
generation and damaged some roads. Consequently, real GDP growth has been revised
downwards to 3 percent from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent.
4.
Inflation has remained above 20 percent since June 2015. However, an upward trend
set in much quicker in the year, driven by rising food prices on account of the decline in
maize output and depreciation of the Malawi kwacha. Thus, year-on-year inflation reached
24.7 percent in October 2015, from 22.2 percent in July 2015.
5.
Growth in 2016 is estimated at 4.5 percent. This assumes normal weather conditions
as the forecasted “El Niño” phenomenon could seriously affect agricultural production.
Besides agriculture, other sectors driving growth include construction, distribution, and the
wholesale and retail sectors. In the medium term, growth is expected to pick up to about
6 percent while the external current account deficit is projected to be stable at around
8 percent. Resumption of uranium production in the medium term is expected to boost
growth further. Inflation is projected to moderate in 2016, supported in part by tight fiscal
and monetary policy stance.

2
Fiscal and public financial management
6.
Fiscal adjustment has been challenging due to, in part, the need to address the food
security situation to complement the humanitarian assistance received from the international
community, and the need to recruit teachers and doctors. This recruitment and the granting of
a higher than budgeted for general salary increase, to avoid continued disruptions of public
services following industrial actions, led to overspending on the wage bill. As a result, the
authorities implemented corrective measures, including expenditure cuts, in the first half of
the 2015–16 fiscal year to partly offset the slippages. My authorities are committed to
restoring macroeconomic stability and to take the necessary fiscal measures. In this
connection, further expenditure cuts have been effected and will be tabled in Parliament
during the Mid-Term Budget Review Session to be held in February 2016. The cuts have
affected domestically financed investment and goods and services and preclude any increases
to net domestic financing and emergence of domestic payment arrears. These have been
carefully effected to safeguard allocations to social spending and consolidate the positive
progress achieved this far.
7.
In addition, a comprehensive payroll audit, which is expected to result in elimination
of ghost workers, is currently underway. The authorities have, in the meantime,
communicated measures to strengthen payroll management, and payment of salaries is now
contingent upon submission of the required documentation, including Staff Returns. They are
confident that these measures are sufficient to meet the end-December 2015 ECF program
targets and to complement monetary policy actions in reducing inflation.
8.
My authorities would like to highlight some progress that has been achieved in public
finance management reforms (PFM), including: rationalization of government bank accounts
at the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM); incorporation of main government bank accounts
into IFMIS; and development of a more comprehensive strategy for resolving the problem of
bank reconciliations. Most of the backlog in bank reconciliations will be processed by private
accountants and auditors hired by the Auditor General, and verified by the Accountant
General’s Department (AGD). The AGD is closely monitoring reconciliations for the current
financial year and submissions from the MDAs have significantly improved.
A multi-stakeholder technical committee is in place to monitor progress while Controlling
Officers have now explicitly been charged with improving financial discipline within
spending units; and independent audit committees, responsible for reviewing audit matters
presented by internal and external auditors, have been established. Furthermore, with effect
from January 2016, monthly funding to MDAs will be contingent upon their submission of
(a) Expenditure Returns; (b) Revenue Returns; (c) Commitment Returns; (d) Bank
Reconciliation returns; and (e) Staff Returns. These requirements are within the provisions of
the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA).
Monetary and exchange rate policies
9.
The RBM is committed to continue using policy instruments at its disposal to
stabilize monetary conditions. In November 2015, it raised the policy rate by 200 basis points
to 27 percent in a move to tame inflation. With respect to the monetary policy architecture,

3
the RBM submits that aligning the policy rate with Treasury bill rates is not a daily
operational objective, given the oligopolistic structure of the interbank market. The fiscal
costs of aligning the interbank rate with the policy rate outweigh the monetary policy benefits
and cannot, at the moment, be justified as a daily operational objective.
10.
The exchange rate against the United States dollar weakened from end-June 2015 and
temporarily stabilized at the beginning of September 2015, but continues to weaken.
These developments, in part, reflect the strengthening of the dollar against most major
currencies and excess demand for foreign exchange to finance imports. As communicated
during consultations, my authorities agree with the assessment on the exchange rate valuation
and reiterate their commitment to maintaining exchange rate flexibility, with interventions
being limited to smoothening market volatility.
Financial sector
11.
In January 2014, Malawi migrated to Basel II standards to strengthen financial sector
stability. Banks that could not meet the new capital requirements had to augment their
capital. In the process, two weak banks with significant state-shareholding were sold and are
being recapitalized. The revision of the RBM Act further strengthened the monetary policy
framework. In addition, the RBM took steps to strengthen the soundness of the financial
sector, including the introduction of new provisioning directives to address low provisioning
rates on NPLs, which have since decreased from 16 percent of total loans and advances in
June 2014 to 14 percent in June 2015. Overall, the banking sector remains well capitalized,
profitable and liquid.
12.
Recent stress tests, however, confirmed that credit risk stemming from high exposure
to large borrowers poses a significant threat to the banking system. As noted in the report, my
authorities recognize that credit risk and particularly concentration risk from exposure to
large borrowers remain the largest threat to financial sector stability. It should be noted that
the concentration risk will remain a feature of the financial system for some time, given the
role of large conglomerates in the economy and limited access to both long-term external and
domestic financing. The RBM is committed to continued stress testing, enhancing
supervision, and enforcing compliance with prudential norms. In addition, they are pursuing
efforts to further deepen the financial sector and foster financial inclusion.
Structural Reforms
13.
A critical structural issue to support economic activity in the country is the reliability
of fuel supply in all parts of the country. Therefore, with the key objective of guaranteeing
security of supply of fuel in the country, my authorities have approved a set of reforms
pertaining to liquid fuels and gas within the energy sector. These include (i) allowing the
state-owned National Oil Company of Malawi (NOCMA) to participate in the importation of
petroleum; (ii) introduction of the dry port concept for running the strategic fuel reserves,
with an added advantage of easing tax collection; and (iii) introduction of the fuel bulk
procurement system for the country which is expected to lower procurement prices through
economies of scale. The automatic fuel pricing mechanism will continue.

4
14.
In a bid to diversify agricultural exports, the government with private sector
partnership is investing in commercial agriculture through the Greenbelt Initiative to produce
sugar, ethanol and rice, which will also involve the participation of small scale commercial
farmers. Another upcoming investment along the same concept is the Shire Valley Irrigation
Project. It is expected that these projects will go a long way to reduce poverty and boost
export volumes. Within this sector, the Farm Inputs Subsidy Program (FISP) will also be
reformed to enhance efficiency of expenditure without compromising food security.
Consultations with staff and other key stakeholders are underway to explore options that are
expected to create fiscal space for other investments.
15.
The importance of improving the business environment cannot be overemphasized
and efforts in that respect continue, particularly in improving energy and transport
infrastructure. A milestone reform has been the establishment of a one stop investment
window at the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC).
Conclusion
16.
My authorities reiterate their commitment to restoring macroeconomic stability,
reducing poverty and attaining sustainable and inclusive growth. In this regard, they will
implement tight fiscal and monetary policies needed to place inflation on a downward
declining trajectory; and continue with structural reforms, including improving the business
environment. They also commit to accelerate the pace of the PFM reforms. The broad public
sector reforms to bring efficiency and improve public service delivery are also on going.
In line with the MGDS priorities, the authorities will pursue infrastructure investments in
energy, transport, water, tourism, agriculture and also press on with efforts in export
diversification. Investments in social infrastructure and provision of related service are also
key priorities for the government.
