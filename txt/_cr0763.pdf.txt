• Previous Article IV consultation: The authorities and the Fund have generally agreed
on broad policy priorities. The last Article IV Consultation concluded on
February 6, 2006, and the staff report was published as IMF Country Report No. 06/55.
The Fund emphasized that macroeconomic policies should remain vigilant in view of
upside risks to inflation and that accelerating structural reforms would bolster mediumterm growth prospects. During 2006, India has tightened monetary policy and reduced
the fiscal deficit. Steps were also taken to deepen financial markets, raise limits on FDI,
and increase private investment in infrastructure. However, oil pass-through has
remained partial, while progress on subsidy reforms, liberalization of labor laws, and
privatization has proven difficult.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

India’s performance remains impressive. The economy is in a fourth year of rapid
expansion, with growth ranging around 8 percent and becoming more broad-based.
Inflation is contained. Credit and asset markets are booming, partly reflecting
financial deepening. Economic activity and financial markets have been resilient
despite volatile oil prices, slowing U.S. growth, and tightening global liquidity.

•

In this environment, the main policy challenges are maintaining price and
financial stability, while advancing fiscal and structural reform:
o Demand pressures are building, raising the risk of higher inflation down the road.
The central bank’s stance of continued gradual removal of monetary
accommodation is appropriate and going forward would provide insurance against
a possible inflation overshoot.
o Rapid credit growth may pressure asset quality. Vigilant supervision, improved
risk management and further tightening of prudential standards would provide
early warning of any emergent vulnerabilities.
o Broader and deeper financial markets would support economic and financial
stability over the medium term. Continued steps to promote more liquid
government securities markets, broaden the investor base, and foster corporate
debt and derivatives markets would be useful.
o Public debt, while declining relative to GDP, is high. Measures are needed to
achieve the center’s medium term targets, and fiscal space is needed for priority
social spending. Steps are warranted on both revenue and expenditure sides,
including broadening the tax base and reforming subsidies. Better targeting the
tax incentives for SEZs would reduce the risk of an erosion of the tax base.
Overperforming on the 2006/07 budget would also help contain overheating
pressures.
o Despite fast growth, job creation in the organized (formal) sector is lackluster,
and poverty remains widespread. Steps are needed to enhance infrastructure and
further liberalize the trade regime.

•

Decisive progress on these fronts would further boost sustainable growth and
reduce poverty over the medium term, consistent with the authorities’
objectives. The strong conjuncture provides a favorable environment to accelerate
the government’s reform program to achieve this outcome.

integration into the global economy.

3.
Looking to the medium term, prospects are good for a sustained and robust
expansion if reform momentum is maintained. India appears to be in the beginning phase
of a long-run takeoff that began in the mid-1990s on the heels of structural reforms. Going
forward, the coming sharp rise in working-age population will support growth. Continued
growth at staff’s estimated trend (7.5 percent annually) would double per capita real income
in 13 years, and faster growth could be achievable under decisive reforms. However,
sustained reforms and job creation would be needed to take full advantage of the
demographic dividend and attain India’s full potential to improve living standards.

6
4.
Building consensus for these reforms will remain challenging, reflecting the need
to forge consensus among multiple and diverse coalition partners, as well as between the
center and states.1 In this context, progress on reforms is likely to remain steady and gradual,
with issues such as labor market reform, privatization, and reducing public ownership of
banks difficult.
5.
Against this backdrop, the 2006 Article IV consultation focused on the four main
policy challenges facing India, which are also priorities in the government’s agenda.
They are: achieving fiscal sustainability while financing development; managing price and
financial stability; fostering a deeper and broader financial sector; and promoting more
job-intensive, inclusive growth. In discussing policies for inclusive growth, as many
structural issues are long standing and well covered in prior consultations, this consultation
focused on issues in the policy debate that are most macro relevant—special economic zones,
infrastructure, and trade.
II. ECONOMIC BACKDROP

Strong capital inflows comfortably financed the current account deficit. Inflows
remain dominated by portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings (ECBs, which
remain subject to capital controls), particularly convertible bonds. Foreign institutional

continues to cautiously raise limits on
external commercial borrowings (by $250 million to $750 million) and recently doubled the
amount banks can extend in credit to joint ventures abroad to 20 percent of banks’ capital.

The regulatory regime for FDI has been gradually liberalized since 1991, and is no longer particularly
restrictive by international standards.

Box 1. India: Rangarajan Committee on Pricing and
Taxation of Petroleum Products
The Rangarajan report submitted in February 2006 made several major recommendations.
•

A new pricing mechanism for petrol and diesel whereby oil companies have the freedom to set
retail prices based on the trade parity price (a weighted average of the import parity and the
export parity prices in the ratio of 80:20),which would operate as an indicative ceiling price.

•

For petrol and diesel, reducing the customs duty from 10 percent to 7.5 percent; moving from
a combination of ad valorem and specific taxes to specific taxes; and implementing a uniform
sales tax.1/

•

Restricting kerosene subsidies to below-poverty-line families, using a single retail price and
passing subsidies through mechanisms such as debit cards, and financed through the budget.

•

Gradually eliminating the subsidy on LPG (a one-time increase in cooking gas followed by
further increases toward market level), which the Committee saw no merit in as it is used
mainly by above-poverty-line families.

If implemented, according to the report these measures would eliminate subsidies on petrol
and diesel, and reduce the subsidies on kerosene and LPG from 0.8 percent to 0.4 percent of
2005/06 GDP. The report also suggested that subsidies should be financed through specific taxes
with the remainder through the budget, rather than financed through under-recoveries of upstream
companies and the issuance of oil bonds.
Since the report was issued, the
government has reduced the
customs duty for petrol and
diesel. While the trade parity price
has been adopted, the automatic
pricing mechanism for petrol and
diesel has not become operational.
In addition, reforms on kerosene
and LPG subsidies have yet to be
implemented.

Box 2. India Goes Global—The Boom in Overseas Acquisitions
The emergence of globally-competitive private corporates in India has triggered an unusual
boom: its corporates have started to acquire foreign firms. Such acquisitions amounted to
$7.2 billion in the first three quarters of 2006,1/ then doubled in a single deal in October, when Tata
Steel announced it would be spending $8–9 billion to take over Corus, a U.K./Dutch steelmaker.
Such large acquisitions mark a coming of age for Indian companies. If sustained, they could also
rewrite the development textbook. For when Japan and Korea began their overseas investment
drives, their GDP per capita was ten times higher that that of India today. And although China and
Russia have begun expanding overseas at a much earlier stage of development, their GDP per capita
is still much higher than India’s. Equally striking, India’s outward FDI is exceptionally large relative
to its still-small inward FDI. So, what explains India’s sudden surge in acquisitions?
To begin with, Indian corporates have been taking over foreign firms, primarily in Europe
and the United States, to gain direct access to advanced markets and technology. In other
words, while other countries have imported technology through inward FDI, India is obtaining it
through acquisitions. One reason why Indian corporates have been able to do this is that their
business models are very similar to western ones, both in terms of framework and governance, and
they have managers who have been trained in western universities and speak English.
A second factor has to do with finance. After a decade of restructuring, the profitability of Indian
corporates is very high, while their leverage—unlike in East Asia—is quite low. Consequently,
international financial firms have been willing to help fund these acquisitions, especially given the
current benign global financial environment. In many cases, acquisitions have taken the form of
leveraged buy-outs, whereby a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is incorporated in the country of
acquisition, and then borrows against the cash flow and assets of the acquired company. This
mechanism not only allows the Indian company to take over foreign companies of much large scale,
but also leaves financial room for the parent company to make further acquisitions abroad and
expand domestically.
A third factor has to do with competitiveness. India’s shopping list belies the conventional
perception that India has a comparative advantage only in information technology and related
services. Initially, the overseas boom was indeed triggered by software companies, which wanted to
enlarge and diversify their customer base, establish an on-site presence for their clients, and move up
the value chain. But over the past few years, as manufacturing companies have also emerged as
internationally efficient and low-cost producers, they have also started to acquire foreign firms,
including in the textiles, auto parts, chemicals, and now steel sectors. Further, these acquisitions are
not confined to large corporates: smaller manufactures have now joined the race overseas, too.
Better information is needed to monitor and manage any attendant risks. Banks should be
aware of their clients’ worldwide financial exposures, including leverage taken on through overseas
financial activities. In addition, macroeconomic data on outward FDI can be improved, specifically
to include outflows financed through offshore vehicles.

The rupee has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar and its real effective value is
broadly around its 2004−2005 level. The rupee depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the
first half of 2006, against a backdrop of tightening global liquidity and a widening current
account deficit. In addition, the RBI intervened in the foreign exchange market, easing

gradually raised policy rates. The reverse
repo (borrowing) rate has risen 100 bps to 6 percent, while the repo (lending) rate has risen
125 bps to 7.25 percent (Table 4, Figure 3). High credit growth prompted the RBI to tighten
prudential standards, including by raising general provisioning requirements and boosting
risk weights in the high-growth areas, including real estate, to above Basel norms. Indicators
of financial soundness (while backward looking) suggest that banks’ balance sheets and
income remain healthy.

Financial markets continue to soar. Stock prices recovered smartly from the
May/June turbulence, reaching new historical highs on the back of strong foreign and
domestic purchases. PE ratios are now high relative to other countries and India’s recent past.
Meanwhile, real estate prices continue to grow at a rapid clip (Figure 4).

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The near term macroeconomic outlook is bright. Real GDP growth is expected to
ease to 8.2 percent in 2006/07, as growth moderates toward trend (Table 7). WPI inflation
would remain in the 5–5½ percent range. Robust domestic demand is expected to contribute
to a slight widening in the current account deficit (notwithstanding strong exports and
services), readily financed by capital inflows.
13.
The balance of near-term risks is to the upside. Reading inflationary pressures is
complicated by uncertainties about the extent to which credit and output buoyancy reflect
financial deepening and rising productivity, rather than overheating. That said, with GDP
continuing to grow above trend, increases in international oil prices not yet fully passed
through, credit and asset prices buoyant, and monetary conditions accommodative, the risk of
overheating cannot be ruled out. On the international front, a sharper U.S. slowdown with
potential spillovers to world growth could erode confidence in international financial
markets, triggering capital outflows and volatility in emerging markets.
14.
Several factors work to limit vulnerabilities. On the external side, reserves are
equivalent to over seven months of imports, while short-term external debt amounts to only
12 percent of reserves and overall external debt is 70 percent of exports (Tables 8 and 10).
The current account deficit, at 1½ percent of GDP, is manageable: external commercial
borrowing is subject to quantitative, term, and end-use restrictions, and the exchange rate is
flexible. Moreover, direct exposure to a global growth slowdown is modest in light of India’s
moderate level of trade openness and its diversified trading partners (a 1-percentage point
decline in U.S. growth would reduce India’s growth by about 0.1–0.2 percent in the short
run). On the domestic side, financial soundness indicators (while backward looking) are
favorable, and with asset holdings still modest, wealth effects from asset-price fluctuations

Oil bonds equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP were issued to state petroleum companies in 2005/06; a further
0.4 percent of GDP is planned for 2006/07, along with 0.4 percent of GDP in Food Corporation of India
(FCI) subsidy bonds.

are small. The fiscal debt and deficit are on a downward trajectory, helped by a favorable
interest/growth differential.6
IV. KEY POLICY CHALLENGES
15.

India faces four main policy challenges:

•

Achieving fiscal sustainability while financing development, by reducing high debt
and creating fiscal room to fund priority-spending needs.

•

Managing price and financial stability, by limiting the risk of overheating in demand
and further strengthening financial regulation.

•

Fostering a broader and deeper financial sector to expand the channels for saving,
investment and risk management.

•

Promoting more job-intensive, inclusive growth, through further structural reforms to
create an environment in which growth more fully benefits the least advantaged.

16.
The authorities are cognizant that much work needs to be done if they are to
realize their objective of raising growth to the 9–10 percent range. Discussions mainly
surrounded the implementation of the specific reforms that the authorities are considering in
each of these four key areas, and in particular their desirable modalities and pace. The
mission considered that the present conjuncture of strong growth provided a good
opportunity to accelerate the government’s reform agenda.
A. How Can India Best Achieve Fiscal Sustainability While Financing Development?
Background and Staff Views
17.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy has two main pillars: the Fiscal
Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) and the Twelfth Finance
Commission (TFC). The FRMBA targets a central government revenue (current) deficit of
zero and an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2008/09. The TFC offers states debt relief
and other incentives to adopt and implement fiscal responsibility laws (FRLs).7 With this
framework, the government aims to eliminate the general government revenue deficit and
reduce the general government overall deficit to 6 percent of GDP by 2008/09, which would

The decline would be more gradual if the differential returned to its historical average; see Appendix I.

All but five states enacted FRLs and nine states subsequently received TFC debt relief. Box 3 in IMF Country
Report No. 06/55 describes the TFC.

place India’s debt ratio firmly on a downward trajectory (Appendix I). However, within this
framework, room also needs to be made for priority social spending; the Approach Paper for
India’s 11th Plan estimates that such spending needs to rise by 2½ percent of GDP by 2011.
Meeting FRBM and TFC targets would speed up the medium-term decline in the debt/GDP
ratio, and would be a good step toward longer-term debt reduction. Medium-term
consolidation would also facilitate faster progress in financial sector reform and capital
account liberalization.
18.
Consolidation under the FRBMA has resumed. The 2006/07 central and state
government budgets imply a 1 percent of GDP cut in the general government deficit, with
adjustment at the center in line with FRBMA rules.8 This would bring the cumulative decline
in the general government deficit since the 2003/04 enactment of the FRBMA to 2¾ percent
of GDP, with a fall in debt/GDP of around 5 percentage points of GDP.
19.
However, according to staff estimates, reaching the government’s medium term
targets will require further efforts at both the central and state levels.
•

Achieving the center’s FRBMA target of current balance in FY2008/09 will require
additional measures. While revenue buoyancy and planned expenditure restraint will
help to narrow the deficit, measures equivalent to 0.8 percentage points of GDP will
be needed (beyond the current-policies baseline) (see Appendix I).

•

In aggregate, states are well placed to meet medium-term adjustment targets, but the
task will be more difficult for some states. Already in 2006/07, the consolidated state
budget deficit targets (overall and current) are broadly in line with the TFC’s 2008/09
targets and achievable. But 13 of the 28 states failed to reduce their deficits from
previous-year levels in 2005/06, as the TFC requires. Of these, 11 states, accounting
for about a quarter of the aggregate states’ deficit, had deficits that were more than
1 percentage point of state GDP above the 3 percent medium-term TFC target.

20.
The favorable near-term outlook provides an ideal opportunity to accelerate
fiscal reform and make progress toward medium-term consolidation.
•

8

Central government revenues are poised to overperform in 2006/07. Stronger-thanexpected GDP growth is boosting revenues, and expenditure remains contained.
Accordingly, staff projects that the budget could overperform by 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2006/07 if the tax windfall is saved. This stance would also help to contain any
demand pressures.

Except where specified, cited figures correspond to the authorities’ definitions of the deficit, which exclude
off-budget issuance of subsidy bonds that have partly offset budgetary adjustment.

14
•

Looking to the medium term, comprehensive revenue and spending reforms could
achieve FRBMA targets while creating resources for priory spending. Broadening the
tax base, by removing corporate income tax (CIT) and excise duty exemptions, could
boost revenues by up to 1½ percent of GDP.9 Eliminating non-essential subsidies,
and better targeting food, oil, and fertilizer subsidies, could save up to 2¼ percent of
GDP.10 A more flexible, market-based pricing mechanism for petroleum products
would also limit fiscal risks if oil prices rebounded (as well as improve incentives to
conserve consumption and expand productive capacity). Subsidy reforms should be
promptly acted on, and would complement ongoing efforts to improve spending
efficiency, which include output-based budgeting and improved service delivery.

•

Tighter borrowing ceilings could reinforce states’ adjustment efforts. States’ annual
borrowing ceilings could be brought in line with adjustments targeted under their
FRLs. This would require reducing states’ dependence on National Small Savings
Funds (NSSF) in favor of market borrowings subject to a borrowing cap.11 Such a
strategy would, however, require comprehensive NSSF reform (as recommended by
the Reddy and Mohan Committees), including linking deposit rates to market rates
and scaling back tax exemptions.

•

Care is needed to limit the risks of the forthcoming review of civil service pay. The
Sixth Pay Commission (SPC) will update the center’s pay structure with a view to
implementation in 2008/09. (States generally follow Pay Commission
recommendations.) The previous pay review contributed to the deterioration in state
finances in the late 1990s.12

Authorities’ Plans and Views
21.
The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to the FRBMA. They saw
scope to overperform on the 2006/07 budget but acknowledged that reaching the 2008/09
current deficit target would be a challenge. However, with resolute actions on both revenue
and spending they were confident that they would meet FRMBA targets. Their strategy for
medium-term adjustment focused on strengthening tax administration, working toward a

These steps were recommended by the 2004 Kelkar Report on Tax Reform. Savings estimates are based
on 2004/05 tax expenditure estimates published in the budget.

10

See The Central Government Subsidies Report (2004).

11

The government-run NSSF is administered via 154,000 post offices and over 8,000 public sector bank
branches. For retail savers it offers a risk-free, tax-exempt, above-market interest rate. NSSF deposits are a
captive source of finance for states, which are required to borrow 100 percent of net collections in their state.

The Fifth Pay Commission resulted in a 0.9 percent of GDP increase in state employee compensation and a
0.5 percent of GDP increase in central wage and pension payments.

national Goods and Service Tax (GST), improving expenditure management, and reforming
subsidies.
•

On tax administration, recent and ongoing steps included introducing a large taxpayer
unit, increasing use of electronic filing, and better-targeted audits. Favorable growth
would keep direct tax and overall tax revenue buoyancy at current levels. Progress
toward introducing a GST hinged on negotiations with states on revenue-sharing
arrangements surrounding the phase out of the interstate tax.

•

On expenditure management, the government planned to focus on priority rural and
social programs. The growth in spending on these programs was expected to taper off
now that they have been launched. For example, the National Rural Employment
Guarantee program was introduced this year on a pilot basis in the poorest regions,
before being expanded to all districts over the next two years. Going forward,
strengthening implementation capacity and service delivery was seen as key, as a fast
pace of spending may not result in intended outcomes. More generally, resources for
social and infrastructure priorities remain subject to the FRBMA framework.

•

Subsidy reform is an important element of the expenditure strategy. Efforts are
underway to improve cost efficiency and reduce the interest burden of the FCI.
However, the authorities reiterated the constraints to more fundamental reform,
especially for oil subsidies.

22.
The authorities shared the concern that some states may fall short of the TFC’s
adjustment targets. States with high initial deficits would require sizeable adjustments.
However, they were hopeful that market discipline would increase as more states access
markets, and that demonstration effects would prompt laggard states to reform. The
authorities noted that lowering the share of NSSF borrowing taken by states would have
broader implications, and had established a working group to study reform options.
23.
With the SPC recommendations still two years away from formulation, staff’s
concerns were seen as premature. In any case, the lessons from the Fifth Pay Commission
were well known. Moreover, with compensation already indexed to inflation, large hikes
would not likely be needed.

25.
The RBI’s stance of continued gradual removal of monetary accommodation,
going forward, would provide insurance against a possible inflation overshoot. This
strategy would anchor inflation expectations and moderate the credit expansion by raising the
cost of funds.
26.
The mission agreed that risks to financial stability were best managed by
targeted prudential measures, better risk management, and enhanced supervision
(Box 3).
•

Scope exists to further tighten selected prudential norms in specific sectors. Going
forward, the key is to ensure that banks recognize early any pending deterioration in
credit quality. The adoption of Basel II will help in this regard, as will stress tests.
However, there is also scope to shorten the timeline for classifying sub-standard and
doubtful loans, bringing classification and provisioning norms further toward best
international practice.

•

Securitization can be better developed as an important avenue for banks to manage
balance sheet risks. Streamlining capital requirements for mortgage-backed
securitization products, and stamp duties on securitized products, and removing legal
impediments to the secondary market trading of such securities would promote
market development.

13

The RBI’s monetary policy framework follows a broad-based multiple-indicator approach, with indicative
projections for inflation, as well as for growth in broad money, credit, and economic activity.

Fluctuations in asset prices are sizeable and macroeconomically significant.

There are identifiable relationships between (a) asset prices and inflation, (b) asset prices and

These preconditions are not met in India. In particular, rapid structural change makes the
identification of reliable macro-financial relationships and asset price misalignment difficult. On an
informal level, recent price movements appear to be driven by fundamentals—housing prices seem to
reflect rising per capita incomes, growing population, increased affordability, and easier access to
credit, while stock market valuations appear to be supported by future growth. But overall, there is

of one tenth of one percent. In light of this,
the RBI’s approach of tightening prudential norms and raising risk weights in the areas of high credit
growth, and the intensification of supervisory efforts, is appropriate.

The mission saw the present market-determined exchange rate policy as serving
India well. The RBI’s approach to exchange rate management allows two-way flexibility. In
addition, the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, although such
empirical analysis is imprecise and should be treated with caution.14 More generally,
competitiveness does not seem to be a problem. Evidence of wage pressures seems to be
confined to a few sectors and to skilled labor. India’s share of world exports has been
gradually trending upward over time, although it remains modest (see Figure 2). Looking
ahead, continued two-way flexibility in

Committee) would not be warranted.
28.
Continued fiscal reform and steps to deepen financial markets would
complement plans for further capital account liberalization. The Tarapore report outlines
a road map that envisages further gradual lifting of capital controls, with accompanying steps
to strengthen the fiscal position and financial sector, broadly in line with generally accepted
views about the appropriate phasing of capital account liberalization. Such liberalization has
the potential to bring important benefits by further integrating India with international capital
markets. A gradual approach, with complementary fiscal consolidation and strengthening of
the financial sector (including a reduced public-sector role in financial intermediation, as
envisaged by the report), would best manage the risks and reap the benefits of this approach.
Authorities’ Plans and Views
29.
The RBI saw the balance of risks at this juncture as broadly favorable. Inflation
expectations were well anchored. Long-term bond yields had eased substantially from peaks,

14

India’s REER is close to the prediction of a staff model that relates the real effective rupee to productivity
growth relative to trading partners, net foreign assets, and terms of trade (as shown in the figure). See also the
analysis in Box 5 of the 2005 staff report (IMF Country Report No. 06/55), which reached a similar conclusion.
Recent studies of the equilibrium level of the rupee yield widely varying results, ranging from an undervaluation
of 30 percent to an overvaluation of about 5–10 percent at end-2004 (see IMF Country Report No. 06/56 for
further details).

19
Box 4. India: Key Liberalization Steps Envisaged in the 2006 Tarapore Report
Like the Committee’s 1997 report, the 2006 report envisages a gradual and partial liberalization of
capital controls, over five years. Controls would be gradually eased on foreign holdings of Indian
government and corporate bonds, and foreign investment in India’s stock market, as well as foreign bond
issuance in rupees, external commercial borrowing by Indian corporations and banks, and Indian investment
abroad. Controls on resident individuals would remain in place, but caps on residents’ outflows would be
gradually raised.
The reports identify a comprehensive menu of reforms to minimize the potential risks associated with
freer capital movements. The most important include:
•

Fiscal consolidation: The central government should target a current budget surplus of 1 percent of GDP
by 2010/11 to allow the gross borrowing requirement to fall.

•

A “fairly valued” exchange rate: The RBI would target an exchange rate band of +/-5 percent around
the neutral (not defined) level of the real effective exchange rate.

•

Strong domestic banking system: RBI would (i) formulate prudential policies to encourage
consolidation, and facilitate the emergence of four to five strong domestic banks that can compete better
against foreign banks; (ii) encourage institutions to set up new private banks; and (iii) allow industrial
houses to take stakes in Indian banks. The Government’s (or RBI’s) share in public banks would fall to
33 percent from 51 percent, and bank governance would be improved.

•

Well developed financial markets. Steps to broaden the investor bases in money, government securities,
corporate bond, and derivatives markets, including reducing statutory liquidity requirements and raising
banks’ mark-to-market asset portfolios.

and officials saw little evidence of generalized wage pressures. The RBI was closely
monitoring demand conditions and asset prices, but noted that inflation pressures were hard
to gauge in an environment of ongoing structural change and financial deepening.
30.
The RBI remained vigilant, particularly in light of sustained rapid growth in
monetary and credit aggregates and elevated asset prices. However, a calibrated response
was needed to avoid an adverse impact on the investment needed to sustain current growth
rates. Given low inflation, lack of conclusive evidence of overheating, and lagged effects of
earlier rate increases that had yet to feed through the system, the RBI preferred to closely
monitor evolving macroeconomic developments. After the staff mission, at its end-October
mid-year review of monetary policy, the RBI raised the rate at which it injects liquidity by
25 bps to 7¼ percent but left unchanged the rate at which it absorbs liquidity at 6 percent.
31.
The authorities saw the strong credit growth as a sign of financial deepening and
robust economic activity, but were nonetheless alert for risks.15
•

Financial soundness indicators are strong (Table 9): Low gross and net
nonperforming loans reflected a pickup in loan recoveries on the back of an improved
legal foreclosure framework, strong asset price growth, and turnaround in industrial
profitability.

•

Loan origination standards are conservative: The RBI was mindful that low retail
and mortgage NPLs—less than 2½ percent—reflected a nascent market. However,
conservative mortgage loan-to-value ratios (60–70 percent), the practice of making
the loan size dependent on repayment capacity, and the separation of banks’ loan
origination and appraisal functions would help limit risks going forward. The credit
information bureau was now fully operational, providing banks with information on
retail borrowers. While the commercial real estate boom warranted continued
attention, such lending still comprised only around 5.8 percent of total loans
(including indirect exposure).

•

The RBI has recently issued guidelines for banks to conduct stress tests of their
market, credit and other exposures. Such tests, conducted regularly by systemically
important banks and with implementation reviewed by the RBI, are expected to play
an important role in alerting banks and the RBI to potential vulnerabilities.

15

The 2005 India—Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 06/56) examined the issue of credit growth and
concluded that credit risks were manageable.

21
•

The RBI is enhancing prudential standards. Risk weights and provisioning in
high-growth sectors were tightened. Stress tests and Basel II would encourage further
risk management improvements. However, Basel II implementation would be
challenging, in part due to information technology demands and the need to develop
human skills. Accordingly, in October 2006 the timeline for its introduction was
extended to March 2008 for banks with foreign operations, and to March 2009 for
domestic banks. (The RBI estimates that banks will need to raise an additional
1 percent in capital for Basel II implementation, but it does not view this as a major
hurdle for banks, especially as it has introduced new options for raising capital.)

•

Banks are managing funding risks. To fund rapid credit growth, banks have reduced
holdings of government securities. Deposit growth has picked up, aided by new tax
incentives on term deposits and higher interest rates, helping reduce the incremental
credit-deposit rate to under 80 percent. The RBI has alerted banks to the risks
associated with wholesale commercial deposits, which were a growing source of
funding but could be less stable than retail deposits.

•

The authorities are also undertaking a self-conducted assessment of financial
stability and development. The self-assessment would provide the opportunity to
review systemic risks in the banking system, and the authorities plan to publish its
results.

32.
The policy of a market-determined exchange rate remains unchanged. The RBI
reiterated its policy of no target or pre-announced path for the exchange rate. They noted that
two-way variability in the exchange rate was encouraging corporations to hedge their open
foreign exchange exposures. On the recent Tarapore Committee recommendations on the
REER, the authorities noted that a previous report by that Committee had made the same
recommendation, but it was not adopted.
33.
The Tarapore committee recommendations on capital account liberalization
could also be a means to promote financial market development. The RBI has established
a committee to streamline foreign exchange regulations. In October 2006, the RBI
announced additional steps to gradually liberalize capital flows, including increases in the
limits on outflows by individual residents and overseas investments by mutual funds, and
enhancements in currency hedging available for external trade. The authorities stressed that
the liberalization process would proceed gradually in light of the fiscal deficit, as well as the
need to further develop financial markets–which was seen as key.

22
C. What Are the Priorities for Fostering A Broader and Deeper Financial Sector?
Background and Staff Views
34.
Developing India’s financial markets would promote more efficient
intermediation and risk management, with benefits for growth. In addition to enhancing
capital allocation, broader and more liquid financial markets will help to finance
infrastructure development, as well as provide a broader set of tools to manage risks and
facilitate capital account liberalization.
35.
The challenge going forward will be to develop the basic pillars for vibrant
financial markets. Existing benchmarks such as the money market and government
securities markets need to be developed and made more liquid. The embryonic corporate
bond and derivative markets need to grow to play a meaningful role in financing India’s
development. Finally, broadening the investor base, including through ongoing efforts to
develop pension and insurance markets, will be crucial.
•

Improving benchmarks: A deeper term money market could aid the development of
financial markets by establishing reliable short-term pricing benchmarks. At present,
the market is concentrated at the overnight maturity, reflecting the limited treasury
operations of public banks, and term money markets are dominated by instruments
such as CDs and CP. In addition, increased liquidity in the government securities

Developing corporate bond and derivatives markets:16 The corporate bond market is
hampered by cumbersome issuance procedures, statutory guidelines that restrict
banks’ and institutional investors’ holdings, and limits on foreign investor
participation. The market is dominated by financial institutions and state-owned
enterprises, who generally issue bonds with maturities of less than five years.

outside participating dealers.
•

Broadening the institutional investor base: Insurance and pension reforms will
broaden the institutional investor base and increase available long-term funding. The
deregulation and opening of the insurance sector to private companies in 2000 has
spurred rapid growth of the mutual fund and insurance industries. Forthcoming
insurance reforms, including the increase in the FDI limit and the gradual lifting of
pricing restrictions starting in 2007, should help ensure continued strong growth of
the sector. The Pension Bill under consideration would open the sector to private
participation and could transform the corporate bond and equity markets (Box 5).

Authorities’ Plans and Views
“… if we can push through financial sector reforms, the growth rate will not be at 8 percent
but close to 9.4 percent.”
Finance Minister Chidambaram, October 2006
36.

The authorities agreed on the importance of vibrant financial markets.

•

In the money markets, the RBI is focused on developing collateralized segments, with
a view to limiting credit risk and ensuring stability. In 2005, the creation of an
anonymous order matching trading screen promoted the development of an active
collateralized market. More recently, the RBI has created a screen-based system for
transactions in the call and term money markets. The authorities are also considering
the recommendations of a 2005 Report by the Technical Group on Money Markets,
which recommended broadening the range of assets that could be utilized as collateral
in repo transactions, including for example state government securities. Mainly in
order to limit credit risk in the unsecured call money market, in 2005 participation
was restricted to primary dealers.

24
Box 5. India: Financial Market Implications of Pension Reform
Decentralization of pension fund management, as envisaged in India, can spur major capital
market development. In Latin America and Eastern Europe, reforms allocating the management
of pension fund assets to specialized, privately-managed institutions generated fast growth in
pension-led asset demand (1−1½ percent of GDP a year on average). In several cases, they also
fostered new financial instruments such as mortgage backed securities (MBS) and other forms of
securitization, venture capital, and inflation-protected bonds.
International experience suggests that pension reforms are most likely to contribute to the
development of capital markets in the context of certain supporting conditions, such as:
•

Build-up of a critical mass. The reform may need to generate sufficient asset demand before it
can kick-start financial market development. Empirical tests validate the link between pension
sector growth and financial depth in Chile, where after two decades the pension sector has
reached a size comparable to that of the United Kingdom; however they fail to detect such a
link for countries with a shorter history of reforms.1/

•

Design of capital market laws and regulations. Laws and regulations should be flexible enough
allow new instruments to appear, which can be suitable investments for pension funds. Some
consider that this may require shifting from a positive to a negative system of regulation, in
which all activities that are not expressly forbidden would be allowed. It may also require the
buildup of market infrastructure.

• Regulatory guidelines that enable optimum portfolio diversification. For instance, Colombian
pension funds hold 30 percent of their assets in corporate bonds, whereas Mexican pension
funds hold less than 12 percent due to restrictive investment regulations. Similarly, Chilean
pension funds hold 50–60 percent of outstanding private debt securities (corporate bonds and
MBS) compared to one third for Mexican funds. Allowing investments abroad, commensurate
with fund managers’ expertise, also supports risk diversification. In underdeveloped markets, it
also prevents imbalances between pension-led demand and the domestic supply of securities
from heightening volatility in the short term.
The pension reform in India may not build critical mass initially, as its mandatory pillar is
restricted to new government entrants. Along with pension reforms, concurrent improvements in
the corporate governance of exempt nongovernment provident funds (employee pension funds), by
making their boards more accountable for performance, could further strengthen the demand for
new investment products and asset diversification, and help achieve the critical mass earlier.

•

Initiatives are afoot to develop a more liquid G-Sec yield curve. In October 2006 the
RBI expanded the scope of “when-issued” trading beyond reissues to selected new
issues, extended permitted short sales from intraday to five days, and allowed the
delivery of borrowed securities for repo transactions. The RBI is gradually
consolidating reissues along the yield curve, while mindful of the fiscal implications
of debt operations. The Government Securities Act (2006) legalizes stripping. The
RBI has also proposed to broaden the investor base by gradually raising the limit on
foreign participation in the G-Sec market to $3.2 billion by March 31, 2007, from its
current level of $2 billion.

•

The authorities recognize the need for a dynamic corporate bond market. The
authorities are considering the report of the 2005 High Level Expert Committee on
Corporate Bonds and Securitization, which recommended (i) permitting investment
by institutional investors in rated corporate bonds; (ii) raising the limit on foreign
institutional investment in corporate bonds; (iii) harmonizing state level stamp duties
and tax deduction at source by investor type; and, (iv) setting up a system of market
makers, developing a trade reporting system and clearing and settlement system to
spur secondary market trading.

•

The RBI is developing a prudential regulatory and supervisory framework for OTC
derivatives. The 2006 Amendment to the RBI Act clarifies the legal status of OTC
derivatives, and establishes the RBI as the regulator of the OTC derivatives market.
The RBI has also tightened prudential norms. Banks are now required to hold
minimum defined regulatory capital to cover their off-balance sheet exposures and
banks are required to adhere to minimum transparency and disclosure requirements
(capital adequacy norms for OTC derivatives have been in line with Basel I for some
time). The 2006 guidelines for the valuation and accounting of derivatives introduce
fair value accounting norms akin to international accounting standards (IAS39).

•

Pension and insurance reforms remain a key element of the authorities’ agenda. The

D. How Can Reforms Promote More Job-Intensive, Inclusive Growth?
“There is a new dynamism in India…however, if we have to realize our full potential there is
much work to be done.”

challenge going forward will be to create
jobs on the scale needed to successfully
absorb excess agricultural labor and the 140 million new entrants to the labor force over the
next decade. At the same time, skill gaps suggest that India’s education system must adapt to
the evolving needs of the growing industry and service sectors. The government is well
aware of these challenges and are focusing on what they see as more immediate bottlenecks
to growth—such as inadequate infrastructure—while continuing to encourage job-led growth
through special economic zones (SEZs) and trade liberalization.

38.
The government is turning to the private sector to help meet its enormous
infrastructure needs. According to the World Bank, inadequate infrastructure costs India
about 1 percent per annum in foregone growth and infrastructure investment needs to rise by
4 percentage points of GDP over the medium term if India is to sustain current growth
rates.17 With budgetary resources limited, the government’s strategy is to involve the private
sector through public-private partnerships. While continuing to provide limited gap funding
to projects with below-market returns, the government has established the India
Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFC) to provide finance and refinance facilities for longterm commercial infrastructure projects. It has also developed Model Concession
Agreements in the key infrastructure sectors to clarify the surrounding policy framework.
The IIFC has already raised some $400 million on the domestic market and provided
financing to 5 mega-power projects. Additional efforts would bolster the PPP framework:
strong and independent sector regulators would reduce regulatory uncertainties for investors,
while developing domestic bond markets would facilitate infrastructure finance (any
contingent liabilities to the government should be recorded in the budget).

17

27
39.
The role of SEZs in India’s development strategy is the subject of debate.
International experience suggests that associated revenue losses could be high, particularly,
as in India, when tax incentives are not well targeted (Box 6). Blanket tax incentives also
work against efforts to streamline administration and broaden the tax base. Moreover, the
small size of many approved SEZs suggests that they may provide only limited
infrastructure. The mission suggested that consideration could be given to replacing tax
holidays with more targeted incentives, as well as to raising the size threshold. The
authorities recognize the revenue risks, and were already taking steps to limit diversion of
already-planned investment into the zones. Approvals are limited to those projects that bring
in new capital goods or service new contracts, and income from sales to the domestic market
would not be exempt.
40.
The government has expressed its strong commitment to multilateral trade
liberalization as a key element of its development strategy. The government is concerned
about the delay in the Doha round, and intends to play an active role in restarting the
negotiations. They stressed the need for developed countries to reduce farm support,
particularly in light of India’s vulnerable and underdeveloped agricultural sector. In the
meantime, the authorities have been cutting trade tariffs—the simple average tariff is now
around 15.2 percent, compared with over 30 percent earlier in this decade. The mission
encouraged the government to accelerate the timeline for reducing tariffs to ASEAN levels
(currently about 8¾ percent on a simple average basis) ahead of 2009. The mission and the
authorities agreed that regional trade agreements were no substitute for multilateral
liberalization, and that arrangements with liberal and simple rules of origin, with
liberalization on an MFN basis, would likely yield the largest payoff for India and its trading
partners. The government also planned to extend duty- and quota-free access to at least
50 least developed countries (consistent with the decision reached at the Hong Kong
Ministerial conference).
E. Other Issues
41.
An improved statistical system would better support India’s emerging global
role. Progress is being made: quarterly demand-side GDP will be released starting in 2007;
the lag in dissemination of annual expenditure-based estimates will be reduced to three
months; and steps are underway to compile a new producer price index and improve
preliminary export estimates through expanded electronic reporting by customs facilities.
The authorities are also implementing 2004 IMF Fiscal Affairs Department technical
assistance recommendations in state finance statistics, and the RBI is participating in the IMF
Statistics Department’s initiative to compile financial soundness indicators. Going forward,

28
Box 6. India: Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
Interest in SEZs intensified with the passage of the SEZ Act 2005. India’s SEZ policy aims to
increase economic activity, promote exports and investment, create employment, and develop
infrastructure. To achieve these goals, various incentives are given to business units in the zone
as well as zone developers. Over 300 applications have been filed, and approvals have been
notified for 34 zones (as of October 2006).
Some questions have been raised regarding the fiscal costs of the zones’ tax incentives.
International experiences with tax incentives, which exist in virtually all SEZs worldwide, are
mixed. One strand of the literature using U.S. data suggests that targeted tax incentives can boost
R&D or FDI. However, a number of case studies and surveys suggest that business climate and
macroeconomic policies are more important. Moreover, revenue losses can arise from investment
diversion—where investment would have been undertaken without the tax incentive. Such losses
can be significant when, as in India, tax relief is provided through corporate income tax holidays.
International experience suggests that targeted tax incentives are more cost efficient. In the
United States, R&D or investment credits are used to promote innovation and investment, while
employment credits have been effective in reducing unemployment in economically distressed
regions. Similarly, experience in developing countries (including Mexico, Turkey, Pakistan, and
Central European countries) also shows that blanket CIT incentives are less effective than
targeted incentives in promoting investment. In addition, tax incentives might not reduce the
overall tax burden for foreign investors. In particular, tax authorities often grant credits for taxes
that firms pay abroad; hence, without a special clause in the tax treaty, savings from tax
incentives in the host country may be offset by increased tax liability to the home country.

unlike China where SEZs were used to
experiment with market reforms at the
start of its liberalization process, India already has a long track record in reform. Moreover, the
small size of most SEZs—most are under 100 hectares—suggests that the accompanying
infrastructure enhancements may be limited.

29
priority could be given to improving the timeliness and coverage of data on employment,
wages, productivity, and outward FDI, as well as the timeliness of state finance statistics.18
42.
India has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. However, restrictions remain in
place with respect to the mutual debt agreement of 1993 with Russia and bilateral payment
agreements with two Eastern European countries (see Appendix II).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
India’s remarkable growth performance has surpassed all expectations. For the
first time in history, growth of over 8 percent is in its fourth year. The expansion has
broadened to industry and investment. Inflation remains subdued, the result of productivity
and competitiveness gains, as well as macro management. The economy has shown
remarkable resilience, weathering high oil prices, slowing U.S. growth and severe emerging
market turbulence. Record corporate profits are funding ambitious expansions abroad.
44.
The immediate challenge is managing the near-term risk of inflationary
pressures. The increases in rates implemented over the past year and the RBI’s continued
vigilance are welcome. The central bank’s stance of continued gradual removal of monetary
accommodation is appropriate and going forward would provide insurance against a possible
inflation overshoot. Overperformance on the 2006/07 budget, by channeling the anticipated
revenue windfall to deficit reduction, would support this stance while contributing toward
medium-term fiscal consolidation.
45.
The current exchange rate arrangement remains appropriate. Competitiveness
appears adequate. As the capital account opens further, the current policy will continue to
promote flexibility, preserve monetary policy independence, and give the private sector
incentives to manage currency exposures.
46.
Looking to the medium term, the new economic dynamism presents an
opportunity to move India to a higher growth path by accelerating key reforms. The
government’s vision is to reduce poverty and create employment by accelerating growth to
the 9–10 percent range. It has rightly made fiscal consolidation, financial sector
development, and addressing structural bottlenecks cornerstones of its reform platform. Staff
fully support these priorities, which if implemented will reduce the debt burden, create space
for priority social spending, generate private resources for investment, and create a more
favorable environment for job creation.

18

An IMF technical assistance mission is visiting India during November-December 2006 to advise on reforms
to the budget classification system and chart of accounts.

30
47.
Government finances are in their best position in over a decade, but further
progress is needed to reduce public debt and make room for social and infrastructure
spending. Ongoing tax administration improvements have substantially boosted central
government revenues. The state-level deficit has fallen on the back of TFC reforms and
introduction of VAT. Implementation of the FRBMA and consolidation of state finances
under the TFC will permit a steady decline in the public debt ratio.
48.
Further revenue and expenditure measures are needed to meet the
center’s 2008/09 revenue deficit target. This could entail:
•

Further broadening the tax base. Eliminating corporate income tax incentives and
paring excise exemptions would bolster revenue and make up for possible erosion of
revenues from tax incentives granted under SEZs. The phase out of the interstate
trade tax would also pave the way for a national GST.

•

Reforming expenditure as well as improving its efficiency. The potential for
broad-based subsidy reform to reduce costs and improve poverty-reducing outcomes
is well known. Subsidy reforms have been the subject of several government
committees, including the most recent recommendations for an automatic marketbased mechanism for petroleum goods, as well as better-targeted on-budget kerosene
subsidies. The government should act promptly on these recommendations.

•

Tightening controls on state borrowing. A number of states face sizable adjustments
to meet 2008/09 TFC targets. Lowering annual borrowing targets in line with FRL
targets, and reforming the NSSF, would harden state budget constraints.

49.
The rapid deepening of India’s banking sector is welcome, but supervisory
vigilance is warranted. Financial soundness indicators are favorable. Going forward,
however, asset quality could come under pressure, particularly if rapid credit growth is
sustained. Comprehensive stress tests, and the authorities’ self-assessment, will help expose
any vulnerabilities, and staff look forward to publication of the results of both exercises.
Implementation of Basel II will also give banks incentives to enhance risk management. To
complement these steps, consideration could also be given to shortening the timeline for
recognizing doubtful NPLs.
50.
Deeper and broader financial markets will foster growth and facilitate greater
capital account openness. Recent initiatives to develop money and government securities
markets, expand foreign participation in debt markets, and strengthen supervision of OTC
derivatives activities are welcome. Further expanding short selling, when-issued trading, and
consolidation of benchmark issues would be useful, as would steps to streamline issuance
requirements for corporate bonds and facilitate trading of securitized assets. Raising the limit
on FDI in insurance and opening the pension sector to private participation (as anticipated in

31
the pension bill) would broaden India’s investor base and improve channels for funding
longer-term investment.
51.
Greater progress is needed in addressing structural obstacles to job-intensive,
inclusive growth. The problem of inadequate infrastructure is well known. Building strong
and independent regulators would bolster investor interest in infrastructure, underpinning the
authorities’ PPP initiative. In addition, changes to SEZs policies would help them to play a
more effective role in India’s development strategy. International experience suggests that
revenue losses from tax incentives could prove costly. The authorities should consider
modifying the SEZ framework to increase minimum size and to target tax incentives,
avoiding blanket income tax exemptions that narrow the tax base and complicate
administration.
52.
India can play a proactive role in restarting multilateral trade talks. The staff
welcomes the unilateral extension of duty free, quota free access to LDCs. In implementing
regional and bilateral trade arrangements, agreements with liberal and simple rules of origin,
and liberalization on an MFN basis, will likely yield the largest payoff for India and its
trading partners. India has already made considerable progress in reducing its simple average
nonagricultural tariff, and the present rapid growth provides an opportunity to move more
quickly towards ASEAN levels, reducing tariffs on an MFN basis.
53.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation occur on the 12-month cycle.

5/ Treats divestment receipts as a below the line financing item.
6/ Authorities' definition treats divestment as a receipt item until 2005/06 included.
7/ Staff's definition treats divestment receipts as a below the line financing item and treats bond issuance by the central government to oil companies
and FCI as current expenditure, in accordance with GFSM 2001.
8/ External debt measured at historical exchange rates.
9/ Issued by the central government to FCI and the state-owned oil refining/distribution companies as compensation for losses incurred from the

Sources: Data provided by the Indian authorities; state level data from the RBI State Finance Bulletin. Staff amalgamate and prepare projections.
1/ The consolidated general government comprises the central government (CG) and state governments.
2/ Based on RBI's estimate of provisional outturn for state finances.
3/ Based on central government provisional unaudited outturn and staff's projection of state finances.
4/ Tax revenue = Tax revenue of central government (CG), including NCCF and states' share, plus state tax revenue.
5/ Nontax revenue = Nontax revenue of CG, less interest payments by states on CG loans, plus nontax revenue of states.
6/ Expenditure and net lending = Total expenditure and net lending of CG (authorities' definition excluding FCI and oil bonds), less net loans
and grants to states and union territories, plus total expenditure of states (excluding interest payments on CG loans).
7/ From the RBI Handbook of Statistics and the RBI Annual Report 2006 ; the authorities treat disinvestment proceeds above-the-line as
capital receipts. From 2005/06, disinvestment receipts of the central government are transferred to the National Investment Fund (off-budget).
8/ Above-the-line items in the CGA, which cancel out in the consolidation (e.g., loans to states).

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I: INDIA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. The Baseline Scenario
Staff assumptions. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the staff baseline scenario
are as described in Table 7 and assume some increase in real interest rates and continued
fiscal restraint. These policies, combined with progress in structural areas, deliver continued
firm growth and contained inflation. In addition, the government is assumed not to issue
further bonds to the state-owned petroleum companies, the Food Corporation of India, or
other state-owned entities over the medium term.
Debt path. Under the baseline scenario (a general government deficit of 6¼ percent of GDP
in 2006/07 declining to 5 percent of GDP by 2011/12), gross public debt would fall from
80¾ percent of GDP to 69 percent of GDP over the same period.
FRBML targets. Under the baseline scenario, while the general government overall
borrowing requirement is brought under 6 percent of GDP by 2008/09, achievement of the
current balance target by the central government is delayed by three years to March 2012.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
Relative to the baseline scenario:
Interest rate and other shocks. A gradual decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio would still occur
under various shocks, including in a scenario where the growth-interest-differential returns to
its historical average (Figure I.1 and
Table I.1). Only in the case of a return to
India: General Government Overall Balance
(In percent of GDP)
historical averages for the primary
12.0
balance, real GDP growth, and real
10.0
interest rates would the debt ratio rise
8.0
over the medium term.

more ambitious adjustment path in the

context of sustained GDP growth higher
by 1½ percentage point (“high growth”
scenario) compared to the baseline would lower the general government deficit to under
4 percent of GDP and public debt to 62 percent of GDP by March 2012 (Figure 5). Higher
growth, combined with stronger tax measures (including elimination of sectoral and areabased corporate incentives and paring of excise exemptions) and progress in subsidy reform
would also allow the government to meet both FRBML targets by 2008/09.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since March 1, 1993, the Indian rupee has floated against other currencies, although the
Reserve Bank of India intervenes in the market periodically. As per the Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the exchange rate in India is
classified as managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. On
August 20, 1994, India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
IMF Articles of Agreement. India maintains the following restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to the non-transferability of
balances under the India-Russia debt agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances
under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and
a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by non-resident relatives. The
Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.

APPENDIX III: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
After a year of significantly high lending by the World Bank to India during Bank FY05, reaching
$2.89 billion, the Bank’s support to India in FY06 declined to $1.32 billion. This shortfall from plan
was due to delays in project approval as a result of institutional/fiduciary issues, which have
recently been resolved. World Bank support to India in Bank FY07 is expected to increase and
again reach its targeted level consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), having already
delivered over $700 million as of end-August 2006. IFC also recorded a strong commitment in
FY05 of $412.5 million. The World Bank Group’s program of support combines policy dialogue
with diversified IBRD/IDA lending, IFC investments and analytical and advisory activities in the
sectors that are important to reducing poverty and sustaining growth.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors discussed a new CAS for India on August 26, 2004. The CAS
jointly covers the programs of IBRD/IDA and IFC for FY05–08. With over one-quarter of the
world’s poor in India, the overarching challenge is how to scale up the impact of Bank Group
assistance in order to help India move closer to achieving its development goals—including the
goal of halving poverty by 2015.
Scaling up assistance will entail a strengthened Bank Group program at the Center, as well as more
lending to the states compared to recent years. For state level lending, the strategy is to retain an
essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states, and to also seek new opportunities
for engagement with the largest and poorest states in India in order to help strengthen the
environment for reform. The expansion in lending will primarily be for investment in infrastructure
development, human development and rural livelihoods. Through adjustment lending, continued
emphasis is also being placed on support to fiscal and governance reforms at the state level.
Adjustment lending to finance state level reforms will be limited to 15 percent of total IBRD/IDA
lending for the CAS period. Overall lending levels will fall within an upper bound of $2.15 billion
per year for IBRD, on average for the four years of the CAS, and the IDA limits for India
established by the IDA Deputies. Financial operations since 1998/99 are summarized below.

APPENDIX IV: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public
sector loan commitments totaled $14.6 billion as of July 31, 2006 for 80 loans. With an
additional $0.4 billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total
loan commitments amounted to $15.0 billion. These funds have been provided from the
Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments
amounting to $0.2 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

1/ In addition to these public sector loans, AsDB also provided $750 million for
rural roads in 2005 under its multitranche financing facility.

AsDB’s core operational strategy in India remains poverty reduction through infrastructureled growth. More than 75 percent of its ongoing and proposed assistance focuses on transport
(national highways, state roads, and rural roads), urban (water and sanitation, waste
management, urban transport, city planning, and municipal reforms), and energy (power
sector reforms, investments for upgrading transmission and distribution systems, hydropower
generation, and improvement in energy efficiency) sector operations.

APPENDIX V: INDIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While India’s macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, weaknesses
remain in the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an elaborate system
for compiling economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering
virtually all sectors of the economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) on December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS,
although it uses flexibility options for timeliness of data on general government operations and
on the periodicity and timeliness of labor market data. The authorities are planning further
improvements in the timeliness, periodicity, and coverage of data in a number of statistical areas
as detailed below. Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis,
most of which are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF
Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination
practices against the SDDS requirements and the quality of six datasets based on the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA. In addition, it lists prioritized
recommendations to improve national accounts, consumer and wholesale price indices, fiscal,
monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data ROSC identified issues related to the
periodicity, coverage, and quality of statistical series.
•

National accounts: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) rebased the annual
national accounts statistics and began publishing quarterly data in 1999. The CSO has
recently reduced the dissemination lag for quarterly releases from three to two months
and released a new series of national accounts, with base year 1999–2000 in
January 2006. However, quarterly data are only available from 1996Q2 and relate only
to production-based concepts. Information on major expenditure categories is available
with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year). Estimates of
value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased
upwards, as they are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the
year that they are paid) deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for industrial
workers. The CSO plans to disseminate quarterly expenditure-based aggregates starting
in 2007 and aims to reduce the dissemination lag for the annual expenditure-based
estimates to three months.

•

Industrial production index (IPI): In May 2000, the CSO took the welcome step of
releasing a revised time series for IPI, using the new WPI (base year 1993/94) series as a
deflator. The government has also contracted a private company, CMIE, to increase the
number of respondents and products in the sample, as recommended by the data ROSC.

•

Price statistics: The CSO has published revised CPI with a 2000 base year. Presently,
there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of
consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural
laborers, and rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month.

56
The WPI is published weekly with a lag of two weeks and is subject to large revisions,
especially in periods of rising inflation. A new WPI series was published in 2000 with
updated weights, new categories, and a revised base year (1993/94). However, the
representativeness of the index may be undermined by the collection of prices from a
relatively small sample of products.
•

External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance
of payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5), the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) presentation does not
follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage
problems, and data on trade prices and volumes are not regularly available on a timely
basis (a committee will examine the base year of trade indices). Starting January 2001,
external debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag.
Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original
maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only
available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term
nonresident Indian accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover
the sectors prescribed in the BPM5 and these data are disseminated within six months of
the reference period in respect of annual data. India began disseminating the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under
the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain variables,
such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on
a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the
RBI website. A STA mission that visited the country during August-September 2005
identified the major priorities for improvement in external statistics to be: (a) obtaining
legislative authority to cover liberalized transactions; (b) adopting market valuation of
direct investment, portfolio investment, and reserve assets; and (c) additional detail on
service transactions.

•

Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI website and the RBI Bulletin publish a
wide array of monetary and financial statistics, including interest rates, exchange rates,
foreign reserves, the monetary survey, and results of government securities auctions. The
frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
However, some crucial data, such as the RBI’s forward liabilities and intervention data,
are still published with lags of two to three months.

•

The ROSC data module mission of May 2002 found that the concepts and definitions
used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the
guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the
resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of
domestic credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities
subdivide the resident nonbank sector data by (i) central government, (ii) state

57
government, and (iii) the commercial sector (including other financial corporations,
public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a
quarterly basis only. The staff has recommended that the authorities adopt the full range
of sectors prescribed in the MFSM and include accrued interest on a monthly basis
instead of reflecting it only on a quarterly basis.
•

India has submitted to STA test data (for the period December 2001-June 2006) on
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been developed to implement the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. STA is working with the
authorities in resolving outstanding data issues. In October 2006, India initiated
electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous
paper-based reporting.

•

Fiscal statistics: The Ministry of Finance posts selected central government monthly
fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its website. However, no monthly data on fiscal
performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an
eight- to ten-month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government
operations. In addition, data on the functional and economic classification of
expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the
analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,
classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and
plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. Reporting to the
Fund for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) has been
current (with data reported to 2004 in the 2005 GFSY), but only cash data is reported,
and the coverage is generally limited to the central government. Some limited general
government data has been reported for 2002.

3.
In addition to the ROSC recommendations, the authorities are presently addressing a
number of data compilation issues which were identified in the August 2001 Report of the
National Statistical Commission, including:
•

The revision of statistical and data reporting methods in order to keep pace with the shift
to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial licensing.

•

The need for the CSO to initiate procedures through which its interaction with other
agencies in the decentralized statistical system is made more proactive as well as
effective. The planned establishment of the National Statistical Commission is a first
step.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 20, 2006

1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on November 29, 2006. This information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data suggest stronger-than-expected near-term growth. Real GDP growth
accelerated to 9.2 percent y/y in the June-September quarter, well above market and staff
projections, reflecting strong services and a marked pickup in manufacturing. Industrial
production growth eased to 6.2 percent y/y in October, but this largely reflected the
temporary seasonal impact of holidays. Strong momentum has also contributed to a widening
trade deficit. WPI inflation edged up to 5.3 percent in November, mainly reflecting rising
food and manufacturing prices. On the basis of recent data, staff has revised upward GDP
growth to 8.9 percent for FY2006/07 and to 8.2 percent for FY2007/08, with upward
revisions to the projected current account deficit (2 percent of GDP) and inflation
(5.2 percent) in FY2006/07.
3.
Fiscal revenues have been stronger than anticipated. The central government’s net
tax revenue grew 33.8 percent y/y during April-October, reflecting strong corporate tax
receipts. State VAT collection rose over 30 percent y/y during April-September.
4.
On December 8, the RBI announced increases in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).
The CRR will be raised by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent on December 23, and another
25 basis points on January 6, to remove some Rs. 135 billion (2.2 percent of reserve money)
in excess liquidity from the market. Nonetheless, monetary conditions remain
accommodative; in November, M3 grew 19.3 percent y/y, reserve money grew 17.5 percent
y/y, non-food credit expanded 30.1 percent y/y, and real short-term interest rates remain at
low levels compared with the past.
5.
The equity market has recently experienced volatility. Between December 8 and
12, the BSE Sensex fell 5.8 percent, but subsequently stabilized. Between end-November and
December 13 the rupee gained 0.1 percent against the dollar amid dollar weakening, while
foreign exchange reserves now stand at $175 billion (December 8).
6.
The government has cut domestic petrol and diesel prices by 4¼ percent and
3 percent respectively; LPG and kerosene prices are unchanged. The impact on inflation is
likely to be limited (perhaps reducing WPI inflation by 0.1 percent). According to staff
estimates, petrol is now 3½ percent above, and diesel 4½ percent below, cost-recovery levels
on an import parity basis.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/9
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 25, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with India
On December 20, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s economy has continued to grow above trend, with average growth of 8 percent in the last
three years. Growth is broad based, with robust consumption, investment, and exports. With
manufacturing expanding at over 10 percent y/y, industry has joined services as an engine of
growth. A normal monsoon is supporting agriculture. Staff projects growth of about 9 percent this
year, further moderating toward trend in 2007/08. WPI inflation is contained within the RBI’s
indicative projection range of 5−5½ percent, partly reflecting gradual hikes in policy rates since
late 2005, limited pass-through of higher world oil prices to domestic LPG and kerosene, and cuts
in import duties. However, high food prices are contributing to CPI inflation (industrial workers)
exceeding 6 percent. Staff projects WPI inflation to remain in the 5−5½ percent range in the near
term.
The investment recovery and consumption boom continue to widen the external current account
deficit. In 2005/06, buoyant imports have offset rising goods and services exports, pushing up the
trade deficit to 6½ percent of GDP and the current account deficit to 1¼ percent of GDP. While
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
exports are growing apace, robust domestic demand is expected to contribute to a further
widening in both deficits this year.
Strong capital inflows comfortably financed the current account deficit. In 2005/06, inflows
remained dominated by portfolio flows and external commercial borrowings, particularly
convertible bonds. While gross FDI inflows have begun to rise, they have been partly offset by a
pickup in outward investment by Indian corporates. So far this fiscal year, capital inflows have
remained strong and reserve coverage has remained stable at around 7½ months of imports of
goods and services. While more reliance on debt and portfolio inflows has increased exposures
to changes in international investor sentiment, India’s large reserves and low external debt limit
this risk.
The exchange rate has exhibited two-way flexibility and in real effective terms is broadly around
its 2004/05 level. In the first half of 2006, the rupee depreciated against the U.S. dollar, against a
backdrop of tightening global liquidity and a widening current account deficit. The RBI limited its
intervention in foreign exchange markets to easing exchange rate volatility and smoothing
domestic liquidity pressures that arose from the redemption of external bonds. Since then the
rupee has regained ground against the dollar and the RBI continued to intervene only
occasionally, both buying and selling dollars.
Financial markets continue to soar. Net foreign investor inflows rebounded after the May/June
2006 stock market correction and stock prices recovered smartly, reaching new historical highs.
PE ratios are now high relative to other countries and India’s recent past. Meanwhile, real estate
prices continue to grow at a rapid clip on the back of a credit boom. To curb speculative
pressures, the RBI has tightened prudential standards further, including by raising general
provisioning requirements and boosting risk-weights on high-growth areas, including real estate,
to above Basel norms. Indicators of financial soundness (backward looking) suggest that banks’
balance sheets and income remain healthy.
Following three years of reduced deficits, fiscal consolidation “paused” in 2005/06. The general
government deficit was broadly unchanged at around 7½ percent of GDP, with a modestly rising
central government deficit broadly offset by a falling states deficit. All but five states enacted
fiscal responsibility laws (FRLs) and nine states subsequently received debt relief under the new
facility introduced last year by the Twelfth Finance Commission. General government debt
remains high―over 80 percent of GDP―reflecting both budget deficits and off-budget subsidies
for oil and food. Consolidation has resumed in 2006/07. The state and central government
budget deficit targets of 2.7 percent of GDP and 3.8 percent of GDP, respectively, are consistent
with the minimum reductions required under their fiscal responsibility legislations. Staff projects
the general government deficit to overperform budget estimates by 0.2 percent of GDP on the
back of strong revenue growth.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on India’s continued outstanding economic
performance—reflected inter alia in strong growth, enhanced resilience to shocks, and
increasing integration with the global economy. The favorable conjuncture and outlook provide a
good opportunity to accelerate key reforms to support the government’s vision of reducing
poverty and creating employment by boosting growth. Directors endorsed the government’s
reform priorities of fiscal consolidation, financial sector development, and removal of structural
bottlenecks as the appropriate means to achieve these objectives.
While recognizing the difficulty in gauging inflation pressures during a period of financial
deepening and other structural reforms, Directors agreed that vigilance is needed to guard
against any potential risks of overheating. They supported the central bank’s stance of
continued gradual removal of monetary accommodation. Overperformance on the 2006/07
budget could support this policy stance by channeling the anticipated revenue windfall to deficit
reduction. Directors concurred that India’s policy of a market determined exchange rate is
appropriately promoting flexibility, preserving monetary policy independence, and giving the
private sector incentives to manage currency exposures as the capital account opens further.
They supported the authorities’ gradual approach to capital account liberalization, in step with
fiscal consolidation and financial deepening.
Directors commended the improvement in government finances, but called for further progress
in reducing public debt to make room for social and infrastructure spending. To achieve the
target of bringing the central government’s revenue deficit to balance by 2008/09, they
recommended steps to broaden the tax base by eliminating corporate income tax incentives,
paring exemptions, and reforming interstate taxation to pave the way for a national goods and
services tax. On expenditure reform, Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the
recommendations of government committees on subsidies, including the introduction of an
automatic market-based mechanism for petroleum goods and better targeting of kerosene
subsidies. Consideration should also be given to hardening state budget constraints, given that
a number of states still face sizable adjustments.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of financial sector supervision, with prudential norms
generally in line with international best practices. They advised continued vigilance to guard
against pressures on asset quality in the face of rapid credit growth. Useful steps to expose
potential vulnerabilities will be comprehensive stress tests and the authorities’ self assessment
of financial stability and development, while the future implementation of Basel II will give banks
incentives to enhance risk management.
Directors saw the ongoing deepening and broadening of India’s financial markets as key to
fostering growth and facilitating greater capital account openness. Recent initiatives to develop
money and government securities markets and strengthen regulation of derivatives activities are
welcome. Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with measures that will further
deepen markets, including the expansion of short selling, the consolidation of benchmark
issues, and the streamlining of issuance requirements for corporate bonds. To broaden India’s

4
investor base and improve channels for funding longer-term investment, the limit on FDI in
insurance should be raised and private participation in the pension system permitted.
Directors urged greater progress in addressing structural obstacles to job-intensive, inclusive
growth. To help meet India’s infrastructure needs, steps should be taken to strengthen
implementation capacity and develop strong and independent regulators, as these would bolster
investor interest and underpin the authorities’ public private partnership initiative. Directors
encouraged the consideration of steps to maximize the contribution of Special Economic Zones
to India’s growth strategy while limiting potential revenue losses. More broadly, efforts should
continue to improve the business climate and reform education, as well as to alleviate rural
poverty through promoting agricultural growth.
Directors welcomed the government’s commitment to multilateral trade liberalization and
supported India’s intention to play an active role in restarting multilateral trade talks. They
welcomed the unilateral extension of duty free, quota free access to the least-developed
countries and the continued reduction in trade tariffs. Rapid economic growth provides an
opportunity to move tariffs more quickly towards ASEAN levels.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.
