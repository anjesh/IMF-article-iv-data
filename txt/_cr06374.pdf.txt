•

The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sydney, Melbourne, and
Canberra during June 1–9, 2006.

•

The staff team consisted of Messrs. Coe (Head), Beaumont, Mercereau, Rozhkov (all
APD), Mr. Ouanès (MFD), and Mr. Rancière (RES). Mr. Murray (Alternate Executive
Director) attended the meetings in Melbourne and Canberra.

•

The mission met with Treasurer Peter Costello, RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane, RBA
Deputy Governor Glenn Stevens (who will become Governor on September 18, 2006),
Treasury Secretary Ken Henry, Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority Chairman
John Laker, Fair Pay Commission Chairman Ian Harper, Future Fund Chairman David
Murray, and other senior officials, as well as representatives from the academic, labor,
financial, and business sectors.

Macroeconomic and structural policies are sound and are consistent with Fund advice.
The 2006/07 Budget maintains Australia’s robust medium-term fiscal position while
introducing tax reforms that will help increase labor participation. Monetary policy has
been tightened moderately as the medium-term outlook for inflation edged upwards. An
ambitious and wide-ranging structural reform program, the National Reform Agenda, was
agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 2006; in addition, the
government’s WorkChoices legislation, effective from March 2006, will further enhance
the flexibility of the labor market. The authorities continue to closely monitor
developments in household sector finances and in private external debt. These policies
are consistent with Executive Director’s recommendations at the conclusion of the
2005 Article IV consultation on August 29, 2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/331
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn05123.htm).

•

The exchange rate of the Australian dollar floats and Australia maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions (Annex I).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic growth is strengthening, stimulated by the highest terms of trade in three
decades. After 14 years of economic expansion there was a modest slowing in 2005
following a welcome cooling of the housing market. But strong global growth has boosted
Australia’s export commodity prices, contributing to high business investment that is
expected to underpin solid growth in exports in the medium term, while also resulting in a
larger than normal external current account deficit and rising net foreign liabilities.
Past experience suggests that much of the terms of trade improvement will, sooner or
later, be reversed. Hence the authorities allow for a significant decline in commodity prices
in their medium-term fiscal projections. Nonetheless, commodity prices could fall more
sharply if global growth were to slow significantly, although there is also the possibility that
commodity prices remain high for longer than expected.
Macroeconomic policies are well positioned in the event of shocks. Monetary policy has
been tightened appropriately and a further tightening may eventually be needed. A flexible
monetary policy response to potential external shocks, including commodity price swings,
will help to cushion growth while preserving low inflation. The fiscal position is projected to
remain in surplus in the medium term, providing a substantial buffer against shocks; the
surplus should be allowed to exceed budget targets if growth and revenues are stronger than
expected.
The FSAP finds that the financial sector is healthy and financial supervision is sound.
To promote robust risk management practices by financial institutions the authorities intend
to conduct further stress tests, and they are reviewing the regulation of banks’ liquidity. The
authorities’ initiative to ensure the legal foundations for the resolution of failed institutions is
important to help underpin the resilience of the financial system during a crisis.
Now is the time to press ahead with implementing reforms to lift productivity and
participation over the next decade. The recent surge in revenues provides resources that
should be used to spur the implementation of reforms that, by sustaining strong economic
growth, will help ensure that Australia is better placed to address the challenges of an ageing
population and rising healthcare costs.

As a result, strong business investment helped cushion the slowing of real GDP
growth in 2005 to 2½ percent. High profits and capacity utilization, and the low relative
price of capital goods, drove growth in business capital spending of 16 percent in 2005, with
investment particularly strong in the resources sector (Table 1). This partly offset a decline in
consumption growth and the modest fall in dwelling investment that followed the cooling of
the housing market. Nonetheless, consumption shows signs of strengthening in 2006 and
household credit growth has also picked up modestly, suggesting that any needed adjustment
in household balance sheets may already be largely complete.2

This conclusion is consistent with the preliminary results of a forthcoming working paper, which finds that
consumption was close to its estimated long-term equilibrium in late 2005. It also finds that consumption
“overshoots” in response to changes in housing wealth, with a peak impact after one year some 60 percent
larger than the long-run effect. An unwinding of this overshooting after the housing boom was a key factor
dampening consumption growth in 2005.

for commodity exports (Table 2).
Strong imports of capital goods kept
overall import growth relatively high. Moreover, the investment income balance deteriorated,
primarily because about half of the booming resource sector is foreign owned. External
financing continued to rely on portfolio inflows, principally through offshore bond issues by
the major banks in a range of international markets, with a weighted average maturity of
around four years. Net foreign liabilities reached a new high, at 60 percent of GDP, but the
ratio of net interest payments to exports remained low at 9 percent.4

4.
Unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years, but there has been little
generalized wage pressure. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in June as
employment growth strengthened. Wage rises have picked up in the construction and mining
sectors where employment growth has been strongest, but average private sector wage
growth has risen relatively modestly, to 4 percent (y/y) in March 2006 from 3½ percent in
recent years. Unit labor cost growth rose more significantly because labor productivity
growth was unusally low in 2005, but productivity growth recovered in the first half of 2006.

Potential vulnerabilities stemming from Australia’s large and sustained external current account deficits are
further discussed in Chapter I of the forthcoming selected issues paper. In terms of the saving-investment
balance, the rise in total investment to 26½ percent of GDP in 2005 is the main factor accounting for the
external deficit being wider than its historical average of 4½ percent of GDP. National saving has been
relatively stable at about 20 percent of GDP.

4

The private sector accounts for virtually all (99 percent) of Australia’s net external debt, with most
(78 percent) intermediated by private financial institutions.

6
5.
Headline and core CPI inflation have
increased. Higher prices for oil and fruit
helped to boost headline CPI inflation to
4 percent (y/y) in June 2006. Excluding these
volatile items, CPI inflation has remained
below 2½ percent. Nonetheless, the Reserve
Bank of Australia’s (RBA) statistical measures
of core inflation have risen to just under
3 percent, after being steady for two years at
the center of the 2-3 percent inflation target.
6.
Monetary policy was tightened. The
RBA hiked the cash rate by 25 basis points in
May 2006, the first increase since March 2005,
although a tightening bias had been signalled for
some time. With resource utilization relatively
high, and domestic spending growth expected to
be solid, the RBA considered that inflation
pressures were building; the RBA also noted that
competitive discounting had reduced effective
lending rates. A second hike in August took the
cash rate to 6 percent.
7.
The Australian dollar has been stable
but remains high by historical standards. In
July 2006 the Australian dollar was 11 percent
above its 20-year average in real effective
terms. The stability of the exchange rate in the
past year, in spite of the commodity price
boom, may partly reflect a narrowing of
interest differentials and, perhaps, expectations
of a decline in commodity prices: futures prices
for base metals decline by almost half in real
terms over the next five years.

Net debt of the Commonwealth government was eliminated in April 2006, aided
by fiscal surpluses in 8 of the past 9 years. The underlying cash balance for the 2005/06
fiscal year (ending June) is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP (Table 3), ½ percentage point
higher than budgeted. 5 Revenue was higher than projected owing to unexpectedly strong
growth in employment, significant capital gains for investors, and rapid growth in corporate
profits partly owing to high commodity prices.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Commodity Prices Could Surprise in Either Direction
9.
Growth is projected to pick up to about 3 percent in 2006 and 3½ percent in
2007. Domestic demand growth is expected to slow gradually, principally owing to some
moderation in business investment growth (Table 4). Consumption growth will likely settle
at around 3 percent as the effects of strengthening household incomes are tempered by
monetary tightening, slowing growth in wealth, and rising oil prices. Exports are expected to
accelerate as resource sector projects come on stream and as agricultural output recovers.
Terms of trade increases will also help reduce the trade deficit, but these gains will be partly
offset by higher equity income outflows, so the external current account deficit will decline
only modestly. Unemployment is expected to remain stable or decline gradually, and core
CPI inflation and wage growth are projected to remain broadly stable in 2006 and 2007.
10.
In the medium term, with investment declining only gradually from current
highs relative to GDP, net foreign liabilities are expected to keep rising. Continued
robust export growth is expected to help drive real GDP growth averaging about 3¼ percent
in the medium term.6 Owing to expanding global resource supply, export commodity prices
are assumed to start declining after a few years, resulting in slowing investment and a
narrowing of the external deficit. While net external liabilities could rise to about 70 percent
of GDP by 2011, external debt dynamics are reasonably robust to shocks (Table 5 and
Figure 7). The authorities continue to monitor Australia’s external position closely, and they
noted that the private sector’s net foreign liabilities had been broadly stable relative to the
market value of business assets: the external deficit did not imply that Australia was
“consuming its capital.”7 Solid growth in the business capital stock and in exports are

Analyses of resource sector capital projects by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
and by Access Economics support the outlook for strong growth in commodity exports in the medium term.
7

This balance sheet perspective on the external position is elaborated by Guy Debelle, “Comments on
Understanding Global Imbalances,” June 2006 (http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/conf/conf51/index.htm).

8
11.
Commodity prices are a source of uncertainty in the medium term. Past increases
in Australia’s terms of trade have been followed by global supply and demand responses that
have tended to reverse about half of the gains within a few years. The authorities are
therefore budgeting on the prudent assumption that coal and iron ore prices revert to
historical average levels by 2008/09—implying a fall of about 25 percent in Australia’s
export commodity prices—while recognizing that there are risks on both sides:
•

Commodity prices could fall more rapidly if global and/or Chinese growth slows.
The authorities explore such a scenario in the 2006/07 Budget, noting that the
macroeconomic impact of the current terms of trade boom had been greatly reduced
compared with the past. They attribute this change to reforms, such as the floating
exchange rate and greater relative wage flexibility, and consider that these structural
changes would also facilitate adjustment to future commodity price declines, although
GDP growth could still slow significantly.8 If the global slow down stemmed from a
disorderly adjustment in global imbalances the resulting fall in the Australian dollar could
be amplified, although this would have relatively little impact on private sector balance
sheets owing to extensive foreign exchange hedging.9

•

But sustained high commodity prices could also pose challenges. Owing to the long
lead times in resource sector capacity expansion, and the strength of global commodity
demand, commodity price declines could take longer to eventuate. While this scenario
would be welcome for Australia, it could prolong upward pressure on interest rates and
the exchange rate, and result in more divergent growth outcomes across the States.

12.
Risks to consumer spending
from the housing market and household
balance sheets appear to have further
diminished. House prices increased by
3¼ percent from the end of 2003 until the
first quarter of 2006, well below the
14 percent rise in household disposable
incomes over this period.10 Moreover,
activity in the housing market has shifted
away from investors to owner occupiers,
migration inflows have increased, and,

These reforms are discussed in Craig Beaumont and Li Cui, “Australia’s Adaptation to a Floating Exchange
Rate,” IMF Country Report No. 05/330 (forthcoming as an IMF Policy Discussion Paper).

In March 2005, 79 percent of Australia’s net foreign currency debt was hedged through derivatives: see
“Australia’s Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging Practices,” RBA Bulletin, December 2005.
10

120

Regional variation in house prices has been substantial—since the end of 2003, house prices have fallen by
almost 10 percent in Sydney whereas they have risen over 50 percent in Perth. A forthcoming working paper
uses data on the Australian States to model the linkages between household consumption and housing prices.

9
unlike past cycles, there is no backlog of excess construction.11 Hence, while house prices
still appear to be elevated relative to rents and incomes, most analysts expect the soft landing
will continue. Household indebtedness has continued to rise, with debt reaching 152 percent
of disposable income in the first quarter, although debt is equivalent to only one-fifth of
household assets. The RBA’s March 2006 Financial Stability Review found few signs of
household financial distress; arrears on mortgages have increased a little from 2004, but at
0.3 percent of outstanding loans they are very low by international standards, and bank credit
card arrears also remain low.12 The authorities attribute the rise in mortgage arrears mainly to
a deliberate easing by financial institutions of their conservative credit standards, although an
increase in arrears in New South Wales was associated with a rise in bankruptcies.
B. Monetary and Fiscal Policies are Well Positioned
13.
Monetary policy can respond flexibly to potential shocks. With core inflation
expected to remain within 2½ to 3 percent in 2006-07 at the time of the mission, the RBA
saw no need to change the monetary stance in the near term, although the recent firming in
indicators such as household spending suggested that the next change would be a tightening.
Staff agreed that continuing with a pre-emptive approach would reduce the risk that a larger,
potentially more disruptive, tightening might be needed later. In the event, the RBA lifted
rates in August, reflecting an assessment that economic activity remained strong, and that
underlying inflation was likely to exceed previous forecasts. Staff noted that if export
commodity prices stayed high in coming years, strong domestic demand may be prolonged,
requiring interest rates to be higher than otherwise; with resource shifts already evident
between the States, the RBA did not consider that concerns about a “two speed” economy
would hinder monetary policy. If, on the other hand, global activity slowed and commodity
prices fell, the Australian dollar could depreciate significantly, but the RBA would still have
room to cut interest rates if needed because exchange rate pass-through has diminished, and
the inflation targeting framework for monetary policy is focused on the medium term.
14.
The Australian dollar is relatively high by historical standards, but it is not clear
that the exchange rate is significantly misaligned. IMF staff estimates the Australian dollar
was 5 percent above its multilateral equilibrium in February-March 2006, and the exchange
rate on a trade-weighted basis remains close to that level.13 Given the uncertainty about key
fundamentals the authorities consider it difficult to determine whether the currency is
misaligned; indeed, the exchange rate was lower than might be expected given the rise in
commodity prices. Reduced competitiveness of the manufacturing and services sectors has
11

Australia’s strong employment growth and migration inflows have had spillover effects on New Zealand’s
economy, because migration outflows to Australia have risen in spite of an already tight labor market.

12

The reluctance to default on mortgages may partly reflect the fact that borrowers remain personally liable for
the debt: see Ellis et al, 2006, Housing finance in Australia, (http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs26cbpapers.htm).

13

This evaluation is based on a macroeconomic balance approach (Isard and Faruquee, 1998, Exchange Rate

15.
With the high terms of trade supporting economic growth and tax revenue, the
government has appropriately targeted larger-than-usual budget surpluses. 14 Even
allowing for a substantial decline in commodity prices, the 2006/07 Budget projects the
underlying cash surplus to remain at 1 percent of GDP in the medium term, well above the
objective of balancing the budget over the cycle. Compared with the previous budget, and
before new policy measures, revenue is projected to be 1½ percent of GDP higher in 2006/07
and in later years.15 While agreeing that this revision was substantial, the authorities
considered that the risks to the revenue

Chapter II of the forthcoming selected issues paper analyzes the fiscal impact of swings in commodity prices,
and discusses the appropriate fiscal policy response to commodity price swings.

15

Following a number of revenue under predictions the authorities revised the revenue projection methodology
in the 2005/06 budget to make the projections more elastic with respect to incomes.

16

The personal tax measures include additional increases in income thresholds for each tax bracket and
reductions of 2 percentage points in the top marginal tax rates (formerly 42 and 47 percent).

The 2006/07 budget implies a mild fiscal stimulus. The fiscal surplus is projected to
decline by ½ percent of GDP in 2006/07, but most of this decline reflects tax cuts, which,
based on past experience, are generally expected to largely be saved. Hence the 2006/07
budget is not expected to put significant pressure on inflation or monetary policy.
Nonetheless, with resource utilization already high, the mission recommended that the
authorities limit changes in fiscal policies if revenue again runs ahead of budget estimates in
2006/07, allowing the fiscal surplus to exceed the budget target as was expected to occur in
2005/06. Moreover, if, in coming years, Australia faced a global slow-down, reducing
growth and resulting in a large fall in commodity prices, staff noted that the strong fiscal
position would allow a temporary move into deficit if needed.
17.
The government is continuing to address long-term fiscal challenges. The Future
Fund announced in the 2005/06 budget has now been established, and it is well placed to
invest future budget surpluses (Box 1). To boost incentives to work and save, increase

C. Vigilance Remains the Watchword for Financial Supervision
18.
Australia’s financial system is healthy, profitable, and resilient to shocks. The
recent FSAP also found that prudential supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority (APRA) and market conduct supervision by the Australian Securities and
Investment Commission (ASIC) are sound, with a high level of compliance with
international standards, and at the forefront of best practices in a number of areas. Stress tests
did not reveal near-term stability concerns, including in the event of a scenario combining a
sharp recession, large falls in both house prices and the exchange rate, and a significant rise
in the cost of wholesale funding. The authorities found the FSAP stress tests very useful;
building on this exercise, they expect to conduct further stress tests in coming years.
19.
The authorities endorsed the key recommendations of the FSAP (Box 2).
Regarding supervisory capacity, the authorities noted that APRA’s resources had been
increased in recent years, and that funding arrangements for ASIC were revised in the
2006/07 budget to enhance flexibility. ASIC is comfortable that its resources are adequate;
APRA saw moderating turnover among junior staff as the remaining priority to strengthen

12
supervisory capacity, and was examining this issue within a broader human resource
management context. APRA also agreed with the need to ensure suitable risk management by
authorized deposit-taking institutions (ADI) that were entering new businesses, noting that
supervisors were making assessments of ADI risk management capabilities, and that greater
use of differentiated capital requirements was expected in future.
20.
Financial supervision is alert to potential vulnerabilities. The FSSA highlights that
banks face a number of interrelated areas of vulnerability, including heavy exposure to
households with historically high debt levels, the elevated level of house prices, an easing in
credit standards, and banks’ reliance on wholesale funding.17 APRA had responded to
emerging risks by tightening the mortgage insurance requirements for “low doc” loans to
qualify for a 50 percent risk weight. To help assess the impact of changing lending standards
on housing loan portfolios, APRA is collecting detailed data on banks’ mortgage lending to
better understand the underlying debt service capacity of households. Regarding wholesale
funding, APRA noted that it was an early adopter of a scenario approach to liquidity
regulation, and that it had seen ongoing improvement by ADIs in diversifying their funding
sources, lengthening maturities, and avoiding concentrations of rollover dates. Moreover,
with the goal of promoting further improvements in liquidity management, APRA was
undertaking a wide ranging review of liquidity regulation that is drawing on international
practices, which the mission welcomed.
21.
To guard against complacency in an environment of sustained favorable
financial developments the authorities are embarked on an important initiative to
formalize the framework for failure resolution and crisis management. The authorities
are continuing to develop the legal foundations and policy approach of this framework,
which by achieving timely and minimally disruptive resolution of failed institutions at the
least fiscal cost, will help to sustain the confidence of foreign and domestic investors during a
crisis. The mission agreed that the proposed Financial Claims Compensation Scheme would
be a useful element of such a framework. The authorities are also seeking to pass legislation
to provide APRA with the legal powers needed to deal with a troubled general insurer.
22.
Steps to enhance supervisory cooperation with New Zealand are welcome given
the interdependence of the two banking systems. The Australian and New Zealand
authorities recently agreed legislative changes to promote enhanced cooperation between
APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (FSSA, Box 3). The mission fully supported
the ongoing discussions to improve the coordination of official responses to a financial crisis.
23.
Legislation to address AMF/CFT issues will be tabled in 2006. Since late 2003,
the government has undertaken an extensive review of AML/CFT legislation, including
consideration of the recommendations of the October 2005 FATF mutual evaluation.

17

Deposits are one-quarter of bank funding, down from 40 percent of funding in the early 1990s, partly because
households have shifted their portfolios following the introduction of mandatory superannuation contributions.

13
D. Growth Prospects Hinge on Putting Structural Reforms into Effect
24.
Room remains to further lift productivity and incomes. Australian per capita
incomes slipped relative to other advanced economies during the 1970s and 1980s. But there
was significant progress to close these gaps in the 1990s because productivity surged in
response to wide-ranging structural reforms and ICT-related innovations. However,
productivity growth has slowed in the first half of this decade, so Australian incomes have
tended to level out relative to other advanced economies, and they remain just over
20 percent below the level in the United States. A recent study estimates that only about half
of the difference in productivity levels that underpins this income gap can be accounted for
by Australia’s remoteness from global markets.18

The new National Reform Agenda, agreed by the Council of Australian
Governments (COAG) in February 2006, sets out an appropriately ambitious reform
program for the decade ahead. The reform agenda has been broadened to include human
capital and regulation issues, which is important since the long-term payoffs from enhancing
education, training, and health care are likely to be seen in higher productivity and labor
participation. Competition related reforms are at various stages:19
•

Export infrastructure: COAG has agreed a simpler and nationally consistent system of
regulation for ports, railways, and other export-related infrastructure, to reduce regulatory
uncertainty and compliance costs for owners, users, and investors. The mission urged
timely implementation given the large potential for growth in resource sector exports.

14
•

Land transportation and electricity: The Productivity Commission is undertaking an
inquiry to identify the optimal methods and timeframes for introducing efficient road and
rail freight infrastructure pricing, and the Energy Reform Implementation Group is
charged with making proposals to achieve a fully national electricity market. These
reports will lay the foundation for the development of action plans in these vital areas.

•

Water: The National Water Initiative, agreed in 2004, aims to achieve full trading in
water rights by 2014. However, water trade is currently mostly limited to within
catchments, and key steps to facilitate interstate water trading between New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia are falling behind the implementation timeframe.

26.
The challenge is to steadfastly implement action plans to achieve these goals.
Australia has an admirable track record of implementing wide-ranging structural reforms
over the past two decades even though its Federal structure presents challenges of political
coordination (Box 3). Nonetheless, there is a concern that the commodity price boom could
dampen the appetite for implementing reform going forward. To realize the large potential
benefits from these reforms, the mission encouraged sustained and determined leadership
from the Commonwealth government, arguing that this is an auspicious time to accelerate
reforms by using some of the recent surge in revenues to spur action. The authorities agreed
that timely reform implementation is important, and the COAG meeting in July 2006
advanced the discussion of funding arrangements for the National Reform Agenda.
27.
The government is making a concerted effort to expand employment. The
WorkChoices reforms of industrial relations came into effect in March 2006.20 The resulting
increases in labor demand may be most evident among small businesses.21 Employment
gains will be reinforced by labor supply increases owing to the tightening of eligibility
requirements for Disability Support Pensions and Parenting Payments in the 2005/06 budget,
and also to measures in the 2006/07 budget that reduce effective marginal tax rates—which
can be as high as 74 percent for some levels of personal income.22 Maintaining labor market
flexibility will be crucial to facilitate smooth adjustment of the economy to potential swings
in commodity prices or other shocks.
28.
Australia plans to double its official development assistance. The 2006/07 Budget
sets aside an estimated 0.3 percent of national income for ODA, up from 0.25 percent in
2005. By 2010 Australia plans to double its ODA from 2004 levels, which will continue to be
focused on the Asia-Pacific region.
20

The main changes are to expand the coverage of the federal jurisdiction, simplify minimum working
conditions, establish the Fair Pay Commission to set minimum wages, and limit the coverage of unfair dismissal
laws to employers with more than 100 employees.

21
22

See Mark Wooden, 2006, “Implications of Work Choices Legislation,” Agenda, Volume 13, Number 2.

Key measures reducing effective marginal take rates at lower income levels are the increase in the threshold
for the 30 percent income tax rate, the expansion of Low Income Tax Offset, a cut in Medicare levies from 20
to 10 percent at low income levels, and the increase in income thresholds for family benefits.

15
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Australia’s economic performance has been robust and prospects remain bright.
After 14 years of expansion, with only a modest slowing in 2005 following a welcome
cooling of the housing market, growth is strengthening again. Strong business investment,
owing to high capacity utilization and the highest terms of trade in three decades, is laying
the foundation for solid export-led growth in the medium term. However, past experience
suggests that much of the terms of trade improvement will, sooner or later, be reversed.
30.
When this happens, or, if there are other shocks, macroeconomic policies are
well positioned. Monetary policy has been tightened appropriately, and, given the relatively
high level of resource utilization, a further tightening may eventually be needed to reduce
inflation pressures. The Australian dollar is relatively high, but it is not clear that it is
significantly misaligned. Flexibility in the exchange rate, and the medium-term focus of
monetary policy, continue to provide important cushions against potential external shocks.
Australia’s fiscal position is enviable: few countries have been able to eliminate net public
debt while also providing significant tax cuts. Even after making prudent allowance for a
decline in commodity prices the medium-term fiscal outlook is robust, which is another
valuable buffer against shocks. The fiscal surplus should be allowed to exceed budget targets
if growth and revenues are strong. Although potential vulnerabilities are contained by
Australia’s sound macroeconomic policies and sophisticated risk management by the private
sector, close monitoring of private external debt should continue.
31.
Financial supervision must remain vigilant. Australia’s financial system is healthy
and financial supervision is sound, but continuing efforts will be needed to promote robust
risk management practices by financial institutions as they enter new businesses and face
growing competitive pressures. Hence, APRA’s close monitoring of household debt service
capacity, plans to conduct further stress tests, the review of liquidity regulation, and efforts to
moderate staff turnover are welcome. The authorities’ initiative to ensure the legal
foundations for timely and minimally disruptive resolution of failed institutions, at the least
fiscal cost, is important to help underpin the resilience of the financial system during a crisis.
32.
Now is the time to press ahead with the ambitious National Reform Agenda to lift
productivity and participation over the next decade. The reform agenda has been
broadened appropriately to include human capital issues, yet implementation is lagging in
crucial areas such as trading in water. The recent surge in revenues provides resources that
should be used to spur reform implementation. By sustaining strong economic growth, these
reforms will help narrow the gap between living standards in Australia and those in the most
advanced economies, and better position Australia to address the challenges of an ageing
population and rising healthcare costs.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Australia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

16
Box 1. The Future Fund
Australia faces significant long-term fiscal challenges that that government aims to tackle
principally through structural reforms. By 2045 it is estimated that the annual fiscal balance of the
general government will deteriorate by 6½ percent of GDP, with increases in health spending accounting
for about 70 percent of this fall.1 The government’s strategy to address this challenge emphasizes
structural reforms to lift productivity and labor participation. This approach is facilitated by the
relatively gradual ageing of the population in Australia, and the fact that retirement income
arrangements rely primarily on mandatory private pensions.
To complement this overall strategy, the Future Fund (FF) was established in April 2006 to cover
unfunded public service pensions, which will address about one-tenth of the estimated long-term
fiscal gap. While new public service pensions are fully funded, there remains an outstanding liability for
earlier pension schemes. The goal of the FF is to cover this liability by 2020, requiring the accumulation
of an estimated A$140 billion in assets. The FF will receive inflows from future fiscal surpluses,
privatization proceeds, and its own investment income. Outflows from the FF will not begin until 2020,
or when the liability is fully covered, and can only be used to meet the pension payments covered by the
FF, which are projected to average about 0.6 percent of GDP.
FF assets could grow rapidly in coming years. Seed capital of A$18 billion was provided in May, and
around A$12 billion should be added in September after the 2005/06 budget outcome is confirmed.
Completing the privatization of Telstra could lift the fund to over A$50 billion. If fiscal surpluses
projected in the next three or four years are realized, and assuming the FF earns reasonable returns, it will
be well placed to reach its long-term goals.
The FF enjoys substantial flexibility in its investment strategy. The investment mandate adopted in
May sets a long-term benchmark average annual real return of at least 4½ to 5½ percent, and puts just
two main restrictions on investments. First, the FF is not to hold controlling stakes, so there is a
20 percent ceiling on holdings of any listed company. Second, the FF is to “act in a manner that
minimizes the potential to cause any abnormal change in the volatility or efficient operation of the
Australian financial markets.” The main implication of the latter is that the FF must limit its outright
holdings of the relatively small available stock of Commonwealth government bonds. Otherwise the FF
is free to set its risk tolerance and asset allocation, such as between domestic and foreign assets. It is
envisaged that management of the funds will be contracted out to private managers for some time.
Governance of the FF is consistent with international best practice.2 The Board of Guardians of the
FF was appointed in late March, consisting of the Chairman and six members, all of whom have
significant expertise in investment management and corporate governance, and none of whom are
government employees. With the FF essentially being a financial subsidiary of the government, the
government has retained the right to direct the Board by changing the investment mandate. However,
there are strong protections against the misuse of this power—if the Board considers that the new
mandate is inconsistent with the basic objectives of the FF it has the right to table a submission to
Parliament opposing the change. This transparency should minimize the risk of politically motivated
investments, such as in infrastructure projects, while also protecting the capability of the FF to pursue
investment strategies with a long-term horizon.

Box 2. Key Recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment
The following outlines the main recommendations from Australia’s recent participation
in the Financial Sector Assessment Program. A more detailed discussion and additional
recommendations are found in the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA).

1

•

Banking: APRA should continue to ensure strong risk management practices
including through regular stress testing. As authorized deposit-taking institutions
(ADI) shift away from real estate lending and into businesses such as SME lending,
wealth management, and expansion overseas, the FSSA emphasizes the importance of
monitoring and evaluating the capacity of ADIs to manage these new risks, and
setting appropriately strong capital requirements. The FSSA also recommends that
the authorities build on the experience with the FSAP stress tests by requesting that
banks conduct stress tests on a regular basis to further strengthen their risk
management capacity.

•

Failure Resolution and Crisis Management: Continue to develop a formal process
to manage the failure of individual institutions and more widespread crises.
Historically, there have been very few failures of financial institutions, and past
responses to troubled institutions have been ad hoc and relied on provision of official
support. Hence, the authorities have begun to develop a comprehensive framework
for the resolution of failed institutions and crisis management. The FSSA strongly
supports this initiative because it would minimize the likelihood that the government
will be forced to resort to costly bailouts to protect systemic stability. The FSSA
notes that the main requirement for such a framework is to ensure that the necessary
legal powers to implement a speedy and orderly resolution are in place. The proposed
Financial Claims Compensation Scheme could be a useful element of such a
framework.

•

Supervisory Capacity: Ensure that the supervisory agencies have adequate
resources and flexibility. APRA has increased staff resources by almost 50 percent
since the failure of the HIH Group in 2001, and it has a cadre of experienced senior
staff. Nonetheless, turnover among more junior staff is relatively high, which could
potentially have adverse affects on its supervisory capacity. Financial institutions will
need to put greater emphasis on risk management, especially under Basel II,
increasing the demand for these skills. Hence it will be important to ensure that both
APRA and ASIC have the financial resources, and flexibility in deploying these
resources, that are needed to ensure that sufficiently well-qualified staff are available
to meet the challenges of implementing Basel II and effectively implementing
principle-based approaches to supervision, especially of the large banks.

18
Box 3. Achieving Structural Reform in a Federal System
Structural issues are often in the jurisdiction of the Australian States. The Australian Government (or
the Commonwealth) has few exclusive powers, and in a large number of areas it can only exercise powers
concurrently with the six State Governments, who retain responsibility for all other areas.1 Nonetheless,
the Commonwealth can influence State policies and programs by granting financial assistance on terms
and conditions that it specifies. To coordinate their policies, the Commonwealth and State governments
meet biannually in the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
A cooperative approach to structural reforms yielded handsome dividends in the past decade. The
National Competition Policy (NCP) was agreed by COAG in 1994 with the goal of promoting efficiency
gains through competitive national markets. Implementation of reforms across the levels of government
was required to reduce legal barriers to competition, ensure competitive neutrality for government
businesses, enhance third-party access to infrastructure, and reform the transport, electricity, gas, and
water sectors. It is estimated that the NCP-related reforms raised GDP by 2½ percent in the 1990s.2
Successful implementation of NCP reforms was underpinned by political leadership, but also by
two factors that may be of interest for other countries:
•

The benefits of reforms were shared through conditional payments to the States. Part of the
benefits of reforms accrue to the Commonwealth through higher income taxes, so “competition
payments” were established to recycle these gains back to the States. The actual payments to the
States were subject to penalties if reform commitments were not met, as assessed by the
independent National Competition Council. While these penalties were usually not large relative
to State budgets, in practice they could have significant leverage.

•

The Productivity Commission also assisted reform.3 The Productivity Commission provides
advice to governments on structural reform, and its legislation ensures independence, openness,
and an economy-wide focus. Importantly, its advice is shaped by extensive public submissions in
response to draft reports, tending to expose weaknesses in the arguments of vested interests,
increasing the awareness of the broader public, and refining the recommendations, thereby
promoting consensus on the need for reforms and on the best way forward.

The National Reform Agenda will require a broadening of reform cooperation, with a continuing
role for Commonwealth funding and for analytical support from the Productivity Commission. The
COAG has agreed to establish an independent body, the COAG Reform Council (CRC), to report to
COAG annually on progress in implementing the National Reform Agenda. If funding is needed to ensure
a fair sharing of the costs and benefits of reform, the Commonwealth will provide funding to the States
and Territories on a case-by-case basis once specific implementation plans have been developed—plans
for transport, energy, and infrastructure regulation are expect to be available in early 2007. The amount of
funding will take into account the relevant costs and benefits, and the CRC will draw on the resources of
the Productivity Commission in making cost-benefit assessments of the various reform options.

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2006. This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging
covers 79 percent of foreign currency debt, consistent with the findings of a survey by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, as reported in "Australia's Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging Practices," RBA Bulletin,

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.
7/ This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging covers 79 percent of foreign currency debt, consistent with the findings of a survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as reported in "Australia's Foreign Currency Exposure
and Hedging Practices," RBA Bulletin, December 2005.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. Australia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free from
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for
exchange restrictions that are maintained solely for the preservation of national or international
security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51). The exchange rate is independently floating, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains
discretionary power to intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange.
VIII. Restrictions on Capital Transactions. Australia maintains a capital transactions regime that is
virtually free of restrictions. Two main restrictions on foreigners require: authorization for significant
ownership of Australian corporations; and approval for acquisition of real estate.
IX.
Article IV Consultation. Australia is on the 12–month consultation cycle. The 2005 Article IV
consultation discussions were held during June 8-17, 2005, the Executive Board discussed the staff report
(IMF Country Report No. 05/331) and concluded the consultation on August 29, 2005.
X.
FSAP Participation. The FSAP missions took place during November 30-December 14, 2005,
and March 26-April 12, 2006. The FSSA (including financial sector ROSCs) will be discussed by the
Executive Board in the context of the 2006 Article IV consultation.
XI.
Fourth Amendment. Australia has accepted the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement.

ANNEX II. AUSTRALIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Australia publishes a wide array of economic and financial data, which are considered adequate for
surveillance purposes. It has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In recent years,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics has taken several initiatives to further improve the quality of the
data, such as including the prices of financial services in the CPI and developing new measures of
labor underutilization.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On October 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Australia.1
Background
Australia’s economic performance continues to be robust and prospects remain bright.
The economy is entering its 16th year of expansion, reflecting the benefits of wide-ranging
structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policies. After a modest slowing in 2005 following
a welcome cooling of the housing market, growth is expected to strengthen once more because
strong global growth has lifted Australia’s terms of trade to the highest level in three decades.
As a result, business investment has risen sharply, laying the foundation for solid export-led
growth in the medium term.
Real GDP growth eased to 2¾ percent in 2005 as consumption growth declined and dwelling
investment fell modestly following the cooling of the housing market. The slow down was
cushioned by rapid growth in business capital spending, with investment being particularly
strong in the mining sector. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8 percent in recent months,
its lowest level in 30 years, but there has been little generalized wage pressure. Nonetheless,
resource utilization is relatively high in some sectors and regions, and the Reserve Bank of
Australia’s (RBA) preferred measure of the core CPI inflation edged up to almost 3 percent (y/y)
in June, while headline CPI inflation was 4 percent y/y owing to rising oil and fruit prices.
The external current account deficit was 6 percent of GDP in 2005, exceeding its typical level of
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

about 4½ percent owing to high business investment. The trade deficit narrowed with the rise in
export prices, but export volume growth was slow, reflecting unfavorable weather, the
appreciated exchange rate, and disruptions of transport infrastructure for commodity exports.
More recently, the trade and current account deficits have both eased somewhat.
The Australian dollar has been broadly stable, but remains relatively high by historical
standards, at about 12 percent above its 20-year average in real effective terms in September
2006. Net foreign liabilities reached a new high, at 57 percent of GDP, but the ratio of net
interest payments to exports remained low at 9 percent.
Monetary policy was tightened modestly, with the RBA raising the target cash rate to 6 percent
in two 25 basis point steps in May and August 2006. The fiscal position continues to be robust,
with fiscal surpluses recorded in eight of the past nine years. Indeed, the net debt of the
Australian government was eliminated in April 2006. The underlying cash balance for the
2005/06 fiscal year was 1.6 percent of GDP, ½ percentage point higher than budgeted owing to
strong revenues. The 2006/07 budget targets a fiscal surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP, and
projects the surplus to remain at 1 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Growth is expected to pick up to about 3 percent in 2006 and 3½ percent in 2007. Domestic
demand growth is expected to slow gradually as investment growth moderates. With mining
sector projects scheduled to come on stream, higher exports will help reduce the trade deficit,
but the external current account deficit will decline more modestly owing to rising equity income
outflows. Unemployment is expected to remain stable or decline gradually, and core CPI
inflation and wage growth are projected to remain broadly stable. In the medium term, export
commodity prices are assumed to decline significantly owing to an expansion in the global
capacity of the mining sector, but there are both upside and downside risks to this outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Australia’s current economic expansion is now in its sixteenth year and unemployment has
fallen below 5 percent for the first time in three decades. Executive Directors commended the
authorities on their sound macroeconomic management and continuing structural reform efforts
that have underpinned the sustained strong economic performance. Looking ahead,
macroeconomic policies are well positioned to face potential external shocks, and Directors
were confident that the authorities will press ahead with necessary reforms to address mediumterm growth and fiscal challenges.
Directors judged that monetary policy has been tightened appropriately as the medium-term
prospects for inflation had risen owing to rising world commodity prices and the relatively high
level of resource utilization in some sectors and regions. They noted that further monetary
tightening may eventually be needed if domestic demand growth or other factors lead to an
increase in underlying inflation pressure. Although the Australian dollar is relatively high by
historical standards, Directors saw no clear signs of misalignment given the high level of
commodity prices and the prospects for stronger growth in export volumes.
Directors commended Australia’s continued strong fiscal position, observing that the elimination
of net public debt by the Australian government was an impressive milestone that few countries
have been able to achieve. With the budget expected to remain in surplus in the medium term,
Directors endorsed the establishment of the Future Fund to invest these surpluses to help

3
Australia manage its long-term fiscal challenges. Noting that the current fiscal policy stance is
mildly stimulatory at a time of relatively high resource utilization in some sectors and regions,
Directors recommended that the fiscal surplus be allowed to exceed budget targets if growth
and revenues are higher than expected.
Directors noted that that much of the recent improvement in Australia’s terms of trade may
eventually be reversed, and that there are also broader downside risks to the global economic
outlook in the medium term. Nonetheless, Directors considered that Australia’s macroeconomic
policies, flexible exchange rate regime, and the robust medium-term fiscal outlook and the
medium-term focus of monetary policy provide substantial cushions to help the economy cope
with a fall in commodity prices or other shocks. Although potential vulnerabilities are contained
and private sector risk management practices are sufficient, Directors recommended that the
authorities continue to monitor private external debt closely.
Australia’s participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program was welcomed by
Directors, and they endorsed the finding that Australia’s financial system is healthy and financial
supervision is sound. Nevertheless, with financial institutions entering new businesses and
facing growing competition, Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant by promoting
robust risk management practices. In this regard, Directors welcomed the close monitoring of
household debt servicing capacity by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, along with
the review of liquidity regulation that is currently underway, and they fully supported the
authorities’ request to the banks to conduct regular stress tests. They also welcomed the steps
taken to enhance supervisory cooperation with New Zealand. Directors emphasized that the
authorities’ ongoing work to ensure the legal foundations for timely and minimally disruptive
resolutions of failed institutions was important to underpin the resilience of the financial system
and minimize fiscal cost.
Directors welcomed the agreement between the Australian and state governments on the
ambitious National Reform Agenda to lift productivity and labor participation over the next
decade. They supported the broadening of the reform agenda to include human capital issues
such as education, training, and health care. However, Directors recognized that progress on
this reform agenda would be challenging, as evidenced by the lagging reform implementation in
crucial areas—such as trading in water. Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to make
appropriate use of the resources provided by the recent surge in fiscal revenues to help spur
the implementation of reforms. They considered that such an investment in reforms would help
sustain strong economic growth and better position Australia to address the challenges of an
ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation with Australia is also available.
