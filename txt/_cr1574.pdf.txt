STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 17, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Indonesia has strengthened policy and reserve buffers since mid 2013, in the
face of global headwinds from the commodity down-cycle and episodes of volatility
affecting emerging market economies. Policies have aimed at containing external and
inflation pressures, helping to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability. With
growth slowing, the new government is keen to jump start supply-side reforms aimed at
raising potential growth while strengthening the external position. Upfront actions to
curb fuel subsidies have opened fiscal space to support infrastructure spending.
Near-term outlook: After slowing in 2014, growth is projected to tick up to 5.2 percent
in 2015, factoring in an anticipated jump in public investment in infrastructure. Inflation
has temporarily risen on earlier fuel price increases, but is expected to return to within
the target band by year end. Notwithstanding soft commodity prices, the current
account deficit is projected to narrow further in 2015. Risks to the outlook arise mainly
from a deeper-than-expected slowdown in emerging market trading partners and
surges in global financial market volatility, which could exacerbate strains on the
domestic banking and corporate sectors.
Policy mix: The current policy mix aims at improving growth potential while
consolidating recent stability gains and containing vulnerabilities. Fiscal policy should be
geared towards securing space for more social and capital spending, underpinned by a
broad-based strategy for increasing nonoil tax revenues, while pursuing moderate deficit
reduction over the medium term. Monetary policy needs to remain focused on
anchoring inflation expectations and facilitating external adjustment, supported by
continued exchange rate and bond yield flexibility. Bank funding pressures, while
showing signs of easing, will need to be managed through stronger policy coordination
and improved market functionality. Financial stability is expected to be preserved
through enhanced risk assessment and effective prudential measures, anchored by a
strong crisis management framework. Structural reforms should be aimed at easing
supply bottlenecks and improving the investment climate in order to create new jobs,
bolster medium-term growth prospects, and strengthen the external position.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Since mid 2013, Indonesia has taken significant steps to strengthen policy and reserve
buffers, in the face of strong headwinds confronting major commodity exporters and episodes of
heightened market volatility in emerging market economies (EMEs).1 Aided by enhanced policy
credibility and global push factors, external inflows to Indonesia have been supportive the past
18 months. Equity prices rebounded in the first half of the 2014, including relative to most EME
peers. Government bond yields have stabilized, with the fixed-income market buoyed by strong
foreign inflows, which has led to an increase in reserves and helped keep the rupiah relatively stable
against the U.S. dollar (Box 1).
2.
However, the economy continues to be buffeted by a shift in the terms of trade
against commodity exporters, with significant macro-financial implications (Figure 1). The
commodity down-cycle has weakened the current account, dampened new investment, and resulted
in a growth slowdown.2 As a consequence, corporate cash flows have been constrained, which has
caused bank deposit growth to slow sharply and contributed to funding pressures. More recently,
credit growth has decelerated, in part due to monetary and macro prudential policy measures, which
have led to a moderate tightening in financial conditions (Figure 2). Household demand for credit
has also slowed, affecting private consumption and property prices. At the same time, private
external borrowing has risen, with firms taking advantage of lower borrowing costs abroad.
3.
Against this backdrop, the 2014 Article IV consultation focused on the challenge of
charting a course to higher growth while preserving macro-financial stability and
strengthening the external position. With a change in government in October 2014, the new
administration appears keen to ease longstanding supply bottlenecks through a reform strategy that
aims to raise potential growth. As a first step, it has taken decisive action to remove most fuel
subsidies with a view to freeing up space in the government budget for more growth-critical
spending. In keeping with this, the authorities have been steadfast in their commitment to
macroeconomic and financial stability, as Indonesia transitions away from commodity-supported to
more competitiveness-driven growth in a challenging global environment.

1

Indonesia is a significant commodity producer and exporter. Coal, palm oils, natural gas, crude oil, and processed
rubber are the top five commodity-related exports, with this category accounting for slightly more than half of total
exports in 2014.

Box 1. Indonesia: Managing Market Pressures
Since the taper tantrum in mid 2013, Indonesia has deployed a set of policy actions and
strengthened economic fundamentals to increase resilience to market shocks. Monetary and macro
prudential policies have been tightened and exchange rate and bond yield flexibility has increased in
1
response to market conditions. These actions have helped anchor inflation expectations, reduce external
pressures, and facilitate a rebuilding of reserves. In addition, financial market deepening measures to
improve the functionality of FX and money markets and to encourage prudent hedging by corporates
(including state-owned enterprises) have been initiated. Furthermore, the fiscal deficit has been held in
check through energy subsidy reforms and made more resilient to exchange rate shocks and financing
pressures, including through a freeing up of fuel prices and well-timed external bond issuances.
Due in part to these policy actions, Indonesia has weathered several bouts of market volatility
in 2014 relatively well. Most notably, during the Argentine debt default episode of January 2014,
Indonesia and India “…improved their current account and hardly witnessed a move in their currencies in
2
January compared with the May-December [2013] period when they had depreciated substantially.”
Throughout much of 2014, capital inflows to Indonesia have been highly supportive, although some
outflows occurred in the last quarter of the 2014 with a general decline in risk appetite toward emerging
markets (EMs). Nevertheless, Indonesia again fared better than most large EMs, with equity prices and
bond yields remaining broadly stable. Meanwhile, the relatively large movements in the exchange rate
helped absorb some of the pressure and limit reserve losses.
Nevertheless, risks of further surges in global financial market volatility remain (see Appendix I).
While fundamentals have improved, the current account deficit remains sizable, financial markets are still
relatively shallow, and the large share of rupiah bonds held by nonresidents poses potential rollover risks.
Nevertheless, following heightened volatility in the last quarter of 2014, bond yields have fallen moderately
since the beginning of the year, broadly in line with other EMs, with global financial conditions still
supportive, while equity prices have also rebounded on foreign buying.
Looking ahead, capital inflows to Indonesia are expected to slow in 2015, but remain supportive.
Recent market performance suggests that spillovers from a strong U.S. dollar, lackluster EM growth, and
continued oil market uncertainty remain manageable. Indonesia’s financial account could be subject to
further bouts of market volatility, but the current policy framework is expected to continue unpinning
3
positive sentiment. Meanwhile, FDI, which comes largely from Japan and other ASEAN countries, is
expected to stay supportive. Policy settings in Indonesia are also consistent with those recommended to
other large EMs facing potential balance of payments pressures—including Brazil, India, and Philippines—
where IMF advice has emphasized monetary policy tightness and exchange rate flexibility.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
Macroeconomic performance. Growth in Indonesia moderated to 5.1 percent in 2014 from
5.7 percent in 2013—in line with staff’s expectations and to its slowest pace in five years (Table 1
and Figure 3).3 While the growth in domestic demand was broadly unchanged, the contribution
from net exports was significantly weaker in 2014 owing to slowing EME growth, notably in China,
and the raw mineral ore export ban.4 However, the current account deficit likely narrowed
moderately in 2014, owing to the effects of the real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciation
(about 7 percent since mid 2013) and of lower oil prices on imports. Headline inflation moved back
above BI’s target band towards end 2014 following administered fuel price hikes in November.
Vulnerability indicators improved modestly in 2014, except financial ones, which weakened slightly
(Table 2).
5.
The near-term outlook will continue to be complicated by cross currents in the global
economy affecting financial conditions and commodity prices. While growth is expected to be
weighed down by commodity-related activities, prospects should improve as the domestic reform
momentum gathers pace. The impact of the fall in oil prices should help dampen inflation pressures
and buttress the current account through lower oil imports.


Real GDP growth is projected to tick up to 5.2 percent in 2015, with the output gap
effectively closed based on staff’s latest estimates of potential growth. Net exports are likely
to remain constrained by weak external demand, notwithstanding one-off factors that are
expected to boost oil and mineral exports.5 Private consumption growth is expected to slow
due mainly to reduced commodity incomes. While total investment growth should rise
moderately, the impulse is expected to come mainly from higher public infrastructure
spending. Private investment growth will likely remain subdued because of funding
constraints. Barring a pick up in public investment, real GDP growth could be lower in 2015.
Funding pressures could also intensify if capital inflows are lower than envisaged and/or
budgetary pressures affect system-wide liquidity, limiting space for new lending.

3

A new GDP series, rebased to 2010, was issued in February 2015 (Box 2). It lowered real GDP growth rates by an
average of 0.1 percentage points during 2009‒14, while recording a slowdown in growth to 5.0 percent in 2014 from
5.5 percent in 2013. The new series also raised nominal GDP, marginally affecting key macro indicators such as the
current account and fiscal balances, as well as investment and saving ratios. The analysis and projections in this
report are based on the old (2000 base) GDP series.
4

The ban, approved in the Mining Law (2009), requires all raw mineral ores to be processed onshore to increase
domestic value added. When implementation commenced in early 2014, export taxes of 20-25 percent were initially
imposed on mining companies seeking a temporary waiver from the ban. The biggest impact was on copper
concentrate. In mid 2014, interim arrangements were reached allowing the resumption of copper exports while
granting tax concessions until new processing plants are built onshore.

8

The main factors are new production from the Cepu oil field and the full year effect of resumed copper exports.

Box 2. Indonesia: Rebased Gross Domestic Product
Statistics Indonesia (BPS) published a rebased GDP series in February 2015. The base year
was revised to 2010 from 2000 to reflect changes over the intervening decade in the country’s
economic structure, particularly in IT and
transportation, and the emergence of
new products. On the production side,
the industrial classification was expanded
to 17 sectors from 9 sectors.
Under the newly rebased series,
nominal GDP in 2010 increased by
around Rp 400 trillion or 6.5 percent.
Meanwhile, real GDP growth rates were
revised downward on average by around
0.1 percentage points during 2009‒14
owing to revised estimates derived from the expanded sectoral classifications. The increase in
the nominal GDP reflects two factors: the implementation of the System of National
Accounts 2008 and changes in volumes and prices. The increase appears modest compared to
other countries that have rebased GDP upward recently, such as Singapore (by 1.3 percent),
Malaysia (3.2 percent), Kenya (25.0 percent), and Nigeria (59.5 percent).



Headline inflation is expected to decline in 2015, with reductions in retail gasoline and
diesel prices under the new fuel price regime along with the passing through of the earlier
price increase expected to bring inflation back within BI’s target band (4.0±1 percent) by
year end, supported by maintenance of a relatively tight monetary stance.



The current account deficit is projected to narrow slightly in 2015 (Table 3 and Figure 4),
mainly due to a reduction in net oil imports, but adjustment is expected to be partially offset
by lower nonfuel commodity prices and weak external demand. The balance of payments
(BOP) recorded a sizeable surplus in 2014 on strong capital inflows, but a smaller surplus is
expected in 2015 on shifts in global financial conditions. Reserves at end 2014 were
US$111.9 billion, equivalent to 7 months of prospective imports of goods and services or
160 percent of the IMF’s reserve metric for a floating currency, which should be sufficient to
deal with most shocks.

6.
Risks and contingencies. Downside risks emanate mainly from external sources, but they
could exacerbate strains in the banking system and corporate sector (Appendix I: Risk Assessment
Matrix). Spillovers are predominantly inward, with outward spillovers negligible. Among the most
significant risks, a sharp slowdown in trading partner growth could dampen external demand and

commodity prices. Unexpected surges in global financial market volatility could increase BOP and
bank funding pressures. Relatively high dependence on foreign investors in the rupiah government
bonds market could heighten vulnerabilities. Persistent strength in the U.S. dollar could place further
strain on corporations’ balance sheets, with their foreign currency-denominated debt reaching
22 percent of GDP at end September 2014. Distress at small or mid-sized banks and among
corporates could be amplified by an incomplete crisis management framework and inadequate
hedging of foreign currency debt. In the event of an adverse BOP shock, tighter aggregate demand
management and continued exchange rate flexibility could help contain risks, with reserves used
cautiously to smooth excessive volatility. Contingent financing totaling US$76 billion is currently
available, inclusive of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization and bilateral swap arrangements.
7.
Medium-term outlook. The medium-term baseline is in line with the authorities’
announced policy intentions. It assumes the use of expanded fiscal space and implementation of
structural reforms aimed at closing infrastructure and skills gaps and raising private investment.
Growth is projected to rise to 6 percent by 2018, factoring in positive reform momentum, which is
also expected to raise growth potential through increases in factor productivity and capital stock
(Table 4). The current account deficit would narrow to 2½ percent of GDP in the medium term,
factoring in increased investment-related imports as well as a subdued outlook for commodity
prices. Gross FDI would continue to grow while portfolio inflows would remain supportive, with
reserves expected to remain above six months of imports. Risks to this outlook are moderately to
the downside, given the possibility of less supportive global financial conditions, more muted
growth in major trading partners, and slower and narrower reforms than envisaged in the current
baseline.
8.
Authorities’ views. The authorities generally agreed with staff on macroeconomic prospects
for 2014, but were more optimistic on the growth outlook in 2015 on expectations of a faster rise in
public investment. Views were broadly aligned on the inflation forecast and the external outlook.
The authorities generally concurred on the assessment of major risks facing the economy and
appropriate policy responses, noting that since the mid 2013 taper tantrum, the economy had
weathered several mini-episodes of EME turbulence comparatively well.
9.
External position and debt sustainability. Indonesia’s external position is assessed as
moderately weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, in line with
the 2014 Pilot ESR. Staff estimate the current account gap as 0‒2 percent of GDP weaker and the
REER 0−10 percent overvalued for 2014 (Box 3 and Appendix II). The main conclusions from the
Debt Sustainability Analysis (Appendix III) are broadly unchanged from the last Article IV
consultation. External debt remains at a moderate level, notwithstanding a rise in recent years owing
largely to private external borrowing and exchange rate depreciation. Debt and debt service ratios
are projected to be somewhat higher in the near term, but increases in FDI and equity inflows
should help reduce the share of debt financing over the medium term. Public debt also is relatively
low, with both it and external debt sustainable over the medium term.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Box 3. Indonesia: External Sector Assessment
Indonesia’s external position is found to be moderately weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.


Staff assesses the current account (CA) gap to be 0 percent to -2 percent of GDP, which is similar to EBA CA
estimates (Appendix II). Policy actions since mid 2013 should continue to gradually improve the external
position (Box 1).



The latest EBA CA estimates imply a gap of
-1.9 percent of GDP, based on a cyclically adjusted
CA balance of ‒2.3 percent of GDP and a norm of
-0.4 percent of GDP. However, taking uncertainties
into account, staff believes a norm of ‒1.5 percent
of GDP (±1 percent of GDP) more accurately
reflects Indonesia’s significant investment needs.



In contrast, EBA ES estimates suggest the CA is
about 1 percent of GDP above the level needed to
stabilize Indonesia’s net international investment
position (NIIP) over the medium term.



EBA REER estimates suggest an undervaluation at
end 2014 of about 8 percent. However, staff
assesses the REER to be overvalued by
0−10 percent, consistent with the recent erosion in
Indonesia’s terms of trade and projected falls in oil and gas production over the long run.

Indonesia’s CA deficit is projected to improve gradually. The 2014 deficit is expected to be about 3.0 percent
of GDP (compared to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013), as rising manufacturing exports and falling oil prices have
compensated for declines in other commodity exports. Looking ahead, manufacturing is expected to continue
to perform well, in line with increasing growth momentum in the United States and the lagged effect of
exchange rate depreciation.
For most of 2014, capital inflows, mainly in the form of FDI and investment in government bonds, were
above trend, but slowed in the latter part of the year. Going forward, they could further dissipate with a
large shock. Bank Indonesia built up reserves by US$13 billion in 2014 to US$112 billion at year end
(160 percent of the IMF’s reserve metric for a floating currency and 7 months of imports), partly reflecting the
1
government’s intake of dollar-based oil revenues and proceeds from sovereign issues. While the composite
metric may not adequately account for commodity price volatility, the current level of reserves should be
sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined drains also manageable.
The NIIP and external debt are at moderate levels and projected to remain stable. At end September 2014,
Indonesia’s NIIP was about ­49 percent of GDP, compared to -44 percent of GDP at end 2013. Gross external
liabilities were about 76 percent of GDP, up from 67 percent of GDP at end 2013. Gross external debt is
expected to be about 35 percent at end 2014, with short-term debt at around 6 percent of GDP. The debt
sustainability analysis (Appendix III) indicates that external and public debt are sustainable over the medium
term.

Since mid 2013, Indonesia has shifted towards a more flexible exchange rate policy framework, with a floating
regime better facilitating adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Policy discussions focused on improving growth potential while consolidating recent
stability gains and containing vulnerabilities. In the near term, the macroeconomic policy mix
appears broadly appropriate. To achieve its main policy objectives, the government will need a clear
revenue strategy to buttress its fiscal stance. A moderately low deficit would help contain bank
funding pressures and facilitate external adjustment. The monetary stance is well calibrated until
inflation and external pressures firmly ease. Financial stability is expected to be preserved through
prudential measures and close monitoring of vulnerabilities. Structural policies aim to raise potential
growth, with timely implementation also key to strengthening the external position. Staff
recommendations draw on recent IMF technical assistance (TA), the 2010 FSAP, and previous
discussions, as well as other EMEs’ experiences. Against the recommendations made at the time of
the 2013 Article IV consultation, major actions have been taken on energy subsidy reform, monetary
management, and the exchange rate framework (Appendix IV).

A. Fiscal Policy and Reforms—Creating Lasting Space
11.
Main issues. The government’s fiscal rule has provided a sound nominal anchor, with public
debt as a share of GDP falling by around three-quarters since the late 1990s.6 Budgetary pressures in
recent years stem mainly from rising energy subsidies and weak revenue collections, which has
limited space for growth-critical social and infrastructure spending (Figure 5 and Tables 5 and 6).
The new administration seeks to move decisively to reverse the trend of under-investment in
infrastructure (Box 4). Fuel subsidy and revenue reforms are at the heart of their strategy. The
government also looks to pursue more multilateral loans and raise the borrowing capacity (including
from external sources) of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to support infrastructure development. The
recent sharp drop in oil prices is proving to be a significant headwind for the government’s strategy,
as lower oil and gas revenues will largely offset space created by the reduction in fuel subsidies in
the near term (Box 5). Reversing broader declines in revenues, which mainly reflect structural
weaknesses in tax revenues and a trend decline in oil production, may take time. The government
will also have to manage potential funding risk given the current reliance on foreign bond investors.

6

The rule limits the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP. Based on historical experience, it generally
means a cap on the central government deficit of 2½ percent of GDP.

Box 4. Indonesia: Closing the Infrastructure Gap
Indonesia’s infrastructure gap remains wide compared to its peers, particularly in transport and power. As
a result, logistics costs account for around 24 percent of GDP in Indonesia, compared to Thailand (20 percent),
1
China (18 percent), and Malaysia (13 percent). Electricity production per capita is only 20‒60 percent of its peers,
implying significant constraints on power generation, and the electrification ratio is at 82 percent, well below
2
Malaysia, Thailand and China (with each close to 100 percent).
Infrastructure investment has been subdued over the past decade, with under-investment affecting growth
by catalyzing less private investment and dampening productivity gains. On average, it has been at 3−4 percent
3
of GDP a year, compared to more than 7 percent in the mid 1990s. Most of the decline was due to lower private
4
and state-owned enterprise (SOE) investment in infrastructure. According to the World Economic Forum,
th
th
th
Indonesia ranked 56 out of 144 countries on infrastructure, compared with Malaysia (25 ), China (46 ), and
th
Thailand (48 ) in 2014.
The slow progress in reducing the infrastructure gap is due to several factors, including a complex land
3
acquisition process, weak implementation capacity, and poor inter-agency coordination. While the government’s
budget for capital spending has been constrained in recent years by the substantial amount of energy subsidies
(which averaged 3½ percent of GDP a year during 2011−14), the actual execution of capital spending has been
at only around 85 percent. The government has tried to tap public-private partnerships in power plants, toll
roads, and water supply, but they have yet to take off significantly due in part to a weak institutional framework.
The new administration has voiced an upfront commitment to boosting infrastructure spending through
a multipronged effort. The government aims, inter alia, to reduce logistics costs to 19 percent of GDP and
improve the electrification ratio to 97 percent by 2019. It estimates that infrastructure financing needs
during 2015−2019 will be around Rp 5,000 trillion, or on average 8−9 percent of GDP a year, with about half of
this possibly financed off-budget, including through SOE borrowing and PPPs. To support this process, the
government plans to inject new capital into infrastructure-related SOEs, including to PT Sarana Multi
Infrastructure (a government infrastructure financing company set up in 2009), thereby enabling them to
leverage their balance sheets and launch strategic infrastructure projects and PPPs. With a view to jump-starting
investment, the government also aims in 2015 to streamline the investment process through a one-stop service
at the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) and implement the revamped Land Acquisition Law to
remove bottlenecks to large infrastructure projects.

Box 5. Indonesia: Fuel Subsidy Reform and the Fiscal Impact of Low World Oil Prices
Two major reforms on fuel subsidies came into effect on January 1, 2015. First, subsidies on gasoline
were effectively discontinued. Second, a fixed per-liter subsidy scheme of Rp 1,000 per liter (US$0.08) for
diesel was adopted. Going forward, the retail fuel
prices will be adjusted twice a month by the Ministry
of Energy to reflect the economic cost of the fuel
products, including taxes. These reforms will not only
generate substantial fiscal savings (gasoline
consumption is around twice that of diesel), but also
protect the budget against future fluctuations in oil
prices and exchange rates. Indonesia is among several
countries in the region that have recently implemented
energy-pricing reforms. India deregulated diesel prices
and increased petrol excise rates. China increased the
gasoline tax rate twice (by 40 percent in total).
Malaysia took final steps to eliminate diesel and
gasoline subsidies, while Thailand began to gradually
reduce fuel subsidies and partially reinstate diesel
excises.
Measures have been taken in Indonesia to mitigate negative income shocks emanating from the
November 2014 administered fuel price hike, while falling world oil prices have provided added
relief. Cash transfers equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP were made to 15.5 million low-income households
(bottom 25 percent of income distribution) shortly after the November price hike. This move followed a
similar approach to the June 2013 price hike, which kept the poverty rate unchanged, according to the
World Bank. The rationale for the price hikes—a need to reallocate fuel subsidies to infrastructure
spending—was also communicated effectively to the public. Under the new pricing regime, the
government was also able to cut gasoline and diesel prices by around 22 and 15 percent, respectively, in
January 2015, aided by the precipitous fall in oil prices.
Recent fuel subsidy reform potentially opens
sizable fiscal space for priority spending. The
fuel subsidy bill is projected to decrease by about
1¾ percentage points (ppts) of GDP in 2015,
factoring in the new pricing regime for gasoline
and diesel. Lower world oil price will also reduce
kerosene and LPG subsidies, whose retail prices are
still fixed in nominal terms. In addition, the
electricity subsidy bill will be cut by around ½ ppts
of GDP, following discontinuation of subsidies for
medium and large users in mid 2014. As a result,
the energy subsidy bill is expected to decrease to
6 percent of total expenditure in 2015
from 19 percent in 2014. Under the current
baseline, this savings will be partially offset in 2015
by a loss in oil and gas revenues by more than
1½ ppts of GDP.
A further drop in the oil price could worsen the fiscal balance and constrain space for priority
spending. Under a fairly extreme scenario with an average world crude oil price of US$30 per barrel
in 2015, the fiscal deficit would increase by 0.4 ppts of GDP. Further losses in oil and gas revenues would
amount to 0.6 ppts of GDP, partially offset by additional savings in the subsidy bill for kerosene, LPG, and
electricity, as well as in revenue sharing with local governments, which would total around 0.2 ppts of GDP.

Policy developments. The new administration submitted a revised 2015 budget proposal to
Parliament in early January that aims to carve out significant new space for capital spending, while
maintaining a prudent fiscal stance. To this end, the revised budget seeks to target a central
government deficit of 1.9 percent, against 2.2 percent of GDP in the original budget and preliminary
outturn of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014. Under the current proposal, the government expects to offset
the large reduction in oil and gas revenues with ambitious increases in non-oil tax revenues, while
allocating most subsidy-bill savings to capital spending. Despite the lower deficit target in 2015, the
revised budget may require a substantially larger net issuance of government bonds in order to
finance a significant recapitalization of SOEs (equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP in the budget
proposal), as part of plans to leverage their support for infrastructure investment.
13.

Staff Position



2015 budget. Staff welcomed the proposal to target a deficit of around 2.0 percent of GDP
in 2015, given the need to support external adjustment and manage funding pressures. It noted
that a shift in resources away from poorly targeted energy subsidies to infrastructure spending
with higher multipliers would help support growth and still leave space for automatic stabilizers to
operate in case of an extreme slowdown. To achieve this target, staff indicated that the revised
budget would need to be underpinned by some upfront revenue measures to bolster its
credibility and by capital spending targets in keeping with absorptive capacity. Full
transparency in the fuel price adjustments would help shield the space opened by earlier
subsidy reforms. Staff also proposed a more phased approach to SOE recapitalization to
ensure governance, accounting, and procurement frameworks are sufficiently robust and
government domestic borrowing is contained.



Near-term outlook. Based on more conservative revenue and expenditure targets and
factoring in the expected decline in oil and gas revenues, staff indicated that the overall
fiscal deficit would likely be around 2.4 percent of GDP, as shown in the current baseline. To
safeguard performance in 2015, staff recommended a moderate increase in fuel excises
(equivalent to around 0.3 percent of GDP), which could be more easily absorbed by
consumers given recent reductions in retail fuel prices. Higher taxes on tobacco and luxury
goods could provide additional revenues. Sufficient space would still exist to increase the
capital budget by about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and protect social spending, notably on
health care coverage for the poor, as well as for safety nets to defray higher fuel costs.



Medium-term framework. Over the medium term, staff recommended a small primary
deficit, in order to keep debt levels stable and safeguard against a reversal in inflows. In
support, the authorities were urged to pursue tax reforms along the lines of recent FAD TA,
focused initially on broadening the base, streamlining exemptions (notably the VAT), and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

INDONESIA

enhancing risk-based tax administration. Staff noted that these reforms would take time to
prepare and implement properly, with only a gradual increase in tax revenues built into the
current baseline. A more ambitious rise would require broader, complementary reforms,
including rationalizing corporate tax rates, strengthening the property tax regime, and
raising the VAT rate and select excises. A phase out of energy subsidies by end 2017 is also
assumed in the baseline, in keeping with G-20 commitments, potentially opening more
space in the budget. Staff cautioned that fiscal risks warranted careful management, in
particular those arising from expanded balance sheets of and new external borrowing by
SOEs.7 The impact of lower oil prices on the finances of Pertamina (the state oil and natural
gas corporation) would also need to be monitored closely, given its sizable presence in
upstream production in Indonesia.8
14.
Authorities’ view. The authorities recognize the need to maintain sound fiscal management
in the current environment. In doing such, they wish to seize the opportunity created by subsidy
reforms to ramp up infrastructure investment, with an initial focus on rural roads and irrigation. They
are also keen to improve national connectivity in support of sustained growth and to reduce
regional inequalities through better transport infrastructure (including maritime) and more power
generation. This effort is expected to be backed by implementation of streamlined approval
processes, procurement reforms, and the Land Acquisition Law. The authorities note it will also
require substantially more resources, seeing the two-pronged approach of seeking more domestic
revenues and larger external borrowing as consistent with maintaining a solid fiscal position and
minimizing risks. On revenue targets, the authorities see substantial gains from improved tax
administration, anchored by a strengthening in the capacity of the Directorate-General of Taxation
under the Ministry of Finance. They also expect more buoyant growth than envisaged by staff
in 2015 to contribute to tax collections. On external borrowing, they noted the low level of external
and public debt and favorable borrowing costs as driving their strategy.

B. Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange Management—Striking the Right
Balance
15.
Main issues. Bank Indonesia continues to maintain a relatively tight monetary stance in
order to anchor inflation expectations and manage external pressures in light of current
vulnerabilities. Broad money and private credit growth have slowed, while real interest rates have
risen moderately (Figure 6 and Table 7). However, banks still hold sizable excess reserves in order to
self-insure for liquidity purposes, which speaks to the need to further develop the interbank money
market as the main channel of monetary transmission.9 At the same time, they have faced increased

Currently, Pertamina is the second largest oil producer in Indonesia behind the U.S.-owned Chevron Pacific
Indonesia. Its daily output of oil in 2013 averaged around 121,000 barrels—about 15 percent of national oil output. It
is the third largest gas producer, accounting for 13 percent of gas output in 2013.

funding pressures, as credit growth outpaced deposit growth through the first half of 2014. Funding
conditions in 2014 were also affected by changes in guidance on loan-to-deposit ratios (LDRs) and
by the government’s front-loading of rupiah bond issuances in the first half of the year, all of which
led to intensified competition for term deposits.10 Conditions began to ease in the second half
of 2014, aided by seasonal factors and lower credit growth.
16.
Policy developments. Following the November 2014 fuel price hike, BI promptly raised its
benchmark and lending facility rates for the first time in a year by 25 bps and 50 bps, respectively to
7.75 percent and 8.00 percent, but left its deposit facility rate unchanged to discourage a further
increase in excess reserves held by banks. To mitigate the adverse effects of banks’ competition for
deposits, the Financial Services Agency (OJK) imposed interest rate caps on deposits at larger banks
in October 2014.11 In the meantime, BI continued to make progress in deepening the interbank
money market, supported by MCM TA on financial deepening. A mini Master Repo Agreement
(MRA) was launched at end 2013 for collateralized transactions, while the Jakarta Interbank Spot
Dollar Rate (JISDOR) established a viable reference rate following its launch in mid 2013. The use of
onshore hedging instruments has also picked up.
17.

Staff Position



Monetary policy stance and exchange rate management. Staff broadly agreed with BI’s
current monetary stance, which provides scope for future adjustments as inflation and
external pressures ease. Under the new fuel pricing regime, inflation volatility could rise,
reinforcing the importance of maintaining strong policy credibility within BI’s inflation
targeting framework. Staff noted the need for continued exchange rate and bond yield
flexibility as the primary response against external shocks, with BI limiting intervention in the
FX market to smoothing volatility and ensuring orderly market conditions, in line with the
current practice. The authorities were also urged to remove the deposit rate caps to improve
the signaling effects of monetary policy and strengthen policy transmission.



Monetary operations and market deepening. Staff noted that further improvements in
the monetary operations framework, complemented by BI’s ongoing market deepening
efforts, would also help strengthen the transmission mechanism. To this end, staff
recommended moving to reserve requirement averaging, easing supervisory stigma tied to
accessing BI’s lending facility, and conducting rupiah and FX market operations consistent
with reducing excess reserves. Progress on making legacy government securities on BI’s

10

Bank Indonesia raised the secondary reserve requirement (RR) to 4.0 percent from 2.5 percent, with full effect from
December 2013; earlier, it tightened the LDR-linked RR by lowering its applicability to banks with both an LDR in
excess of 92 percent (from 100 percent) and a capital adequacy ratio of less than 14 percent.
11

Deposit rates offered on all bank deposits up to Rp 2 billion were capped at no more than the maximum
guaranteed rate of the deposit insurance agency (currently 7.75 percent). Furthermore, deposit rates for large
deposits (above Rp 2 billion) were capped at (i) 200 bps above the current BI rate for the largest banks
(i.e., Buku 4 banks—i.e., core capital above Rp 30 trillion) and (ii) 225 bps above the current BI rate for medium to
large banks (i.e., Buku 3 banks—i.e., core capital between Rp 5 trillion and Rp 30 trillion).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

balance sheet marketable would also help. Staff suggested that market deepening focus on
building a benchmark yield curve and also welcomed the authorities’ effort to develop a
global MRA for the repo market.


Liquidity management. To help alleviate funding pressures, staff recommended relaxing
recent guidance (including supervisory) on LDRs. Staff noted that plans by BI to include
non-deposit long-term market funding in the LDR calculation might temporarily ease these
pressures, but further suggested that liquidity risk could be better managed by adopting
prudential tools such as a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In addition, a more evenly paced
issuance of rupiah government bonds in 2015, along with moderate government borrowing,
would help banks better manage their funding needs.

18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of recent
developments. Bank Indonesia reiterated it will maintain its current monetary policy stance in the
near term. At the same time, they saw adjustments in macro prudential policies playing a balancing
role in supporting credit growth while maintaining financial stability. On deposit rate caps, OJK
noted that they are intended to be temporary measures aimed at curbing excessive deposit
competition, but expect the caps will become less binding over time given slower credit growth and
easing funding pressures observed more recently. The authorities see further progress on financial
market development as key to managing liquidity stresses. While the collateralized mini-MRA
achieved some success, BI noted that the uncollateralized money market continue to be hampered
by counterparty risks. The authorities view guidance on LDRs and related ratios as transitory
measures as financial markets deepened.

C. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues—Keeping Close Watch
19.
Recent performance. Indonesia’s financial system continues to evolve rapidly, posing
myriad challenges to the authorities, who themselves are adapting to changes in their own
mandates. Banks on a system-wide basis remain generally sound, although as growth slows,
nonperforming loans (NPLs) have begun to rise, but from low levels, with new NPLs mainly from
corporate loans (Box 6 and Table 8). Currently, capital buffers are adequate to handle the recent
deterioration in credit quality. At the same time, some small and mid-sized banks appear more
susceptible to liquidity risks given their more volatile funding structures. Corporate sector
performance remains strong against EME peers, but vulnerabilities arise from weakening debtservicing capacity, inadequate hedging of foreign currency debt, and declining profitability of
commodity-related firms (Box 7).

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Box 6. Indonesia—Banking System Soundness
The banking sector appears generally sound, but some divergence exists within the system. As a
whole, banks are well capitalized and highly profitable, benefiting from wide net interest margins.
However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) edged up in the first half of 2014, although they remained at a
low level. Notwithstanding their larger capital buffers, smaller banks tend to be less profitable due to
higher funding costs and greater credit risk. Overall liquidity remains manageable, with heightened
funding pressures in the first half of 2014 having subsided. Nonetheless, compared with emerging
market peers, the Indonesian banking system appears more vulnerable to potential funding outflows.
Smaller banks are exposed to greater liquidity risk given that their funding is more dependent on
short-dated term deposits, whereas larger banks receive more of their funding from current and
savings account (CASA) deposits. In Indonesia, term deposits, which look similar to money market
instruments, tend to be more volatile than CASA deposits.
Despite these generally sound conditions, banks could face some risks from both the liquidity
and solvency perspectives. On the liquidity front, banks could experience renewed funding pressures
if deposit growth lags credit growth again—similar to early 2014 when banks faced heightened
competition for deposits. With regards to solvency, banks’ balance sheets could be weakened on the
back of tightening financial conditions, slowing economic growth, and pronounced market volatility.
While the recent rise in NPLs has been modest, it is more concentrated in corporate loans. Going
forward, the quality of these loans could worsen, especially to foreign currency borrowers with
inadequate hedging and/or to businesses facing deteriorating financial conditions (e.g., those tied to
the resources sector). Moreover, with tighter financial conditions, banks’ profitability could decline as a
result of narrowing net interest margins.
Nonetheless, the banking system as a whole remains in a strong position to withstand severe
shocks. Susceptibility to systemic liquidity risk appears limited, given that the bulk of short-term
liabilities comes from relatively stable retail deposits, while capital buffers seem generally adequate to
absorb substantial credit and market losses. Based on staff’s stress scenarios, the following
observations are made:


Liquidity buffers: About three-quarters of banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets such as
cash, securities, and placements at Bank Indonesia to withstand a sizable deposit outflow
concurrently with a complete withdrawal of short-term wholesale funding. Based on
end-June 2014 data, the total liquidity gap of banks facing liquidity shortages was estimated at
Rp 13.5 trillion (0.3 percent of total funding). Smaller banks appear less equipped to handle
potential liquidity stress. However, the banking sector could face a foreign currency funding
shortage of up to US$25 billion in the event of an extreme system-wide shock to foreign currency
liabilities, including withdrawals of deposits and drawdowns on commitments, with a
concentration of the shortage in the larger banks.



Capital buffers: The system-wide capital adequacy ratio would fall by 4 percentage points to
15 percent at end 2015 if all restructured, special-mention, and problem loans were classified as
loss loans, concurrently with an increase in government bond yields by 500 bps and the inclusion
of a few other stress-related factors (see footnote 2 in Box 6 panel chart). Under this extreme
stress scenario, around a quarter of banks would likely breach the minimum capital requirement
(8 percent), with capital shortfalls amounting to Rp 57.0 trillion (0.6 percent of GDP). Even after
realizing the abovementioned losses, the banking sector as a whole would still be adequately
capitalized, able to withstand a further increase in the NPL ratio by 9.2 percentage points from
the current level.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Box 7. Indonesia: Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities
Corporate sector performance is showing signs of strain on the back of slowing economic
growth and rising funding costs. Overall profitability and debt servicing capacity of listed
companies in Indonesia have weakened. On the former, the return on assets fell slightly to
14.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, still high relative to international peers. On the
latter, the share of companies with income insufficient to cover interest expenses increased to
21 percent in 2013, while the share of debt of these companies jumped to 30 percent—in excess of
its peak in 2008. Stress appears more concentrated in the resources sector as a result of sluggish
mining activities and falling commodity prices.
Pockets of vulnerabilities exist owing to rising corporate indebtedness, increasing
concentrated leverage and corporate insolvency, and unhedged foreign currency debt.


Corporate debt has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching 34 percent of GDP as of
end September 2014 (latest figures available) compared to 23 percent at end 2010, in part
spurred by easy financial conditions in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. About
45 percent of the increase in corporate debt was financed by borrowings from abroad.
Corporate external debt was US$118 billion (around 15 percent of GDP) at end
September 2014—up by US$66 billion since end 2010, although about 60 percent of this
increase was either FDI-related (i.e., financed by parent or affiliated entities) or incurred by
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The greater reliance on external funding could also pose a
refinancing risk, possibly exacerbated by major corporate distress, with about US$10 billion of
bond and syndicated loans maturing in 2015.



Concentrated leverage at highly indebted companies has also increased, coupled with
rising corporate insolvency. Companies that were already highly indebted became even
more indebted over the past few years, despite only a marginal increase in system-wide
average leverage ratios. This concentration is seen in the aggregate debt-to-assets ratio of
listed companies (weighted by individual companies’ outstanding debt), which has increased
substantially to a level near its peak in 2009. In addition, the share of listed companies with
negative equity has risen sharply, indicating potential for more widespread corporate defaults.



Exposure to foreign exchange (FX) risk is not negligible. About half of corporate debt is
denominated in foreign currency. Although around 70 percent of non-SOE foreign currency
debt is estimated to have been incurred by companies with FDI-related funding and/or with FX
1
cash flows, some companies are still subject to FX risk. A large rupiah depreciation could
significantly undermine balance sheets of companies with inadequate hedging of their FX
exposure, with market reports also suggesting that most hedging now in place will knock out
at specific levels of the exchange rate.

The banking sector as a whole remains resilient in light of these corporate sector
vulnerabilities given strong capital buffers. However, some mid-sized and regional banks could
possibly face significant credit losses tied to resources-related activities from both corporate and
household loans.

Policy developments. In January 2014, OJK took control over banking supervision and
regulation from BI, following the agency’s earlier assumption of oversight of nonbank financial
institutions (NBFIs) and capital markets from the former Capital Market and Financial Institution
Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK). Bank Indonesia retained its macro prudential responsibilities,
with development of a policy framework being supported by MCM TA. Banks began to implement
Basel III capital standards in early 2014, with larger banks expected to adopt the LCR requirement
in 2016. Gaps remain in the financial stability architecture absent a fully developed regime for bank
resolution and emergency liquidity assistance and harmonized arrangements for crisis management.
To close them, the draft Financial System Safety Net (FSSN) law is being revised for resubmission to
Parliament in 2015. In the interim, support to troubled banks would rely on the use of presidential
decrees. The anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework, now under OJK, requires strengthening to comply with Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) recommendations.
21.

Staff Position



Banking and corporate soundness. Continued vigilance will be needed to ensure adequate
liquidity buffers at banks and to contain corporate vulnerabilities. In staff’s view, the LCR
requirement should be applied to all banks to contain liquidity risks. In addition to BI’s plan
to improve monitoring of riskier corporate borrowers, new regulations issued in
December 2014 on hedging offshore foreign currency borrowing should help manage
risks.12



Financial supervision. To strengthen its risk-based supervision, OJK will need to improve its
capacity to assess banks’ risk profile (e.g., stress testing). Staff urged closer collaboration
among supervisors across sectors in order to enhance consolidated/group-wide supervision
and ensure the resilience of financial conglomerates, supported by strengthened oversight
by OJK, especially for NBFIs (including insurance) and capital markets.



Macro prudential oversight and coordination. The macro prudential policy framework will
need to be supported by effective inter-agency arrangements for sharing information,
conducting joint surveillance activities (such as stress testing exercises and on-site
examinations), and formulating and implementing macro prudential policy. Staff welcomed
progress in delineating responsibilities through Standard Operating Procedures as the basis
for effective coordination between BI and OJK. Plans by BI to strengthen its capacity to
conduct systemic risk assessments should buttress financial stability.



Financial stability architecture. Progress is being made to close gaps in the crisis
management framework. In welcoming recent work on the draft FSSN law, staff noted the

12

The regulation requires nonbank corporations that obtain foreign currency-denominated debt from abroad to
hedge at least 20 percent of their net foreign liabilities due over the next six months and to maintain the ratio of
current foreign assets to current foreign liabilities (up to three months) at a minimum of 50 percent. Corporations
would also be required to be rated at least BB- from 2016 onwards to contract new borrowing abroad.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

INDONESIA

need to set out clear principles for exercising special powers under a systemic event, with
responsibilities of all relevant authorities being clearly defined. Also emphasized was the
need for comprehensive reforms, underpinned by a simultaneous amendment of all relevant
financial sector laws to ensure a fully developed and consistent legal framework. Moreover,
staff urged a strengthening of the banking resolution regime, giving the Deposit Insurance
Corporation (LPS) a full range of tools to resolve banks in a timely, cost-effective manner.


AML/CFT issues. To avoid FATF sanctions, staff urged action to address key deficiencies
regarding the development and implementation of a legal framework and procedures for
identifying and freezing of terrorist assets.

22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessments and
recommendations. Bank Indonesia assesses the banking system to be generally sound, noting that
while NPLs have ticked up, they are still near historically low levels. On corporate sector
vulnerabilities, concerns mainly center on unhedged private external borrowing, which are being
addressed by newly introduced regulations. The authorities place importance on strengthening the
financial stability architecture, pointing out that the FSSN law is on a priority list for parliamentary
consideration.

D. Structural Reform Priorities—Cementing Jobs, Growth, and Sustainability
23.
Main issues. The new administration recognizes the need for significant supply-side reforms
aimed at stimulating job creation, raising potential growth, and strengthening the external position.
Staff noted that upfront actions would send an important signal to investors and lend support to the
government’s ambitious growth target of 7 percent by 2017. Discussions focused on the following:


Growing the export base. The authorities are rightly focused on boosting exports, focusing
on more processed agricultural products and manufactured goods. An initial push to
streamline business licensing and investment approvals appears appropriate. Greater
emphasis on ports and maritime development also bodes well for trade. However, staff
noted that these initiatives would need to be supported by a trade policy more oriented
towards export promotion and less focused on import restrictions than in recent years. The
start of the ASEAN Economic Community at end 2015 provides an opportunity to signal a
shift in this direction.



Ensuring a supportive labor market. Wage settlements should be aligned with productivity
increases in order to manage costs and improve competitiveness. Moving away from annual
negotiations of minimum wages would also reduce uncertainty to employers and possibly
spur more hiring. In view of ambitious development plans, a manpower strategy is needed
to close skilled labor gaps, identifying additional resources for education and training and
considering policies for easing entry by foreign skilled labor.



Developing financial markets. A wider range of financial instruments would help mobilize
domestic savings and finance long-term investment. Under a multi-pronged approach, staff

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

noted the need to lengthen banks’ funding profiles, develop securitized products, and
deepen relatively small, illiquid capital markets, as well as to grow the domestic institutional
investor base, while keeping the financial sector open to foreign participation. A national
task force on financial deepening is being set up and a master plan on sector development
is being formulated, with the experience of regional peers possibly instructive.


Providing a comprehensive energy policy. A comprehensive energy policy that
incentivizes more upstream and downstream investment in the oil and gas sector should be
established, with lower world prices necessitating greater efficiencies and better governance
over the sector. Staff noted that more intensive use of renewable sources of energy could
also spur new investment, facilitate external adjustment, and balance environmental
challenges presented by greater domestic usage of coal.

24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly recognize the importance of export promotion
as a vital part of Indonesia’s new growth strategy and to facilitate external adjustment, supported by
envisaged reforms to streamline export and import licensing. They are exploring ways of linking
wage settlement to labor productivity and plan to devote more public resources to vocational and
technical training in support of higher quality job creation. Better governance in the energy sector is
also a top priority of the new administration, with the authorities noting measures already taken to
strengthen the energy regulator SKK Migas with a view to cutting the cost of energy production and
formulating a more transparent regulatory framework in support of investment.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Sound macroeconomic management and exchange rate flexibility have bolstered
policy credibility and external resiliency in Indonesia over the past 18 months. In the face of
Fed tapering and headwinds posed by falling commodity prices, policy and reserve buffers have
been strengthened through a clearer policy framework and better policy coordination. Markets have
responded favorably, as evidenced by large portfolio inflows in 2014, supported by global push
factors. However, financial and corporate sector health shows signs of strain, as growth slows,
funding conditions tighten, and with external pressures remaining elevated.
26.
Notwithstanding commodity sector weakness and global uncertainties, the near-term
outlook is broadly positive. Led by a pickup in public investment, growth should reach around
5¼ percent this year. Credit expansion will likely remain moderate, as funding conditions stay
relatively tight. Inflation is expected to return within BI’s target band by year end, given the current
monetary stance and anticipated fuel price declines. The current account deficit should also narrow
slightly, with a lower oil import bill offsetting pressures arising from nonoil commodity exports, with
reserves expected to remain adequate.
27.
However, risks remain to the downside, requiring continued vigilance. They emanate
mainly from external sources, which could feed into those facing the banking and corporate sectors.
Continued exchange rate flexibility coupled with tighter demand management could help mitigate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

INDONESIA

external shocks, with a modest use of reserves possibly smoothing volatility. Accelerated structural
reforms could yield a more diversified export base and deeper financial markets, making Indonesia
less vulnerable to spillovers affecting the commodities sector and to volatile capital flows. Stronger
prudential measures would help contain risks in the financial sector, backed by strengthened
frameworks for risk assessment and protocols on crisis management.
28.
Indonesia’s main challenge is to chart a course to higher, more inclusive growth, while
preserving macro-financial stability and further strengthening its external position. The new
administration appears keen to ease supply bottlenecks through a reform strategy that aims to raise
potential growth. Upfront, the strategy’s success will hinge on reducing skills and infrastructure
gaps. As a first step and in keeping with the authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic and
financial stability, decisive actions have been taken to remove most fuel subsidies with a view to
freeing up space in the government budget for more growth-critical spending. While Indonesia’s
external position is found to be moderately weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and
desired policies, current policies appear well geared towards strengthening it. Debt levels remain
sustainable and resilient to standard shocks.
29.
The macro-financial policy mix is broadly appropriate, but vigilance is warranted in
the current setting, with sound fiscal policy a key anchor to growth and stability objectives.
Budgetary pressures could re-emerge without new revenue measures to support much-needed
infrastructure spending. Over the medium term, broader reforms will be needed to boost nonoil tax
revenues in order to sustain increases in development expenditure and maintain a strong fiscal
position, with moderate deficit reduction also enhancing resilience to shocks. The expanded space
sought by plans to use state-owned enterprises to raise funds for infrastructure investment should
also be pursued judiciously, foremost to ensure the strategy is consistent with sound debt
management and external sustainability.
30.
Monetary policy tightening since mid 2013 and a more flexible exchange rate policy
have been instrumental in reducing imbalances, while helping rebuild reserves. The current
monetary stance has also aided a credit growth deceleration, in keeping with policy objectives.
Going forward, maintaining a relatively tight stance appears appropriate until inflation and external
pressures firmly ease. Further progress in improving monetary operations and deepening money
markets are expected to improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission. Stronger policy
coordination and improved market functionality would help ease funding pressures.
31.
Financial and corporate sector vulnerabilities appear manageable, but require close
watch in light of the growth slowdown. The banking system remains generally sound, but system
stability needs to be underpinned by an effective macro prudential policy framework to mitigate
systemic risk and a robust crisis management framework to handle bank distress effectively, backed
by joint surveillance and policy coordination among financial authorities and a new Financial System
Safety Net law. Corporate sector vulnerabilities warrant careful monitoring, with the support of steps
being taken to regulate external borrowing. Key legal deficiencies in the AML/CFT framework should
also be addressed in a timely manner.

Structural reforms aimed at easing supply bottlenecks and improving the investment
climate could buttress growth prospects and strengthen the external position. Upfront actions
would send an important signal to investors that the new administration is taking a constructive
approach towards the trade and investment regime, on labor market issues and human resource
development, and with regard to energy policy. Reforms in these areas could boost potential growth

Economic growth has moderated in recent years, with the
commodity sector’s contribution to growth a factor.

The shift of the current account balance into a deficit has also
been driven by commodity-related exports.

The commodity cycle weakness has affected corporate cash

dependent on internal financing.

At the same time, these factors have weighed on bank deposit
growth, while monetary policy tightening has slowed bank
credit growth but with a lag.

Corporate borrowing has risen significantly, with firms
tapping into lower borrowing costs by contracting debt

However, the corporate sector shows growing signs of strains,
particularly firms in resource-related activity.

Banks’ lending rates have risen since the second half of 2013,

Higher borrowing costs and macro prudential measures have
helped moderate growth in property prices.

Nonperforming loans in the banking system have begun to

On the expenditure side, the growth slowdown is seen mainly
in tepid investment demand and less supportive net exports

Declines in potential growth appear to reflect lower capital
accumulation and factor productivity related to the
commodity down cycle.

Production indicators also point to slowing growth, with
domestic factors likely weighing larger lately.

Retail sales have softened, with weaker commodity related
incomes, higher borrowing costs, and November 2014 fuel

of large increases in administered fuel prices, but has since

This improvement has been spearheaded by a moderate

External financing needs will remain sizeable in 2015,

Figure 5. Indonesia: Fiscal Sector Performance
The central government fiscal deficit has widened since 2010,
until recently driven by the rise in energy subsidies, while the
fall in oil and gas revenues may limit improvements in 2015.

Budgetary pressures continued in 2014, although they eased
somewhat toward year end because of the administered fuel
price hike, which curbed fuel subsidies.

Tax revenue as a share of GDP has stagnated with limited
progress on nonresource revenue mobilization…

…leaving Indonesia with the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio among
its regional peers.

Fuel subsidy reforms are expected to free up space for
growth-critical capital spending in 2015.

The public debt-to-GDP ratio has risen in recent years on
weaker fiscal performance and currency depreciation, but it is
expected to remain at a comparatively low level.

Figure 6. Indonesia: Monetary Sector and Bank Liquidity Developments
As noted earlier, credit growth has moderated, due to
monetary policy tightening and macro prudential controls.

Despite slowing credit growth, loan-to-deposit ratios remain
elevated.

Net available funding has fallen sharply driven by slowing
deposit growth, resulting in banks competing more intensely
for term deposits.

Banks’ interest margins have compressed, as deposit rates have
risen sharply.

Bank Indonesia (BI) has maintained a tight monetary stance
with higher real interest rates, but structural liquidity
problems hamper policy transmission.

Banks still hold sizable excess reserves in BI’s deposit facility,
reflecting their self insurance in liquidity management until
financial deepening measures firmly take hold.

Lower demand or prices for commodity exports
could widen the current account deficit, adding to
balance of payments (BOP) pressures and reserve
losses. The fiscal balance would deteriorate on
weaker resource revenues and knock-on effects to
domestic demand, while the financial sector could
be exposed to losses from loans to the
commodity sector and a broader slowdown in the
economy. The corporate sector could be
vulnerable to declining profits stemming from
commodity related activities and incomplete
hedging of external borrowing.

Maintain exchange rate flexibility to
help reduce the current account deficit
and limit reserve losses. Fiscal
measures to contain the budget deficit
might be necessary if the slowdown in
EMs were accompanied by protracted
financial market volatility that restricts
funding. Accelerate infrastructure
spending and structural reforms to
boost productivity, employment in
non-resource sectors and export
diversification.

Appendix II. Indonesia—External Assessment
(Updated January 2015)
Overall Assessment
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Current account

Background. At end September 2014, Indonesia’s net international investment position (NIIP) position stood at -49 percent of
GDP, compared to -44 percent of GDP at end 2013. The components as a percent of GDP were reserves (+13), net FDI (-26), net
equities (-12), net portfolio debt (-10), and other investment (-13). About half of the change was due to strong equity inflows
in 2014. At end September 2014, gross external liabilities stood at 74 percent of GDP (up from 66 percent of GDP at end 2013).
Indonesia’s gross external debt is relatively low at 34 percent of GDP as of end September 2014.
Assessment. The EBA external sustainability approach suggests Indonesia’s cyclically-adjusted current account (CA) deficit is
2.5 percent of GDP, better than the 3.5 percent needed to stabilize the NIIP. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross
external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable, but non-resident holdings of rupiah debt could be
affected by global volatility, which at end October 2014 stood at 5.3 percent of GDP.

Overall Assessment:
Indonesia’s external position in 2014 is
moderately weaker than implied by mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policies.

Background. Indonesia’s CA deficit is projected at 3.0 percent of GDP in 2014, compared to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Rising
manufacturing exports and falling oil prices have compensated for declines in other commodity exports. The CA deficit is
projected to fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015, in part due to a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) since
mid-2013, continued support from manufactured exports, and an expected continuation of relatively tight monetary policy.
Assessment. The EBA CA results suggest a gap of -1.9 percent of GDP for 2014 (based on a cyclically adjusted CA balance of 
‒2.3 percent of GDP and a norm of -0.4 percent of GDP). However, taking uncertainties into account, staff believes a norm of
‒1.5 percent of GDP (±1 percent of GDP) more accurately reflects Indonesia’s significant investment needs. This suggests a CA
gap of about -1 percent of GDP (±1 percent of GDP), which reflects domestic policy gaps in social spending and capital account
controls, as well as external policy gaps (particularly fiscal deficits) in partner countries.
Background. After sizable depreciation in the second half of 2013, the REER appreciated at end 2014 reflecting a temporary
increase in inflation related to fuel price increases.
Assessment. EBA REER results suggest an undervaluation of about 8 percent at end 2014, compared with undervaluation of
2 percent for 2013. The change in the estimates is driven by movement in the unexplained residual, i.e. the fall in the actual REER,
even though the REER norm remained relatively unchanged. Using the CA gap estimate of -1 percent of GDP (± 1 percent of
GDP) and standard elasticities, staff’s assessment is that the REER is overvalued by around 5 percent (± 5 percent). Over the
medium term, the lagged effects of the weaker rupiah should help lower the CA deficit. However, with commodities making up
nearly half of Indonesia’s exports, the impact of a weaker rupiah on the CA deficit could be largely offset by falling world
commodity prices and/or Indonesia export volumes. With reduced fuel subsidies and monetary policy focused on low and stable
inflation and balance of payments adjustment, staff recommends continued exchange rate flexibility and broad-based structural
reforms to absorb external shocks and strengthen Indonesia’s competitiveness.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Indonesia’s gross external financing requirement is expected to be 9.6 percent of GDP for 2014, with amortization
at 6.7 percent, of GDP. Net inward FDI and new borrowing are projected at 2.5 percent and 9.4 percent of GDP, respectively, with
a reserves increase accounting for the rest. On capital controls, Indonesia ranks as more restrictive than other countries in the
sample.
Assessment. Net and gross financial flows appear sustainable, but could dissipate or reverse in the event of large domestic or
external shocks. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing
supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Since mid 2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Its floating regime has better
facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. As of end 2014, reserves stood at US$111.9 billion (equal to
160 percent of IMF’s reserve adequacy metric—assuming a floating exchange rate—and 7 months of imports of goods and
services). In addition, the government has in place contingencies and swap lines equivalent to around US$76 billion.
Assessment. Continued external imbalances or volatile capital flows could cause reserves to decline significantly. Nonetheless,
current levels of reserves should be sufficient to absorb such shocks. Intervention should aim primarily at smoothing volatility,
while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.



Potential Policy Responses
Monetary policy should continue to focus on
containing inflation within Bank Indonesia’s
target band and facilitating external
adjustment. Fiscal policy can support
monetary policy in bringing external
adjustment and help contain vulnerability to
funding pressures by aiming for a small
primary deficit over the medium term, led by
reforms aimed at increasing the tax take.
Continued flexibility of the exchange rate and
use of market-determined interest rates would
also help facilitate adjustment and absorb
shocks. Easing trade and investment
restrictions, expanding public infrastructure,
deepening financial markets, and improving
labor markets would promote growth and
competitiveness over the medium term.

INDONESIA

Appendix III. Indonesia—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Indonesia’s external debt remains at a moderate level and is projected to be sustainable over the
medium term. Growth in private external debt is expected to slow as global financial conditions
tighten and borrowing costs rise. Public debt remains low, but contingent liabilities arising from
borrowing by state corporations pose some fiscal risk.
External Debt Sustainability
1.
Indonesia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has been rising in recent years, but total
external debt remains at a moderate level. The main reasons for the increase have been a
rise in private external borrowing (including by state-owned enterprises (SOEs)) and the
depreciation of the exchange rate. As a share of GDP, external debt was 30½ at end 2013, up
from a low of 26¾ percent at end 2011, and is expected to have reached 35 percent at
end 2014 (Figure 1 and Table 1).
2.
Looking ahead, external debt is projected to stabilize in the medium term. Under
the baseline, debt rises slightly to 36 percent of GDP at end 2015 before declining to 32 percent
by end 2019 in line with a gradual narrowing of the current account deficit and increase in FDI
and equity inflows. The modest improvements in the current account balance would be aided
by trade and investment reforms that boost manufactured exports and by comparatively lower
oil prices than in recent years. Public external debt may increase above the current baseline if
the government increases reliance on external financing (including multilateral loans) to help
fund infrastructure projects. With the exception of borrowing by SOEs, which may also be used
for infrastructure development, the growth in private external debt is expected to slow owing
mainly due to an expected tightening in global financial conditions. Real growth is projected to
average about 5½ percent over the medium term and 6 percent in the longer run.
3.
External sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more
sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A further deterioration in
the current account balance from the current level would cause the external debt ratio to rise
moderately (a one standard deviation shock would raise the external debt to GDP ratio to
37 percent by 2019). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact; a 30 percent
depreciation would raise the external debt to GDP ratio to about 50 percent in 2015 followed
by a small decline to 45 percent of GDP by 2019.
Public Debt Sustainability
4.
Public sector debt remains low in Indonesia. General government debt as a percent
of GDP declined steadily from 95 percent in 2000 to 24 percent in 2012, owing to a prudent
fiscal stance, which has been anchored by the fiscal rule since in 2003 that caps the general
government deficit at 3 percent of GDP a year. The debt dynamics have also been favorable,
with strong GDP growth and moderate real interest rates. Exchange rate depreciation has

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

increased the debt ratio moderately since 2012. At the same time, foreign currency
denominated debt has fallen to less than half of total public sector debt, as issuance in the
domestic rupiah bond market has grown rapidly and attracted strong foreign interests.
Notwithstanding, dependence on foreign investors remains sizable, with the share of foreign
ownership of rupiah-denominated government bonds rising from about 20 percent in 2009 to
38 percent as of end 2014.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to remain stable
(Figure 3). The debt to GDP ratio is expected to decline slightly to 25½ percent of GDP by 2019,
underpinned by moderate fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Debt dynamics would
remain favorable, with a negative interest rate-growth differential at more than 5 percent, with
the small primary deficit projected in 2019 well below the debt-stabilizing level. Gross funding
needs are also expected to decrease gradually and be less than 4 percent of GDP over the
medium term.
6.
Public debt is sustainable and robust to macroeconomic shocks (Figure 4). Standard
stress tests suggest that the debt ratio is likely to remain modest even under shocks from
contingent liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, lower economic growth, and higher
interest rates. The debt ratio rises only marginally in an alternative scenario where the primary
deficit is maintained at the current level of 0.9 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, fiscal risks, in
particular those arising from expanding balance sheets of key state corporations, will need to
be managed carefully. Pertamina and PLN—the two largest SOEs in Indonesia—already had
combined total liabilities equivalent to 9.4 percent of GDP at end 2013. Also, lower world oil
prices will affect Pertamina’s revenue from upstream activities.

 Further tighten monetary policy if projected

Bank Indonesia (BI) preemptively raised its benchmark and lending rates
in November 2014 by 25 and 50 bps, respectively, to 7.75 and
8.00 percent to help anchor inflation expectations. The action was taken
immediately after administered fuel price hikes, which pushed headline
inflation above the target band. Policy communications have been clear.

 Ensure BI’s inflation targeting framework is

The introduction of tradable OMO instruments and ongoing IMF
technical assistance (TA) to develop secured lending among banks are
expected to deepen market activity and make the banking system more
resilient to liquidity shocks. A mini-Master Repo Agreement among
banks has been in place since January 2014.

 Continue to limit foreign exchange (FX) market

The exchange rate has been allowed to move to reflect market
conditions. Foreign exchange sales have been scaled back to SOEs. New
regulations were introduced by BI in September 2014 to encourage
prudent hedging by SOEs of their FX exposures, followed by regulations

Fiscal Policy

 Keep the overall deficit capped at 2 percent of GDP

In 2013, the fiscal deficit was 2.3 percent of GDP, in line with the revised
budget but higher than recommended. Tax revenue shortfalls were
partially offset by lower-than-budgeted current spending.

 Pursue moderate fiscal consolidation in 2014 and

In 2014, the fiscal deficit was 2.3 percent—slightly lower than targeted in
the revised budget. However, the 2014 deficit was still higher than staff
recommended mainly due to underperformance of non-oil and gas
revenues and a larger-than-envisaged energy subsidy bill. Nevertheless,
subsidized fuel consumption was capped for the year and significant
energy subsidy reforms were implemented, with electricity tariffs
increased for large industrial users in July 2014, administered fuel prices
raised by an average of 33 percent in November 2014, and fuel pricing
reform undertaken in January 2015.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
Background
The working relationship between the IMF and the World Bank in Indonesia is very strong, with joint
working programs in a number of areas and close coordination through frequent meetings between
resident offices and with headquarters missions, including the Article IV consultation.
Key Areas with Joint Programs
Budget Reforms


The reform agenda for budget and treasury remains a high priority for both institutions.
Currently, the World Bank’s support is being provided through the Government Financial
Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) program, trust funds, and
development policy loans (DPLs), with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations,
including accounting reforms, improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform;
(b) improved linkages between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of
a medium-term expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of
budget flexibility at the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight
through systems and organizational reform. The IMF has complemented this work through
recent technical assistance (TA) on subsidy reform and social safety nets aimed at ensuring
longer-run fiscal sustainability.

Taxation Issues


Revenue (tax and nontax revenue) issues are a priority for the IMF and the World Bank, with
broadening the revenue base and increasing revenues an important issue for both macro-fiscal
stability and the investment climate. The Fund conducted a mission on tax policy and
administration in September 2014 to identify key reform options in each of these areas. The
Bank provides support through TA to DG Tax through a multi-donor trust fund and preparation
of an investment loan in support of a comprehensive program for tax administration reform. The
Bank has also been providing analytical support on nontax revenue administration.

Asset-Liability Management


The World Bank and IMF have been leading an effort to improve asset-liability management,
including at the Treasury and Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance and at Bank
Indonesia, with continued collaboration envisaged, as needed.

Crisis Preparedness


4

In recent years, the World Bank has focused on supporting the authorities in Indonesia to create
a robust crisis prevention and management framework. Most recently, this support has included
analysis of the financial sector stability framework through the 2010 FSAP and a series of crisis
simulation exercises. Since 2012, the Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and
Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) DPL has also supported the authorities in this area. The
IMF has supported work in this area through past TA on reviewing the legal framework

INDONESIA

underpinning Indonesia’s financial stability architecture and in its current surveillance dialogue
with the authorities and exchange of views with the Bank.
Financial Sector


The World Bank has focused on broad monitoring of the financial sector. Most recently, through
its Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization DPL, the Bank is
supporting the implementation of reforms aimed at maintaining stability, increasing
diversification, and enhancing financial sector inclusion in Indonesia. The IMF has concentrated
on the banking system, with emphasis on regulation and supervision, with a resident advisor
placed at the Financial Services Agency (OJK) in January 2015. It has also embarked on TA in
financial deepening, focused initially on money and foreign exchange market development and
more recently on monetary operations and the transmission mechanism. In addition, the Fund
has provided recent TA on the macro prudential policy framework. A joint World Bank-IMF FSAP
was completed in 2010 and some recommendations have been followed through by the
authorities. The Bank is to provide TA to implement select FSAP recommendations concerning
the nonbank financial sector.

Statistics


The World Bank has a major program of capacity building with the statistics agency that was
launched in 2011. The Statistical Capacity Building-Change and Reform for the Development of
Statistics (STATCAP-CERDAS) program is designed to focus on improvements in key statistical
series that should improve the ability to understand the Indonesian economy, executed through
an institution-wide approach, which includes significant business, IT and HR/organizational
reforms. The IMF has focused recent training and TA on government finance statistics, monetary
and financial statistics, and sectoral balance sheets.

Macroeconomics


The IMF continues to take the lead in macroeconomic areas, with the Article IV mission and staff
visits, focusing on fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; macrofinancial linkages, financial
sector reforms, and crisis management, as well as the external position and spillover effects. The
Fund also updates the Debt Sustainability Analysis at the time of the Article IV consultation, with
inputs from the World Bank and other development partners. The Bank has also taken on a
larger role, including on macroeconomic monitoring, public policy dialogue, and capacity
building, with ongoing coordination with the Fund. The Bank team continues to assist the
Ministry of Finance‘s Fiscal Policy Office to improve capacity for macroeconomic monitoring,
forecasting, and evidence-based macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis.

These threads of work are expected to be continued by both institutions, with periodic meetings
aimed at keeping each other informed about ongoing work and joint areas of interest. Issues being
addressed by the IMF include domestic and external vulnerabilities, exchange rate management,
medium-term external and fiscal sustainability, and macro/financial linkages and financial stability
risks; and by the Bank the link between macro/fiscal policy and real economic outcomes, including
growth and poverty, resource-sector fiscal revenues, and longstanding problems in the
implementation and effectiveness of government spending.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 2014)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans to Indonesia have totaled US$30 billion since 1969.1 The ADB
approved a total of US$554.4 million in loans to Indonesia in 2014.2 The sectors with the largest
shares in cumulative lending are public sector management (19.1 percent), energy (14.5 percent),
agriculture and natural resources (13.6 percent), and finance (13.6 percent).3
Between 1969 and 2014, the ADB provided Technical Assistance (TA) grants to Indonesia amounting
to US$430 million. The TA grants were financed from the ADB’s TA Special Fund, the Japan Special
Fund and other sources.
The ADB is preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2015−2019 with the government of
Indonesia covering the period 2015−2019. The strategy will be aligned with the government’s
medium-term development plan for 2015−2019. The CPS will be closely attuned to the needs of
Indonesia as a large middle-income country and guided by the government’s commitment on
development. The CPS will also maintain consistency with the priorities set out in ADB’s Mid-Term
Review of Strategy 2020.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) disseminates annual and quarterly GDP (QGDP) by economic activity and expenditure
components at current prices and in volume terms regularly. The base year of GDP was revised to 2010 recently. Revised GDP
estimates are based on the supply and use tables, international standard of industrial classification Revision 4, updated source data,
and latest international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). These changes resulted in an
upward revision of 6.5 percent in nominal GDP for the year 2010, out of which 2.4 percent was attributed to the 2008 SNA
implementation. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by
seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not published. BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral
accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with technical assistance (TA) from STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize
the annual nonfinancial accounts, financial flows, and stocks for the year 2010 during 2015, and quarterly financial flows and stocks
starting from Q1:2015 in 2017.
Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. In October 2013, BPS released the new industrial Producer
Price Index (PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing with 2010 as the base period, and has published
the PPI index quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and
starting or completing work for 15 service industries. A TA mission was conducted in October 2014 to advise the BPS on continuing
development of the PPI that conforms to international standards as presented in the Producer Price Index Manual (PPI
Manual), 2004.
Government finance statistics: Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of classification,
coverage, and timeliness. Data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month lag, but subnational
(provincial and local) government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of these data varies widely.
Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by recent decentralization initiatives, which have shifted
substantial resources to the subnational governments. Significant efforts are being made to overcome these problems, ranging
from the planned adoption of advanced accounting and statistical standards to the introduction of best-practice budget
management processes and the development of computerized financial management information systems.
Against this background, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront
of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The coverage and timeliness of
public debt statistics is generally adequate. The new expenditure classification introduced in the 2005 budget is generally consistent
with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on functional codes and classification, although the data are
compiled on a cash basis.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, IMF staff have recommended in the short term:
(i) establishment of a register of all extrabudgetary units; and (ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent with the GFSM 2001 in
the chart of accounts to ensure that general government units report all transactions and balances over which they exert control.
Over the medium term, priority should be given to (i) establishment of the underlying reporting arrangements necessary to obtain
timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and (ii) development of a GFSM 2001 operating statement, statements of
sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of which should be published on the MOF’s website. Currently, a system has
been set up to allow for an automatic conversion of budget files to GFSM 2001 data; however, these data are yet to be published
on the MOF’s website.
The MOF’s continued efforts to compile GFS data for the general government sector, as part of ongoing public financial
management reforms, are being assisted by STA.

INDONESIA

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics are
compiled by BI on a timely basis. BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from
which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the
IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. BI also
compiles monetary data for other financial corporations (OFCs), but covering only finance companies. In October 2014, an STA
mission supported BI in expanding the coverage of the OFCs survey with the inclusion of data from insurance companies,
pension funds, the state owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export financing institution (Eximbank). The
mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI
compiles and reports two STA 11 core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, two
encouraged FSIs for OFCs, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published on the Fund’s FSI website.
Starting with Q4:2011 data, BI began reporting these FSIs on a quarterly basis. STA recommended that BI coordinate with other
relevant institutions to explore the possibility of compiling FSIs for nonfinancial corporations and households.
Balance of payments (BOP): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade
zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of BOP statistics.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial improvement.
Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to
estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have improved the coverage of the directory of enterprises
in recent years. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio
investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item in the BOP has been large at
times and appears to be related to the under˗coverage of assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are
reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP), except data on direct investment.
Annual and quarterly IIP data are compiled and published, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI.
External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002
and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI,
the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of
private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the
accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the
private sector from external creditors.

Statement by IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
March 9, 2015
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Recent data releases are broadly consistent with staff’s view on the near-term
macroeconomic outlook.


The current account deficit for 2014 was in line with expectations at about
US$26 billion. It remained on a downward trend, narrowing in the last quarter
of 2014 to US$6.2 billion (2.9 percent of GDP), which was largely attributable to a
smaller oil import bill. The overall BOP surplus was slightly larger than expected
in 2014 at US$15.2 billion, with non-portfolio capital inflows the main factor.
Turning to 2015, the trade surplus rose to US$0.7 billion in January from
US$0.2 billion in December, with oil and gas imports further shrinking.



Headline inflation declined further to 6.3 percent (y/y) in February 2015, benefiting
from lower food and transportation prices, but core inflation stayed around 5 percent.
Bank Indonesia’s latest (February) consumer survey index showed price expectations
continuing to fall.

2.
Parliament approved a revised 2015 budget in mid February with an overall deficit
target of 1.9 percent of GDP, in keeping with the government’s initial proposal. To achieve
this target and boost capital spending, the budget relies on an ambitious increase in non-oil
and gas revenues, which is expected to come mainly from administrative measures. The
budget also provides for a recapitalization of state-owned enterprises (0.4 percent of GDP)
within the financing items.
3.
Bank Indonesia (BI) cut its benchmark and deposit facility rates by 25 bps to
7.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, effective February 18, while leaving its lending
facility rate unchanged at 8.0 percent, citing recent improvement in inflation performance
and the current account. Broad money and private credit growth slowed in December 2014,
as expected, to around 12 percent and 12½ percent (y/y), respectively.
4.
Financial market developments have remained broadly favorable. Since BI’s rate cut,
the 10-year bond yield has declined by about 30 basis points while the rupiah has weakened
slightly against the U.S. dollar. Portfolio inflows continue to be supportive.

Press Release No. 15/123
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 19, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia

On March 9, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia.
Sound macroeconomic management and exchange rate flexibility have bolstered policy
credibility and external resiliency in Indonesia over the past 18 months. In the face of Fed
tapering and headwinds posed by slumping commodity prices, policy and reserve buffers have
been strengthened through a clearer policy framework and better policy coordination. Markets
have responded favorably, as evidenced by large portfolio inflows in 2014 and so far in 2015.
Overall, the banking system remains sound and well capitalized, while the corporate sector has
been affected by a cyclical slowdown. Key risks, which emanate mainly from external sources,
are moderately to the downside, requiring continued vigilance by policymakers.
Notwithstanding commodity sector developments and global risk factors, the near-term outlook
is broadly positive. Led by a pickup in public investment, growth should reach around
5¼ percent this year. Inflation is expected to return to within BI’s target band of 3 to 5 percent
by year end, given the current monetary stance and fuel price outlook. The current account
deficit should also narrow slightly, with a lower oil import bill offsetting pressures arising from
non-oil commodity exports, while foreign reserves are expected to rise moderately.
Decisive fiscal policy actions taken since late 2014 on fuel subsidy reforms have opened space in
the budget to support government plans to increase social and infrastructure spending, but lower
oil and gas revenues may constrain available resources in the near term. Monetary policy
continues to provide a strong anchor to inflation expectations and facilitate external adjustment,
with the latter also aided by flexibility in the exchange rate and bond yields. Financial sector
policies have been aimed at deepening market activity, enhancing macro and micro prudential
oversight, and increasing corporate sector resilience.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Looking ahead, the main challenge for Indonesia is to chart a course to higher, more inclusive
growth, while preserving macro-financial stability and further strengthening the external
position. Moderate fiscal consolidation would help improve funding conditions and facilitate
external adjustment. It should be underpinned by a broad tax revenue strategy and supported by
prudent borrowing, with a view to generating ample resources for growth-critical spending and
maintaining debt sustainability. The current monetary stance appears appropriate until inflation
and external pressures firmly ease. Financial stability is expected to be preserved through
prudential measures backed by strengthened frameworks for risk assessment and protocols on
crisis management. Structural policies should address longstanding supply bottlenecks, deepen
financial markets, and create a more supportive trade and investment climate in order to expand
the export base, stimulate job creation, and raise potential growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management,
which has strengthened policy and reserve buffers. Directors, however, noted that the economy
faces downside risks, particularly those arising from external sources. In this context, Directors
agreed that policy priorities and structural reforms should continue to focus on consolidating
recent stability gains, containing vulnerabilities, and boosting growth potential.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to maintain a prudent fiscal stance to enhance
resilience to shocks. They welcomed the decisive measures taken to eliminate the bulk of fuel
subsidies. Directors supported the use of the expanded fiscal space to increase growth-critical
social and capital spending, noting that bridging infrastructure needs would enhance Indonesia’s
longer-term growth prospects. To achieve this goal, they underscored the importance of raising
nonoil tax revenues, including by strengthening tax administration. Directors also encouraged
further efforts to phase out the remaining subsidies, while protecting the most vulnerable
households. In addition, they recommended close monitoring of risks related to state-owned
enterprises and public-private partnerships.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be broadly appropriate to anchor
inflation expectations and support external adjustment. They noted that continued exchange rate
and bond yield flexibility would help mitigate the impact of external shocks. Directors supported
efforts to deepen money markets to improve liquidity management and strengthen monetary
transmission.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors observed that Indonesia’s financial system remains sound. With the system having
transitioned to a new regulatory and supervisory architecture, they stressed the importance of
further progress to enhance macro- and microprudential oversight, strengthen the capacity for
risk assessment, and expeditiously put in place an effective crisis management framework,
including by enacting the Financial System Safety Net Law. A number of Directors advised
removal of interest caps on deposits. They supported efforts to strengthen corporate sector
resilience, including by better managing rising external debt. Noting the progress made in the
AML/CFT framework, Directors encouraged further efforts to address the remaining
deficiencies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on supply-side reforms to alleviate infrastructure
bottlenecks, deepen financial markets, and streamline investment approvals in order to bolster
employment and growth prospects. Going forward, they highlighted the importance of improving
the trade and investment regime, addressing labor market issues, including by aligning wage
settlements with productivity increases, and fostering human resource development, focusing
particularly on investment in education. Efforts to broaden the export base will also be important.

Statement by Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Evie Akbar, Advisor to Executive Director
March 9, 2015
1.
On behalf Indonesian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF mission team
for the constructive and candid discussions during the Article IV consultation. The
discussions focused on the new administration’ policies to manage vulnerabilities and
boost potential growth in the medium-term. We are encouraged by staff’ recognition that
the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management has bolstered policy credibility and
strengthened the external resiliency of Indonesian economy.
2.
As clearly described by staff, the Indonesian economy continues to demonstrate
its resilience and is on better footing to weathering the unfavorable and headwinds of
global development. Macroeconomic stability is preserved and economic rebalancing
progresses to a more sustainable path, underpinned by economic stabilisation policy and
structural reforms. Financial system stability is also maintained with the support of
steadfast banking system resilience and sound financial market performance. To arrive at
this stage, the authorities have continuously strengthened the economic fundamental,
including taking bold and pre-emptive macroeconomic policies to withstand a spillover
impact from global economic adjustment.
3.
Moreover, successful elections in mid 2014 have brought momentum and
optimism to the country. The new government has put structural reforms as its priority to
address infrastructure bottlenecks and sustain a balanced growth in the medium-term.
This has brought back investor confidence as reflected in substantial capital inflows
in 2014. Moving forward, the authorities have set out clear strategies to secure
macroeconomic and financial stability. They have also laid solid foundation to maintain a
balanced and sustainable growth in the longer term. These include maintaining prudent
fiscal management by managing the fiscal deficit at the low level, and keeping debt to the
GDP ratio at the sustainable level. Exchange rate will also be kept flexible, to function as
a shock absorber, as well as a facilitator of external adjustment.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
4.
The Indonesian economy grew 5.02 percent (yoy) in 2014; remain strong despite
slowing from 5.6 percent in 2013. The lower economic growth in 2014 was inevitably as
a result of slower-than expected global growth which in turn affects export performance.
Furthermore, domestic demand growth moderated, in line with the authorities' policies to
prioritize economic stabilization. In 2015, the authorities expect the growth to accelerate
to 5.4 -5.8 percent, higher than staff’s projection of 5.2 percent. Strong household
consumption and greater fiscal capacity to support economic activity will swiftly catalyze
higher economic growth.

5.
CPI inflation escalated to 8.36 percent in December 2014, mostly due to the rise
in administered price components. The fuel price adjustment in November 2014 has
temporary put upward pressure on inflation. Nevertheless, the core inflation was
relatively well managed at 4.93 percent, showing that the monetary policy stance could
contain the second round effect of fuel prices hike. The authorities believe that the
inflation has reached its peak in December 2014 as illustrated in declining level of CPI
inflation in first two months of 2015, which fell to 6.3 percent (y/y) in February. Going
forward, the authorities are assured that the inflation will be contained and reach the
target of 4+1 percent in 2015.
6.
On the fiscal side, the authorities continue to maintain sound fiscal management
and keep debt to GDP ratio at a safe level to secure fiscal sustainability. Recognizing the
importance of infrastructure to lift the potential output in the medium-term, the focus of
fiscal policy is increasing budget allocation for infrastructure investment and poverty
alleviation.
External Sector Assessment
7.
Coherent stabilization policies in monetary and fiscal front, as well as improved
investor confidence have significantly enhanced the Balance of Payments (BOP) in 2014.
The BOP recorded a surplus of US$ 15.2 billion, against a deficit of US$7.3 billion
in 2013 as the current account improved and financial account recorded a sizable surplus.
The current account deficit narrowed to US$26.2 billion (2.95 percent of GDP) from US$
29.1 billion (3.18 percent of GDP) in 2013. It is worth to note that the improvement in
the current account was supported by higher the non-oil/gas trade balance as a result of
stronger manufacturing exports, and declining imports due to subdued domestic demand.
Furthermore, the large influx of foreign capital made the financial and capital account
register a surplus of US$43.6 billion. This includes a rise in Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) inflows that extended to manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and transportation &
communication sectors.
8.
The authorities view that Indonesia's external position is in line with its mediumterm fundamental. The current account deficit is within the range as suggested by the
EBA, a model that the authorities have replicated to ensure their assessment is
comparable to Fund's suggested best practice. The current policies, including the flexible
exchange rate, have facilitated external adjustments in the current account toward a sound
level as well as better composition. Manufacturing sectors have improved and could
ultimately compensate a decline in commodity export following a decrease in commodity
prices. Furthermore, Indonesia is on the crossroad to move up from middle income
country group. Increasing the economic activity still requires more import contents that
may lead to the current account deficit. In this regard, staff could have provided more
granular recommendation on how to balance between effort to promote economic activity
and to maintain healthy external balance.

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Policy
9.
The authorities are cognizant of the importance of anchoring inflation expectation
and managing external shocks. In this regard, Bank Indonesia (BI) launched the policy
mix by adopting tight monetary policy to control inflation, maintaining flexible exchange
rate to promote an adjustment on the current account, and introducing capital flow
management (CFM) to dampen short-term excessive volatility. The rise in policy and
lending facility rates to 7.75 percent and 8.00 percent following the fuel prices
adjustment in November 2014 had brought down the spike in inflation rate; meanwhile
flexible exchange rate and CFM have supported the authorities in narrowing the current
account deficit and strengthening external resiliency.
10.
On February 2015, BI lowered the policy rate and the deposit facility rate 25 bps
to 7.50 percent and 5.50 percent respectively. This decision was taken after the
authorities' comprehensive assessment concluded that a drop in the expected oil prices
along with benign development in domestic food prices and manageable domestic
demand will present considerable downside risks to expected inflation. Hence the
authorities are confident that inflation will remain under control and will fall at the lower
end of the 4+1 percent target range in 2015 and 2016.
11.
The authorities would consistently adopt flexible exchange rate in line with its
economic fundamental value. This would help to facilitate external adjustments and
safeguard current account sustainability. The authorities' also share staff’s assessment on
the importance of strengthening monetary policy transmission; thus, they would further
enhance the monetary operations frameworks. Recognizing the importance of deepening
financial market, the authorities move forward with efforts to address shallow financial
market. These include amending BI’s regulation on hedging activities to increase hedged
market liquidity, and introducing Islamic Foreign Currency Term-Deposit. Bond yield
flexibility will also be continued to complement primary response against external shocks
as currently practiced.
Fiscal Policy
12.
As acknowledged by staff, the government's fiscal rule has provided a solid
nominal anchor. The authorities deliberately adopt prudent fiscal policy by maintaining
the deficit below 2.5 percent and managing public debt at a low level. In 2014, the fiscal
deficit was targeted at 2.4 percent of GDP and public debt was successfully retained
below 30 percent of GDP. Initiatives to maintain strong fiscal position were in place,
ranging from enhancing revenue to improving the quality of spending. In terms of
optimizing revenue, tax reforms will continuously be pursued. Meanwhile, on improving
the quality of spending, the recent fuel price adjustment was the main policy measures to
cut spending. The reforms on energy subsidies provide significant fiscal space to
anticipate undesirable impacts from global economic development, as well as to invest in
infrastructure projects. Considering the impact of rising fuel prices to the low-income and

vulnerable people, the authorities launched a compensation program by distributing
cashless smart cards system that covers education, cost of living, and health insurance
and medical benefit.
13.
Moving forward, the authorities reiterate its commitment to maintain sound fiscal
management. Fiscal policy will focus on improving budget structure to buttress real
sector activities and reduce poverty while maintaining macroeconomic stability and
boosting potential growth in the medium term. Continued efforts to improve the current
account would also be enforced by providing fiscal incentives for industries that produce
intermediate goods and re-investing their dividends, as well as strengthening reinsurance
and local shipping industry. In light of this, the authorities expect the fiscal deficit to be
around 1.91 percent of GDP in 2015.
14.
The authorities are mindful that continued decline in oil prices will have an
impact on non-tax revenue. They will strive to substantially increase tax revenue in order
to offset lower non-tax revenue. In this connection, the authorities will persevere to
maintain sustainable revenue sources by revamping tax administration, increasing
compliance of individual taxpayers, strengthening enforcement and reducing tax
distortion in strategic sectors, broadening tax based, optimizing custom and excise
policies and enhancing the VAT system.
15.
On the expenditure side, budget spending is intended to stimulate the economy
through increasing capital expenditure to improve competitiveness and production
capacity. The authorities would also reallocate budget to productive spending to generate
employment and alleviate poverty. In this regard, additional budget would be allocated to
village funds to induce productive activity in the remote areas and promote more
inclusive growth, as well as capital injection to SOEs to support infrastructure
development.
Financial Sector
16.
Indonesia financial sector remains strong amidst challenging macroeconomic
environment in 2014. Industry wide, banks are well capitalized and equipped with ample
liquidity, with Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is maintained at 19.36 percent, much
higher than required minimum level. Credit and liquidity risks are also contained,
underpinned by solid capital structure. Despite showing an uptick, Non Performing Loans
(NPLs) were retained at low level of 2.2 percent. Meanwhile credit growth decelerated to
11.6 percent, in line with subsiding domestic economy activity. Sound banking system is
confirmed by stress test conducted by the authorities which demonstrates that Indonesian
banking sector possesses strong resilience to weather severe shocks.
17.
While staff has concern on the possibility of renewed funding pressures in
banking system in the event that deposit growth lags credit growth, the authorities are
confident that the concern is unlikely to materialize. Heightened funding pressures in

early 2014 were owing to segmented market and seasonal factor due to government fiscal
contraction, while banking liquidity remains sufficient. The liquidity condition has been
improved during the second half of 2014, in line with the fiscal expansion and
improvement in deposit growth. Furthermore, demand for credit was low, thus it lessened
funding pressures.
18.
The authorities continue to employ macro-prudential policy to maintain financial
stability. They will also launch measures to enhance funding resources for banks while
promoting financial market deepening and extending loan to productive sectors. Steps to
strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision continue to progress, among others,
by developing integrated risk based supervision, increasing banks' capital to meet Basel
III standard, adjusting capital requirements and product enrichment for insurance industry
and encouraging more firms to accumulate funds through capital market.
19.
Meanwhile, risk form the corporate sector is expected to be contained as the
authorities have issued regulation to promote prudent external debt management for nonbank corporations1. The purpose of this regulation is to further deepen the financial
market as well as to mitigate risks on private external debt vulnerability, primarily
currency risk, liquidity risk, and over-leverage risk. To confront the aforementioned risks,
Bank Indonesia requires non-bank corporations holding external debt to fulfill three
requirements, namely a minimum hedging ratio to mitigate currency risk, a minimum
forex liquidity ratio to mitigate liquidity risk and a minimum credit rating to mitigate
over-leverage risk. In addition to ensuring prudential principles, the minimum hedging
ratio required by the regulation will also contribute in expanding the hedging market.
While the corporate moves toward better prudent practices, banking sector has cushioned
themselves with the sufficient capital buffers.
20.
Furthermore, acknowledging the importance of crisis management framework, the
work on finalizing the Financial Sector Safety Net (FSSN) Law is on progress and has
become a top priority of the new government to be completed this year.
Structural Reforms
21.
We concur with staff on the need of upfront actions to enhance structural reforms.
In light of this, the new government has a strong commitment on structural reforms to
improve productivity, explore new source of growth, develop financial markets and
undertake a comprehensive energy policy. Fuels subsidy reforms taken at the end of 2014
demonstrated the authorities' swift actions to advance structural reforms. The main focus
of structural reforms is to address supply bottlenecks, diversify the economy from
commodity sector and raise potential growth. In this connection, the new government has

1

This includes Bank Indonesia regulation No. 16/20/PBI/2014 concerning Prudential Principles for the Management of
Non-Bank Corporate External Debt to corporate borrowers of foreign loans on 28th October 2014 which was further
amended with BI Regulation No. 16/21/PBI/2014 dated 29 December 2014.

set up infrastructure investment plan for 2015-2019 that covers many sectors, such as
transportation, energy, clean water and telecommunications.
22.
The implementation of infrastructure development is complemented by efforts to
improve business climate. In doing so, the authorities implement One Stop Service to
streamline approval process, improve the quality of public service and governance, step
up with the implementation of the Land Acquisition Law, increase productivity by
providing incentives for research and development activity, as well as strengthen labor
policy. The authorities would also develop agriculture and fishery sectors to support food
security and generate employment.
23.
Finally we are pleased to share that we continuously improve our AML/CFT
compliance and this effort has been acknowledged by the FATF in its February 2015
public statement.
Conclusion
24.
In summary, amidst the global uncertainty, Indonesia moves forward to transform
into a better, more sound and sustainable economy. Nevertheless, the authorities
recognize the challenges that lie ahead and do not want to loose sight. They will closely
monitor the latest development of both domestic and global economy in order to maintain
consistent and bold policy measures. The authorities also reiterate their commitment to
remain vigilant and stand ready to take proactive measures to ensure that macroeconomic
and financial stability are well preserved. Having said that, the authorities would benefit
from staff's advice that not only helps Indonesia to stay in current stage, but also takes
Indonesia to reach a higher level. In that regard, they look forward to a continued
constructive engagement with the Fund.
