STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 3, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Background: The large imbalances that accumulated prior to the global financial crisis
culminated in a collapse of the banking sector in early 2013. In response, the authorities
took unprecedented measures and adopted an economic adjustment program,
supported by official financing, aimed at securing financial stability and fiscal
sustainability.
Recent developments and outlook: GDP contracted sharply in 2013. Wages and prices
also declined, and unemployment increased. While bank deposit outflows have slowed,
non-performing loans have risen sharply, and credit remains impaired. The outlook is
difficult, with the recession expected to continue this year, followed by a modest
recovery starting next year. Risks remain tilted to the downside.
Reform agenda: The authorities need to overcome recent delays in the implementation
of their adjustment program. A key priority is addressing high non-performing loans,
which requires putting in place a strong private-sector debt-restructuring framework,
including legislation to facilitate foreclosures, complemented by a modernized
insolvency regime. Banks should continue to restructure and build strong capital buffers.
Removal of external-payment restrictions must proceed prudently. Continued fiscal
consolidation is required to ensure long-run sustainability, complemented by firm
implementation of structural reforms.

BACKGROUND
A. Crisis and Immediate Policy Response
1.
Cyprus accumulated large imbalances in the run-up to the 2008 global crisis. An annual
growth rate of 4 percent in the decade preceding the crisis masked the build-up of unsustainable
imbalances and vulnerabilities. Following EU entry and the removal of capital account restrictions in
2004, significant foreign inflows led to a rapid

productivity led to a widening of the current-account deficit to about 16 percent of GDP at end-2008.
2.
The imbalances eventually culminated in a banking-sector collapse (Figure 1). As foreign
inflows slowed and bank credit growth shrunk, the housing boom turned to bust, and output fell in
2009. In response, fiscal policy was loosened, which led to a rapid deterioration in the budget balance
and public debt. Domestic weaknesses, compounded by tight sovereign-bank links and an
intensification of the Greek crisis, resulted in a loss of market access in May 2011. The explosion of
Cyprus’s main power station in July added to the economic distress. And the decision to restructure
Greek sovereign debt in late 2011 dealt a severe blow to the two largest Cypriot banks, which lost a
combined 25 percent of GDP. As a result, one bank had to be recapitalized through state support
(10 percent of GDP) in 2012. Deposit outflows intensified, and reliance on Emergency Liquidity
Assistance (ELA) rose to 60 percent of GDP by end-2012.
3.
In March 2013, the authorities took unprecedented measures to stem the crisis. Cyprus
requested official assistance from the EU/IMF in mid-2012. However, negotiations were protracted,
due to difficulties in addressing the large capital needs of the banking sector—estimated at about
60 percent of GDP—without endangering debt sustainability (Box 1), as well as to the impending
presidential election in early 2013. Following the elections, the new government moved aggressively,
resolving the two systemic and by-then economically insolvent banks2, recapitalizing the resulting
institution at no fiscal cost through bail-in of bank creditors (including uninsured depositors) and
selling the banks’ Greek operations. Domestic and external payment restrictions were imposed (the
latter comprising both capital controls and some exchange restrictions) to prevent a bank run.

Box 1. Addressing the Banking Crisis
Huge challenges…Cyprus had an outsized banking sector, which was found severely undercapitalized, with
the two largest banks found economically insolvent. Capital needs (excluding the 2012 recapitalization
bond and after bail in of junior debt) were initially estimated by PIMCO at just over €10 billion, large not
only relative to Cyprus’s GDP but also in historical comparison.

...and limited options…Bank recapitalization with public funds
would have rendered public debt—already close to 90 percent
of GDP at end-2012—unsustainable. Moreover, rather than
addressing the problem at its root by dealing with economic
insolvency in the largest two banks, this would have shifted the
burden to the public-sector balance sheet, putting a daunting

burden on the Cypriot taxpayer. Given the significant share of public debt held by the official sector and
banks, debt restructuring was also not feasible. Direct bank support by the ESM could have minimized fiscal
costs and reduced sovereign-bank links, but was not available.
...led to an unprecedented policy response in March 2013.1,2 A first attempt to recapitalize the banking
sector through the imposition of a levy on all bank deposits (equivalent to around two years of interest
earnings, and differentiated by size) was rejected by parliament on March 19 and was followed by a bank
run, as the proposal was perceived to violate deposit insurance. With financial stability endangered, the
authorities imposed a bank holiday, and on March 25 intervened the two economically insolvent banks.
Following a purchase-and-assumption transaction, the resulting institution was recapitalized at no fiscal
cost, through bail in of bank creditors, including uninsured deposits, which were converted into equity.
Following the bank holiday, the authorities imposed restrictions on domestic and external payment flows.
Cyprus’s response to the crisis entailed difficult but unavoidable decisions. Bank economic insolvency
was addressed upfront and debt sustainability was protected, thus limiting the burden on the Cypriot
taxpayer.

This paved the way for an agreement on an adjustment program supported by official
financing. The three-year program—underpinned by financial support of €10 billion (60 percent of
Cyprus’s GDP) from European partners and the IMF—aimed at stabilizing the financial sector and
ensuring sustainable public finances. The financial sector strategy focused on: (i) completing the
recapitalization and restructuring of the banking sector, including the cooperative credit (coop)
sector; (ii) implementing a debt-restructuring framework to address rising non-performing loans
(NPLs) and private indebtedness; (iii) developing a roadmap for the gradual relaxation of payment
restrictions; and (iv) strengthening bank regulation and supervision and the implementation of the
AML/CFT framework. Fiscal policy aimed to achieve an ambitious yet well-paced consolidation,
balancing short-term cyclical and longer-term sustainability concerns, complemented by
comprehensive structural reforms.

B. Recent Economic Developments
5.
The correction of imbalances resulted in a deep but unavoidable recession. Output
declined by 5.4 percent in 2013, as high macroeconomic uncertainty, the large shock to income and
wealth, and ongoing fiscal consolidation depressed consumption and investment. All sectors
contracted, with construction and financial services—which had expanded rapidly before the crisis—
declining sharply. Nevertheless, the recession was less deep than that projected at the onset of the
program (8.7 percent), as households used savings to smooth consumption. In the first half of 2014,
output contracted by a further 3.2 percent year-on-year, with private consumption stabilizing in the
second quarter, and the tourism and trade sectors growing (Figure 2).

The downturn has been partially mitigated by
price and wage flexibility (Figure 3). Prices declined in the
second half of 2013 and early 2014, with inflation
averaging -0.3 percent in the first eight months of 2014.
Wages also adjusted, due to public-sector wage cuts and a
renegotiation of contracts in the private sector. This helped
contain the rise in unemployment, which peaked at about
16 percent in 2013 before moderating slightly due to a
decline in labor-force participation.

The external current account has adjusted
(Figure 5). The current account deficit declined to about
2 percent of GDP in 2013 from a peak of 15.6 percent
of GDP in 2008. The trade balance registered a
2 percent-of-GDP surplus, driven by contracting
imports, which more than offset falling exports. The
income balance remained in deficit, reflecting the large
negative international investment position (-86 percent
of GDP at end-2013). Import growth turned positive in
mid-2014, and goods exports and tourist arrivals have
risen.

the highest in Europe, at 410 percent of GDP at end2013. Nevertheless, households’ net financial-asset
position has declined but remains large and positive
(140 percent of GDP), while that of corporates is large
and negative (-200 percent of GDP). Housing prices
continued to adjust in 2013–14, and are now 25 percent
below their 2008 peak, pointing to a large deterioration
in the private sector’s non-financial asset position.

Cyprus returned to the sovereign-bond market in mid-2014 after a three-year hiatus.
Due to improved market sentiment in the region, but also to progress in addressing the crisis, Cypriot
bond yields declined from close to 25 percent in March 2013 to under 5 percent in September 2014.
In June 2014, Cyprus issued a five-year €750 million Eurobond. The proceeds were used to repay part
of the 2012 recapitalization bond held by BoC. This helped smooth the debt-maturity profile,
complementing measures taken in 2013 to extend the maturity of €1 billion of domestic debt and
restructure a bilateral Russian loan maturing in 2016.

The core domestic financial sector has been downsized, recapitalized, and restructured.
Following the March 2013 measures, the disposal of non-core bank assets, and further loan-book
deleveraging, the domestic banking sector declined to 315 percent of GDP in March 2014 from
550 percent at end-2012 (foreign banks add another 160 percent of GDP). Its CET1 capital ratio is
estimated to have increased to close to 14 percent of risk-weighted assets at end-August 2014 (from
3.5 percent at end-2012), as a result of: (i) BoC’s recapitalization at no fiscal cost in 2013 and an
additional private placement of €1 billion completed in September 2014, (ii) the recapitalization of
Hellenic Bank through private funds in late 2013; and (iii) the injection of public funds (€1.5 billion) in
the coop sector in early 2014. The latter was also consolidated from 93 entities into 18.

and limited collateral buffers as asset quality deteriorates.

C. Context for the Discussions
14.
In the context of their adjustment program, the authorities have implemented an
ambitious package of reforms (Figure 8). Policy recommendations included in the last Article IV
consultation have been adopted, although some only after the crisis hit. These include an ambitious
fiscal consolidation during 2012–14, measures to shore up the banking sector and strengthen
supervision, and reforms of the public-sector wage-indexation mechanism (COLA) and the pension
system. The authorities went beyond these to also reform the welfare system and the revenue
administration, and introduce a new privatization framework, among others.
15.
Delays in program implementation have recently emerged. Following the break-up of the
governing coalition in February 2014, the government lost its majority in parliament. Since then,
political opposition to the program has risen, signs of reform fatigue have emerged, and vested
interests have been gaining traction. As a result, the authorities have encountered difficulties in
implementing key elements of the debt-restructuring legal framework to address NPLs, with
parliament having approved foreclosure legislation that is not in line with program objectives (some
of the bills were subsequently referred to the Supreme Court for a decision on their constitutionality,
expected later in October). In light of these developments and ensuing legal uncertainty, the
completion of the fifth review has been delayed.

Figure 8. Main Reform Initiatives since the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Article IV Recommendations

Policy Actions

Restoring sound public finances

• Adjustment measures of 2.5% of GDP in 2012
• Reverse widening deficits and put public debt on
a downward path
• Measures should focus on expenditure
reductions: (i.e. containment of public sector
wages and benefits and further improvements in
the targeting of social transfers) and a moderate
increase in VAT rates

• Adjustment measures of 7.5% GDP implemented
(2013-16), including: (i) public wage cuts of 9-15%;
(ii) freeze of public sector wages until 2016; (iii)
reduction in public sector employment by 4,500; (iv)
streamlining social transfers and public employee
allowances; (v) standard VAT rate increase of 2%;
and (vi) increase in contributions on earnings and
pensions and increases in CIT, withholding, property
and excise taxes

Implementing structural reforms
• Reform of COLA indexation (2012)
• Improve flexibility of labor markets, including by
reforming the cost-of-living allowance mechanism
(COLA)
• Reform the national and government pension
scheme
• Reform budget institutions by introducing
medium-term budgetary framework and fully
implementing the EU fiscal framework directives,
including the introduction of fiscal rules

• Reform of General Social Insurance Scheme and
Government Pension Scheme (2013)
• Adoption of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Systems Law (2013), introducing medium-term
budget framework, fiscal rules, and fiscal-risk
management framework
• Also legislated a reform of the social welfare
system (2014), a privatization law (2014), and a
reform of revenue administration, including
strengthening its enforcement powers (2014)

Strengthening the financial sector
• Insolvent banks were resolved and recapitalized
while maintaining fiscal sustainability (2013)
• Heightened vigilance and contingency planning
• Ensure bank capital ratios are in line with EBA
requirements; address liquidity needs; take prompt
corrective action to recapitalize or resolve banks;
revamp the bank framework law; strengthen and
bring supervision and regulation of coops in line
with those for banks

• Other banks and the coops sector were
recapitalized (2013-14)
• Modern bank-resolution framework implemented
(2013-14)
• Supervision and regulation of the financial system
strengthened, including by unifying supervision of
banks and coops (2013-14)
• Also strengthened the AML/CFT framework (201314)

European policies remain broadly supportive. Since the crisis, key policy initiatives have
been put in place at the euro-area level, which Cyprus is expected to benefit from. The upcoming
transition to the Single-Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will harmonize supervisory and regulatory
standards across the region, and the possibility of direct ESM support to banks could help limit
sovereign-bank links. The ECB’s recent policy rate cut is in line with Cyprus’s cyclical position,
although deposit rates in Cyprus remain elevated, reflecting a still-high risk premium. The new TLTRO
and asset-purchase schemes to support lending are also welcome, although to achieve more than a
limited effect in Cyprus, where asset quality has been deteriorating, the ECB would have to further
relax its requirements. Further progress with completing the monetary and fiscal union could help
support Cyprus’s efforts to normalize bank-funding conditions, remove external-payment restrictions,
and preserve fiscal sustainability.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Discussions focused on the policy agenda to support the recovery. They covered three
main areas: (i) macroeconomic fundamentals—including an assessment of consumption-saving
dynamics, housing prices, competitiveness, and long-term potential growth—and risks; (ii) financial
sector policies to address high NPLs and establish conditions to revive lending and normalize
external payment flows; and (iii) fiscal and structural policies for sustainable public finances.
Discussions highlighted the importance of an appropriate policy mix to support the recovery through
a gradual fiscal adjustment minimizing the negative fiscal impulse together with financial policies
reducing NPLs, facilitating private-debt restructuring, and strengthening bank capital and liquidity to
revive lending. Over the medium-term, boosting depositor confidence and gradually lifting external
payment restrictions, together with lowering public debt, are essential to restoring external stability.

A. Outlook and Risks
18.
The recession is expected to continue this year. Output is projected to fall by a further
3.2 percent in 2014 (somewhat better than the fourth program review projection), bringing the 2013–
14 recession to a cumulative 8.6 percent. This is 4 percentage points less than initially projected,

housing market adjusts. Unemployment is projected to reach 16.6 percent, and the price level to

expected to be credit-less and led by service sectors less dependent on credit, such as tourism and

a further modest depreciation of the real-exchange rate and an improvement in competitiveness.

Risks to the medium-term outlook are tilted to the downside (Annex 1).



Domestic risks: Prolonged delays in program implementation due to political tensions could
have adverse implications for confidence and the recovery. Specifically, difficulties in addressing
NPLs, including as a result of an inadequate debt-restructuring legal framework, and delays in
meeting potential bank-capital needs following the comprehensive assessment could reignite
negative bank-sovereign-real-sector feedback loops. Moreover, on the fiscal front, resistance to
consolidation and reform fatigue could compromise debt sustainability. Even if the authorities
manage to put the program back on track, deeper and more prolonged private sector
deleveraging, exacerbated by the impact of persistently low inflation on indebtedness, could
weigh on domestic demand and endanger debt sustainability (Annex 2). Long lasting externalpayment restrictions could damage confidence and FDI, while a too rapid relaxation may exhaust
liquidity buffers and endanger financial stability.



External risks: Weaker euro-area recovery would hurt Cyprus’s exports. Relatively lower euroarea inflation could hinder the envisaged improvement in competitiveness (Annex 3). An increase
in world oil prices due to geopolitical tensions would boost imports and intermediate costs,
dampening activity. While spillovers from the conflict in Ukraine have not been observed so far,
a further escalation of sanctions and retaliatory measures could negatively affect Cyprus through
three channels: (i) trade could suffer, given that service exports to Russia account for over
20 percent of Cyprus’ total exports (mostly tourism); (ii) the service sector could be hit by a
departure of Russian companies registered in Cyprus, which make use of Cypriot business
services; and (iii) fiscal revenues would decline if off-shore companies leave Cyprus (they
contribute 1–2 percent of GDP in corporate income-tax revenue).



Mitigating factors: A continuation of gradually improving quarterly national-accounts trends
could result in higher growth this year, while investment associated with the exploitation of
natural gas could boost growth over the medium term.

22.
The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook and saw some upside potential.
They argued that households may save less, given still low confidence in the banking sector, which
could boost consumption in the medium term. Regarding the housing market, they considered that
prices are bottoming out and could modestly increase by next year, given emerging signs of renewed
domestic and foreign demand. Finally, they saw upside to medium-term output, including due to the
recent gas discoveries. The authorities agreed that a prolonged delay in program implementation
could have adverse implications for the macroeconomic framework and concurred with staff’s views
on external risks.

B. Public Debt and External Sustainability
23.
Public debt is high and vulnerable to shocks (Annex 2). Public debt rose to 112 percent of
GDP at end-2013, due to the large official financing and the sharp fall in output. Debt is projected to
peak at about 126 percent of GDP in 2015 and to decline gradually thereafter toward 100 percent by
2020. Contingent liabilities associated with government guarantees on bank loans (20 percent of

20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GDP) and still-large implicit liabilities associated with
the banks’ reliance on central bank financing
(55 percent of GDP) increase its vulnerability to shocks.
In particular, a growth/interest rate/primary-balance
shock or a shock to growth combined with a
materialization of contingent liabilities could push debt
to very high levels. In these cases, additional financing
measures and commitments from European partners
would be needed to protect debt sustainability.

Cyprus’s external position is also highly
vulnerable (Annex 3). Although external debt has declined, it remains high, at 350 percent of GDP at
end-2013. Financial-sector liabilities—mainly non-resident deposits—are large and unstable,
requiring the maintenance of external-payment restrictions. Reliance on official financing is high and
rising, while external liabilities of the central bank with the Euro-system remain significant. The

standard fundamentals-based models.
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with the risks posed by public and external debt.
Nevertheless, they considered that public sector debt projections remain conservative, given the
assumption of full disbursement of the program buffer and the stringent growth and inflation
projections. They also noted that expected upward revisions to the output level later this year (to
conform to ESA2010 standards) will bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio. They concurred with the
external stability assessment, including the need for moderate medium-term REER adjustment.

C. Financial Sector Policy
26.
While the authorities took decisive action to address the crisis, important challenges
remain. The banking sector is now smaller and better capitalized, domestic payment restrictions
have been eliminated, and deposits have broadly stabilized. However, left unaddressed, high and
rising NPLs would pose a threat to the banking system’s long-term viability and the economic
recovery. Capital buffers in some banks are limited, and bank restructuring remains incomplete,
hampering the resumption of credit and growth. Narrow liquidity buffers and still-large ELA
exposure require the maintenance of external payment restrictions. Finally, the authorities need to
further enhance bank supervision ahead of the transition to the SSM and strengthen the
implementation of the AML/CFT framework.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

CYPRUS

Challenge 1: Addressing NPLs
27.
Early policy initiatives have not managed to curb the rising NPL trend. NPLs are very
high both in a historical and cross-country context. This reflects not only the severe recession, but
also increasing strategic default. Indeed, NPLs exceed what could be explained by unemployment,
especially given the large and positive asset position of households. To facilitate the restructuring of
troubled loans, banks have put in place restructuring units. (A state-backed asset-management
company (AMC) was not created given debt-sustainability concerns limiting the ability to provide
either direct state funding or government guarantees.8) The Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) published
an arrears-management framework (AMF) and Code of Conduct (CoC) to guide the loanrestructuring process and developed a supervisory framework to monitor banks’ capacity and
progress against operational and restructuring indicators. Still, progress has been slow, as incentives
are lacking, and banks need time to build capacity to handle the many NPLs.

28.
Reforming the debt-restructuring legal framework is urgent. The inability to reach
restructuring solutions is largely due to a lack of incentives for borrowers and lenders to negotiate,
including a foreclosure process that takes 10–15 years and outdated corporate-restructuring and
personal-bankruptcy procedures. In this regard:


Foreclosure: The authorities need to implement without delay foreclosure legislation allowing
for a balanced but swift process without interference from government agencies. While a
recently adopted legislative package includes important elements, it also introduces a number of
new obstacles, including processes to delay foreclosures, moratoria, and debt-write-offs
irrespective of viability considerations. These obstacles should be removed to protect the
payment culture and provide incentives for debt restructuring. Indeed, banks are expected to use
the law sparingly and mainly as a negotiation tool, as potentially declining collateral values due

8

Moreover, commercial real-estate related NPLs which are the prime candidate for transfers to an AMC are
concentrated in one bank, limiting the potential benefits of an AMC to achieve economies of scale. For a discussion
of cross-country experience with AMCs, see Section IIA of Selected Issues Paper “Cyprus’s Banking Sector: The Crisis
and its Aftermath”.

22 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CYPRUS

to foreclosures would affect their capital. To protect vulnerable groups, implementation of the
foreclosure law for primary residences should be aligned with the new personal-bankruptcy
legislation, and the authorities should ensure adequate implementation of the new safety-net
reform protecting those most in need.


Insolvency: The foreclosure law will need to be complemented by a modernized corporate and
personal-insolvency legal framework facilitating debt restructuring for viable debtors, and
allowing for speedy liquidation of non-viable companies and for a “fresh start” for individuals
without capacity to repay.

29.
Supervisory tools also need to be strengthened. Banks need stronger capacity and better
incentives and tools to proactively restructure NPLs to spearhead the recovery. The CBC needs to
follow up on its review of banks’ operational capacity and ensure that remaining deficiencies are
being addressed. Moreover, the new voluntary Arrears-Management Framework and Code of
Conduct will need to be further refined and their implementation monitored and enforced through
supervisory action. The authorities should also further leverage the supervisory bank-monitoring
framework as a tool to encourage banks to restructure NPLs. Finally, to facilitate the disposal and
workout of NPLs, the authorities could consider other measures to address legal and other barriers
hampering the sale and servicing of bank loans by third parties.
30.
The authorities recognized the importance of addressing NPLs, but emphasized the
need for adequate safeguards for households. They agreed that the insolvency and foreclosure
legal framework needs strengthening, but stressed that the process should be balanced and
vulnerable groups adequately protected. They also noted risks from potential sharp declines in
property prices as a result of foreclosures. They agreed to further refine the AMF and CoC to better
standardize restructuring processes and tools, emphasizing the importance of adequate supervisory
enforcement of the framework.

Challenge 2: Putting in place the conditions to revive lending
31.
The financial sector needs to maintain strong capital buffers. While banks have been
recapitalized under conservative assumptions (including for housing prices, which were projected to
further fall broadly in line with staff’s baseline scenario) given lingering downside risks and low
provisions, stronger capital buffers would help deal with potential shocks, address high NPLs
proactively, and allow for new lending to support viable investment. Moreover, Cypriot banks need
to ensure adequate buffers in light of the pan-European comprehensive assessment, whose
methodological assumptions and stress-test scenario are somewhat more stringent than those
underlying the banks’ initial recapitalization. The recent market recapitalization of BoC, which
boosted its CET1 capital ratio to 15 percent, is a welcome step, and the bank should ensure that any
additional needs can be covered through market sources, if necessary. Hellenic Bank also indicated
its intention to proactively increase its share capital. The authorities should stand ready to provide
additional support to the coop sector, if needed, in line with the program envelope. Commercial
banks’ renewed access to markets, the availability of ESM direct bank recapitalization support (albeit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

CYPRUS

under stringent conditions), and the program buffer (in excess of 10 percent of GDP) can help
mitigate risks.
32.
Bank restructuring should continue. Banks and coops are progressing with the
implementation of their restructuring plans. They cut their cost-to-income ratios to 40 and
50 percent, respectively, well below the European average (60 percent). BoC finalized its operational
integration with Laiki and disposed of non-core activities abroad. Looking forward, given that BoC’s
operational restructuring plan is broadly on track, the bank’s efforts need to focus on continuing
overseas deleveraging and normalizing funding. Regarding the coops, with the new organizational
structure in place, efforts should focus on ensuring efficient and consistent management of
information, processes, and risks across the sector, including by centralizing the management of
NPLs and early arrears and by further strengthening governance arrangements.
33.
The authorities agreed that strong capital buffers and progress with restructuring are
key to reviving lending. They noted that high bank-funding costs—reflecting an elevated risk
premium due to still-low depositor confidence—hamper the resumption of credit. They agreed that
the normalization of funding conditions and lending rates requires further efforts to bolster
confidence, including by expeditiously addressing any capital shortfalls identified by the
comprehensive assessment. Regarding the restructuring of coops, while they concurred with the
need to strengthen and unify management practices across the sector, they noted that excessive
centralization could jeopardize the sector’s franchise and business model.

Challenge 3: Normalizing external flows
34.
Safeguarding financial stability requires prudent management of payment restrictions.
Domestic payment restrictions imposed during the crisis have been gradually and successfully
relaxed on the basis of the authorities’ published roadmap, as key milestones in the bank
recapitalization and restructuring strategy were achieved. However, owing to the short depositmaturity structure, significant foreign deposits (close to 40 percent of the total), large reliance of BoC
on ELA, and the lack of other market funding, external restrictions remain in place. While restrictions

do not apply to fresh foreign inflows into Cyprus, they limit outflows, hampering trade credit and
affecting overall confidence.
35.
The authorities should relax external restrictions gradually, paying attention to shifts
in both depositor confidence and bank liquidity. A gradual approach is needed to manage
restrictions in line with the banks’ ability to normalize funding conditions, taking into account the
need to maintain depositor confidence, in particular given delays in program implementation. The
approach needs to be underpinned by careful analysis of deposit and liquidity trends and be clearly
communicated to provide for a transparent and predictable process. In the meantime, the CBC will
need to carefully monitor the effectiveness of restrictions through supervisory monitoring and
inspections.
36.
Strengthening bank liquidity will be critical to the eventual exit from external payment
restrictions. BoC’s recent capital increase has helped improve its liquidity position and boost
depositor confidence. And the disposal of foreign operations and partial redemption of the Laiki
recapitalization bond have allowed a reduction in ELA. Still, it will take significant time to fully
normalize BoC’s funding. Efforts to accelerate the resolution of NPLs and to further deleverage
operations abroad can help improve the quality of collateral and generate additional cash flow. BoC
could also seek market (junior) funding, which can further boost confidence, although it will need to
ensure that this funding does not come at an excessive cost. Further Euro-system support to ensure
adequate access to liquidity and a normalization of funding remains essential.
37.
The authorities agreed with the need to manage remaining restrictions cautiously.
Given heightened uncertainty associated with the comprehensive assessment, they extended
existing restrictions until after the successful completion of the assessment and transition to the
SSM. 9 They agreed that subsequent relaxations need to be gradual and based on data analysis, but
stressed the difficulty of assessing and predicting deposit behavior. They remained optimistic that
relaxations could be achieved within a reasonable timeframe.

Challenge 4: Ensuring adequate prudential and AML/CFT supervision
38.
The authorities have taken steps to address weaknesses in the bank supervision and
AML/CFT frameworks. Relaxed supervisory standards before the crisis allowed for excessive credit
growth, weak bank governance and risk-management practices, and fragmented standards across
banks and coops. Moreover, weaknesses in the implementation of the AML/CFT framework may
have contributed to the unsustainable growth of the financial sector. The authorities took steps to
address supervisory shortcomings, including by issuing new directives on provisioning, NPL
disclosure, and loan origination, putting in place a country-wide credit register, unifying the
supervision of banks and coops, and strengthening the resolution authority. They also revised the

25

CYPRUS

AML/CFT legal framework to improve compliance with international standards, strengthened the
CBC’s AML/CFT supervisory resources, and developed risk-based tools.
39.
Efforts must continue to further strengthen bank supervision and the implementation
of the AML/CFT framework:


Supervision: The two largest Cypriot banks and the coops, representing 80 percent of the
sector, will come under the supervision of the SSM in November. Although the transition to the
SSM, including the ongoing comprehensive assessment, are putting strains on the CBC’s
capacity, the CBC should ensure adequate supervision while the banking sector is in a critical
restructuring phase. Future supervisory priorities will need to be coordinated within the SSM,
and Cypriot ownership will be key to ensuring an effective oversight of the sector.



AML/CFT: The authorities need to build on progress to date to step up implementation of the
risk-based framework for AML/CFT supervision for banks and service providers, including by:
(i) further enhancing institutional and staff capacity, (ii) improving coordination with prudential
bank supervision, (iii) strengthening inspection processes, risk-based tools, and the quality of
reports, and (iv) improving enforcement, including by applying appropriate sanctions as needed.
The CBC also needs to complete its AML/CFT investigation of FBME branch operating in Cyprus,
which was intervened in July following the bank’s designation by the U.S. Treasury as an
institution of primary money-laundering concern.

40.
The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen prudential and AML/CFT
supervision. While they looked forward to enhancing coordination of overall policies and bankspecific supervisory work with European practices, they noted that the practical details of the
integration with the SSM still need to be clarified and implemented, which could take time and
resources. While they considered that their AML/CFT framework is at least comparable to that of
other countries, they agreed with the need to further strengthen its implementation, especially with
respect to banks and service providers, as a way to rebuild Cyprus’s reputation as a strong and
sustainable financial and business center.

D. Fiscal Policy
41.
The policy objective is to unwind the
imbalances accumulated before the crisis and put
public debt on a firmly downward path. The loose
fiscal policies initiated in 2008, unwinding of the
property-market boom, and deep recession dealt a
severe blow to the fiscal balance, which went from an
overall surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2008 to average
annual deficits of 6 percent of GDP during 2009–12.
This, together with the 2012 public support to Laiki
bank, led to an almost doubling of public debt during
this period. The authorities aim to achieve a primary

surplus of 4 percent of GDP by 2018—similar to the level reached in 2008—to lower public debt to
around 100 percent of GDP by 2020. Primary surpluses will need to be maintained beyond 2020 to
bring debt to its pre-crisis level (50–60 percent of GDP). While achieving and sustaining primary
surpluses of such magnitude can be challenging, a number of countries have done so successfully.10

However, to attain the primary-surplus target of 4 percent

macroeconomic baseline.

In 2015, the primary deficit is projected to remain around at 1 percent of GDP. This
represents a modest improvement in the primary balance net of one-offs, given the overperformance in 2013–14 and the weak expected recovery in 2015. To ensure the fiscal neutrality of
the new welfare reform, the authorities need to implement permanent measures of 0.3 percent of
GDP, which should be focused on improving the targeting and rationalization of other social
benefits. Should costs of the welfare reform turn out to be higher than expected, the authorities
should be prepared to offset these during 2015 with high-quality measures. However, if

Additional adjustment measures are needed over the medium term to ensure fiscal
sustainability. The adjustment should start in 2016, be growth-friendly and balanced over time, and
focus on reversing the statutory spending increases that

46.
The authorities had a more favorable view of fiscal prospects. They expected a better
fiscal outturn in 2014 and considered that a more modest fiscal effort will be required to attain the
2018 primary-surplus target, given the over-performance to date and a likely stronger economic
recovery. While they saw merit in reforming the public wage-setting framework to better link wages
with productivity, they did not agree with further reducing wage levels. They saw scope for further
rationalization of social benefits, pension gratuities, and education spending, but were reluctant to
consider specific measures beyond those required to ensure fiscal neutrality of the welfare reform.

E. Structural Reforms
47.
Recently-legislated structural reforms should be followed through and fully
implemented. Building on the 2012 reforms of the pension system and the wage-indexation (COLA)
framework, the authorities initiated additional reforms aimed at: (i) improving the targeting,
coverage, and administration of the welfare system; (ii) unifying the revenue administration and
enhancing its collection powers; (iii) enhancing public financial management by allowing for
medium-term budget formulation, performance-based budgeting, and fiscal risk management; and
(iv) facilitating privatization of state-owned assets. To reap their long-term benefits, reforms need to
be followed through by implementing remaining secondary legislation, reorganizing resources and
building capacity to meet the new needs, monitoring reform outcomes, and adjusting reform
parameters as needed. Additional medium-term reforms—such as to healthcare and public

Careful execution of the revenue administration reform is needed to support the fiscal
consolidation effort. The reform aims to increase the effectiveness of tax collections by integrating
the two tax departments (VAT and direct taxes) under a unified function-based structure. With the
new legal structure in place, the authorities should focus on timely implementation of reform steps,
—including setting up a large taxpayers’ office and developing a new tax procedure code—with a

view to achieving full integration of the tax departments over the medium-term. They will need to
manage the transition carefully, to ensure that revenue collections are being protected during the
transition period, including by making use of new collection-enforcement powers and continuing
with joint audits of large and high-risk taxpayers.
50.
The authorities should manage fiscal risks prudently and fully implement their new
public financial management framework. Given fiscal risks

address operational weaknesses to allow for an eventual exit
from official assistance and a full return to markets. Finally, to implement the new fiscal responsibility
and budget systems law (FRBSL), the authorities should press ahead with secondary legislation and
guidelines and strengthen budget processes.
51.
Looking forward, a growth strategy could help boost Cyprus’s competitiveness and
economic potential. Cyprus ranks relatively favorably on structural indicators compared to other
countries: it ranked 58th (out of 148) in the World Bank’s 2013–14 global-competitiveness index and
22nd (out of 153) in the 2013 Freedom of the World report. Still, there is room for improvement, and
the authorities are developing a strategy to address bottlenecks to growth. The strategy should
focus on areas where Cyprus lags relative to best practice and where the impact on growth is the
largest, including: (i) opening up of closed professions by streamlining licensing restrictions;
(ii) removing barriers to competition, including protection of firms and price controls; (iii) reducing
red tape; (v) privatizing state-owned enterprises; (vi) strengthening the legal system; and
(vi) fostering innovation. Indeed, structural reforms in these areas are estimated to have a significant

52.
The authorities agreed with the identified structural reform needs and priorities. They
concurred that careful implementation of the GMI is essential to build credibility for the new reform
and were confident that the system will generate cost savings through enhanced scrutiny of
eligibility. They acknowledged the heightened risks during the transition to the integrated revenue
administration, but also stressed risks related to the immediate and full implementation of the new
powers to collect tax debt. They also noted that capacity constraints may pose challenges to their
strategy to collect tax debt and monitor government guarantees. They agreed with the need to
develop a long-term growth strategy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
The Cypriot economy was buffeted by an unprecedented shock in 2013. This exposed
large vulnerabilities and imbalances, which culminated in one of the largest banking sector collapses
on record. In response, the authorities took exceptional measures, including the resolution of the
two largest banks, both of them economically insolvent; recapitalization of the resulting institution
through the bail in of creditors, including uninsured depositors; and the imposition of sweeping
payment restrictions.
54.
The authorities have come a long way in addressing the crisis. In the context of an
ambitious adjustment program supported by international financial assistance, they completed the
recapitalization of the banking sector consistent with fiscal sustainability, downsized and
restructured financial institutions, and liberalized domestic payment flows. These achievements,
complemented by ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, helped Cyprus re-access
international markets earlier this year.
55.
But overcoming the legacy of the crisis will be challenging. The crisis has imposed a
large cost on the economy and on the population. A painful but unavoidable recession is underway,
and unemployment remains very high. Both the private and public sectors remain heavily indebted.
And the banking sector remains vulnerable, given high and rising NPLs, tight liquidity and capital
buffers, and the need to maintain external payment restrictions to protect financial stability.
56.
The authorities need to overcome recent delays in the implementation of their
adjustment program. Heightened political opposition, entrenched vested interests, and reform
fatigue are taking a toll on the program, which has been delayed after eighteen months of strong
implementation. The authorities need to redouble their efforts to put the program back on track to
achieve a durable economic recovery and an eventual exit from official financing.

57.
Addressing high NPLs is essential for the financial sector’s viability and the economy’s
recovery. To encourage loan restructuring and restore the payment culture, the authorities need to
implement without delay legislation to streamline foreclosures. This should be complemented by a
comprehensive reform of the legal framework for insolvency. They should also strengthen
supervisory incentives for banks to proactively restructure NPLs and attain sustainable solutions.
58.
Adequate capital buffers and further bank restructuring are key to reviving lending.
The recent recapitalization of Bank of Cyprus is an encouraging sign of the return of confidence in
the financial sector. The authorities should stand ready to further strengthen capital buffers
consistent with the pan-European comprehensive assessment, and ensure that banks and the coop
sector continue with restructuring, including by strengthening processes and governance.
59.
External payment restrictions should be managed prudently to safeguard financial
stability. Relaxing these restrictions should be predicated on a normalization of bank funding. The
approach should be gradual and underpinned by a transparent milestone-based roadmap. Staff
supports the request to extend existing exchange restrictions under the IMF’s Article VIII. Adequate
support by the Euro-system to normalize bank funding and liquidity is essential.
60.
Effective prudential and AML/CFT supervision is needed to prevent vulnerabilities from
re-emerging. The authorities should maintain tight supervisory oversight of the banking sector as
they restructure. At the same time, they need to coordinate closely with the SSM to ensure a smooth
transition to the new pan-European supervisory framework. Implementation of the AML/CFT
framework should continue to be strengthened.
61.
Additional medium-term fiscal consolidation will be needed to ensure debt
sustainability. The authorities implemented an ambitious fiscal adjustment which, together with
prudent budget execution, helped to reduce the deficit. But with public debt high and rising, an
additional medium-term fiscal effort is required to put debt on a sustained downward path. The
consolidation should be carefully paced, rely on permanent measures, and be focused on unwinding
the spending increases preceding the crisis.
62.
With important structural reforms initiated, the focus needs to be on implementation.
The authorities recently legislated key reforms to the welfare system, public financial management,
and revenue administration. They should ensure that reform implementation continues and manage
the transition period prudently. Privatization efforts should be stepped up. Growth-enhancing
structural reforms could help increase the economy’s long-term potential.
63.
The next Article IV Consultation is expected to be held on a 24-month cycle in accordance
with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010)).

Sources: Eurostat; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Historical fiscal statistics until 2012 are based on Eurostat and are thus reported on an accrual basis. For 2013 and projections, and to be consistent with
the cash basis of the program, the fiscal statistics are reported on a cash basis.
2/ In 2014 and from 2017 onwards, part of the interest bill previously capitalized is projected to be paid annually.
3/ Capital expenditure in 2014, 2015, and 2016 include payments for already called guarantees and those that are expected to be called in the
corresponding years which are recorded as capital transfers under ESA.
4/ Projections for 2015-18 include unspecified additional fiscal measures as agreed under the program. In 2015, unspecified measures are all included in
social transfers. For 2016-2018, 70 percent are assumed on the spending side and the rest on the revenue side.
5/ The composition of net acquisition of financial assets was corrected in 2013 by increasing securities other than shares and reducing shares and other
equity to reflect the holdings of ESM bonds rather than the purchase of equity in the coops which occured in 2014. The operation is correspondingly
reversed in 2014 reflecting the purchase of equity in the coops with the ESM bonds.
6/ Primary fiscal balances in 2015 and 2016 include expected dividends of €0.2 billion, to be distributed by the CBC in line with CBC’s duties under the
Treaties and the Statute.

1/ Balance of Payments historical data and projections exclude data related to the operations by entities without a physical presence in Cyprus as data coverage on these entities
is still incomplete and subject to substantial revisions. This is also consistent with the treatment of these entities in the National Accounts.
2/ 2008-09 data reflect transactions between Greek banks and their subsidiaries in Cyprus.

Expected Impact of Risk
High
Significant trade linkages with the EU
would weaken growth in Cyprus
through lower exports and tourism
and adverse confidence effects.
Stagnation and low inflation could
complicate public debt sustainability
and private sector deleveraging and
negatively impact banks’ balance
sheets
High
An escalation of sanctions could
reduce growth in Cyprus given strong
real and financial links with Russia.
High oil prices would spillover into
reduced growth in Cyprus and
increased external financing needs
for energy-related imports.

High
Financial sector stability, growth
prospects, and debt sustainability
would be severely affected. Pressure
on banks in the euro area could
extend to Cypriot banks and reignite
deposit outflows.
Cyprus’s recently restored access to
the capital markets could be lost
again.
High
Deposit outflows could re-intensify.
Financial sector stability could be
affected, with strong repercussions
on economic activity and debt
sustainability.

High
Lower growth and increased
opposition to further austerity would
prolong Cyprus’s high debt problem
and would hurt balance sheets.

Policy Response

Additional fiscal adjustment
needed to attain mediumterm primary fiscal surplus
targets and ensure debt
sustainability needs to be
carefully balance to avoid a
large and negative impulse
in the short run.

Fiscal automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to
operate in the short run.
Efforts to advance structural
reforms to promote growth
should be intensified.

Efforts need to be

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more. The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex 2. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
This annex presents an analysis of Cyprus’s public debt sustainability. The overall assessment is that full
implementation of the program can maintain Cyprus’s debt on a sustainable trajectory. However, high
debt levels, downside risks to growth, and large contingent and implicit liabilities make the debt
trajectory vulnerable to shocks. In particular, a growth shock, combined with higher interest rates and a
worse primary balance, or a deeper recession combined with a materialization of contingent liabilities
could push debt to very high levels. Under such scenarios, additional financing measures and
commitments from European partners would be needed to protect debt sustainability.
Cyprus’s public debt is projected to peak at 126 percent of GDP in 2015 before gradually
declining toward 100 percent of GDP by 2020. The rise in debt in 2014–15 (from 111 percent of
GDP in 2013) reflects the prevalence of primary fiscal deficits combined with a continued recession in
2014 and only a slight recovery in 2015. In 2014, these effects are offset by the expected conclusion
of a €1 billion (6 percent of GDP) swap of debt held by the CBC for government-owned land. The
medium term decline is predicated on the assumption of continued fiscal consolidation as envisaged
under the program and a gradual pick-up of economic activity. With respect to the fourth review
projections, the baseline debt projections were revised up for 2014 and down for 2015 to reflect a
re-phasing of ESM disbursements. The path from 2016 onwards has been slightly revised up, as the
downward revision of nominal GDP more than offsets the interest savings resulting from the partial
repayment of the Laiki recapitalization bond with the proceeds from the new bond issuance.
Debt projections are highly vulnerable to shocks (Figure A1.1). The baseline debt level is high and
exceeds the benchmark above which the risk of debt distress is assessed to increase (85 percent of
GDP). Under most adverse and combined shocks—including to growth, inflation, and the primary
balance—debt could reach between 130 and 160 percent of GDP by 2020.1 Moreover, several
indicators such as spreads and external financing needs continue to point to a high-risk classification
for Cyprus. The recent debt management operation has helped smooth the debt maturity profile
immediately following the program period and lowered risks associated with shocks to the primary
balance, real interest rate, and real exchange rate. Gross financing needs risk indicators remain
vulnerable to growth and contingent liability shocks.
While forecasting performance has been mixed—given the materialization of unforeseen tail
risks—the current macroeconomic baseline remains conservative relative to macroeconomic
outturns to date (Figure A1.2). Growth, deflator, and primary balance projection errors appear
optimistic relative to other program countries, especially as 2012 and 2013 growth deviations were
significantly outside the inter-quartile range. However, these reflected the effects of the power plant
accident in 2011 and the materialization of tail risk of an unprecedented banking sector crisis in
2013—exacerbated by the Greek PSI—which could not have been foreseen in the years preceding
1

The parameters of the asymmetric distribution were calibrated to capture the predominance of downside risks in
the medium term on growth and the primary balance due to a prolonged deleveraging and fiscal adjustment fatigue.
Consistent with this, upside growth shocks were limited to 1 percentage point and upside primary balance shocks to
2 percentage points.

the events. Since the onset of the program, growth and fiscal projections have been consistently
more conservative than the outturns. For example, growth in 2013 was 3.3 percentage points better
than projected at the time of the program request (-5.4 compared to -8.7 percent), and the 2013
primary balance was 0.5 percentage points better than projected (-1.9 compared to -2.4 percent of
GDP). Medium-term projections—which were revised down during the fourth review—remain
conservative relative to other countries that suffered from banking crises and subsequent credit-less
recoveries.2 Nevertheless, as noted in the text, downside medium-term risks remain.
Standard indicators suggest that the projected fiscal adjustment is ambitious, although
Cyprus’s strong fiscal track record thus far provides some comfort (Figure A1.2 continued). The
level of cyclically-adjusted primary balance is considered borderline realistic, and the three-year
adjustment is seen as ambitious. However, such large primary balance adjustments are not without
precedent. Moreover, the authorities’ disciplined implementation of adjustment measures in 2013–
14 and additional discretionary tightening led to consistent over-performance of program targets.
Finally, these indicators should be interpreted with caution, given the unusually high uncertainty
surrounding the estimation of the output gap and cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in the current
recession.
Debt structure indicators point to vulnerabilities, but there are mitigating factors. The large
external gross financing needs reflect mainly the need to repay maturing short-term debt and the
large amount of uninsured foreign deposits. External payment restrictions mitigate the risks of
abrupt outflows. The relatively low and fixed interest rate of official liabilities combined with their
long term maturity mitigates interest rate and financing risks. Finally, while bond yields and spreads
remain higher than in other countries, they have significantly declined since last year. Specifically,
five-year bond yields are at around 5 percent in the secondary markets, compared to yields above
10 percent in 2013.
Public sector debt remains vulnerable to adverse macro-fiscal shocks (Figure A1.5, top, and
Figure A1.5 continued). The main risks analyzed include:


Growth risk. Assuming a decline in growth by two historical standard deviations (i.e. about
7 percentage points) for 2015 and 2016, a corresponding deterioration in non-interest revenue
of 0.4 percent per percentage point of growth reduction, recovering to baseline levels in two
years thereafter, and a decline of 0.25 percentage points per point of growth of the deflator, the
debt ratio would increase to 167 percent of GDP by 2016 and 152 percent by 2020.



Primary balance risk. A shock reducing the planned fiscal adjustment in 2015–18 by 50 percent,
capturing the risk of reform fatigue, would increase the debt ratio to 126 percent of GDP in 2016
and to 111 percent of GDP by 2020.



Interest rate risk. While the growing share of official financing in the coming years considerably
reduces interest rate risks, ESM financing and new market financing after the program are still a

2

CYPRUS

function of market conditions. A shock increasing the real interest rate by 3 percentage points
each year during 2015–20 would lead debt to reach 124 percent of GDP in 2016 and 110 percent
of GDP in 2020.


Combination of macro-fiscal risks. A combination of the growth, interest rate, and primary
balance shocks above would lead to a debt ratio of 167 percent of GDP in 2016 and 157 percent
of GDP in 2020.



Deflation (Figure A1.5, continued): Deflator growth could be lower than envisaged in the
baseline if downward wage pressures pass through to prices faster than anticipated. In this case,
debt would increase to 127 percent of GDP in 2016 and 113 percent of GDP in 2020.



More protracted recession (Figure A1.5, continued). A slower and prolonged deleveraging
could lead to a more protracted recession. In combination with a lower deflator (0.25 pt
per point of growth), this would lead debt to rise to 134 percent of GDP in 2016 and to
125 percent of GDP by 2020.



Risks related to the asset swap and privatization proceeds (not shown). If the debt swap
(envisaged in 2014) were not carried out, debt in 2020 would increase by about 6 percentage
points of GDP. If the envisaged privatization starting in 2015 were not implemented, this would
increase debt by about 8 percentage points of GDP in 2020.

Contingent liabilities also pose risks to debt sustainability (Figure A1.5, bottom). Additional bank
needs, to the extent that they remain within the program buffer (€2 billion, or 13 percent of GDP),
would not have an impact on debt sustainability. However, should bank needs exceed the buffer, by
say, 10 percent of GDP, and be combined with a deeper recession (by 5 percentage points), this
would increase debt to 147 percent of GDP in 2016 and to 137 percent of GDP by 2020. A full
materialization of government guarantees (i.e. all €3 billion government guarantees are called)
would bring debt to 129 percent of GDP in 2016 and to 112 percent in 2020.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. In 2014, the residual refects the Euro 1 billion asset swap and the pre-payment of a bond maturing in 2017.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex 3. External Debt Sustainability and Real Exchange Rate
Assessment
External sector debt fell substantially in 2013 (Table A3.1). Total external debt fell from
448 percent of GDP in 2012 to 348 percent of GDP in 2013 mainly due to a halving of banking sector
liabilities (mostly deposits). At end-2013, the financial sector represented close to 45 percent of
external debt, while the share of general government debt doubled from 9 to 18 percent due to
official financing from the ESM and IMF.
A gradual decline in external debt is expected over the medium term. Projected current account
surpluses over the medium term coupled with a pick-up in GDP growth is expected to result in a
decline in external debt to 287 percent of GDP in 2021. Stabilization in the banking sector and a
gradual fiscal adjustment are also expected to contribute to a substantial decline in gross financing
needs relative to the pre-crisis period. Compared with the previous medium-term projection,
external debt is expected to be lower by close to 10 percent of GDP reflecting a lower initial level of
debt in 2014.
The baseline scenario is vulnerable to shocks. The external debt trajectory is most vulnerable
under the historical scenario which assumes that key macroeconomic variables, including GDP
growth, interest rates and the current account, revert to levels over the previous five years. Since this
includes the severe shock from 2013, this scenario is unlikely. Alternative scenarios of shocks to
growth and interest rates would substantially slow the pace of debt reduction in the medium term.
Restoring external stability requires placing the financial sector on a firmer footing and
lowering public debt. Despite the sale of banks’ Greek operations in 2013—which reduced both
liabilities and assets abroad—the IIP remained large and negative, at -86 percent of GDP at end2013. Reducing it to its 2010 level (-35 percent of GDP) requires running current account surpluses
on the order of 5 percent for a prolonged period (10 years). An adjustment of this scale is not
expected to be achieved solely through the real exchange rate. However, further depreciation of the
exchange rate beyond what standard models imply (see below) will likely be needed to help improve
the IIP. More importantly, given the large share of banking and public sector liabilities in the IIP,
measures are needed to rebuild confidence in the financial sector, gradually remove external
payment restrictions and reduce reliance on foreign deposits, and achieve and sustain primary fiscal
surpluses to put public sector debt on a sustained downward path.
Although the current account has adjusted, further moderate depreciation in the real effective
exchange rate (REER) is projected over the medium term. The collapse in domestic demand
following the crisis led the trade balance to a surplus in 2013 for the first time since 2001, mainly due
to a sharp compression of imports. Due to wage adjustment, economy-wide unit labor costs have
fallen by 12 percent in the first quarter of 2014 relative to their peak in 2011. And falling prices
relative to trading partners resulted in a depreciation of the REER by about 10 percent since its peak
in 2009 (CPI-based). Still, at end-2013, it remained 3 percentage points higher than its long-run
historical average (1980–2008), suggesting that a further moderate adjustment can be expected over
the medium term. Such adjustment—namely a cumulative inflation differential of about 4

percentage points relative to trading partners during 2014–20—is incorporated into the baseline
projections.
Standard CGER-type methodologies for assessing the equilibrium exchange rate suggest that
REER would be broadly in line with fundamentals in the medium-to long-term. Taking into
account the adjustment incorporated in the baseline projections, the REER method points to an
overvaluation of up to 7.9 percent over the medium term. The macro-balance approach, on the
other hand, suggests a small undervaluation of 0.7 percent. This is underpinned by an estimated
current account norm of -3.8 percent of GDP, reflecting the large net foreign asset position and
negative oil trade balance, compared with the projected underlying value of -0.2 percent of GDP
over the medium run. Similarly, the external sustainability approach suggests a small undervaluation
of 0.5 percent, given that the current account deficit required to maintain the IIP at the 2010 level
(2.7 percent of GDP) is higher than the long-term projected deficit under the macroeconomic
baseline.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:
Cyprus’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies. Cyprus
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Cyprus maintains three exchange
restrictions under Section 2(a) arising from: (i) limits on payments for certain transactions involving
normal business activity, including the import of goods and services; (ii) limitations on certain
invisible payments by individuals, including firm limits on remittances for living expenses for certain
family members; and (iii) limits on access to certain funds deposited with financial institutions in

recently acquired net income from current international transactions or investment income.
Safeguards Assessment:
The CBC has made progress in implementing recommendations since the 2013 safeguards
assessment in the areas of governance, financial reporting transparency, and internal audit. However,
some measures to further enhance financial reporting and strengthen the legal framework still
remain outstanding. The CBC continues to publish its audited financial statements in a timely
manner.
Last article IV consultations and program relations:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on November 18, 2011 (IMF Country Report
No. 11/31). Article IV consultations with Cyprus are on the 24-month cycle during the Extended
Arrangement.
Cyprus’s three-year, SDR 891 million (563 percent of quota) Extended Arrangement under the EFF
was approved by the IMF Executive Board on May 15 2013, and the first four reviews under the

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National accounts and real sector data: In September 2014, the new European System of
National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) will replace the current ESA 1995 implying
methodological changes and historical revisions to national accounts series.
Financial sector data: The CBC has adjusted reporting guidelines to comply with European
standards. While past data has been restated, the structural break may result in errors in the time
series for the data preceding mid-2013. The migration to Basel 3, which will begin in 2014,
implies a change in the definitions of capital and risk coverage and will generate a structural
break in the time series.
External data: The CBC compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics in national
publications on a quarterly basis and annual basis. This data treats Special Purpose Vehicles
(SPVs) as non-residents. The authorities will begin the publication of balance of payments data
on the basis of BPM6 in November 2014. In the past, current account statistics have been subject
to very large revisions due to misclassification of items in the income account.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Cyprus subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Cyprus’s economic
database is comprehensive and of generally good quality. Data are provided to the Fund in a
comprehensive manner (see attached table). The authorities regularly publish a wide range of
economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the main statistical releases.
Cyprus is also subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), and has adopted the European System of Accounts
1995 (ESA95). No data ROSC is available.

would be 370 percent of GDP (rather than

Other data revisions are expected later this year, that could further affect key
macroeconomic ratios. The adoption of the ESA2010 methodology for the fiscal accounts is
expected in the last quarter of the year. On the BoP side, the authorities are expected to switch
to BPM6 in November. These methodological changes are expected to lead to further changes
to the fiscal and external accounts, which may partly offset the effect of the GDP level increase.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Cyprus

On October 20, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Cyprus.
Large imbalances accumulated prior to the global financial crisis culminated in the collapse of
Cyprus’s banking system in early 2013. In response, the authorities took unprecedented measures
upfront to resolve and recapitalize weak systemic banks at no fiscal cost and adopted a three-year
economic-adjustment program aiming to secure financial stability and fiscal sustainability.
The program is supported by international financial assistance of about €10 billion, of which
about €1 billion is provided by the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, and
€9 billion by the European Stability Mechanism. About €5.75 billion has already been disbursed
under the program by the IMF and the ESM.
Cyprus has made considerable progress in addressing the crisis. In the context of their
adjustment program, the authorities have restructured and recapitalized the financial sector while
preserving fiscal sustainability, removed domestic payment restrictions imposed at the height of
the crisis, consolidated the public finances, and initiated structural reforms. These achievements
helped Cyprus re-access international capital markets earlier this year.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
However, overcoming the legacies of the crisis is still challenging, and the outlook remains
difficult. The economy contracted sharply in 2013, and unemployment is very high. Output is
expected to decline this year by a further 3.2 percent before recovering modestly next year. The
private and public sectors are heavily indebted. The banking sector remains vulnerable given
high and rising non-performing loans and tight funding conditions, with external payment
restrictions still needed to protect financial stability. Achieving a durable economic recovery will
critically depend on maintaining the reform momentum, which requires overcoming recent
delays in program implementation.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ strong efforts to address the recent economic
and financial crisis, including measures to recapitalize and restructure the banking sector,
liberalize domestic-payment flows, consolidate the public finances, and initiate structural
reforms. Nevertheless, Directors agreed that Cyprus’ macroeconomic situation continues to be
difficult and full and timely implementation of the adjustment program supported by the IMF’s
Extended Fund Facility remains critical for a durable recovery.
Directors stressed that addressing the high level of non-performing loans to help revive credit
and support growth should be a priority. Acknowledging progress in establishing bank internal
debt-restructuring units, they highlighted the need for an effective and fair foreclosure regime,
complemented by reforms of the legal-insolvency framework that facilitate debt restructuring
and preserve the payment culture.
Directors welcomed the recapitalization of the financial sector in a manner consistent with
maintaining fiscal sustainability, including the recent market recapitalization of the largest bank.
Looking ahead, they called for capital buffers in line with the outcome of the European Central
Bank’s comprehensive assessment and for further efforts to restructure banks and the cooperative
sector. Directors also supported plans to strengthen bank supervision and regulation in the
transition to the pan-European Single Supervisory Mechanism and steps to enhance the
implementation of the anti money-laundering framework.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors called for prudent management of external-payment restrictions to safeguard financial
stability and agreed that their relaxation should be gradual and transparent. In this context, they
underscored the importance of normalizing bank funding and liquidity and noted that
Eurosystem support remains essential.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious fiscal consolidation so far. However, with public
debt still high, they noted that additional efforts will be required to achieve medium-term fiscal
targets. Directors emphasized the need for a judiciously paced adjustment based on permanent
measures aimed at reversing the pre-crisis increase in spending.
Directors commended the authorities for putting in place comprehensive structural reforms. They
underscored that continued implementation of reforms of revenue administration, public
financial management, and the welfare system are key to safeguarding the sustainability of the
fiscal position while protecting vulnerable groups. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
privatize state-owned enterprises and develop a strategy to boost competitiveness and potential
growth.

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel, Executive Director for Cyprus, and Mr. Ektoras
Kanaris, Advisor to the Executive Director
October 20, 2014
We thank staff for a well laid out Article IV report and the detailed supplementary papers.
The Article IV report appropriately captures the grim story of the island’s recent economic
history. Looking back, it will hopefully serve as yet another useful reminder of how a twist of
unforeseen events, mixed with lingering vulnerabilities, policy indecisiveness but also
broader politics, can fester into a treacherous combination that can bring a country to its
knees in an instant.
In the years leading to the start of the global financial crisis in 2008, Cyprus had been posting
strong growth rates of around 4 percent, the unemployment rate was hovering close to
4 percent, inflation was at low levels, the public finances were in surplus and the debt-toGDP ratio was below 50 percent. However, with a booming economy came complacency,
and serious fragilities were quietly being amplified in the background while policy responses
were either timid or absent. Rapidly rising property prices contributed to an overdependence
of public finances on the property sector, leading to a wealth effect that gradually started to
hamper competitiveness. When the property bubble burst, the first cracks in the banking
system started to emerge while persistent reluctance to correct long standing imbalances and
continued lax fiscal and macro prudential policies had started taking their toll on the
country’s ability to refinance its debt at rates compatible with long term fiscal sustainability.
These imbalances became increasingly more evident in 2011 when the large exposure of the
country’s banks to a then fragile Greece led to a series of rating agency downgrades. By mid2011, Cyprus had lost access to long-term sovereign debt markets.
Even by then, these imbalances were arguably still manageable, if prompt action had been
taken: the economy was still growing q-o-q and the banks were still solvent and capitalized.
However, the unforeseen events that followed accelerated and exacerbated the island’s
problems. In July 2011, a catastrophic explosion of a huge cache of confiscated munitions
stored at a naval base destroyed Cyprus’s nearby power plant which supplied power to half
of the island, and led to a then estimated burden of over €2 billion on the government’s ailing
budget. The fallout included systematic electricity blackouts, with adverse effects on output
and government revenues while deepening the sense of economic uncertainty. By that point
in time, the economy was thrown into recession. Three months later, in October, 2011, the
decisions taken on the Greek PSI wiped out overnight more than €4.5 billion in bank assets
(over 25% of GDP) with an ensuing substantial loss in bank capital. Within just a few
months, these two events sunk the economy deep into unchartered territory. Failing to
request immediate assistance at that point, Cyprus’s fate became gloomier by the day. In the
meantime, the banking sector, now undercapitalized, was increasingly cut off from
international market funding.

2
It was not until June 2012 that Cyprus requested official support in the form of a combined
European and IMF package. However, upcoming elections caused delays in concluding an
assistance package, and negotiations were caught up in a broader unfavorable political
nebula. By early 2013, statements and rumors in the press regarding deposit haircuts and the
consequent fall in confidence led to accelerated and substantial deposit outflows. Against the
background of these severe economic and financial disturbances, on March 16 and 25, 2013,
an agreement was forged with the newly elected government on an EU-IMF supported
program.
In an unprecedented manner, beyond the core elements of an officially supported program,
depositors of the island’s two largest banks were bailed-in. Uninsured depositors of Laiki
bank and Bank of Cyprus were bailed in using 100 percent and 47.5 percent of their deposits
over €100 000 respectively. With the conclusion of the exercise, a total of €9.4 billion was
affected, including €1.5 billion of debt. Amidst financial turmoil and public outcry, a two
week bank holiday was imposed, followed by the introduction of capital controls and
restrictions on cash withdrawals in a bid to prevent a bank run. Cyprus was in a state of
paralysis and some market commentators, in their own right, believed the island’s euro exit
was inevitable and imminent.
Developments since the onset of the program and review status
A year and a half later, following a vast array of bold fiscal, structural and financial sector
policies, the economy is mending at a rapid pace and well beyond what was expected at the
program inception. Landmark reforms included a fiscal consolidation of over 10 percent of
GDP between 2013 and 2014, reform of the General Social Insurance and the Government
Pension Scheme, reform of the wage indexation system, adoption of the Fiscal Responsibility
and Budget Systems Law, the introduction of the Medium Term Budget Framework, the
modernization and refinement of the social welfare system, the unification and empowerment
of tax departments and the introduction of the privatization framework. In the financial
sector, following the bail-in of uninsured depositors and the imposition of restrictive
measures, key policies included the merger of 93 coops into 18 entities, the unified
supervision of banks and coops under the Central Bank, the recapitalisation of the
cooperative sector, the strengthening of the AML/CFT framework and policies targeting the
areas of governance, loan origination and arrears management. Progress is being made, inter
alia, with a wide range of the goods and services market such as regulated professions, public
administration review, public financial management, housing market, health, tourism and
energy. With over 200 completed actions in four reviews, Cyprus has begun to reap the
benefits of steadfast program implementation.
The positive side-effects of this effort were broad based. By now, the financial system finds
itself closer to a stable state, underscored by the normalization of deposit flows, even as all
domestic restrictions have been absent since May 2014. At the same time, rating agencies

3
have been reversing a long trend of successive downgrades and sovereign bond yields have
been on a steady downward trend. In June 2014, Cyprus tapped the international bond
markets after three years of absence– and a year ahead of schedule- through a heavily
oversubscribed five year paper issuance. The banking system has also received the attention
of foreign funds. In November 2013, Hellenic Bank was recapitalized by new private
investors who have also indicated their intention to cover any potential capital needs
following the conclusion of the ECB’s comprehensive assessment. More recently, in
September 2014, Bank of Cyprus has successfully undergone a 1 billion share capital
increase through foreign participation. The latter boosted its CET1 capital ratio to 15 percent.
The bank has also been able to reduce its ELA dependence by another €800 million.
While Cyprus has adhered to and consistently overperformed the program’s quantitative
conditionality, the completion of the 5th review, originally scheduled to take place in
September 2014, has been delayed due to one incomplete prior action. The government,
which lost the House majority in February 2014, has been working hard to fulfill the prior
action on the foreclosure law and build on its excellent track record. However, the smooth
transition into the new foreclosure framework proved somewhat too ambitious. While the
actual foreclosure law was passed – and is actually currently active - the House majority
voted some side-legislation rendering the effectiveness of the foreclosure law’s objectives
weaker. Since then, most of the associated bills have been referred to the Supreme Court to
review their constitutionality with a final decision to be expected in early November.
Importantly, however, the government’s efforts throughout this process underscore once
again its commitment to abide to program conditionality. In the same context, the authorities’
prudent fiscal management has given Cyprus the benefit of time since the accumulated fiscal
buffers have eliminated any imminent financing threats. Nonetheless, the authorities are in
complete agreement with staff views regarding the necessity of a well-functioning
foreclosure framework complemented by a modernized insolvency regime as the best way to
promote debt restructurings and address the high NPLs. Their efforts, irrespective of the
ensuing delays, should be acknowledged.
Macroeconomic developments
The real economy also delivered positive surprises. To put this into perspective, at program
inception, growth estimates for 2013 ranged from -8.7 percent (program estimates) up to -20
percent (market analysts), with the year ending with drop in output of -5.4 percent. For 2014,
program estimates stood at -4.8 percent (3rd review) with the latest revised forecast
envisaging a 3.2 percent drop in output. The authorities do not expect the economy to
contract more than 3.0 percent. Indications to date point indeed towards such an outcome as
the annualized growth for the first half of the year was -2.5 percent. Moreover, the second
quarter’s -0.3 percent q-o-q growth rate was the lowest quarterly contraction since the
aforementioned naval base blast in July 2011. Regarding the outlook, the staff report

4
accurately captures the authorities’ views which point to somewhat more positive medium
term outcomes.
There are several reasons contributing to these better-than-expected outcomes, not least the
price and wage flexibility exhibited by the economy. Wages in both the public and private
sectors have been subject to a large downward adjustment. While the cost of adjustment is
painful, it is contributing towards improved competitiveness. Cyprus saw a decline in its
labour costs of 6.5 percent in Q4 2013. The adjustment continued well into 2014 with
Eurostat’s latest publication indicating another 3.9 decrease by Q2 2014 compared with the
same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, the public sector workforce was
significantly reduced over the last years and by Q2 2014, the number of broad public sector
employees stood at levels last seen in 2007, representing a decrease of around 10 percent
from their peak in 2011. Inevitably, unemployment was a victim of the adjustment effort,
peaking at 16 percent in 2013. However, with the recession moderating, the growth in
unemployment is now reversing, falling to 15.4 percent in August, and constituting the fourth
consecutive monthly drop. In terms of price developments, inflation averaged -0.3 percent in
the first eight months of 2014. While having a positive impact on competitiveness, these
levels warrant caution as they also impede the authorities’ efforts to resume growth and
reduce the debt overhang.
Public Finances
Cyprus continues to achieve -and surpass- all its fiscal targets, as it has done since the
beginning of the program. This has been despite the deep recession, evidencing the
authorities’ intent and determination to meet their fiscal balance objectives for the coming
years. It is also useful to recall that the 2014 budget, on the authorities’ own initiative,
included additional fiscal consolidation that went beyond program requirements. As a result
of prudent management, public finances are running almost two years ahead of the original
program profile. As staff correctly identifies, preliminary August figures point to continued
overperformance. To specify, there is a primary surplus of +2.9 percent of GDP for the first
eight months of 2014. In fact, where the target for 2014 is for a primary deficit of -1.6
percent of GDP (4th review), the authorities expect to end the year with a primary surplus.
The authorities clearly share staff’s view about the need for a credible but balanced fiscal
adjustment over time, as evidenced by their track record. They also concur with the need to
ensure the fiscal neutrality of the new welfare reform. The Guaranteed Minimum Income,
which is now operational, has been designed in a way that improves targeting and reduces
benefit abuse. These goals appear to have been met as the new refined selection process
appears to have contained benefit abuse bringing in associated savings relative to what was
expected. Regarding the calls for additional adjustment measures over the medium term, the
authorities’ share the objectives behind staff’s proposals presented in the Selected Issues.
Indeed, they wish to reaffirm their intention to do what is necessary to achieve the 4 percent

5
primary surplus by 2018. It should be pointed out that the authorities project a more modest
fiscal effort than that envisaged by staff. Further measures will of course need to be balanced
against the still recessionary and fragile environment, future macroeconomic outcomes, the
broader external environment and the added value/loss of pushing the economy more than
may really be necessary. In each review so far, the authorities’ internal projections presented
in mission discussions have consistently outperformed those of staff.
The authorities take note of the accompanying Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis.
While staff expects Cyprus public debt to GDP to peak in 2015 at 126.2 per cent, the
authorities wish to reveal the possibility that debt to GDP may peak this year and at much
lower levels. While staff’s DSA assumes full disbursement of the buffer at over €2 billion
(13 percent of GDP), the authorities consider that this prospect does not constitute a realistic
baseline scenario by now. The authorities would also expect the baseline scenario to be
updated with any new information following the completion of the ECB’s comprehensive
assessment on October 26. Moreover, the output level revision scheduled later this year to
conform to ESA2010 standards is expected to further decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio by a
sizeable amount.
As a general remark, while conservative assumptions have their benefit, they could also
mislead broader market participants with a direct (miscalculated) impact on future policy.
Financial sector
The authorities are acutely aware of the remaining challenges outlined by staff. The report
correctly highlights the criticality of addressing the high level of NPLs which may pose a
threat to the banking system’s long-term viability. The authorities share staff views that
NPLs exceed what could be explained by unemployment. As such, the rise in NPLs can be
largely explained by a large number of strategic defaulters. The latter is being fuelled by the
uncertainty created regarding the treatment of NPLs, and the lack of tools to lay the
foundations and incentives for healthy debt restructurings. In response, as outlined earlier,
significant efforts have been put into building the necessary framework to effectively address
arrears and accelerate sustainable restructuring. This was an exercise that involved reform at
many levels including banks, supervision, legislation and civil institutions. So far, banks have
established specialized units to deal with troubled borrowers and have been gradually
building capacity with the help of external consultants. The process was complemented by
the Central Bank’s Arrears Management Framework (AMF), the Code of Conduct (CoC) for
borrowers and creditors, and the loan origination directive. The authorities agree that where
implementation reveals weaknesses, these tools should be refined accordingly. As such, the
Central Bank intends to further improve the AMF and CoC accordingly upon the conclusion
of the SSM transition and the comprehensive assessment, both of which have been straining
the Central Bank’s operational capacity. Finally, the authorities agree than in the absence of

6
an efficient foreclosure and insolvency framework, the exercise remains incomplete. They
will continue to push this forward with the same determination shown thus far.
Conclusion
The Cyprus case has raised important policy issues, not least in the areas of modern bank
resolution, program design and timing, the size of financial systems/institutions, corporate
governance as well as the inability of regulators or other international economic surveyors –
including the Fund – to ring louder bells in the years leading to this. Even as some of these
issues feature prominently in international fora, including last week’s Annual Meetings,
some of the answers remain elusive. The island’s story also serves as another stark example
of how inaction can lead to severe economic dislocations. In a still fragile environment such
as the current one, it is a timely reminder that timid policies will only postpone underlying
problems which will come to haunt the country later on. As the story unfolds itself, it may
also prove that firm upfront action can lead to a faster adjustment than otherwise.
Faced with an unprecedented economic shock in the island’s modern history, the authorities
have come a long way in addressing the crisis. As staff concludes, a number of challenges
remain. Nevertheless, following eighteen months of strong implementation Cyprus finds
itself in a good place to continue along the agreed path. The authorities are cognizant that the
achievements to date will be jeopardized if there is a hint of complacency and are therefore
determined to push through their commitments even as headwinds have emerged. With
continued guidance from staff and careful policy design for the remainder of the program, the
authorities are confident that Cyprus will soon return to growth and broad-based economic
prosperity.
