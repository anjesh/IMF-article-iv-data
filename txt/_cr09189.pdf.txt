THE BAHAMAS
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with The Bahamas
Approved by Patricia Alonso-Gamo and Aasim Husain
May 21, 2009
Economic and political setting. The Bahamas’ economy, closely linked to that of the
U.S., is being affected by the global economic and financial crisis. Growth contracted by
1.7 percent in 2008, and staff projects a further contraction of 3.9 percent in 2009,
reflecting declines in tourism, foreign direct investment and offshore financial services
activity. The country has relatively low debt (40 percent of GDP), providing some fiscal
space for countercyclical policy, but the fixed exchange rate regime could pose a
constraint on the level of borrowing.
Focus of consultation. The discussions focused on macroeconomic and financial policies
to respond to the crisis, and measures to reduce vulnerability over the longer term. The
authorities’ fiscal plans strike a reasonable balance between accommodating the shock―
maintaining essential expenditures in FY 2008/09 and FY 2009/10―and fiscal
adjustment, particularly in light of the uncertain duration of the global slowdown. The
authorities’ plans to strengthen non-banking financial services supervision are also
welcome.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred that economic growth would be adversely
impacted, but in their view real GDP growth may decline less than projected by the staff,
emphasizing the resilience of foreign direct investment and measures to generate tourism
receipts from non-traditional sources. They concurred that contingency policy measures
to deal with fiscal revenue shortfalls for the next 1–2 years would be important. The
authorities are committed to protecting the soundness of the financial sector and
strengthening supervision and monitoring.
Exchange system. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of the Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate of the
Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at parity.
Mission. The team visited Nassau during March 24–April 3 and comprised Laure Redifer
(head), Christopher Faircloth, Masahiro Nozaki (all WHD) and Werner Keller (AFR).
Patricia Alonso-Gamo and Trevor Alleyne (both WHD) and Mr. Ladd (OED)
participated in policy meetings.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Bahamas is a small open economy, based mainly on tourism, foreign direct
investment, and offshore financial activities. The one-to-one peg between the Bahamian
and U.S. dollars has been in place for 36 years, and has provided a stable investment climate.
The country has the third largest income per capita in the western hemisphere region, with a
good track record of political stability, and a relatively high credit rating within the region.

and government debt.
2.
Macroeconomic policy has historically been geared to maintaining fiscal
sustainability, attracting investment, and supporting the exchange rate peg. In the
decade preceding the crisis, the central government had an overall fiscal deficit averaging
around 2 percent, with a primary balance of zero. This helped maintain government debt low
(33 percent of GDP at end-2006). 1 The authorities took corrective fiscal measures when
necessary, as when tourism declined in 2001–03, leading to a sharp drop in revenues. In that
case, after an initial fiscal impulse, spending cuts and administrative tax measures were
introduced to contain the increase in the budget deficit. The tax regime in the Bahamas is
largely based on import and real estate taxes, with numerous concessions for investment in
the tourism industry. 2 The revenue base is narrow compared to other Caribbean islands,
leaving revenue vulnerable to external cycles. The authorities have occasionally taken direct

Central government debt. Consolidated public sector debt, which excludes public corporations’ holdings of
central government debt, was estimated at 32 percent of GDP for end-2006.

Fund research suggests that such incentives regimes are potentially costly in terms of lost tax revenue,
estimated to be in the range of 11 percent of GDP for the Caribbean region. See IMF publication The
Caribbean: Enhancing Economic Integration (2008).

4
measures to defend the level of reserves and the exchange rate peg: in 2001–03, they
imposed temporary bank credit ceilings to dampen private consumption and imports.
3.
Favorable external conditions prior to the onset of the global downturn led to
strong growth in real GDP, credit, and investment. Real GDP growth averaged 5 percent
in 2005–06, reflecting a recovery in tourism and related FDI inflows after the 2001–03
shock. Private sector credit grew by an average of 14.3 percent, reflecting strong economic
activity and pent-up demand unleashed by the removal of credit controls in August 2004.
Real estate activity was particularly notable, with outstanding mortgage loans rising from 27
percent of GDP in 2003 to 37 percent in 2008. The external current account worsened due to
an increase in consumer good imports and higher oil bills, and international reserves declined
from 668 million to 454 million during 2004–07.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
4.
Since mid-2008, the global downturn, particularly in the United States, has
significantly affected economic activity in The Bahamas, but direct financial contagion
has been limited (Figure 1). Tourism began declining in September, also affected by the
threat of Hurricane Ike, causing overall receipts

5.
Real GDP is projected to contract further in 2009–10, reflecting the impact of
the U.S. and global downturn. Growth developments in The Bahamas are strongly
correlated with those in the United States, with U.S. shocks historically having an amplified
and protracted impact (Box 1). Based on the sharp contraction and weak recovery projected
for the United States, real GDP is projected to contract by 3.9 percent in 2009 and 0.5
percent in 2010. This assumes a drop in tourism receipts of 9 percent and 1.5 percent in 2009
and 2010, respectively. FDI is projected to drop by 30 percent in 2009, in line with the
overall contraction in global credit. This decline is expected to have ripple effects for
construction, real estate, and domestic financial services. Some large tourism-related projects
have been cancelled or delayed, but activity in the market for second homes for nonBahamians appears steady. The downturn has had a large impact on domestic revenue and
this is expected to

Box 1. Spillovers of a U.S. Credit Contraction on The Bahamas
A contraction in credit to the private sector in the United States can be expected to
put pressure on The Bahamas’ external sector, particularly capital inflows and
exports. This result is confirmed by a U.S. business cycle model used to examine the
potential impact of the global financial crisis on The Bahamas. An econometric model
linking the U.S. economy and the Bahamian external sector examines the impact of a
hypothetical U.S. credit crunch—defined as a one year, two standard deviation contraction
in real credit to the private sector—on Bahamian external sector variables. The impact is
evaluated by comparing projections for Bahamian external sector variables under the
“shock” scenario against a “no shock” baseline over a five-year period. The results are
summarized as follows:
•

Capital inflows weaken, especially FDI. Private capital inflows are projected to be
weaker by US$275 million—two thirds is a decline in FDI.

•

Exports of goods and services decline sharply. Lower exports of goods and
services—about 70 percent tourism—are consistent with the expected contraction
in tourism activity prompted by a weakening in U.S. growth and U.S. real incomes.

The findings imply that the current account largely accommodates a drop in capital
inflows, but growth might be more profoundly affected. The impact on international
reserves would likely be largely contained based on the above results. However, growth
might be more severely affected. Indeed, tourism and FDI—two key growth drivers—
would weaken significantly and the results show a high degree of persistence suggesting
that the impact on growth could be prolonged and associated with a slow recovery. That
said, the above results should be interpreted cautiously given that: (i) findings are based on
historical relationships that may be limited in gauging the transmission of a historically
unprecedented shock; and (ii) the simulated shock does not necessarily reflect current
global conditions.

7
continue. Abated activity and lower commodity prices would lead to a decline in the inflation
rate to 1.0 by end-2009 and 0.2 percent by end-2010.
6.
The projected decline in tourism receipts is significantly tempered by the impact
of offsetting factors outlined by the authorities. The government and the tourism industry
have been working together to implement measures to counteract the potential decline in
receipts. These include: launching a new promotional campaign; diversifying the tourism
base by easing visa requirements for Latin Americans; working with airlines to provide
increased airlift capacity at reduced prices; and providing more diversified products. There
has been a five-year wage settlement for hotel employees that largely freezes nominal wages
to help contain rising costs. There are, however, substantial downside risks to the forecast for
tourism receipts. 3
7.
The FY 2008/09 fiscal deficit is expected to increase to about 5 percent of GDP,
owing to revenue shortfalls (Figure 2). Revenues and grants for FY 2008/09 are expected to
be 3.5 percent of GDP lower than budgeted due to lower imports and weak activity. 4 The
authorities shifted the composition of spending to maintain capital spending and provide
transitory means-tested unemployment benefits, while keeping total expenditure close to
budgeted levels. 5 The fiscal deficit was financed by new external and domestic borrowing,
including a US$200 million short-term (one year) foreign currency credit from domestic
banks. Central government debt as a percent of GDP is expected to rise to over 40 percent by
the end of FY 2008/09, implying that the authorities’ earlier stated objective of reducing debt
to GDP to 30 percent by 2012 will need to be postponed.
8.
The external current account improved in 2008, but private sector financing
flows weakened significantly (Figure 3). Lower construction-related imports and higher
retained earnings reduced the external current account deficit from 17.5 percent to
13.2 percent of GDP, but private sector financing flows dropped by 6.6 percent of GDP.
The government issued U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of $100 million to finance its capital
program in FY 2007/08, which helped bolster international reserves to US$563 million at
end-2008, about 87 percent of base money.

3

Tourism arrivals data for the first two months of 2009 indicate a drop in tourism receipts of some 16–
18 percent against January–February 2008.

4

Estimates determined in the March mid-year budget review; introduction of mid-year budget reviews was
encouraged in past Article IV consultations.

5

The new benefits are administered by the National Insurance Board. The hotel industry also provides transitory
social benefits for redundant workers.

The Bahamian dollar appears broadly in line with fundamentals (Figure 4). The
sizable current account (CA) deficit in recent years partly reflects high oil prices and capital
goods imports related to large FDI inflows. Over the medium term, assuming tourism
receipts recover to their 2006–08 average, the CA deficit would stay at about 10 percent of
GDP (5 percent excluding FDI-related
imports), in line with the estimated CA norm 35

Hurricane Ike).
10.
Financial soundness indicators of domestic banks have deteriorated, but the
banks remain well capitalized (Box 2 and Figure 5). The share of nonperforming loans has
been increasing, given the downturn and rising loan-to-value ratios during the credit boom.
Banks have been proactively restructuring troubled consumer and mortgage loans, while
increasing retained earnings, and the central bank has enhanced monitoring. Nevertheless,
the capital position of domestic banks remains relatively strong, and the central bank’s
preliminary stress tests suggest that NPLs would have to spike sharply before banks would
encounter capital adequacy problems. Private sector credit growth decelerated from 9.7 in
2007 to 5.1 percent in 2008, reflecting weaker demand and tighter lending standards by
banks.
11.
Supervision of the banking sector is more stringent than that of the nonbanking
financial sector. Both domestic and offshore banks are supervised by the central bank, while
insurance, credit unions and pension funds are supervised by other entities and are less
tightly regulated, with different provisioning rules. A law was passed by Parliament in 2005
to bring insurance supervision in line with international norms, but has not yet been
implemented.

The CA norm and equilibrium REER are computed from the panel regressions in “Assessing Exchange Rate
Competitiveness in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union” (IMF Working Paper) by Pineda, Cashin, and Sun,

Box 2. The Domestic Financial System of The Bahamas
The Bahamian domestic financial system is dominated by banks, with private sector credit
and domestic deposits amounting to 86 percent and 75 percent of GDP, respectively. Deposit
insurance covers 95 percent of deposits. Although dominated by U.S. and Canadian
subsidiaries and branches, its activities are financed by domestic deposits and bank capital
rather than external borrowing. The National Insurance Board (NIB) administers the national
pension and social safety net schemes. In 2007, the NIB, private pension funds, and
insurance companies had assets amounting to about 19.3 percent, 14.8 percent, and 11.9
percent of GDP, respectively. Credit unions have assets of only 3 percent of GDP, but their
membership covers about 10 percent of the population.
The deterioration of the Bahamian economy has put negative pressure on the quality of the
banks’ credit portfolio. Arrears over 30 days or more reached 12.5 percent of total loans in
end-2008, up by 5 percentage points since end-2006, and NPLs were 6 percent to total loans
by end-2008. However, banks have large capital buffers, and indicators of asset liquidity
have also improved.

The failure of CLICO Bahamas, an insurance company with total liabilities of about 1
percent of GDP, highlights the need to strengthen insurance sector supervision. In February
2009, the insurance regulator initiated a process to liquidate the company after it became
insolvent mainly due to investment in Florida real estate, guided by the strategy of its parent
regional conglomerate. Although the regulator had raised concerns in the past, the issue of
risk concentration had not been corrected. The Central Bank of The Bahamas has stated
publicly that the failure of CLICO Bahamas does not pose a threat to the domestic financial
system.

Negative spillovers from the offshore financial sector to the domestic financial
sector appear limited so far. The offshore financial sector, comprising about 250 banks and
trust companies with estimated total assets of over $300 billion in 2007, dwarfs the domestic
financial sector. However, the sector accounts for only 1–2 percent of total employment and
the linkages to the domestic economy are limited to employment and consumption. Offshore
banks report that assets under management and profits are dropping substantially in line with
global conditions, but that local employment has not yet been affected, though compensation
has. Exchange controls and restrictions on net open foreign exchange positions of domestic
commercial banks limit their asset and liability exposure to global markets, limiting the
impact on the domestic economy. The authorities indicated that, because of the limited links,
the impact of a cyclical weakening on the OFC sector on the domestic economy would be
moderate.
13.
Following the London G20 summit, the authorities reaffirmed their 2002
commitment to adopt OECD standards on tax transparency and information exchange.
The authorities concluded a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the United States in
2002 and have announced that negotiations with Canada are underway. Moreover, the
authorities reiterated their commitment to adhere to international standards to regulate the
offshore financial industry. The AML/CFT related regulatory framework has been
strengthened significantly since 2000, and AML/CFT guidelines are being revised, following
an evaluation by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions focused on macroeconomic policy measures to respond to the impact
of the global slowdown and measures to reduce longer term vulnerability. Regarding the
short-term impact, there were two main themes of discussion: (i) the extent of fiscal
adjustment vs. financing to compensate for the drop in fiscal revenue; and (ii) containing the
impact on the domestic financial sector. The discussions also focused on how to reduce
vulnerabilities over the medium term.
A. Macroeconomic Policy Responses to the Shock
15.
The decline in U.S. growth will lead to a significant contraction in economic
activity in 2009. The authorities and staff concurred that economic growth would be
adversely impacted, but, in the authorities’ view, real GDP growth may decline less than
projected by the staff, and they emphasized the resilience of foreign direct investment and
intended measures to generate tourism receipts from non-traditional sources.
16.
The authorities agreed with the importance of contingency planning should the
downturn prove worse than expected. The authorities have a solid track record of prudent
fiscal policy management, and clearly stated their determination to respond to the downturn
so as to preserve fiscal and debt sustainability.

15
Fiscal policy
17.
The authorities envisage both revenue and expenditure measures to contain the
fiscal deficit in FY 2009/10. On the basis of unchanged policies, there was broad agreement
that gross financing needs would have reached about 7 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10. 7 In
order to contain the deficit, the authorities are taking measures to improve tax compliance
and revenue administration including by: introducing electronic declarations and other
customs reforms to limit leakage for non-reporting and underreporting; reducing arrears in
real estate taxes and other fees; and updating procedures for conducting property value
assessments.
18.
The authorities aim at streamlining expenditure while protecting priority areas.
Unemployment insurance introduced in FY 2008/09 was temporary, but consideration is
being given to extending the benefits, and the authorities want to protect public investment to
the extent possible. They identified some measures to contain spending: strictly limiting
overtime pay for public sector employees—a key factor in the 25 percent real increase in
public sector wages since FY 2000/01; maintaining strict caps on transfers to public sector
entities, in light of persistent losses of a few large public corporations; auditing transfers to
regional entities; and public tendering for procurement contracts. The measures discussed
during the mission would help contain the overall deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP. Moreover,
the authorities stated that additional consolidation measures might be adopted in the
FY 2009/10 to bring down the deficit further. The staff agreed that such a stance struck a
reasonable balance between avoiding an excessive contraction of domestic demand and
preserving medium-term sustainability.
19.
The authorities intend to finance the FY 2009/10 fiscal deficit with privatization
proceeds and new borrowing. They will implement ongoing plans to privatize 51 percent of
The Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC). Despite the adverse global
environment, there continue to be interested buyers due to the company’s profitability. 8 They
plan to refinance the US$200 million credit line with domestic banks through an external
sovereign bond offering in 2010. The remainder of the deficit would be financed by domestic
borrowing, which should be easily placed given limited domestic investment vehicles. 9 The
staff agreed that, in the near term, weak private sector credit demand implied that the risk of
crowding out private sector recovery should be low. Additional borrowing would increase
central government debt to 47 percent of GDP by the end of FY 2009/10, of which external
debt would account for a still low 10 percent of GDP.

7

On the basis of revenues determined by GDP and import projections, capital spending constant in real terms,
wage growth in line with historical averages, and other current spending constant as a share of GDP.

8

Privatization is expected to generate exceptional receipts from the sale of mobile phone licenses in FY10/11.

9

The NIB could purchase the debt, and faces no legal restrictions to do so.

16
External and monetary policies
20.
Planned official borrowing and privatization receipts would contribute to offset
other pressures on the balance of payments in 2009–10, allowing some build-up of
foreign exchange reserves. The current account is expected to improve significantly, as a
result of a large drop in fuel prices and lower imports of consumption and capital goods.
While private sector capital inflows are anticipated to continue to drop by a relatively larger
amount, government external borrowing, domestic borrowing in foreign currency, and
privatization receipts would mitigate pressures on foreign exchange reserves.
21.
The central bank intends to introduce quarterly balance of payments forecasts
and consult regularly with the central government to identify any nascent BOP
pressures. The current slack demand for private sector credit and the plans for public sector
financing in foreign currency make the need for any private sector credit controls, along the
lines of those after the 2001 shock, unlikely in the near term. The current shock has been
unfolding more slowly than in the previous shock, and private consumption demand has
already been declining.
B. Financial Sector Policies
22.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts and plans to strengthen further
bank monitoring and supervision. 10 The authorities plan to enhance stress testing, tailored
to specific risks to The Bahamas, and have requested Fund technical assistance. CARTAC
has just concluded an assessment of the Banking Supervision Department, and is planning to
send an expert on stress testing to The Bahamas in the near future. They introduced quarterly
reporting requirements on credit risk in December 2008, and are strengthening regional
cooperation under the Caribbean Group of Banking Supervisors. The authorities have also
requested technical assistance to establish automated procedures for data transmittal from
banks; revisions to anti-money laundering guidance documents; and revisions to credit
assessment procedures.
23.
The authorities and staff agreed that steps should be taken to strengthen
supervision for the nonbank financial sector, and to ensure that provisioning is
adequate. For credit unions, the government has requested that the central bank assume
supervisory responsibility, currently handled by the Agriculture Ministry, and plans are being
discussed. The authorities have made it an immediate priority to put into effect the law
passed by Parliament in 2005 to bring insurance supervision and provisioning in line with
international norms. They plan to request Fund TA for help in implementing the new law and
its regulations.

10

Institutions for banking supervision were strengthened substantially in recent years: an IMF assessment of
banking regulation and supervision, including of the offshore sector, found compliance with 21 out of 25 Basel
Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.

17
C. Contingency Planning and Risks
24.
While supporting the authorities’ macroeconomic policy stance, the staff
underscored the importance of further contingency planning. Risks to the growth
forecast remain on the downside. For instance, tourism could remain subdued, demand for
imports could be higher than anticipated, and private capital inflows could drop more sharply
than forecast. Moreover, short-term fiscal consolidation plans hinge heavily on
administrative revenue measures and privatization receipts, which may fall short or take
longer to materialize. In that case, additional financing and/or expenditure adjustment might
be required. Finally, the financial sector could be more vulnerable than expected, in light of
rising NPLs and weak supervision of the nonbank financial sector.
D. Reducing Vulnerability over the Medium Term
25.
Preliminary fiscal debt sustainability analysis suggests that, given limits to
expenditure containment, further revenue measures would be needed to put the central
government debt-to-GDP ratio back on a
50
declining trajectory. Within the Caribbean,
Caribbean: Revenues
The Bahamas is a relatively low-tax

jurisdiction (17 percent of GDP compared with 40
a regional average of 30 percent), revenue
being largely reliant on international trade

taxes. Even with the planned administrative
revenue measures in FY 2009/10, revenue is

medium term. Without further measures, debt

Box 3. Revenue Reform Priorities
There is scope to increase revenue in The Bahamas. A Fund TA mission in 2002 concluded that
the tax system is excessively reliant on trade taxes on goods, which increases vulnerability, given the
unpredictability of tourism and elasticity of imports. The mission recommended detailed measures to
strengthen administration of existing property and trade taxes, review FDI incentives, and shift the
tax base to domestic consumption—endorsing the adoption of a broad-based VAT—in order to
broaden it, reduce cyclicality and distortions, and provide a more predictable revenue source.
The authorities have acted on some of the recommendations, but there is scope for further
action. The authorities have: (i) introduced a taxpayer identification number; (ii) encouraged arrears
payments through an amnesty on penalties; (iii) increased the floor on exempt property values; and,
(iii) enforced payment of property tax arrears following home sales. Property tax arrears, however,
remain large (an estimated 4 percent of GDP) and the property tax re-assessment mechanism is
cumbersome. The authorities are exploring options to improve assessments, and have outlined a
multi-year plan to modernize customs administration, beginning with the introduction of an
electronic declarations system this fiscal year.
Additional revenue reforms will likely be needed to stem a rising debt trajectory, given
constraints to expenditure consolidation. Including the revenue measures proposed for
FY 2009/10, the debt ratio would continue to rise through FY 2014/15, in the absence of further
measures to increase tax revenue. Staff estimates that increasing revenue by an average of
1¾ percent of GDP between FY 2011/12 and FY 2013/14 would help stabilize the debt ratio at
50 percent in FY 2011/2 and help it revert to its present level (around 40 percent of GDP) by
FY 2014/15. Sustainable revenue-enhancing measures, including a VAT, would be needed to reduce
debt to 30 percent of GDP over the medium term.

the authorities subjected public entities to hard budget constraints in the FY 2008/09 budget,
which were generally adhered to. A restructuring plan for the Bahamas Air is underway, and
consideration may be given to subcontracting domestic routes to smaller local charter
companies. Along with the planned privatization of 51 percent of BTC in 2010, there is longstanding consideration to privatize the Bahamas Electric Company (BEC), which has
historically operated free of government transfers. Government-imposed rate reductions and
customer relief programs have contributed to growing operational losses since 2006. 11
Discussions of a rate increase to cost recovery levels are on the government’s agenda for the
coming year.
27.
The authorities intend to transition to market-oriented monetary instruments.
Despite the fixed exchange rate regime, controls provide some room for monetary policy.
Current monetary control relies on moral suasion and credit restrictions, which hampers
efficient credit allocation. The central bank is developing a strategic plan to modernize
11

Operational losses were $3 million and $11 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and in late 2008, the
government capped surcharges at a cost of $3.7 million and introduced a relief program for customer payment
arrears.

19
monetary policy instruments, consistent with 2007 Fund TA recommendations, including by
introducing a market-based auction mechanism for placing government debt and
repurchasing operations. Supporting changes would involve improving: (i) forecasting
capacity for economic, liquidity, and balance of payments developments; (ii) fiscal and
monetary policy coordination; and (iii) payment systems. The authorities are considering
some gradual liberalization of exchange controls, but only once global market conditions are
more conducive.
28.
The authorities are continuing efforts to promote further diversification of the
economy, reducing the reliance on tourism. In light of the crisis, the Prime Minister has
urged the tourism sector to make more use of local products, especially fish and produce, to
strengthen downstream linkages. Beyond tourism, the authorities are promoting shipping,
agriculture, and the second home market, particularly for non-Bahamians.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Solid macroeconomic policy management in the past has positioned The
Bahamas relatively well for dealing with the difficult economic environment. The
projected contraction of economic activity will put stress on fiscal and external positions for
the next two-three years, requiring proactive policy intervention. Further increases in
unemployment and social needs are to be expected. In staff’s view, given the economy’s
strong dependence on U.S. growth prospects, the risks to growth remain on the downside.
30.
The authorities’ plans to undertake some countercyclical policies and support
priority expenditures through the downturn appear appropriate. Particularly important
are increased social spending through the National Insurance Board to protect those most
vulnerable to the downturn, as well as public infrastructure investment projects to sustain
employment in the construction sector.
31.
At the same time, staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to rationalize spending
through more rigorous oversight given uncertainties about the duration of the global
slowdown. The authorities plan to reduce costs of loss-making public sector enterprises;
tender openly for procurement of public contracts; audit transfers; and streamline overtime
payments. Early implementation of the planned review of non-targeted electricity subsidies
will facilitate cost recovery and contribute to the necessary strengthening of the finances of a
key public enterprise. Overall, the authorities’ plans strike a reasonable balance between
financing a temporary shock and preserving vital spending while seeking to maintain
medium-term fiscal sustainability. Moreover, the expenditures targeted for reduction will
increase the overall efficiency of government service delivery.
32.
The authorities’ plans to limit the budgetary financing needs in FY 2009/10
hinge importantly on increasing revenues through administrative measures and
privatization proceeds. In staff’s view, the planned yield from administrative improvements
is uncertain both in terms of magnitude and timing, particularly for Customs. Thus, any
delays in privatization plans could lead to financing shortfalls. Staff encouraged the
authorities to prepare a revised medium-term fiscal consolidation path, specifying additional

20
contingency measures in the event that they are needed. While a temporary delay in fiscal
consolidation plans was needed, defining a new path will help anchor expectations.
33.
The fixed exchange rate regime and parity with the U.S. dollar continue to serve
the country well. The small and open Bahamian economy, tied tightly to U.S. economic and
financial activity, argues for maintaining the peg which continues to foster long-term growth
through a stable investment climate. As the peg limits policy flexibility in the face of shocks,
supportive macroeconomic policies become more important in the current difficult
environment.
34.
Staff welcomes the central bank’s multi-year strategy to modernize monetary
policy tools. Introducing an auction mechanism to place government securities would help
develop a secondary market, enabling central bank repurchasing operations to manage
liquidity better. Gradual relaxation of exchange controls in the future as conditions permit,
according to a well-sequenced implementation plan that safeguards reserve adequacy, would
contribute to capital market development and enhanced economic efficiency.
35.
Staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to make strengthening financial
supervision an immediate priority. Measures to align further legal and regulatory
compliance with international norms, and improve stress testing for banking system capital
adequacy are welcome. The recent insolvency of an insurance company reinforces the need
to implement the pending insurance law to bring regulatory, supervisory and prudential
standards to international norms. The authorities’ plans to transfer supervisory responsibility
for the credit unions to the central bank are also welcome.
36.
While the outlook is subject to risks, the authorities have a strong record of
prudent economic management, and are committed to medium-term sustainability.
They are thus ready to take additional measures as needed in order to maintain
macroeconomic stability in the coming period and lay the basis for a growth recovery as the
global economic conditions improve. The authorities also reiterated their commitment to
bring debt down to 30 percent of GDP in the medium term.
37.
The downturn provides an opportunity to address structural issues at the root of
the fiscal deficits of the past decade. Revenue and spending structures should enable the
government to provide the goods and services necessary to maintain high living standards,
protect the most vulnerable, and invest in physical and human capital for robust growth.
Thus, for the medium term, the staff encourages consideration of more fundamental reforms,
particularly rendering the revenue structure more efficient and less distortionary, which
would facilitate efforts to diversify economic activity. Current FDI concessions should be
reviewed to ensure they are not more generous than necessary, while the coverage and type
of taxes should distribute the burden more evenly on all economic activity, including
services. Strengthened administrative capacity would lay the groundwork for eventually
introducing a goods and services or value added tax that would reduce the burden on
consumption/cycle-dependent taxes on imports of goods. Such measures are needed to
facilitate a path toward gradually achieving the authorities’ debt objective.

21
38.
The Bahamas will return to a 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The
Bahamas was placed on the 24 month cycle in the 1999 Article IV consultation staff report,
consistent with the 1997 decision. In light of the risks posed by the global economic and
financial situation, and the benefits of enhanced policy dialogue, it is thus proposed that the
next Article IV consultation with The Bahamas take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2010 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2010

1/ Central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate
depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Background and Summary of Informational Annexes
Discussions. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Nassau during
March 24-April 3, 2009. The mission met with Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, Finance
Minister of State Zhivargo Laing, Governor Wendy Craigg, Acting Financial Secretary Ehurd
Cunningham, other senior officials, representatives of the private sector, and the opposition.
The team visited Nassau during March 24–April 3 and comprised Laure Redifer (head),
Christopher Faircloth, Masahiro Nozaki (all WHD) and Werner Keller (AFR). Patricia AlonsoGamo and Trevor Alleyne (both WHD) and Mr. Ladd (OED) participated in policy meetings.
Exchange arrangement. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of the Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate of the
Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at parity.
Fund relations. The Bahamas has no outstanding purchases or loans.
Technical assistance. In 2005, STA provided assistance in balance of payments and external
debt accounting, and government finance statistics. In 2007, STA assisted in the compilation
of the new national accounts series. Immediately following the 2007 Article IV consultation
mission, an MCM/CARTAC mission provided advice on the adoption of market-oriented
monetary instruments. CARTAC provided advice in three TA missions in 2009 on banking and
credit union supervision, and has three TA missions in the pipeline on stress testing, credit
assessment and anti-money laundering.
Statistical issues. There has been progress in the timeliness and quality of economic data,
although weaknesses remain. The Department of Statistics (DOS) revised and rebased in 2007
and again in 2008 incorporating information from the latest economic census. A preliminary
version of the revised national accounts was released in April 2009 in line with the FY 2009/10
budget cycle. The operations of public corporations are not compiled into consolidated set of
public sector accounts. While Statistical data are adequate for surveillance purposes, the
posting of data and reports on the DOS’ website occurs with long delays, implying that the
central bank is the main source of data. The DOS has also embarked on an ambitious program
to conduct comprehensive socio-economic surveys.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). As of April 6, 2009, the
active portfolio of the IDB stood at US$174 million, of which US$42 million were
outstanding. The IDB is in the final stages of preparing a new strategy for 2008-12. During the
period the Bank seeks to reposition itself as an important source of financing for the critical
investment needs of The Bahamas. In order to cushion adverse aspects of the downturn, build
resilience to exogenous factors, position the economy for long term growth, and given the
identified priorities of Government, the new strategy will focus on two strategic pillars:
(i) Infrastructure for Growth and Environmental Sustainability; and (ii) Institutions for
Competitiveness and Social Sustainability.

Recent Country Strategy:
The IDB is in the final stages of the preparing a new strategy for 2008–12. During the period the Bank seeks to
reposition itself as an important source of financing for the critical investment needs of The Bahamas. As a
result of the present global crisis, and as highlighted by the analytical work carried out by the Bank, the major
challenges facing The Bahamas during the next strategy period will be the need to: (i) cushion the adverse
impacts and build resilience to exogenous factors; and (ii) position the economy for long-term sustainable
growth. Within this context, and given the identified priorities of Government, the new strategy will focus on
two strategic pillars (i) Infrastructure for Growth and Environmental Sustainability and (ii) Institutions for
Competitiveness and Social Sustainability.
The IDB’s strategy for 2003–07 was to focus on: (i) supporting private sector development; (ii) promoting
social development and equity enhancement; (iii) environmental protection and natural resource sustainability;
and (iv) improving public sector management. A key feature of the strategy has been to focus on relatively small
projects with a high technical assistance content.

5
Annex III. The Bahamas—Statistical Issues
There has been progress in the timeliness and quality of economic data, although
weaknesses remain. The Department of Statistics (DOS) has embarked on a series of
initiatives to improve national accounts information. The national accounts were revised and
rebased (2006=100) in 2007 and again in 2008 incorporating information from the latest
economic census. The census revealed that certain non-traditional sectors (land, marine, and
storage) were undercounted in previous national accounts, while the contribution of others,
including real estate, hotels, and education, were over-estimated. 12 A preliminary version of
the revised national accounts was released in April 2009 in line with the FY 2009/10 budget
cycle. In addition, the central bank produces annual, quarterly, and monthly reports
summarizing macroeconomic developments, monetary and fiscal data, and a weekly brief of
key monetary data is available to staff. The operations of public corporations are not
compiled into consolidated set of public sector accounts. While Statistical data are adequate
for surveillance purposes, the posting of data and reports on the DOS’ website is erratic and
occurs with long delays, implying that the central bank is the main source of data.
The DOS has embarked on an ambitious program to conduct comprehensive socioeconomic surveys. (i) A household expenditure survey with a poverty assessment module
has been completed but delays in processing the data has precluded the production poverty
assessment (now scheduled for end-2009); (ii) a survey on social conditions will provide
MDG data (modified to fit the local circumstances); (iii) an occupational survey will update
the labor force statistics, which the authorities have begun to publish on a bi-annual basis
given the recent deterioration in economic conditions; and (iv) a survey is planned to update
and revise the CPI basket (last updated in 1994).
The Bahamas began participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
in 2003. Its metadata was posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
February 14, 2003.

12

The census excluded the banking/insurance, fisheries, and agriculture sectors.

recommendations of the staff appraisal.
1.
The proposed FY 2009/2010
budget maintains essential spending,
but reflects further revenue
measures that would reduce the

Telecommunications Company (BTC) ($30 million) prior to privatization; and a

•

Expenditures. Expenditures ($1697 million) are in line with the Article IV
discussions and the staff report. The government introduced unemployment benefits
in April 2009, and the budget provisions for an extension of these benefits. 14 In the
first four weeks, the program disbursed some $2.4 million, benefiting 5,711
claimants. Recently enacted amendments to the scheme will make eligible an
additional 400 claimants.

•

Financing. The resulting deficit is 3.9 percent of GDP, financed by the proceeds
from BTC privatization and new borrowing.

2.
The fiscal stance remains appropriate, but the yield from planned revenue
measures appears uncertain, given the reliance on improvements in tax administration.
If revenues/privatization receipts are lower than planned or take longer to materialize,
additional expenditure adjustment may be required in order to contain the deficit at
5.8 percent of GDP or below, as discussed during the Article IV consultation.
3.
Structural revenue measures are needed to buttress medium-term debt
sustainability. For the medium term, the budget presents multi-annual fiscal projections
which set a course to reduce the overall deficit an additional 1.5 percent of GDP (by
FY 2011/2012), mainly through curtailed expenditure increases. While this level of
expenditure containment would flatten the increase of the debt trajectory, it would not
change medium-term debt dynamics. Given the need to protect priority social and
infrastructure spending, and rigidities in the public sector wage bill, a structural change on
the revenue side would likely still be needed to achieve the authorities’ medium-term
objective of reducing debt back to 30–35 percent of GDP.
4.
The growth forecast for 2009 remains reasonable, but heavy risks remain on the
downside. Data for tourism arrivals in January–April, comprising the peak of the season,
remain broadly consistent with staff’s forecasted 9.2 percent contraction in tourism receipts
for 2009. First quarter data for FDI suggest the staff’s forecast of a 30 percent contraction
remains realistic.

13

Customs reforms include measures discussed in the staff report, along with significant management changes
recently undertaken. Improvements to collection of real property taxes and business licenses will be effected
through new legislation.
14

The additional budgetary cost of the unemployment benefits will be limited in the near term since they are
being financed by a transfer of a surplus in the medical infrastructure fund managed by the National Insurance
Board. Contributions to the Unemployment Fund will commence in 2010 through a payroll levy on employers
and employees, with the Government contributing as an employer.

3
•

Tourism. Sea arrivals were up by 5.5 percent over the same period last year, partly
reflecting increased demand for shorter and cheaper cruise trips. However, tourists
arriving by air―who spend three times as much daily as cruise tourists and stay six
times longer―dropped by 15.5 percent. On May 26, the Four Seasons Hotel in
Exuma closed, resulting in the termination over one-half of its 500 employees, with
further lay-offs pending.

•

FDI. The number of commercial property acquisitions by non-Bahamians dropped
36 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008, with the total value ($70 million)
declining by 65 percent. Similarly, the number of residential property purchases by
non-Bahamians dropped by 19 percent, with a decline in total value of 25 percent.

5.
The authorities are implementing legislation to align insurance supervision in
The Bahamas with international norms. In May, Parliament passed a new External
Insurance Act and amendments to the 2005 Insurance Act: these are in the process of gaining
assent by the Governor General and then will be put into force. The authorities will request
CARTAC assistance with implementation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 17, 2009

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
The Bahamas
On June 5, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Bahamas. 1
Background
Since mid-2008, the global downturn has significantly affected economic activity in The
Bahamas. Tourism began declining in September and a number of foreign direct investment
projects were postponed or cancelled due to the downturn or financing difficulties. As a result,
real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.7 percent after having grown 2.5 percent per
year in 2006–07, and unemployment rose to 12–14.5 percent (preliminary March 2009
estimates) from 7.9 percent at end-2007, with hotel and construction accounting for most of the
layoffs. Inflation for the twelve months ending in March stood at 4.9 percent. Private sector
credit growth decelerated to 5.1 percent in 2008 from almost 10 percent a year earlier, reflecting
weaker demand and tighter lending standards by banks. Direct exposure to the global financial
crisis has been limited by exchange controls that cap Bahamian residents’ foreign-currency
denominated assets and liabilities.
The external current account balance improved in 2008, mainly reflecting lower constructionrelated imports and higher retained earnings. Although private sector financing flows dropped
substantially, government borrowing in foreign currency to finance capital expenditures helped
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
bolster international reserves, which stood at US$563 million at end-2008, about 87 percent of
base money.
The FY 2008/09 overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase to about 5 percent of GDP,
reflecting shortfalls in revenues associated with the downturn. The authorities maintained
budgeted expenditure levels, while shifting spending to provide transitory means-tested
unemployment benefits. The fiscal deficit is being financed by new external and domestic
borrowing, increasing central government debt to around 40 percent by the end of FY 2008/09,
still low relative to the regional average.
Domestic banks remain well capitalized, despite an increase in non-performing loans as a result
of the downturn. Banks have proactively restructured troubled consumer and mortgage loans,
and the central bank has enhanced monitoring. Negative spillovers from the offshore financial
sector to the domestic financial sector appear limited so far, due to exchange controls and
restrictions on net open foreign exchange positions of domestic banks. The linkages to the
domestic economy are limited to employment and consumption of services by the sector. A
large insurance company, CLICO Bahamas, was placed into liquidation in February 2009 after it
became insolvent due to real estate investments in the United States, but its demise has not
had systemic implications for the domestic financial system. In May, the authorities tabled
amendments to put into effect a law to align insurance supervision with international standards.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Bahamian authorities’ strong track record of prudent
macroeconomic management. They noted that the global economic downturn has put significant
stress on the Bahamian economy because of the latter’s strong ties to the U.S. economy, and that
downside risks to the outlook remain. However, they considered that the Bahamas’ low debt ratios
provide the authorities with room for maneuver to cope with the current difficult economic
environment, and noted the authorities’ readiness to adapt their policy agenda as economic
conditions warrant.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strike a reasonable balance between countercyclical
fiscal policy and fiscal adjustment to contain the adverse impact of the shock on medium-term
sustainability. They supported the authorities’ plans to maintain priority spending and expand
targeted social benefits, despite dwindling fiscal revenues, while streamlining non-essential
spending, introducing administrative and legal reforms to enhance revenue collection, and
strengthening the public enterprise sector to reduce its burden on the public finances. Directors
noted, however, that the attainment of budgetary objectives would depend importantly on
privatization proceeds and increased revenue, both of which are uncertain in terms of magnitude
and timing. They cautioned that if receipts fell short, additional adjustment measures might be
needed.
Directors concurred that the fixed exchange rate regime has served the Bahamas well by
contributing to a stable investment climate. They stressed that macroeconomic policies would need
to be supportive of the peg under the current difficult environment. They noted the staff analysis

3
indicating that the real exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals and that, despite the
recent appreciation, tourism indicators do not suggest a loss of competitiveness.
Directors noted that the direct financial impact of the global downturn and negative spillover from the
offshore financial sector appear limited thus far. They observed that, despite increases in nonperforming loans, domestic banks remain liquid and well capitalized with healthy margins. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ enhanced bank monitoring and plans to strengthen supervision of credit
unions and the insurance sector, and encouraged further regional coordination of bank supervision.
They highlighted the authorities’ commitment to adhere to international standards for offshore
financial regulation, strengthen the framework for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and adopt Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) standards on tax information exchange.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to shift from credit controls to more market-based
monetary policy instruments, including by introducing an auction mechanism for government
securities to allocate credit more efficiently and to provide a vehicle for liquidity management.
Directors concurred that gradual relaxation of exchange controls, under a well-sequenced
implementation plan, once the global environment becomes more supportive, would help deepen
domestic capital markets.
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement structural reforms to promote economic
diversification and private-sector-led growth over the medium term. In particular, they stressed the
need to diversify tourism exports, and to broaden the domestic tax base in order to help finance
priority spending, reduce distortions, and increase the resilience of revenues to shocks.
Strengthened administrative capacity could facilitate the eventual introduction of a goods and
services tax, which in turn would help achieve the authorities’ objective of reducing the debt to 30–
35 percent of GDP over the medium term.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency
