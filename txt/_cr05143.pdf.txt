SURINAME
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2004 Consultation with Suriname
Approved by Christopher Towe and Michael Hadjimichael
March 8, 2005
Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation took place in Paramaribo during
November 30–December 16, 2004. The mission consisted of Messrs. B. Fritz-Krockow (Head),
T. Roy, G. El-Masry, and Ms. M. Torres (all WHD). The mission met with Minister of Finance
Hildenberg, Central Bank President Telting, and other senior government officials, representatives
of the business community, labor unions, and opposition political parties. Ms. K. Florestal (OED)
participated in the policy discussions.
Last Article IV consultation. At its conclusion on October 17, 2003, Directors commended the
authorities for their efforts to stabilize the economy in 2003 by tightening fiscal and monetary
policies. They stressed that macroeconomic stabilization should remain a priority and highlighted
the need to substantially improve tax administration and reform the public sector.
Recent developments. Economic growth has accelerated reflecting increased mining output and a
return of confidence as a result of a more stable macroeconomic situation. More disciplined
monetary and fiscal policies have helped reduce inflation and stabilize the exchange rate, although
pressures on prices are reemerging as a result of somewhat more expansionary policy stance and
uncertainties related to the forthcoming elections.
Key policy issues. The main short-term challenge for Suriname is to maintain disciplined fiscal and
monetary polices before and after the May 2005 elections. Over the medium term, Suriname will
need to develop and entrench a consistent macroeconomic policy framework and advance critical
public sector reforms to minimize the vulnerability to exogenous shocks, ensure continued growth
in income and employment, and maintain a sustainable debt position.
Exchange arrangement. The authorities have made progress in unifying exchange rates under the
managed float regime, but Suriname still maintains multiple currency practices.
Statistics. Despite Suriname’s subscription to the GDDS in June 2004, there remain serious
problems in the quality, coverage, and provision of economic data, in particular national accounts
and trade statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The authorities tightened macroeconomic policies in late 2002, which stabilized the
economy, helped reduce inflation, and supported growth. A reduction in the fiscal deficit
from 6½ percent of GDP in 2002 to near balance in 2003, coupled with a tighter monetary
policy, helped lower inflation from 23 percent in 2002 to 9 percent in 2004. The stable
macroeconomic policy environment and strong mining exports helped boost real GDP
growth to around 5 percent in 2003 and 2004.
The policy stance eased somewhat in 2004. The central government deficit widened to
about 1¾ percent of GDP on account of larger capital expenditure, and the Central Bank of
Suriname reduced reserve requirements on domestic deposits, partly aimed at stimulating the
housing sector.
On current policies, the medium-term outlook would appear manageable, but there are
significant vulnerabilities. Suriname has a history of sudden and highly destabilizing shifts
in policy, especially in the face of shocks to global commodity prices, and there is the risk of
policy slippages both before and after the May 2005 elections.
The key challenge is to maintain and entrench stable macroeconomic policies. It is
important to resist pre-election spending pressures and to avoid undermining the credibility
of recently enacted fiscal responsibility legislation. On the monetary policy front, care will be
needed to ensure that the policy stance remains consistent with low inflation and helps stem
recent pressure toward dollarization, while moving to a unified exchange rate. In addition, it
will be important to advance far-reaching reforms of the civil service and to deal with the
large number of public enterprises.
Over the medium term, the authorities should strive to reduce the country’s
vulnerability to shocks. Key priorities are to broaden the fiscal revenue base and reduce its
dependency on mining exports, reform the domestic fuel taxation, and explore amendments
to the fiscal framework that would limit its vulnerability to volatility in the mining sector.
Similarly, there is scope for establishing a firmer anchor for monetary policy, possibly based
on targets for a monetary aggregate. In addition, there is a need to strengthen prudential
regulations and banking supervision, in particular to mitigate the balance sheet risks
emanating from dollarization.

I. BACKGROUND
A. A Brief Perspective
1.
In the past, Suriname has been prone to exogenous shocks and poor
macroeconomic management. The economy is heavily dependent on bauxite and gold
exports, as well as private remittances from abroad. A large and inefficient public sector,
which includes about 120 public enterprises, accounts for about 60 percent of formal
employment. Fiscal and monetary policies have tended to amplify the effects of negative
shocks to bauxite export receipts, and since the 1970s the economy has suffered through two
separate episodes of hyperinflation; output growth has been highly volatile; and there have
been repeated instances of external payment difficulties.

Suriname’s social indicators are above the average for Latin America and the
Caribbean. However, the country has limited sources of employment outside of the mining
industry and the public sector.1 The latest poverty survey highlights the fact that poor and
rural households in Suriname were particularly affected by erratic macroeconomic policies
and their impact on inflation and real household incomes.2
3.
General parliamentary and indirect presidential elections are scheduled for
May 2005. The political landscape comprises shifting coalitions among a large number of
small, mostly ethnically-based political parties. The coalition supporting the present

administration, led by President Ronald Venetiaan, favors maintaining stable macroeconomic
policies, while some of the main opposition groups have stated a preference for a more
expansionary policy stance.
B. Recent Developments
4.
A tighter monetary and fiscal policy stance helped stabilize the exchange rate
and moderate inflation pressures in 2003. Reserve requirements were increased in late
2002. Coupled with a substantial narrowing of the fiscal deficit, the Central Bank of
Suriname (CBvS) was able to moderate growth of credit to the central government and of
reserve money, and broad money growth halved from 32 percent in 2002 to 16 percent in
2003, with the banking system’s net domestic assets contributing a mere 4 percentage points.
These policies contributed to an easing of inflation to an estimated 13 percent in 2003 and an
estimated 9 percent in 2004.3
5.
Economic growth accelerated in
2003 and 2004, reflecting increased mining
output and the effects of macroeconomic
stability on confidence. Growth is estimated
to have averaged around 5 percent in both 2003
and 2004, mainly owing to continued largescale investment in the mining sector, a new
gold mine in Rosebel that became operational
in April 2004, and an expansion of the Suralco
alumina refinery. In addition, activity was
boosted by investment in public housing, with
about 4,000 new units having been constructed
since 2003.
6.
The more stable macroeconomic
environment laid the foundation for the
successful launch of the Suriname dollar.4 In
January 2004, the CBvS replaced the Suriname
guilder with the Suriname dollar (SRD) at a
rate of Sf1,000 per SRD. Shortly thereafter, the
CBvS devalued the official exchange rate by
4 percent, thereby reducing the spread against
the parallel market rate to less than 2½ percent.

Data for 2003 and 2004 are Fund staff estimates. CPI data are not available between July 2003 and March
2004, owing to a fire that destroyed the General Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) building. The ABS resumed
monthly CPI data collection and processing only after moving into new facilities in March 2004.

See the chapter on Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate Regime in the accompanying Selected Issues
paper.

-6-

In June 2004, the CBvS eliminated ceilings and floors on trading at the parallel exchange
rate. Since then, the parallel rate has further converged toward the official rate of SDR 2.75
per U.S. dollar.5
7.
The fiscal stance eased somewhat in 2004. The central government’s overall
deficit narrowed substantially during 2003, falling from 6½ percent of GDP in 2002 to
0.1 percent of GDP, as a result of wage restraint and tight controls on current outlays.
However, the deficit rose to an estimated 1.8 percent of GDP in 2004, owing to a substantial
increase in capital expenditure on account of several large infrastructure and road
improvement projects and a drop in petroleum taxes. These factors more than offset the
effects of higher tax payments by the bauxite sector and the lagged effect on revenues of a
temporary corporate income tax surcharge for 2003.6
8.
Monetary policy also became somewhat more accommodative in 2004. The
CBvS lowered reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits from 35 percent to
30 percent and allowed commercial banks to invest up to 7 percentage points of the required
reserves on domestic currency deposits in low-interest housing loans to low-income groups.
This measure reduced the effective reserve ratio on domestic deposits to about 26½ percent
at end-December 2004.7 Broad money growth accelerated to 29 percent in 2004, reflecting a
strong increase in net international reserves and an expansion of credit to the private sector of
32½ percent.

5

The official rate is determined by the CBvS and is used for its transactions, including the surrender of mining
export proceeds; the commercial rate is determined by commercial banks and foreign exchange houses
(cambios); the black market rate is used by nonbank financial intermediaries, but has become less important
since the CBvS eliminated the ceilings and floors for the commercial rate. There are also highly subsidized
official exchange rates for imports of infant formula and milk powder.
6

Even though Suriname’s tax-to-GDP ratio is high, the income tax relies heavily on the mining industry and
taxation of the nonmining sector is further hampered by a weak tax and customs administration. The authorities
have requested technical assistance to address these issues.
7

Commercial banks have invested about 2½ percent of their deposit liabilities in such mortgages since the
announcement. The effective reserve requirement ratio is calculated by excluding these mortgages.

Box: Taxation of Petroleum Products
Government revenue from petroleum products comprises an import duty, a turnover tax, a
road levy, and a variable petroleum consumption tax. The latter tax is collected as the
residual difference between the pump price and landed cost plus margins for transportation
and distribution. Pump prices and the margins for domestic distribution are fixed by the
government.

The last price adjustment took place in March 2003, when the pump price for diesel fuel was
raised from SRD1.00 per liter to SRD1.40 per liter and for gasoline from SRD1.08 to
SRD1.55. The significant increase in international oil prices in 2004 caused a corresponding
reduction in government revenue from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2003 to 2.2 percent of GDP in
2004.

9.
The economy has become
increasingly dollarized in recent years. 8
During 2002–04, the share of foreign currency
deposits rose from 47 percent to 56 percent of
the total deposit base, and the share of private
sector credit denominated in foreign currency
rose from 42 percent to 54 percent.
Dollarization has reflected the lingering effects
on confidence of the earlier episodes of nearhyperinflation, the liberalization of foreign
exchange controls and bank lending regulations
during 2002–03, and reserve requirements that
strongly favor foreign currency intermediation.9
The CBvS has begun to address the latter by
raising the minimum reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits to 22 percent in
October 2004.

Banking supervision has improved, but weaknesses remain. The new Banking
Supervision Law enacted in January 2003 tightened norms on capital adequacy and those
relating to banks’ risk assessment and management. However, implementation has suffered
from a lack of staff resources, which led to delays in reporting and deficiencies in conducting
onsite inspections.

8

See the chapter on dollarization in the accompanying Selected Issues paper. Foreign currency deposits and
loans are denominated in euros and U.S. dollars.
9

The reserve ratio for foreign currency deposits was set at 17.5 percent since February 2003, compared with
35 percent for domestic deposits. Moreover, required reserves for foreign currency deposits can be held in
interest-bearing accounts abroad, while those for domestic currency deposits are held as unremunerated deposits
at the CBvS. The spread between lending and deposit rates in 2003 was 12.5 percentage points for domestic
currency and 6.9 percentage points for foreign currency instruments.

-9-

11.
The external current account deficit
has remained wide, financed largely through
foreign direct investment. The current account
deficit rose from 6 percent of GDP in 2002 to
14 percent in 2003, narrowing only marginally
in 2004, despite the cumulative 66 percent
increase in export proceeds in 2003-04. Prices
for alumina and gold were very favorable in
2004, while exports of gold also benefited from
regulatory changes facilitating gold purchases
from the informal sector, significantly reducing
the smuggling of gold to neighboring
countries.10 This was more than offset by a
surge in imports due to large investments by the
mining companies in 2003 and 2004, as well as
imports of consumer goods, which increased
significantly with the rise in real incomes and a
more stable economic environment.
Nonetheless, the continued large inflows of
foreign direct investment helped reserves to rise
by almost 3 percent of GDP in 2004.

Weak debt management has left
Suriname with external arrears and a poor credit rating. Suriname maintains arrears on
bilateral loans since 1999, despite the country’s relatively comfortable reserves position.
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) temporarily downgraded Suriname’s long-term foreign currency
rating from B- to SD (selective default) in August 2004, citing the country’s inadequate debt
management and weak debt payment discipline as key factors behind the arrears
accumulation.11 In late 2004, the Suriname Debt Management Office (SDMO) became
operational, improving significantly the country’s debt reporting system. The authorities had
considered floating a US$100-200 million bond on international capital markets—
Suriname’s first—in early 2004, but this plan was shelved in October 2004.

10

See the chapter on the gold sector in the accompanying Selected Issues paper. The value of gold exports from
informal sources increased from US$70 million in 2002 to US$140 million in 2003 (12 percent of GDP) and to
US$195 million in 2004.

11

S&P reversed its downgrade and placed Suriname’s rating back to B- after it received information from the
Surinamese authorities that arrears were held on official bilateral loans rather than commercial obligations.

- 10 -

13.
External competitiveness of nonmining industries has been affected by the
high and volatile real effective exchange rate.
Suriname’s real effective exchange rate has
exhibited a high volatility in the past, due
mainly to the country’s macroeconomic policy
instability.12 Although the nominal exchange
rate has stabilized in recent years, the real
effective rate appreciated by a cumulative
19 percent between August 2002 and December
2004, reflecting Suriname’s relatively high
inflation rate. The real appreciation has
undermined the competitiveness of nonmineral
exports, which have remained stagnant since
2002.13

absenteeism, and improving recruitment and
remuneration policies. The IDB also advised
the government on the restructuring of four
ailing state-owned banks, while efforts are being undertaken to tackle governance problems
at the customs administration and improve revenue collection. The authorities have also been
working with the World Bank’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) with a view to
facilitating private investment by removing unnecessary impediments, eliminating public
monopolies, and streamlining regulations.

II. SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
15.
Economic growth will likely remain strong in 2005. The economy is projected to
grow by almost 5 percent in 2005 in response to continued large mining investments and a

12

Empirical analysis suggests that there has been no long-run relationship between Suriname’s real effective
exchange rate and the world prices of its principal exports. See Paul Cashin, Luis Céspedes, and Ratna Sahay,
2002, “ Keynes, Cocoa, and Copper: In Search of Commodity Currencies,” IMF Working Paper 02/223. These
issues are also discussed in the chapters on monetary policy and fiscal revenue instability in the accompanying
Selected Issues paper.

- 11 -

further loosening of the fiscal stance. These factors, as well as uncertainties in the run-up to
the elections, would keep inflation at about 9 percent in 2005.
16.
Based on the authorities’ 2005 budget, the staff projects that the central
government deficit will increase to 2¾ percent of GDP in 2005. Capital expenditure is
expected to increase from 5½ percent of GDP in 2004 to around 6¾ percent of GDP in 2005,
mainly on account of a large road expansion project, while current expenditure is projected to
remain about unchanged in real terms.14 Total revenue and grants are projected to increase
from 35½ percent of GDP in 2004 to 36½ percent of GDP in 2005 as a result of higher
indirect tax revenue. Direct tax revenue is projected to fall with the expiration of the
corporate income surcharge, offsetting the effect of anticipated higher tax revenue from the
new gold mine.
17.
The authorities are expected to maintain a disciplined monetary stance. In view
of the recent tightening of reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits and
uncertainties in the run-up to the elections, it is projected that private credit expansion will
decelerate during 2005, while money supply growth is projected to slow to around
16 percent. Dollarization is projected to slow considerably as a result of the increase in
reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits that was introduced in late 2004.
18.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain substantial. As a
result of large investments in the bauxite mining sector to replace the aging mines at Mungo
and Lelydorp, the current account deficit will only narrow marginally to around 12 percent of
GDP. Exports are projected to increase by 16 percent in U.S. dollar terms due to continued
growth in the alumina and gold output, while imports are projected to rise on account of new
investments in the mining industry. With continued inflows of foreign direct investment, it is
projected that reserves will increase by about 3 percent of GDP.
III. POLICY ISSUES AND DISCUSSIONS
19.
The team stressed that the short-term challenge facing policymakers in
Suriname was to maintain policy discipline in the run-up to the May 2005 elections. The
authorities indicated that they were mindful of the potentially destabilizing effects of a looser
policy stance in an environment of heightened political uncertainty and emphasized their
commitment to preserving the price and exchange rate stability that had been achieved in
recent years.
20.
The discussions centered on the medium-term challenge of placing policies
within a consistent and forward-looking macroeconomic framework. The authorities
concurred that a long-term policy framework was needed to entrench stable policies,
minimize the impact of export revenue volatility, ensure stable and continued growth in real
14

As in previous years, the 2005 budget envisages a substantial increase of capital expenditure, which is
unlikely to be fully executed.

- 12 -

income and employment, reduce poverty in rural areas, and maintain a sustainable debt
position.
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
21.
The staff’s baseline for the medium-term outlook appears relatively favorable.
In the baseline scenario, macroeconomic policies are assumed to remain disciplined, with a
primary fiscal surplus of around 1.3 percent of GDP maintained during 2006–09. The current
account deficit would remain significant due to the limited outlook for alumina, gold, and
nontraditional exports, but continued foreign direct investment is expected to finance a small
balance of payments surplus. As a result of only modest fiscal deficits, public sector debt
would fall from around 52 percent of GDP at end-2003 to around 41 percent at end-2009.15

22.
Against this background, the team stressed the importance of maintaining a
disciplined policy stance to guard against the key risks to the outlook:
•

Policy slippages: The period leading up to the May 2005 election will undoubtedly
include pressures to increase labor-intensive capital spending. Moreover, while the
current administration has maintained relatively disciplined policies and has been
successful in stabilizing the economy, the challenge will be to ensure that these policy
successes are sustained after the election, especially given Suriname’s history of highly
destabilizing economic policies and bouts of near-hyperinflation.16

•

Capital flight: Although increased dollarization may have reduced the risk of large-scale
deposit flight, political uncertainties before and after the elections, erratic macroeconomic
policies, or a loss in confidence in the domestic banking system have left the economy
vulnerable to large-scale deposit outflows.

•

External shocks: Bauxite and aluminum prices are projected to remain broadly stable
and the export base is becoming somewhat more diversified with the exports of gold.17
Nonetheless, Suriname remains highly reliant on mining exports and is very vulnerable to
global commodity price shocks.

•

Upside opportunities: The medium-term growth and employment outlook could
improve substantially in light of possible large-scale foreign direct investment projects.
The authorities pointed in particular to the feasibility studies being undertaken for a new
bauxite-aluminum complex, which could lead to new investment of about US$3 billion in
2007–11; and the ongoing offshore petroleum exploration.

16

See also the chapters on fiscal volatility and monetary policy and the exchange regime in the accompanying
Selected Issues paper.

17

The impact of the recent diversification might be limited as gold and alumina prices have shown a high
positive correlation in the past. International oil price changes have only a limited impact on the BOP and the
budget, as fuel-related payments and receipts are about equal.

A debt sustainability analysis
Debt-to-GDP Ratio, 2003-09
(In percent)
illustrates the country’s vulnerabilities,
especially to fiscal shocks. Suriname’s fiscal
position has been highly volatile in the past and
a policy shock that caused a deterioration of the
primary fiscal balance to its historical average
minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio to
76 percent by 2006, 30 percentage points above
the baseline scenario. The analysis also
illustrates the risks related to output and
commodity prices. A shock to real GDP in 2005
and 2006 that took the rate to its historical growth rate minus two standard deviations would
lead to a gradual increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 66½ percent by 2009. Furthermore, a
deterioration of aluminum and gold prices by two standard deviations relative to the WEO
baseline in 2005–06—assuming no corrective policy response—would lead to a fiscal deficit
of 5 percent of GDP in 2006 and would increase public debt to 56 percent of GDP by 2006.

24.
Against this background, the team stressed the importance of reforms to
entrench a policy framework geared towards ensuring macroeconomic stability and
growth over the medium term. The authorities broadly agreed that while recent legislation
had strengthened fiscal responsibility, there would be merit in exploring amendments to the
framework to reduce the risk of global commodity price shocks undermining fiscal discipline
and debt sustainability, to unify the exchange rate, and to develop a more explicit mediumterm anchor for monetary policy. They agreed with the staff that windfall revenues from high
international prices for alumina and gold should be used to lower debt levels and increase the
economy’s resilience to shocks. It would also be important to pursue structural reforms to
reduce the economy’s reliance on the mining and government sectors for employment. At the
same time, however, the authorities cautioned that substantive progress on these fronts would
depend on the outcome of the elections, and that in any event a cautious and deliberate
approach to reform would be required in light of Suriname’s under-developed financial
markets and the need to maintain social consensus.
B. Fiscal Policy
25.
The staff stressed the importance resisting pressures to loosen fiscal policies in
the run-up to the elections. In particular, the mission broadly endorsed the 2005 budget
targets, which assumed relatively tight control over both current and capital spending, and
welcomed the authorities’ medium-term objective of maintaining a moderate fiscal policy
stance with a view to reducing public sector debt below 40 percent of GDP by 2009.
However, the team noted that large public sector wage increases had been difficult to resist in
the past, and that boosting capital expenditure prior to the elections would lead to waste and
inefficiency, given the limited project implementation capacity, and undermine confidence in
the authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline.

- 15 -

26.
The authorities agreed on the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline. In
particular, they acknowledged that containing wage demands was a pre-requisite for
containing pressures on prices and the exchange rate. The authorities also agreed on the need
to advance the technical work for the IDB-supported reform of the civil service, but
emphasized the importance of tailoring the reform to avoid social dislocation and large
increases in unemployment. As for investment spending, the authorities indicated that they
would not seek commercial external borrowing to finance pre-election capital expenditure,
and would limit infrastructure investment to bilaterally and multilaterally financed and
supervised projects.
27.
The authorities also pointed to the recent steps taken to strengthen the fiscal
framework. In order to improve the efficiency and transparency of the budget process, the
February 2002 fiscal responsibility law established a ceiling on public sector debt of
60 percent of GDP and a subceiling on domestic public sector debt of 15 percent of GDP.
These limits can be exceeded only with parliamentary approval and under exceptional
circumstances.18 The team and the authorities agreed that the inherent vulnerability of the
country to exogenous shocks and the history of very poor macroeconomic policies required
further efforts to strengthen the fiscal framework. The team remarked that the debt ceiling
appeared high given the country’s low credit rating and market access, its vulnerability to
exogenous shocks, and its high revenue volatility.19 The mission noted that soon after the
new ceilings were introduced, the authorities considered requesting a breach, and the team
stressed the importance of respecting the ceilings except in cases of national emergency.
28.
The authorities and the mission agreed on the need to diversify the revenue
base and reduce revenue volatility. The team noted that about 22½ percent of the revenue
base was tied to the fortunes of the bauxite, gold and oil export sectors, and that shocks to
commodity prices had in the past caused sharp swings in the overall fiscal position.
Moreover, revenue volatility was further amplified by the domestic fuel tax system. The
authorities agreed to work towards expanding the tax base to improve nonmining revenue
collection and to study ways to amend the fuel tax system to eliminate revenue volatility, and
requested technical assistance to help in the design and implementation.
29.
The team suggested that consideration could be given to other mechanisms for
coping with the fiscal effects of volatility in the natural resource sector. In particular, the
mission noted that a revenue stabilization fund or similar fiscal rules could be introduced to
18

There is also a subceiling since 1986 on government’s access to central bank financing of 10 percent of
budgeted annual current fiscal revenue, but this limit has been frequently violated. A new Central Bank Act that
is awaiting parliamentary approval would strengthen the central bank president’s authority to limit financing in
excess of the lending limit and establish penalties for central bank officials if the limit was exceeded.

19

The September 2003 World Economic Outlook illustrates that developing country debt ratios should fall into
the 20–60 percent range, with the higher end reserved for countries with higher credit ratings and revenue-toGDP ratios, and lower revenue volatility.

- 16 -

the fiscal framework, which could both make it easier to cope with shocks to revenues from
the mining sector and assist in ensuring inter-generational equity. The authorities expressed
interest in studying further such mechanisms, but cautioned that administrative and political
constraints would likely limit the scope for their introduction in the near term.
30.
The authorities agreed on the need for a comprehensive plan to improve the
efficiency of state-owned companies and encourage non-mining private sector activity.
As a first step, the authorities were committed to the privatization of the banana, rice, and
forestry companies in the course of 2005. A large number of public enterprises had not
submitted financial statements to the government for many years, and the authorities had
intensified efforts to gather information on these enterprises, including through the
withholding of government transfers.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
31.
The team stressed that the monetary authorities would need to stem incipient
inflation pressures.20 In particular, although inflation had remained at 9 percent in 2004,
broad money growth had accelerated to 29 percent, in part due to the unsterilized increase in
central bank reserves. The mission also noted that despite the recent success in limiting
central bank credit to the government, the authorities had demonstrated in the past a tendency
to subordinate monetary policy to fiscal financing needs, with scant importance to the impact
on inflation. However, the authorities stressed their commitment to tighten policies as
necessary to contain inflation and noted that proposal had been made to amend the Central
Bank Act and strengthen the limits on central bank lending to the government.
32.
The team suggested that the monetary policy framework could be strengthened
by moving toward the adoption of a more explicit policy anchor. Recent steps to cement
the CBvS’s ability to limit financing of the central government and the elimination of
restrictions on the commercial bank exchange rate were encouraging, but the mission
suggested that the adoption of a pre-announced monetary target could provide a more solid
anchor for monetary policy and strengthen confidence in the central bank. However,
successful implementation would require a credible and continuous commitment to fiscal
discipline, independence of the central bank to conduct monetary policy, and the availability
of indirect monetary policy instruments. The authorities noted that the rapidly changing
conditions in Suriname’s financial markets and the limited success of the CBvS in projecting
monetary aggregates would make if difficult to adopt a more formal monetary target in the
near future.21

20

21

Monetary policy instruments consist of reserve requirements on deposits and CBvS credit to the government.

For a description of Suriname’s monetary policy framework and exchange rate regime, see the chapter in the
accompanying Selected Issues paper.

- 17 -

33.
The authorities agreed that policy implementation would benefit from
expanding the range of monetary instruments. However, while they acknowledged that
adjustments to reserve requirements on deposits and the statutory limits on fiscal financing
were relatively blunt tools, they saw limited scope at present to introduce more indirect
instruments in light of the underdeveloped financial markets and the limited marketability of
government or CBvS securities. Moreover, in response to the team’s argument that social
policy goals should be addressed transparently through the budget rather than through the use
of monetary policy instruments, the authorities saw limited political scope for eliminating
housing loans from the list of approved reserve assets.
34.
The mission recommended moving to a unified exchange rate regime. While
welcoming the steps that led to the convergence of exchange rates and greater exchange rate
flexibility, the team noted Suriname’s poor track record in maintaining a free and marketdetermined exchange rate. The mission, therefore, recommended adopting the bank/cambios
daily rate as the official rate, which would also help to eliminate the existing multiple
currency practice. Similarly, the mission suggested the elimination of the special exchange
rates for infant formula and milk powder imports in favor of direct budgetary subsidies.
However, the authorities were reluctant to consider the mission’s recommendation at this
stage, citing uncertainties in the market place prior to the election and the risk of exchange
rate volatility given the thin market.
35.
There is a need to regularize relations with external creditors and eliminate
payment arrears. The staff noted that external debt levels are high but manageable and
welcomed the establishment of the Suriname Debt Management Office (SDMO). While
focused primarily on the regularization and management of public sector external debt, the
SDMO could also become instrumental in improving the marketability of government
securities. The mission noted that improvements in Suriname’s payment record and the
elimination of arrears to bilateral creditors, which amounted to US$145 million at end-2004,
would likely improve the country’s credit rating, lower borrowing costs, and increase access
to international capital markets. A first encouraging step has been taken in February 2005
with the regularization of outstanding liabilities to the German Euler Hermes credit insurance
group, which had been incurred in the second half of the 1980s.
D. Financial System
36.
The financial system is underdeveloped and highly concentrated.22 The system
consists of the CBvS, commercial banks, and a number of nonbank financial institutions—
mainly pension funds and insurance companies—that represent less than a third of financial
sector assets. The banking system is highly concentrated, with the largest three banks
accounting for about 85 percent of total claims, assets, and deposits. There are three small
22

Suriname constitutes one of the pilot case countries to increase financial sector surveillance in the context of
Article IV consultations. In this respect, a more detailed review of the financial sector and its vulnerabilities can
be found in Appendix Table 4 and the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

- 18 -

state-owned banks that provide credit to low-income households for agriculture and housing
under mostly social criteria.
37.
Banking sector indicators appear relatively robust, but point to inherent
vulnerabilities. Core indicators appear healthy, but the financial sector remains vulnerable to
credit risk events, as evidenced by the relatively low level of bank capitalization and the
increase in the nonperforming loan ratio from 13.3 percent at end-2002 to 15.3 percent in
2004.23 Supervision also continues to be weak due to inadequate staff resources and delays in
data collection to control compliance, while questions remain about the system’s capacity to
prevent money laundering, particularly at the casinos and unregulated foreign exchange
houses. In addition, there are no specific limits on the foreign currency position of the banks
or regulations for foreign currency lending. The staff recommended strengthening prudential
regulations and supervision to address possible currency mismatch risks at banks and the
recent increase in nonperforming loans. The authorities agreed that there was a need to
improve banking supervision and were prepared to consider participating in a Financial
Sector Assessment Program.
38.
The staff cautioned that dollarization exposed the banking system to balance
sheet risks. In this context, the authorities agreed with the mission’s recommendation to
remove the remaining gap between foreign and domestic currency reserve requirements,
which favored financial intermediation in foreign currencies. Subsequent to the discussions,
the authorities raised the reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits to 33⅓ percent.
E. Structural Policies and Other Issues
39.
Suriname has a relatively open trade system. As reported in the recent WTO’s
Trade Policy Review, the unweighted average rate tariff is 11 percent and there are no
protectionist nontariff barriers. Suriname has enacted the CARICOM Single Market and
Economy Treaty and implemented the fourth phase of the common external tariff
(20 percent).
40.
There is a need to promote the development of the nonmining private sector.
While the economy will likely continue to be dominated by bauxite and gold mining in the
medium term, there is a need to diversify the economy to help avoid the excessive
fluctuations in employment and real incomes that the country experienced in the past. In this
respect, the mission recommended reducing the reliance on fiscal and tariff incentives, while
concentrating on simplifying licensing procedures and promoting a more stable and rulebased climate for investment, including through strengthening the protection of property
rights and dispute settlement procedures. In this context, a World Bank study found that the
Investment Act of 2002 provided incentives for the nonmining private sector at high fiscal
costs, while private sector investment continues to be hampered by governance issues,
23

Part of the deterioration in the indicators is attributable to the tightening of regulatory guidelines in 2003, in
particular with respect to capital adequacy ratios.

- 19 -

uncertain and complex licensing procedures, weak administrative capacity, and excessive
scope for administrative discretion.
41.
There are serious data reporting problems in Suriname. Notwithstanding the
recent accession to the GDDS and improvements in the coverage and timeliness of monetary
data, there are severe shortcomings in the quality, coverage, and provision of economic
statistics, in particular with respect to national accounts and trade data. The staff stressed the
importance of improvements in the provision of statistics to facilitate more timely and
accurate economic analysis and planning.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The authorities have achieved considerable success on the macroeconomic front
since 2003. Continued expenditure moderation and higher tax revenue have resulted in a
substantial improvement in the public finances. Fiscal discipline, supported by a cautious
monetary policy stance and a favorable external environment, have helped stabilize the
exchange rate and lower inflation, improving investor confidence and achieving a solid
growth performance.
43.
Nonetheless, Suriname still faces important challenges. In the near term, the key
priority will be to resist pressures to relax the fiscal stance ahead of the elections, including
by limiting pre-election capital expenditure and civil service wage increases, and to rein in
the growth of broad money. Over the medium term, institutional changes are needed to help
avoid the procyclical monetary and fiscal responses that have exacerbated the effects of
terms-of-trade shocks and led to destabilizing bouts of near hyperinflation.
44.
The fiscal framework has been strengthened, but further steps could yield
important dividends. On the revenue side, tax reforms are needed to broaden and diversify
the domestic revenue base and reduce the reliance on the mining sector, and to amend the
fuel pricing and taxation. On the expenditure side, civil service reform will be critical for
improving the efficiency of the large public sector, and the authorities are urged to accelerate
the IDB-supported project in this area, while maintaining moderate wage and employment
policies prior to its completion. From a broader perspective, the new limits that have been
placed on public sector debt are a welcome innovation, but these appear high given
Suriname’s vulnerability to external shocks and consideration should be given to more
stringent targets. In any event, care will be needed to respect the legal debt ceilings except in
cases of national emergency.
45.
Inflation pressures may be reemerging and it is important to maintain a firm
control over credit growth. The authorities have been successful in lowering inflation over
the past two years, but these gains may be threatened by the strong growth of broad money
during 2004. Against this background, the central bank should stand ready to tighten
monetary conditions and slow the rate of broad money growth.
46.
In addition, there is scope for strengthening the monetary policy framework. In
the past, monetary policy has been subordinated to fiscal financing needs, with limited regard
for the implications for inflation or macroeconomic stability. Encouragingly, the envisaged

- 20 -

amendments to the Central Bank Act will define more clearly the central bank’s
responsibility to provide credit to the government. However, consideration should be given to
anchoring monetary policy more firmly on a pre-announced monetary target and to
expanding the range of monetary policy instruments.
47.
Care is also needed to ensure that the recent increase in dollarization does not
expose the banking system to balance sheet risks. The authorities have taken the welcome
step of removing the difference between foreign and domestic currency reserve requirements,
which should reduce the incentives that favored foreign currency-denominated
intermediation in Suriname. Nonetheless, there is a need for the regulatory and other
authorities to examine closely the risks to the financial system that dollarization poses.
48.
The authorities should move quickly to a managed unified floating exchange
rate regime. With the introduction of the Suriname dollar in 2004, steps have been taken that
led to the convergence of exchange rates and greater flexibility in the market. The authorities
are urged to seize the present opportunity to move to a unified and floating exchange rate
regime by adopting the daily commercial rate as the official exchange rate. This would also
help eliminate one of the multiple currency practices that are subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, Sections 2 (a) and 3 arising from the existence of an official exchange rate for
government transactions and the partial surrender of export proceeds, and the nonofficial rate
for all other transactions. The preferential rate for milk powder and infant formula imports
also gives rise to a multiple currency practice. In the absence of a schedule for the removal of
these multiple currency practices, the staff does not recommend Fund approval for the
retention of these measures.
49.
The authorities are encouraged to tighten prudential regulations and improve
banking supervision. Key priorities are to limit potential currency mismatch risks in the
system, and to increase staff training and resources devoted to banking supervision,
particularly in light of the recent increase in nonperforming loans in the system and the
continuing problems at the small state-owned banks. The staff also encourages the authorities
to consider participating in a Financial Sector Assessment Program.
50.
There is a need to clarify relations with external creditors and eliminate
payment arrears. Although debt levels are manageable, Suriname’s erratic payment record
and long-standing arrears to bilateral creditors have undermined the country’s
creditworthiness and increased borrowing cost, and should be addressed without further
delay. In this regard, staff welcomes the recent regularization of old bilateral debt arrears
with Germany, which took place after the departure of the mission.
51.
The development of the nonmining private sector is needed to generate
sustainable employment and income growth. In this respect, the authorities should
simplify licensing procedures and promote a more stable and rule-based climate for
investment, including through a strengthening of property-right protection and dispute
settlement procedures. It is important also to move ahead with the design of a comprehensive
plan to improve the efficiency of state-owned companies and encourage nonmining private
sector activity, including privatizing the banana, rice, and forestry companies.

- 21 -

52.
There are serious data reporting problems in Suriname. The staff welcomes the
recent accession to the GDDS, but notes that data provision—while adequate—is severely
impaired due to the substantial shortcomings in the quality and timeliness of economic
statistics.
53.
The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ For commercial banks data, a new data compilation method in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual was adopted from May 2002 onward,
resulting in an irreconcilable data break. Therefore, pre- and post-2002 data are not comparable. Figures involving percentage changes in 2002 over
2001 are calculated on basis of estimates for end-2002 data as according to the old methodology, to achieve compatibility with data prior to May 2002.
2/ Foreign currency deposits in percent of total commercial bank deposits.
3/ Foreign currency credit in percent of total private sector credit by commercial banks.

1/ Public sector debt covers the central government. Public external debt is on a gross basis. Public domestic debt held by the domestic banking system is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured
in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth and primary balance. The real interest rate corresponds to the baseline scenario, as historical real interest rates were highly negative due to inflation and would have led to implausible results.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Standard deviation of the real interest rate is extremely high, owing to highly erratic inflation rates in the past. The informational value of this test is hence somewhat limited.
11/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
12/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced the Surinamese
guilder in January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD. The central bank uses
an official exchange rate of SRD 2.75 per U.S. dollar for government and mining
transactions and a rate of SRD 1.4 per U.S. dollar for baby milk powder imports. Most

APPENDIX I

private transactions take place at a commercial bank/cambio rate. In June 2004, the central
bank removed the ceiling and the floor on this rate, which had previously been set at SRD 2.8
and 2.6 per U.S. dollar respectively. Since then, the commercial bank/cambio rate has traded
between SRD 2.8 and 2.71 per U.S. dollar.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on October 17, 2003
(IMF Country Report No. 03/356). Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
IX.

Participation in the GDDS

In July 2004, the IMF officially announced Suriname’s formal participation in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

SURINAME: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
AND THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. World Bank Group
The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the IFC completed a report in April
2003 that outlined recommendations on how to structure and improve the country's new
investment initiative, including the 2001 Investment Law and the investment promotion
agency InvestSur. A workshop to present the findings was held in Paramaribo in July 2003.
The Government has requested a follow-up report on fiscal incentives, amendments to the
Investment Law, and setting up of the Investment Promotion Agency. This report was
delivered to the Government in October 2004, and subsequently presented at a workshop.
B. Inter-American Development Bank
Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1980. Since then, the IDB
has approved 15 loans (13 projects) to Suriname amounting to US$101.6 million and 82
technical cooperation operations totaling US$26.8 million.
The IDB is the only major multilateral lender operating in Suriname at this time. The other
main sources of financing for public sector investment are The Netherlands and the European
Union. As of December 2004, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$44
million, mostly on Intermediate Fund Financing (IFF) terms.
Bank strategy in Suriname is outlined in the current Suriname Country Strategy approved in
2000. The main premise of the strategy is that Suriname’s recent development was
constrained, not so much by a lack of capital resources, but by a deficient policy and
institutional framework. Consequently, the main thrust of Bank strategy since 2000 has been
to support policy and institutional reforms as the basis for promoting private-sector-led
growth. In addition, this approach has been followed with the help of an active Technical
Cooperation program. A new country strategy is due to be prepared for Board approval in
2005.
Structural reform projects
Public sector. In June 2004 the IDB approved a $5 million loan to Suriname to support the
strengthening of public sector management. Public sector management and reform is
considered to be a critical element of institutional reform in the country, given the large size
and importance of the public sector. The executing agency is now actively working to fulfill
the conditions prior to first disbursement. The loan is complemented by TC (technical
cooperation) to elaborate a road map which will help to guide implementation of the public
sector reform project. Preparation of this road map is expected to begin in April 2005.
Banking system. The authorities are working with the IDB to develop a reform and
rationalization of the state banks. To this end, the IDB approved in May 2003 a technical

- 36 -

APPENDIX II

cooperation project (Financial Sector Strengthening and Rationalization—US$500,000) that
will support a financial evaluation of the state banks and identify reform options. If
authorities decide to pursue a reform strategy, which is consistent with sound financial and
public policy criteria, the project would also finance the development of a detailed
implementation plan that could be executed with IDB financial support through a subsequent
loan program.
Financial relations (as of December 2004)
At present, 7 loan projects are in execution amounting to US$51 million in IDB contribution
and 18 technical cooperation projects in execution with total IDB contributions of
US$11 million. The undisbursed portion of the loan portfolio in execution is entirely on OC
terms with IFF subsidy.

APPENDIX III

SURINAME—STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. OVERVIEW
The quality and timeliness of economic statistics has improved over the past two years. The
authorities have worked with STA to improve national accounts, monetary, and balance of
payments statistics. Suriname started participating in the GDDS in June 2004, and its
metadata are posted on the IMF's Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. These provide
information on Suriname’s statistical production and dissemination practices, as well as plans
for improvement. In addition, the newly created Suriname Debt Management Office started
operations in 2004, improving the quality of public debt data. Notwithstanding these
advances, continued effort is required to bring statistics up to a level that is adequate for
policy analysis.
Real Sector
The latest national income accounts data are 2002. Preliminary estimates for 2003 became
available in late-2004, but without the details on informal sector activity.
Some efforts were made to improve the GDP data by production approach. The constant
price series were rebased to 1990 and the estimates in the different economic sectors are now
based on indicator variables. However, indicators of sectoral activities still suffer from poor
response rates to questionnaires.
There are no national accounts by expenditure approach and no labor statistics. There is also
no reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments data.
The production and dissemination of Suriname’s consumer price index (CPI) was disrupted
by the temporary cessation of work by the General Statistics Bureau (ABS) due to a fire
(June 2003 - March 2004). In the absence of data collection and processing, it will not be
possible to publish those monthly data or annual figures for 2003 and 2004.
Public Finances
The only public sector financial data available are those for the central government. In
addition, a substantial amount of additional information is needed to derive an accurate
picture of the fiscal accounts. With respect to revenue, data are collected on a cash basis by
the Inland Revenue Department and the Nontax Revenue Division. There is a Central
Paymaster Department that also provides revenue and expenditure data on a cash basis,
which is used by the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) to furnish a statement of central
government operations, (produced daily, weekly, and monthly) and these, in turn, are the
basis for the liquidity report on revenue and expenditure prepared by the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Some capital expenditure items are recorded by the Central Paymaster, but the
majority of them seems to be recorded only at the ministerial level. As there are also no

- 39 -

APPENDIX III

centralized records for receipts of external grants, capital expenditure has to be inferred from
partial donor information.
As the estimates for revenue and expenditure components can differ significantly among the
MoF, the Treasury department, the CBvS, and the Central Paymaster data, the authorities
have begun the process of streamlining the system of fiscal reporting, improving the
reconciliation process and standardizing the reporting format. There is a pressing need for
standardization of expenditure by economic classification and more coordination between the
MoF and other ministries for GFS compilation and reporting, as well as between the MoF
and the central bank. Since 1991, no data on central government operations have been
published in the IFS and no data are reported for publication in the GFSY.
For the rest of the public sector, the collection of comprehensive and consistent financial data
remains a challenge. The Netherlands has recently provided technical assistance in this area.
The actual number of public enterprises remains is unknown, and estimated at 120
companies, but some are dormant, others are social associations (for the blind, handicapped,
etc.) and many of them are small enterprises. Most of them, do not produce accounts on a
timely basis and their impact on fiscal operations, domestic credit and employment is not
known with any certainty.
Statistics on public external debt and external payment arrears suffer from non-transparent
reporting procedures across ministries. However, the startup of the Suriname Debt
Management Office in 2004 has helped centralize the flow and quality of data.
Monetary Accounts
An STA mission visited Suriname in January 2001 to advise on the country’s reporting
format on monetary data, to help prepare a template for more transparent accounting of the
assets and liabilities of the CBvS, and to advise on ways to prepare and promote a faster and
more accurate dissemination of monetary data. In response to the mission’s
recommendations, data on central bank activities are reported with lags of less than a month
since mid-2001. The quality of the accounts makes them suitable for publication in IFS.
To address remaining difficulties with the reporting of commercial banks’ data, STA
missions visited Suriname in September 2001 and February 2005. The missions helped
design new report forms to allow a proper sectorization of the accounts. Although still
experiencing some irregularities, the periodicity of the reporting has improved recently and
the time-lag was reduced to two months.
Balance of Payments
The balance of payments data are still prepared on a cash basis in Suriname. While trade data
are relatively reliable, data on services and capital inflows suffer from poor compilation
systems and procedures, misclassification, and poor procedures of reconciliation. In addition,
the ABS does not provide a sufficiently detailed breakdown of merchandise exports by

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

products and destination. During October 2002, a STA technical assistance mission assessed
progress in improving balance of payments compilation consistent with the Balance of
Payments Manual Fifth Edition (BMP5), and to design new survey and reporting formats that
would allow for detailed BPM5 classifications. A GDDS mission that visited Suriname in
March 2004 found that little progress had been made in implementing the recommendations,
although a proposed revision to the CBvS Act before parliament would make the reporting of
statistical information to the CBvS compulsory.
II. ADEQUACY OF DATA PROVISION TO THE FUND FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES
Data provision can generally be considered adequate for surveillance purposes. However,
there are serious shortcomings in the areas of the expenditure breakdown of national
accounts, exports, and informal sector activity, which significantly hinders staff’s analysis
and hampers the development of a reliable quantitative medium-term policy framework:
•

Real sector performance. Poor collection and presentation methodologies and long
delays in the provision of data compound the lack of data on the informal sector and
seriously undermine the accuracy of GDP estimates.

•

Saving-investment balances. As an expenditure breakdown of national accounts is
unavailable, the estimate of saving and investment balances relies largely on balance
of payments data, rendering problematic the estimation of private investment.

•

Exports. The lack of detailed data on exports by goods and destination requires
trading partner country inferences of exports and renders timely and accurate analysis
difficult.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 20, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Suriname
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation with Suriname.1
Background
Tighter fiscal and monetary policies helped stabilize the exchange rate and moderate inflation
pressures in 2003 and 2004. The fiscal deficit narrowed from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2002 to
near balance in 2003, while a tighter monetary policy helped to reduce inflation from 28 percent
in 2002 to 13 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in 2004. Concurrently, investment and employment
strengthened, and real GDP growth accelerated to about 5 percent in both 2003 and 2004.
The more stable macroeconomic framework also laid the foundation for the successful launch of
the Suriname dollar (SRD) which replaced the Suriname guilder in January 2004.
The policy stance became somewhat more expansionary in 2004. The central government’s
overall deficit widened to about 1.75 percent of GDP in 2004, owing to a substantial increase in
capital expenditure and a drop in domestic fuel taxes. Monetary policy also became somewhat
more accommodative, as the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) lowered reserve requirements
on domestic currency deposits and allowed commercial banks to invest part of their required
reserves in low-interest housing loans.
The financial system has become increasingly dollarized in recent years, reflecting the lingering
effects on confidence of earlier episodes of price instability, as well as regulatory changes
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2favoring foreign currency intermediation. The share of foreign currency deposits rose from
47 percent to 56 percent of the total deposit base during 2002–04, while the share of private
sector credit denominated in foreign currency increased from 42 percent to 54 percent.
The external current account deficit has remained wide, as imports surged in response to large
investments in the mining sector during 2003-04 and an increase in consumer demand.
While mineral exports have increased rapidly in recent years, exports from non-mining sectors
have been stagnant, affected in part by the relatively high level of the real effective exchange
rate. The large current account deficit has been more than financed by continued large inflows
of foreign direct investment, and international reserves rose by almost 3 percent of GDP in
2004. Weak, albeit improving, debt management and significant arrears on bilateral loans since
1999 have contributed to Suriname’s poor international credit rating.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their successful macroeconomic management in
recent years, and observed that prudent fiscal policies, combined with a cautious monetary
policy stance, had helped stabilize the exchange rate and lower inflation, and fostered a solid
growth performance in 2004.
Directors stressed that macroeconomic stability should remain a policy priority to strengthen
growth and tackle poverty supported by reforms to diversify the economy and improve the
business climate. They encouraged the authorities to resist pressures to relax the fiscal stance
in light of the upcoming general elections. Over the medium term, Directors underscored the
importance of establishing an institutional framework to help avoid procyclical monetary and
fiscal responses to terms-of-trade shocks that in the past had led to destabilizing cycles of
inflation and currency depreciation, and emphasized the need to reduce expenditure
inefficiencies.
In this connection, Directors welcomed the recent strengthening of the fiscal framework.
Looking forward, Directors suggested the development and adoption of a medium-term fiscal
framework to help cope with the volatility of revenue from mining operations and to broaden
the domestic revenue base in order to reduce reliance on mining. They also recommended
that steps be taken to amend the fuel pricing mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of tax
revenues to world energy prices. They noted that civil service reform and downsizing would be
critical for improving the efficiency of the public sector, which was large by international
standards, and they urged the authorities to accelerate the Inter American Development
Bank-supported project in this area. More broadly, Directors welcomed the statutory limits that
had been established for public debt, but cautioned that these limits appeared high given the
sensitivity of Suriname’s fiscal position to exogenous shocks.
With regard to monetary policy, Directors stressed the importance of maintaining firm control
over credit growth, noting that the strong growth of broad money in 2004 could threaten the
gains achieved in lowering inflation over the past two years. They encouraged the authorities
to follow through with plans to amend the Central Bank Act in order to define more clearly the
central bank’s scope and responsibility in the provision of credit to the government. Directors
also observed that policy implementation would benefit from being anchored more firmly,

-3possibly on a pre-announced monetary target, and by expanding the range of monetary policy
instruments.
Directors, pointing to the recent increase in dollarization, urged the authorities to take further
steps to protect the banking system from balance sheet risks. They welcomed the central
bank’s recent moves to reduce the difference between the reserve requirements on foreign
and domestic currency deposits, which had favored foreign currency-denominated financial
intermediation in Suriname, and encouraged the authorities to tighten prudential regulations
and improve banking supervision, with a view to limiting potential currency mismatch risks in
the system. Directors viewed that an increase in resources for banking supervision and staff
training would be
worthwhile, in light of the recent increase in nonperforming loans and continuing problems at
the small state-owned banks. They also welcomed the authorities’ interest in participating in a
Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors commended the successful launch of the Suriname dollar in 2004 and welcomed the
steps taken by the central bank that had led to the convergence of exchange rates.
They urged authorities to seize the present opportunity to move to a unified and floating
exchange rate regime.
Directors stressed the importance of the authorities clarifying relations with external creditors
and eliminating payment arrears without delay. Noting that Suriname’s erratic payment record
in the past had undermined the country’s creditworthiness and increased borrowing costs,
they welcomed the recent regularization of bilateral arrears with Germany.
Directors underscored Suriname’s continued vulnerability to external shocks and encouraged
the authorities to implement policies that would support a reduction in reliance on the mining
sector. They advised the authorities to simplify licensing procedures and promote a more
stable and rule-based climate for investment. They also suggested that the authorities begin
designing a comprehensive plan to improve the efficiency of state-owned companies and to
foster nonmining private sector activity, including through the privatization of the banana, rice,
and forestry companies.
Directors welcomed Suriname’s recent accession to the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). They urged the authorities to address the remaining serious data reporting problems,
particularly in the areas of real sector and trade statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) fform part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued afte
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board
in a particular case.

Statement by Murilo Portugal, Executive Director for Suriname
and Ketleen Florestal, Advisor to Executive Director
March 25, 2005
1.
The Surinamese authorities have achieved substantial progress on the
macroeconomic front during the past two years curbing decisively the negative trends of
2002. Careful and responsible macromanagement coupled with increases in the international
prices of minerals -Suriname’s most important exports- has led to economic stability, social
progress, and economic growth. Fiscal discipline and tight monetary policy allowed for the
successful introduction of the Surinamese dollar, the quasi unification of the parallel and
official exchange rates, and a significant reduction of the inflation rate to single digits, with
the monthly inflation rate estimated to be null in February 2005. Suriname is also on track
with most MDGs. A significant number of structural reforms to address vulnerabilities and
increase economic efficiency have either been implemented or are well on their way towards
implementation.
2.
Nevertheless, the Surinamese authorities recognize that the economy remains
vulnerable to external shocks, particularly due to its narrow production and export bases.
Furthermore, they believe that additional reforms continue to be necessary to raise the
efficiency of the public sector, to ensure fiscal sustainability, to encourage private sector
investment, and to strengthen banking supervision. While significant progress has been
made in improving the quality and timeliness of economic statistics, the authorities
acknowledge that further progress is also warranted. In that regard, they wish to thank the
Fund for the prompt delivery of technical assistance following the staff visit of December
2004.
3.
The Surinamese authorities have asked us to convey their determination to pursue
structural reforms. However, they believe that long lasting structural reforms require general
consensus not only on the thrust of the reforms to be undertaken but also on the timing of
their implementation. The coalition government presently in place believes that increased
uncertainty due to the coming elections pleads against major reforms. A renewed mandate
will send a powerful signal that the social consensus needed to accelerate the pace of
structural reforms particularly in the public sector is not lacking. Consequently, the
authorities have chosen to advance cautiously on the structural reform agenda. For the
moment, priority is set at maintaining a stable macro-economic environment
notwithstanding substantial pressures to loosen their policy stance.
4.
In public finance, the authorities consider as priorities public service reform, the
overhauling of the inefficient management systems of certain public enterprises and state
owned banks, and the reduction of the negative impact on fiscal revenue of the domestic
fuel tax system. Given this year’s socio-political constraints, the authorities are advancing as
far as feasible with pre-implementation measures. With technical support from the IDB and
the UNDP, a comprehensive roadmap for the strengthening of public sector management
has been drafted. The technical work achieved so far includes the redefinition of the
Personnel Act, the introduction of a Procurement Act, and the strengthening of the registrar
of civil servants. Technical assistance on the restructuration of the state-owned banks has

-2also been provided by IDB. Reform options include a shutdown of one of the state owned
banks and mergers.
5.
As a first step towards major transformation, public enterprises are being required by
the government to have more transparent financial management systems. Substantial
progress has been made towards the privatization of the banana, rice, and forestry
companies. With help of the EU, the banana company is being brought to a sound level
before privatization. The government is examining different options suggested for the rice
company by a consultant financed by the IDB.
6.
Fund staff warns against three major downside risks, which were extensively
discussed on the occasion of the Article IV visit in December 2004, namely (i) policy
slippages resulting from pre-election pressures, (ii) capital flight, and (iii) the high degree of
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks.
7.
It is pleasing to note that the risks of policy slippages at the eve of general elections
in Suriname did not materialize. The authorities have been able to maintain a satisfactory
fiscal performance complemented by prudent monetary policy. Budget execution and
financing needs continue to be jointly monitored weekly by the highest authorities at the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Suriname. The government has been able to
resist pressures calling for substantial wage increases for public servants. The authorities are
fully committed to continue respecting newly established debt ceilings (60 percent of GDP
for all public sector debt with a sub ceiling of 15 percent of GDP on domestic debt) that
have been fixed at realistic levels.

The exchange rate has been stabilized and there are no conclusive indications that
confidence in the new national currency, the Surinamese dollar, is waning. To correct the
bias in favor of increased dollarization and reduce the associated balance sheet risk to the
commercial banking sector, the reserve requirement on deposits in foreign currency, which
had already been raised to 22 percent in October 2004, was further increased to 33 percent
in February 2005.

Central Bank Independence is being strengthened. Amendments to the Central Bank
Act, which include the establishment of personal penalties including jail for central bank
officials who do not respect the statutory limits set for financing government deficit and
contracting external debt, are presently under debate in the Parliament. The Government is
confident that these amendments will gain approval and hopefully be signed into law before
the election day of May 25. Additional stringent prudential norms are also under
Parliamentary consideration.
10.
Several structural and conjunctural factors have impeded adequate debt
management. To address this problem the authorities created late in 2004 the Suriname Debt
Management Office and have gradually eliminated all arrears to multilateral creditors.
Suriname remains committed to honoring its engagements and is working with bilateral
creditors to solve pending debt issues. Recently, for instance, Suriname reached agreement
with the German Ministry of Economic and Labor Affairs recognizing some old contingent
liabilities arising from finance by Hermes to damage cases in the 1980s.

Amendments to the Bank Act and the law governing transfer houses have been
introduced to Parliament with a view to give more authority to the Central Bank to demand
information necessary to ensure the production of quality and timely statistics. Suriname has
also put in place anti money laundering legislation.
12.
Staff recommends immediate adoption of a flexible pricing mechanism for
petroleum products. While our authorities are convinced of the necessity to adopt a more
direct and targeted subsidization mechanism and decrease the vulnerability of fiscal
revenues to changes in the landed cost of fuel, they do not believe it to be wise to cause a
general price increase during this period of uncertainty.

Successful introduction of the Surinamese dollar and removal of the ceiling and the
floor on the exchange rate movements was achieved without endangering stability in the
foreign exchange market because careful attention was given to the timing of the change,
including a widespread public communication campaign. Similarly, civil service reform will
be implemented after careful planning so as to minimize social disruptions and to reduce
pressures on the unemployment rate. Likewise, the authorities do not see the scope for
removing in the short run the February 2004 measure allowing commercial banks to use up
to 7 percentage points of the reserve requirement to expand their mortgage loan portfolio.
However, the activation of open market operations to reduce the reliance of monetary policy
on reserve requirement remains a priority on the reform agenda.

Suriname is well aware of the limited life span of its gold and bauxite mines. The
authorities welcome the idea of setting up a Non Renewable Resource Fund (NRF). They
are already looking into ways of stimulating non mining production and diversifying the
export base while preferential treatment of their traditional agricultural exports (banana,
rice...) is being eroded. With technical assistance from the World Bank (FIAS/IFC), they are
investigating ways to improve investment incentives including reviewing the Investment
law and setting up of an Investment Promotion Agency.
15.
On behalf of the Surinamese authorities, we would like to commend the staff for the
excellent collaboration and helpful recommendations both during their visits in Paramaribo
and throughout the year while at the Fund’s headquarters. We would also like to thank the
staff for the candid assessment of the macroeconomic framework and a very helpful set of
papers on key economic issues.
16.
Finally, allow me to recall that the authorities are looking forward to Suriname’s
participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
