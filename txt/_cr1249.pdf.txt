STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 18, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Philippines is being affected along with other countries in the region by the
fragile global environment. But macroeconomic conditions are generally sound and the
authorities’ policy management is supporting confidence. The key challenge now is to
navigate through the period of global uncertainty to maintain macroeconomic stability
while building the foundations for faster and more inclusive growth.
Outlook and risks. Domestic demand should support growth in 2012, as public
spending picks up after a sharp decline in 2011, and the staff expects growth to rise from
3.7 percent in 2011 to 4.2 percent in 2012. The global economy remains a key downside
risk as spillovers could affect the Philippines through several channels, although the
authorities have built up policy space for a strong response.
Monetary policy has responded well to changing circumstances. Monetary conditions
are supportive of growth while keeping inflation manageable. Policy easing is not needed
at this time, but policy could be recalibrated if downside risks materialize.
Fiscal policy should provide welcome support for growth in 2012 as expenditures rise
from their unexpectedly low level in 2011. Over the medium term, the planned fiscal
consolidation should strengthen the ability of the budget to respond to shocks.
Expenditure is being reoriented toward key priorities for inclusive growth. Higher revenue
will be needed in order to attain these objectives.
Financial sector resilience has been maintained through the global turbulence in recent
quarters. But careful monitoring should continue of vulnerabilities from concentration
and interest rate risk, real estate exposures, and global spillovers.
Building strong inclusive growth is a key part of the authorities’ medium˗term
development plan. The focus is, appropriately, on both raising growth and implementing
mutually reinforcing measures to strengthen inclusiveness.

3.6 percent (y/y) during the first three quarters
of 2011. But macroeconomic conditions have
remained generally sound, with inflation within
the official target range, the national
government deficit low, the balance of

supported by robust remittances. On the
supply side, services growth has remained
strong, reflecting a continued expansion in
business-process outsourcing (BPO) and real
estate activity. But the export weakness has led
to a slowing in manufacturing growth, while
twin typhoons in September 2011 caused
extensive damage to agricultural output. For
the economy as a whole, the output gap has
now turned negative.

supportive of growth (Figure 2). The
authorities have unwound crisis-related
liquidity support measures and started to
tighten monetary policy since March 2011.
Real policy rates have turned positive and
reserve money has been kept in check by
partially sterilizing the rise in net foreign assets
through the BSP’s special deposit accounts
(SDA), which have risen to very high levels. In
recent months, amid elevated global
uncertainties and low core inflation, monetary
tightening has paused. Real lending rates,
however, are well below pre˗crisis levels,
interbank and short˗term government bond
yields remain below policy rates, and credit
growth is rapid (22 percent, y/y, as of
November). These monetary conditions have
not, however, led to inflation pressure because
of the emerging slack in the economy.

The outlook is subject to significant

downside risks that arise mainly from

investment may increase growth relative to the
staff’s forecast, but on balance the global
economy represents a clear downside risk.
Renewed shocks to global activity, or a
prolonged period of sluggish growth, could
have substantial spillovers to the domestic
economy through goods and services exports,
financial flows, and remittances (Box 1). At
home, low lending rates may continue to fuel
credit demand, and banks may face pressure
to loosen lending standards as excess reserves

Box 1. Philippines: Spillovers from the Global Economy 1/
As a small open economy, the Philippines is influenced by global developments through both
trade and financial channels. Weaker global growth causes demand for exports to decline, which in
turn also affects consumption and investment. The financial system has only limited exposure to
Europe and little reliance on foreign wholesale funding, but contagion could still occur through
pullbacks of credit by European banks to the domestic corporate sector or a retreat by foreign
investors from local equity and bond markets.
Exports, remittances, and portfolio and other capital flows are important transmission channels
for external shocks. The share of goods and
services exports in GDP is about 50 percent,

generally, the euro area and United States are

10 percent of GDP and, although they held up well during 2008−2009, a global downturn would hurt
the earnings on which they are based. Non˗FDI capital flows have increased in importance, driven by
portfolio inflows.

The authorities have used a varied

toolkit for managing external inflows to the
Philippines in recent years. The exchange
rate has appreciated in real effective terms.
Meanwhile, international reserves have risen
rapidly, including during the global financial
crisis, and are well above standard
precautionary metrics as well as the Fund’s
new adequacy metric. The BSP has sterilized
much of the reserve buildup in order to avoid
an undue expansion in monetary aggregates,

domestic-foreign interest differentials. The
authorities have liberalized controls on capital
outflows, prepaid some external debt, and had
in place for some years macro˗prudential
measures that have worked well. Effective
January 2012, the BSP raised market risk
weights on banks’ nondeliverable forward
(NDF) positions, which were considered to be
large in size and speculative in nature. The
move was seen as a macro˗prudential measure
to forestall systemic risk to the banking system
from exchange market volatility.

intention to follow a revenue-based fiscal
consolidation over the medium term that
nonetheless allows for a supportive stance
in the near term.3 Notwithstanding the rise in
the deficit in 2012, the medium˗term debt path
would still be lower than the original plan
envisaged, owing to the greater than intended
debt reduction in 2011. The planned
medium˗term consolidation would help to

On a cyclically-adjusted basis, fiscal policy would
provide a 0.8 percent of GDP stimulus in 2012.

Early actions to simplify the tax system and
broaden the base should complement the
planned tax administration measures, whose
full benefit is hard to predict and will take time
to materialize. In 2012, in order for the
budgeted expenditure and deficit objectives to
be achieved, an increase in revenue will be
required equivalent to 1½ percent of GDP. The
authorities estimate, and the staff agrees, that
tax administration improvements could yield
revenue increases equivalent to ½ percent of
GDP. Consequently, additional tax measures
are likely needed, such as measures to reform
excises, rationalize fiscal incentives, and
address inefficiencies in the VAT to broaden
the tax base.4 Such measures would also make
the tax system more equitable and easier to
administer. In this context, the staff welcomes
the authorities’ recent submission of bills to
Congress to rationalize “sin taxes” and
streamline tax incentives that would go some
way toward raising the additional revenue
needed.

A reform of excises on alcohol and tobacco (so˗called
“sin taxes”), for example, could potentially yield
additional revenue of ½ percent of GDP in 2012 and
1 percent of GDP in 2013.

Box 2. Philippines: The Effectiveness of Macroeconomic Policy Responses to Global Shocks
It is important for macroeconomic policy to stand ready to respond flexibly to changing
circumstances given heightened global uncertainties. A key policy issue is the relative strengths of
monetary and fiscal policy in affecting short˗term output developments in the context of the flexible
exchange rate regime. Headline inflation is also susceptible to volatile commodity prices. The standard
policy response to commodity price shocks, particularly in advanced economies, is to accommodate the
first round effects of food and energy price swings on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but not the second
round effects on other CPI components and inflation expectations.
The GDP impact of macroeconomic policies and the second-round effects of commodity prices for
the Philippines are estimated by an extended Global Projection Model (GPM) using Bayesian
techniques.1/ The key results are:



The short˗term impact of a 1 percent of GDP fiscal stimulus is slightly greater than the combined
impact of a 100 basis points change in the policy interest rates and lending conditions (measured as
the spread between the 91˗day T˗bill rate and the policy rate).2/ The impact of exchange rate
depreciation is relatively weak.

Global fuel and food prices can have a significant impact on headline inflation and significant
second˗round effects, which suggest a need to take account of the impact of volatile commodity prices
when evaluating the inflation forecast and the monetary stance.

Fiscal policy would be more effective than monetary policy in supporting economic activity in the
current juncture. In particular, a cut in policy rates would only have a modest impact of economic activity
without a concomitant easing of lending conditions. With T˗bill rates close to the lower bound and lending
rates already at historical lows, the scope for a substantial easing of lending conditions is limited.

Box 3. Philippines: Building Inclusive Growth 1/
Poverty in the Philippines has fallen in recent decades. Poverty reduction has, however, been relatively
limited owing to both relatively slow growth and a low elasticity of poverty reduction with respect to growth.
The low elasticity may owe in part to high and rising inequality, which reflects unequal distribution of growth
and regional development, rapid population growth, declines in the relative price of labor provided by the
poor, and limited access by the poor to social and financial services.
As the Philippine Development Plan 2011−2016 notes, a strong and sustainable rise in living standards
requires growth to be both faster and more inclusive. The PDP notes that growth has been slow compared
with others in the region; the benefits of economic and social progress have not been broadly shared; and
corruption and governance concerns have at times undermined the public’s sense of ownership and control
over public policy. It emphasizes infrastructure, governance, human capital, and social safety net as key for
strong and inclusive growth.
Rapid and sustained growth requires strengthening all three pillars of potential growth. Staff analysis
suggests that higher investment in better institutional quality and human capital, and a transition of economic
activity from agriculture to industry and services could raise potential growth in the Philippines. In addition,
redundancy costs are relatively high, and active labor market measures such as job training and search
assistance may be helpful to reduce mismatches in the labor market as well as to increase employment.
A set of mutually reinforcing policies will likely be needed to increase the inclusiveness of growth. Staff
cross˗country analysis shows that high inflation is detrimental to inclusiveness.2/ Greater productivity in
agriculture, possibly through better rural infrastructure and extension services, and a shift in labor towards
services, such as BPO and tourism, could help to reduce inequality. The relatively low share of education,
health, and pension spending in GDP in the Philippines also points to an important role for fiscal policy in
strengthening inclusiveness.

APPENDIX I: —DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.

The outlook for public debt

main vulnerability arises from exchange

dynamics is favorable. Nonfinancial
sector public debt has been steadily
declining from 96 percent of GDP in 2003
to 53.5 percent of GDP in 2010. Based on
the government’s medium˗term objective
of a national government deficit to
2 percent of GDP, public debt is projected
to continue this declining trend to
44 percent of GDP by 2016. Gross
financing need is also expected to decline
from 15 percent of GDP in 2010 to
9 percent of GDP by 2016. If the deficit
were to remain 1 percent of GDP higher
than currently projected or if medium˗term
growth were lower by 1 percent, the
decline in public debt will be more gradual
and debt levels would remain at around
50 percent of GDP through 2016. Given the
high share of foreign currency debt, the

rate risk.
2.

Projected external debt dynamics

are stable. In recent years, external debt has
steadily declined, from nearly 80 percent of
GDP in 2001 to below 40 percent of GDP at
end˗2010. Under the staff’s baseline scenario,
the external debt ratio is projected to decline
slightly, a result of current account surpluses.
Further, the debt dynamics appear to be
relatively resilient to various shocks: one˗half
standard deviation shocks to interest rates,
growth, and the current account lead to only a
modest deterioration in the debt ratios over
the medium term. However, exchange rate
volatility remains a vulnerability as a one˗time
real depreciation of 30 percent would entail a
14 percent jump in the external debt ratio
from its end˗2010 level.

The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free
floating, while the de facto exchange
arrangement is classified as floating. The value
of the Philippine peso is determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market; the
Bangko Sentral intervenes in the spot and
forward markets in order to smooth undue
short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate
and to strategically build reserves. The
Philippines has not introduced any new
exchange measure that could give rise to
multiple currency practices and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

The Philippines is on the standard 12˗month
cycle. The 2010 Article IV consultation was
discussed by the Executive Board on
February 18, 2011 (IMF Country Report
No. 11/59).
IX. Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) and Report on Standards and Codes
(ROSC) Participation:
MCM: The Philippines’ FSAP was conducted
during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP
missions visited Manila in October and
November–December 2001. The final version
of the report was discussed with the
authorities in June 2002. The associated FSSA
was discussed by the Executive Board together
with the Article IV staff report in
September 2002. The FSAP update mission
took place in November 2009.

PHILIPPINES

FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were
held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC
report was discussed by the Executive Board in
September 2002 together with the Article IV
staff report, and published in October 2002.
The update to the ROSC report was published
in June 2004.
STA: ROSC Data Module mission was
conducted in September 2003, and the report
was published in August 2004.
X. Technical Assistance:
An MCM resident banking supervision advisor
has been stationed in Manila since May 2003,
to assist the BSP in the implementation of a
new supervisory model. MCM TA in the area of
problem bank identification, management, and
resolution took place in March 2009 and,
together with TA on banking supervision, in
April-May and October-December 2010 and a
TA mission on stress testing visited Manila in
June 2009. The Japan Administered Account
for Selected IMF Activities inspection visit took
place in May 2010.
A STA peripatetic mission visited Manila in
July–August 2003, January–February 2004, and
February–March 2005 to provide TA in balance
of payments and international investment
position statistics and in implementing the
recommendations made by the ROSC Data
Module mission. An STA mission took place in
March˗April 2006 to assist the authorities in
compiling and disseminating government
finance statistics in accordance with

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. A
STA mission took place in August 2009 to
finalize a monetary statistics compilation
system based on the Standardized Report
Forms.
In the fiscal area, FAD has executed a TA
project financed by the Millennium Challenge
Corporation to improve the basic functions of
tax administration by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, in line with recommendations made
by FAD TA missions in 2005, 2008, and 2009.
The project provides for a resident tax advisor
as well as an extensive program of short-term
expert visits. FAD TA on tax policy in 2010
and 2011 assessed the Philippines’ tax system
and advised on a road map for a pro-growth
and equitable tax system. On public financial
management areas, FAD has provided TA on
spending controls and cash management,
including through a peripatetic advisor on cash
management since 2009.
An LEG legal expert visited Manila to discuss
anti-money laundering initiatives in
March 2002 and for the regional United
Nations Security Council Resolutions/Financing
of Terrorism Convention Project workshop in
July 2010.
XI. Resident Representative:
A Resident Representative has been stationed
in Manila since January 1984. Mr. Dennis
Botman assumed the post of Resident
Representative in January 2009.

ANNEX II: PHILIPPINES—IMF-WORLD BANK
COLLABORATION
(As of December 30, 2011)
1.
The Bank and the Fund country teams
on the Philippines led by Mr. Rogier van den
Brink, Lead Economist, World Bank, and
Mr. Vivek Arora, Assistant Director, IMF
mission chief, respectively, exchanged views to
coordinate the teams’ work during 2012.1
2.
The teams agreed on the Philippines’
main macroeconomic challenges. The key
policy challenge now is to navigate the
uncertain global environment to maintain
macroeconomic stability, create policy space
to meet future potential shocks, and build the
foundations for faster and more inclusive
growth.
3.
Maintaining macroeconomic
stability in an uncertain global
environment. Monetary policy has responded
well to changing circumstances. International
reserves and exchange rate flexibility provide a
cushion against external shocks while
facilitating the adjustment to sustained inflows.
The staff supports the government’s intention
to follow a revenue-based fiscal consolidation
over the medium term that nonetheless allows
for a supportive stance in the near term.
Achieving the fiscal objectives will require a
sizable tax effort. The financial sector has been

resilient to the global turbulence so far, and
the authorities have continued to further
strengthen the banking supervision framework.
4.
Building inclusive growth. The
authorities’ 2011−2016 Philippine
Development Plan (PDP) appropriately focuses
on strengthening infrastructure, governance,
human capital, and social safety nets for
building faster and more inclusive growth.
Implementation will be critical to raise fiscal
revenue to support these objectives, reorient
expenditure toward social and infrastructure
priorities, and strengthen the investment
environment and job creation. The current
World Bank Philippines Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) has an overall theme of
inclusive growth and five strategic objectives:
stable macro stability; improved investment
climate; better public service delivery; reduced
vulnerabilities; and good governance. The CAS
progress report (CASPR) updated the strategy
in April 2011. It confirmed that the objectives
remain valid and relevant against the PDP and
assessed that the implementation was
generally on track to deliver the majority of the
envisioned outcomes.
5.
Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified three structural reform areas
as macro-critical, in view of their central role in
achieving macroeconomic stability and
sustained inclusive growth: (1) raising
investment and pro-poor growth; (2) public
finance and social safety nets; and (3) the
financial sector. Table II.1 details the specific
activities planned by the two country teams

PHILIPPINES

over the period January 2012˗December 2012,
along with their expected deliveries, and the
division of labor.
6.
The teams have the following requests
for information and collaboration from their
counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept
informed of progress in World Bank’s
discussions with the government on
financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and
implementation of the development policy
loan.2 Review and sharing of analytical
work, in particular the annually prepared
Philippines Development Report (PDR),
would be welcome, in addition to follow
up from the 2010 FSAP, and on work
related to the reform of social safety nets,
public expenditure reviews, and public
financial management.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX



The Bank team requests to be kept
informed of the Fund’s assessments of
macroeconomic policies and prospects
and to coordinate closely the technical
assistance work, especially in areas such as
tax policy and administration, where the
Bank has an existing program in place, as
well as in public expenditure analysis and
management, where extensive Bank work
is ongoing. The World Bank would
welcome an opportunity to participate in
the 2012 Article IV mission meetings with
the authorities.

7.
No disagreement among the two
teams emerged on either the key issues,
challenges or on the division of tasks to tackle
these. It was agreed that further details on
collaboration, as necessary, will be agreed at
the technical level as work progresses.

A Concept Note Review for the second Development
Policy Loan was held on December 5, 2011. The IMF’s
Vivek Arora was one of the peer reviewers.

ANNEX IV: PHILIPPINES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 6, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As part of a World Bank-funded project, Improving the Quality and Usefulness of the Philippine
System o f National Accounts, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) rebased the national accounts
from 1985 to 2000. Continuing improvements include on-going efforts to fully implement the System of National
Accounts, 2008. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national accounts. These
include the coverage of the GDP and the statistical discrepancies in the GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides. The authorities are working on improving (i) the accuracy of the GDP volume measures; (ii) the
coverage of the public corporations sector; (iii) the accuracy of the quarterly GDP data; and (iv) the adoption of
benchmark techniques to reconcile quarterly and annual national accounts estimates. The NSCB is currently
participating in the IMF Statistics Department’s Project on the Implementation of the System of National Accounts and
the International Comparison Program, funded by the Government of Japan. This three-year technical assistance
project provides assistance to improve the quality of the national accounts and price statistics.
Price statistics: In July 2011, the National Statistics Office introduced a rebased consumer price index (CPI). The
updated CPI is compiled using weights based on the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Data from
the 2008 Commodity and Outlet Survey were used to augment the provincial market baskets. One important
methodological change implemented in the updated CPI is the adoption of the internationally recommended
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the classification of all items. As noted in the above
section, assistance will be provided to improve the quality of price statistics in Philippines.
External sector statistics: Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005, the
Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) created a Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate
on compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. Since
deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional channels
that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The authorities have introduced new data
sources, including the Cross Border Transactions Survey and administrative-based reporting systems to address
coverage issues, but challenges remain. The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about
70−75 percent of foreign exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict banking
secrecy rules.
Monetary and financial statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the
Fund’s methodology.
Government finance statistics: Provision of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Major areas for
improvement include detailed data for levels of the public sector beyond the national government as well as
transition of fiscal data reporting to the GFSM 2001 format. Fiscal Transparency ROSCs were conducted in 2002
and 2004.

II. Data Standards and Quality
The Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS) in August 1996.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Philippines
February 17, 2012
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic activity remains moderate. In the 4th quarter, GDP growth was roughly
unchanged from the previous quarter at 3.7 percent (year/year). Household consumption was
supported by robust remittances, and public expenditure picked up significantly as a result of
the government’s expenditure acceleration program launched last October. On the supply
side, typhoons disrupted agricultural production, but strong services and public construction
activity counteracted the effects on the overall economy. For 2011 as a whole, GDP growth
was 3.7 percent, which coincided with the staff’s forecast but was lower than the authorities’
expectation (4.5 percent−5.5 percent).
External headwinds are affecting exports, but the balance of payments position remains
strong. Exports continued to contract in December (by ˗20.7 percent, year/year), led by
electronics. Net portfolio inflows stayed positive in December and January. International
reserves rose to $77 billion in January (equivalent to 11 months of imports and to 5 times
short˗term external debt based on residual maturity). The peso has depreciated slightly in
nominal and real effective terms since December.
Inflation pressures have continued to decline. Headline inflation moderated slightly faster
than expected to 3.9 percent (year/year) in January, from 4.2 percent in December, largely
owing to food prices. For 2011 as a whole, headline inflation averaged 4.4 percent on
the 2000 basis (roughly equivalent to the staff’s forecast).
Citing external headwinds to growth prospects and a moderate inflation outlook, the
BSP cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points on January 19. The cut brought the key
policy rate to 4.25 percent. On February 2, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced
measures to rationalize reserve requirements. Effective April 2012, a unified reserve
requirement would replace the existing statutory and liquidity reserve requirements; the
reserve requirement would no longer be remunerated; and vault cash would no longer be an
eligible form of reserve requirement compliance. To offset the impact of this move on banks’
intermediation costs, the reserve requirement ratio would be reduced by 3 percentage points
at the same time.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Philippines
On February 17, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Philippines. 1
Background
The Philippines is being affected along with other countries in the region by the fragile global
environment. After reaching 7.6 percent in 2010, growth slowed to 3.7 percent in 2011. The
slowdown reflected a fall in electronics exports and lower public construction. Exports were
subdued by the weak global environment and by supply chain disruptions following the
March 2011 Japan earthquake tragedy. Public construction fell as a result of improved budget
processes that temporarily slowed down project approvals and also reduced costs.
Unemployment and underemployment remain relatively high, at over 7 percent and 19 percent,
respectively.
Financial conditions have remained supportive of growth. Real lending rates are well below
pre˗crisis levels, interbank and short˗term government bond yields remain below policy rates,
and credit growth is rapid (19.3 percent, year-on-year, as of December). These monetary
conditions have not, however, led to inflation pressure because of the emerging slack in the
economy.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Inflation pressures have continued to decline. For 2011 as a whole, headline inflation averaged
4.4 percent. Headline inflation moderated slightly faster than expected to 3.9 percent (year/year)
in January, from 4.2 percent in December, largely owing to food prices.
The financial sector has been resilient to the global turbulence so far. Banking sector indicators
remain consistent with the 2010 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) of the sector’s
soundness. Financial markets were buffeted during the period of emerging market stress in
August˗ September, but recovered in subsequent months. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
(BSP)’s recent bank stress testing exercise suggested that the banking sector is well placed to
withstand the direct effects of a range of shocks. The financial system has only limited exposure
to Europe but contagion could occur through pullbacks of credit by European banks. The
prominent role of conglomerates as recipients of bank credit and the high leverage in parts of
the corporate sector, call for a close monitoring of conglomerates. Rapid credit growth may
pose risks for lending standards and asset quality as the credit cycle matures including in the
real estate sector.
Fiscal policy has contracted more sharply than the authorities envisaged. The national
government deficit for 2011 (P 96 billion; 1 percent of GDP during January-November) fell
substantially short of the annual budget objective (P 300 billion; 3 percent of GDP) mainly
reflecting lower capital expenditure, particularly on public construction. In October, the
government announced a fast˗tracking of spending of about 0.7 percent of GDP on
infrastructure, local government transfers, and job training that has provided a stimulus to
growth in late 2011. However, for the year as a whole the staff expects the deficit to fall to
1½ percent of GDP, which would represent a fiscal withdrawal of 1.8 percent of GDP.
External headwinds are affecting exports, but the balance of payments position remains in
sizable surplus reflecting continued net inflows in both the current and capital and financial
accounts. Remittances, BPO exports, and capital inflows have offset the impact of lower
electronics exports. During 2011, international reserves rose by nearly $13 billion to
$75.3 billion (11 months of imports). The BSP forward book, meanwhile, declined by about
$11 billion, with most of the decline occurring in September when the Philippines was among
the Asian economies affected by the rise in global risk aversion and reversal of capital flows
from emerging markets. The episode led to a temporary drop in reserves and the exchange rate
and a jump in sovereign spreads. During 2011 as a whole, the peso remained stable in nominal
and real effective terms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for prudent policies that have underpinned a
strong recovery and supported confidence. Directors noted the outlook for the near term is
broadly favorable, but subject to significant external risks. In this context, the key policy

3
challenge is to safeguard macroeconomic stability while building the foundations for stronger
and more inclusive growth over the medium term.
Directors agreed that monetary policy has responded well to changing circumstances. They
considered that monetary conditions are appropriately supportive of economic activity and that
inflation is firmly in the middle of the target range. Noting that monetary transmission could be
enhanced, Directors recommended the swift approval of amendments to the central bank act
that would strengthen liquidity management and enhance policy effectiveness.
Directors supported the central bank’s policy of allowing orderly adjustments of the exchange
rate to market pressures. With official reserves well above standard precautionary metrics, they
concurred that reserves could be drawn down to mitigate the impact of capital reversals, if
needed. Directors also saw scope for further flexibility of the exchange rate in response to
sustained inflows.
Directors regarded fiscal policy as appropriately focused on supporting growth in the near term
while aiming for consolidation over the medium term. Directors welcomed the ongoing
expenditure reorientation toward social and infrastructure priorities. Noting, however, that higher
revenue will be needed to meet the authorities’ objectives, they supported the authorities’ efforts
to strengthen tax administration and recommended further measures to reform excises,
rationalize tax incentives, and broaden the tax base.
Directors took note of the resilience of the financial sector in a challenging environment. They
encouraged the authorities to continue monitoring potential pressure points, including
concentration and interest rate risks at banks, real estate exposures of nonbanks, and channels
for inward spillovers of global financial turbulence. More broadly, Directors recommended
further strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework as well as the AML/CFT regime.
Directors supported the authorities’ emphasis on building faster and more inclusive growth.
They welcomed the focus of the Philippine Development Plan on improving governance,
infrastructure, human capital, and social safety nets, as well as access to finance. Progress in
these areas will help to spur investment, boost growth, and reduce poverty.

Statement by Aida S. Budiman, Alternate Executive Director for the Philippines
and Ernando Santos De Leon, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 17, 2012
Philippine authorities would like to express their gratitude to staff for the fruitful conduct of
the 2011 Article IV Consultation. The focus of the Consultation on the challenge of
maintaining economic stability in the face of global uncertainty while building the
foundations for a more vibrant, sustainable and inclusive economic growth is indeed timely
and beneficial. Achieving a faster and more inclusive economic growth is a key priority of
Philippine authorities.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The Philippine economy continued to grow despite difficult external and domestic economic
environments in 2011. The country’s GDP grew at a modest pace of 3.7 percent in 2011,
lower than the government’s growth assumption of 4.5-5.5 percent for 2011 and less than
half of the 7.6 percent growth in 2010. A myriad of external shocks has buffeted the
economy since the beginning of the year, starting from the MENA crisis and the resulting
high oil prices, the tragedies experienced by some countries in the region with their resulting
supply chain disruptions, and the overall weakness of the world economy. In addition, natural
calamities in the Philippines affected agriculture and infrastructure in 2011. A silver lining,
however, has been the resilience in private consumption which continued to advance
strongly, indicating the strength of consumer spending despite strong external headwinds and
lower-than-program fiscal spending.
Macroeconomic conditions have continued to remain sound in 2011. Notwithstanding a fluid
environment, authorities have successfully kept inflation within the target range of
3‐5 percent for 2011 at 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent using the 2000-based Consumer Price
Index (CPI) series and 2006-based CPI series, respectively. At the same time, the healthy
external payments position of the country—indicated by a continued balance of payments
(BOP) surplus—remained a source of resilience for the economy. Meanwhile, the Philippine
banking system continued to be sound and robust, exhibiting steady asset growth, a growing
deposit base, ample liquidity, sustained improvement in asset quality, and above‐standard
solvency ratios. The cash operations of the National Government yielded a lower deficit
representing 1 percent of GDP due mainly to lower expenditures.
Authorities expect the economy to gain momentum, even as global growth continues to
weaken in 2012. Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 5-6 percent on the strength of
sustained public spending, timely start up of projects under the public-private partnerships
(PPPs), supportive monetary policy and robust remittances. Headline inflation is expected to
settle within the targeted range of 3-5 percent for 2012-2013. The fiscal deficit is anticipated
to increase to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2012 even as revenue continues to rise with the pickup
of expenditures after their temporary drop in 2011. On the external front, the balance of
payments is anticipated to remain in surplus buoyed by higher remittances and service
exports as well as capital inflows.

2
Macroeconomic policies
Strong economic fundamentals arising from sound policy management and commitment to
the reform process have engendered confidence of both domestic and foreign investors as
evidenced by positive business and consumer sentiment, capital flows and ratings upgrades
of the country and the banking sector in 2011. Responsible macroeconomic management has
also afforded authorities with adequate policy maneuverability to respond to external shocks
in the period ahead.
On monetary policy. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) remains faithful to its mandate
of maintaining domestic price stability while allowing room for non-inflationary economic
growth. The BSP, therefore, continues to be watchful of evolving price and output conditions
both on the global and domestic fronts, to ensure that monetary policy settings remain
appropriate.
In the early months of 2011, authorities started monetary tightening on signs of broadening
inflation pressures and substantial upside risk to the inflation outlook by raising policy rates
twice by 25 basis points each in March and May 2011. The BSP also raised the reserve
requirements by 1 percentage point each in June and August 2011 as a preemptive move to
counter any additional inflationary pressures from excess liquidity. These preemptive actions
have helped forestall inflation pressures. Subsequently, with demand-pull pressures expected
to ease on prospects of slower output growth both globally and in the domestic economy,
authorities decided to pause from their monetary tightening mode and assess the outlook for
inflation and growth in the second half of 2011. In particular, renewed uncertainty over the
strength and pace of the global economic recovery posed downside risk to the domestic
economy. While initial assessment suggests that there should be no immediate concern for
the observed uptrend in bank lending growth, such a condition required the maintenance of a
prudent monetary policy stance to contain any upward pressures on asset prices. At the same
time, authorities were also mindful of the remaining upside risks to inflation, including the
potential impact of strong net capital inflows on domestic liquidity, pending petitions for
electricity rate adjustments, and possible higher global rice prices.
Authorities would like to point out that since the time when the 2011 Article IV Consultation
mission was concluded in Manila last December 13, 2011, the overall balance of global
economic activity has tipped towards a further slowdown in 2012. Moreover, actual inflation
turned out lower than expected in the Philippines, along with economic growth in 2011. In
light of this, authorities decided to reduce policy interest rates by 25 basis points on
January 19, 2012 based on its assessment that the inflation outlook remains comfortably
within the target range, with expectations well-anchored. However, authorities remain
cognizant that strong capital flows and their impact on domestic liquidity as well as
disruptions in global oil supply continue to pose upside risk to inflation.
On fiscal policy. Authorities assure their unwavering commitment to achieve fiscal
sustainability within the medium term and create fiscal space that will allow higher
investment in infrastructure and social services. This commitment, along with the

3
improvement of public debt profile resulting from prudent debt management have been
recognized by markets and credit rating agencies.
In 2012, improvements in tax administration and the implementation of tax policy reforms,
including the rationalization of the fiscal incentives system and the restructuring of the excise
tax on alcohol and tobacco products, would aid in the attainment of the fiscal deficit target
which is equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP. In the event that these revenue gains are not
sufficient to meet the fiscal objectives, authorities will reduce non-priority expenditure or
speed up privatization to support planned spending. Authorities would reflect on other tax
reforms after maximizing the gains from improved tax administration and simplified tax
system.
On the expenditure side, with the new budget processes in place and greater transparency in
public spending, enhanced efficiency in the implementation of public projects will help
budget spending to meet the targeted level to boost domestic demand in 2012. In this regard,
authorities have nearly released the total budget for 2012 to implementing agencies as early
as January 2012. On the civil service wage bill, we would like to point out that the wage bill
is merely a part of the general objective to transform the Executive branch into a more
effective and efficient branch of government through the implementation of rationalization
program that aims to build a leaner and well-motivated bureaucracy.
On foreign exchange policy. Authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate system
whereby the determination of the exchange rate is left to market forces. Participation in the
foreign exchange market by the BSP is limited to temper sharp fluctuations in the exchange
rate for an orderly adjustment of the exchange rate to reflect current economic fundamentals.
Authorities would like to emphasize that in managing protracted surge in capital flows,
exchange rate adjustment and reserve accumulation are just among the broad range of
measures in their toolkit. There are prudential and regulatory measures that have been
effective in helping cope with the strong surge in capital flows and minimizing their negative
implications on the conduct of monetary policy and financial stability during the 2008-2009
global financial crises. Authorities believe that this range of measures remain useful in the
current setting. Moving forward, authorities will continue to monitor developments in the
international financial markets with the view to better understand the underlying drivers of
capital flows in the country to determine the appropriate policy responses to preserve
macroeconomic and financial stability.
On financial sector policies. Significant headway has been achieved in improving risk
management systems, strengthening the supervisory process, instituting good financial
governance, enhancing coordination among financial regulators, and aligning accounting
rules with international standards in recent period. These reforms have all contributed to the
continued stability and soundness--balance sheets kept growing, asset quality continued to
improve, and bank profitability continued to strengthen--of the Philippines banking system,
amidst global economic slowdown in 2011. It is for this reason that an international credit
rating agency has maintained a “stable” outlook on Philippines banks in 2011 noting that
Philippine banks are likely to remain in relatively good shape even with the lingering
uncertainties in the global environment.

The more recent banking reforms announced by authorities last January 2012 include:
(1) requiring stand-alone thrift banks, rural banks and cooperative banks to be covered by the
Basel 1.5 framework that upgrades them to higher capital adequacy standards (2) requiring
banks to set aside more funds to cover non-deliverable forwards or NDFs for “net open
positions” to reduce potential systemic risk and curb speculation (3) adoption of the more
stringent standards of Basel 3 by commercial and universal banks in 2014, four years ahead
of the timeline set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and (4) adoption of a
new set of enhanced standards on corporate governance in banks, as well as rules to
strengthen banks’ compliance systems.
Concerns have been raised about the potential spillovers from global financial disruptions,
real estate exposures, rapid credit growth and concentration and interest rate risk in the
banking sector. In this regard, authorities stressed that European banks operating in the
Philippines are liquid, have access to a large deposit base and have not displayed signs of
stress. Trade finance and dollar funding continues. Likewise, bonds and other instruments
issued from the euro zone and held by domestic banks accounted for only 1.4 percent of their
total assets as of June 30, 2011. While it is true that the Philippine banking system is not
totally immune to concentration risk due to the conglomerated construct of the Philippine
economy at large, the BSP has been resolute in instituting reforms to effectively mitigate
such risks. One step toward this end is to efficiently monitor and identify the potential extent
of exposure of the banking system to financial conglomerates through conglomerate maps.
Moreover, conglomerates’ revenue is well diversified, which mitigates concentration risk.
Authorities would like to stress that the banking system is not securities-heavy and interest
rate sensitive as banks’ holdings of debt securities constitute only 22.2 percent of their total
assets. Meanwhile, authorities continue to monitor signs of potential risks that rapid credit
growth may pose for lending standards and asset quality.
An important next step for bank supervision will be prompt Congressional approval of the
amendments to the New Central Banking Act (NCBA) that would enhance supervision by
providing supervisors with greater legal powers and protecting them from litigation, lifting
the remaining constraints of bank secrecy laws on examiners, further strengthening the
prompt corrective action and bank resolution framework and prescribing higher ratios for
individual financial institutions which are deemed to be exposed to more than normal risks as
the FSSA Update recommended. The amendments should also allow the BSP to issue its own
debt securities, providing a much-needed instrument to strengthen liquidity management and
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Building inclusive growth
Authorities acknowledge that while some progress had been achieved in alleviating poverty
in recent decades stronger actions and more sustained efforts in promoting inclusive growth
are necessary if poverty incidence was to be reduced significantly in the Philippines.
Authorities believe that to achieve inclusive growth, the country needs to attain a high and
sustained growth path, provide equal access to development opportunities across social

5
spectrum, and implement responsive social safety nets that would assist those who are left
behind by the character of growth. Authorities pointed out that building inclusive growth is a
key part of their medium-term development plan that focuses on five cross-cutting key
strategies, namely: (a) boosting competitiveness to generate employment; (b) improving
access to financing; (c) investing massively in physical infrastructure; (d) promoting
transparent and responsive governance; and (e) developing human resources through
improved social services.
In this regard, the 2012 National Budget is reflective of the desire of the authorities to
address poverty through greater focus in funding and fulfilling anti-corruption and good
governance, empowerment of the poor, inclusive economic growth, just and lasting peace
and the rule of law and integrity of the environment. The 2012 budget also sustains the
tradition of transparency, accountability and citizen participation in public expenditure.
Consistent with the goal to ensure ample education, public health and social protection for
the poor, spending on the Social Services sector receives a significant share of the 2012
National Budget. Significant portion of the 2012 National Budget also went to Economic
Services Sector to support rapid, sustained and inclusive growth. Taken together, these two
expenditure items constituted more than half of the 2012 National Budget. Moreover, publicprivate partnership (PPP) Strategic Support Fund has been funded for various PPP ventures
and for the preparation of business cases and feasibility studies.
On financial inclusiveness, the BSP has been implementing programs that facilitate access of
certain sectors of the economy such as the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the
agriculture sector to formal credit and financing. This includes microfinance which provides
the country's entrepreneurial poor access to collateral-free loans and various financial
services, including deposits, payment services, money transfers and insurance. The BSP’s
regulatory framework for the development of microfinance has been rated as the world’s
best, for three years in a row for pioneering in advocating use of responsible microfinance
while ensuring adherence to safe and sound banking practices. To broaden access by small
and medium-enterprises to collateral-free loans, the BSP has facilitated the development of
credit surety funds or CSFs. Authorities have also intensified Economic and Financial
Learning Program or EFLP which integrates all of BSP's educational outreach activities
across different sectors of the society. For the BSP, having financially-literate Filipinos is a
basic foundation in building a strong and inclusive financial system.
Final Remarks
Authorities see sustained growth for the Philippine economy in 2012 even as global outlook
continues to weaken. This optimism is derived from the fact that the economy has stronger
foundations to endure external shocks resulting from a long history of structural reforms that
they continue to pursue and home-grown sources of resilience. Authorities also see that the
simultaneous running of both monetary and fiscal engines will allow for economic recovery
to proceed at a more vibrant and sustainable pace.
