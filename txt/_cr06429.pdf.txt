Article IV consultation discussions were held in Moscow during June 14-26, 2006. The
mission met with Deputy Prime Minister Zhukov, Minister of Finance Kudrin, Central
Bank of Russia Governor Ignatiev, other senior officials, members of the Duma,
representatives of the business and academic communities, and the press.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Thomsen (head), Messrs. Figliuoli, Takizawa, and Zebregs,
Ms. Basu (all EUR), Mr. Balassone (FAD), Ms. Kozack (PDR), and Mr. Lohmus (MFD),
and was assisted by Mr. Mates (Moscow Office). Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director for
Russia, participated in the discussions.

•

During the last Article IV Consultation discussions, concluded on September 7, 2005,
Directors commended the strong performance of the Russian economy. However, in light
of the emerging capacity constraints and persistent inflationary pressures, they
recommended that fiscal policy not be loosened further, and that the CBR allow the ruble
to appreciate if inflation runs above the targeted path. Directors were concerned that large
oil revenues were causing complacency about structural reforms.

•

Russia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Staff is
consulting with the authorities to determine whether the restriction on current account
transactions identified at the time of the 2005 Article IV consultation has been removed
as part of Russia’s full liberalization of capital account and exchange restrictions.

•

Russia’s statistical database is adequate for surveillance, albeit with some shortcomings
(Appendix III). Russia subscribed to the SDDS in January 2005.

•

Russia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float with the central bank intervening
heavily in the foreign exchange market to limit nominal appreciation of the ruble.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Propelled by large terms-of-trade gains, GDP growth has accelerated and is
running close to potential. The demand pressures associated with the large terms-of-trade
gains are reflected in a fast real appreciation of the ruble, although more of this has come
through nominal appreciation during the last year. This somewhat more flexible exchange
rate policy, in combination with one-off measures, has allowed some reduction in inflation.
Still, inflation remains high as large unsterilized interventions to stem ruble appreciation
continue to fuel money growth. With capacity constraints looming, more inflation pressures
would emerge quickly in the absence of a change in the underlying fundamentals or in the
prevailing policy mix.
Outlook. Real GDP is projected to grow by 6½ percent in 2006 and 2007, the same rate as
in 2005. The risks to the outlook are evenly balanced and depend mostly on oil price
developments.
Policy discussions. The discussions focused on the following issues:
• A notable fiscal relaxation has been underway since early 2005, as calls for more
spending of oil revenues have mounted in the face of a ballooning oil stabilization fund
and upcoming elections. Fiscal relaxation will continue in 2007, despite the economy
being close to full capacity. The Ministry of Finance agreed with staff’s concern that
fiscal relaxation at this juncture is exacerbating demand pressures, but calls from other
parts of the government for more spending from oil revenues are strong as such revenues
continue to swell.
•

Current policies raise medium-term risks. There is considerable scope for increased fiscal
spending once demand pressures associated with the large terms-of-trade gains ease,
but—pointing to the rapid and ill-targeted relaxation during the last 1½ year—staff
warned about the risk of a gradually emerging non-oil deficit and a spending structure
that cannot be sustained if oil prices were to drop sharply, raising the specter of procyclical fiscal tightening and the real exchange rate overshooting its long-term
equilibrium. Staff, therefore, advocated that any increase in the non-oil fiscal deficit be
used for advancing structural reforms that would support faster potential growth.

•

Staff welcomed the greater focus on inflation control, but cautioned that additional
exchange rate flexibility would be needed to meet the end-2006 target, especially at a
time when demand pressures are exacerbated by fiscal relaxation. The CBR could not
commit to such flexibility and acknowledged that the inflation target might be missed.

•

Structural reforms outside the banking sector remain very slow. The authorities agreed
that structural reforms are behind schedule and claimed that high oil prices and robust
growth make it difficult to mobilize political support for reforms.

5
•

Staff expressed concerns about regulatory forbearance and warned that the favorable
macroeconomic environment might be disguising vulnerabilities. It commended the CBR
for its determination in withdrawing licenses of banks engaged in money laundering and
other illegal activities, but expressed concern about the limited number of deposit taking
institutions barred from the new deposit insurance scheme. The CBR agreed that a sharp
drop in oil prices could cause turmoil, but did not believe that risks were systemic.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.
Propelled by large terms-of-trade gains, real GDP growth has accelerated and is
becoming better balanced, but

about 7 percent, broadly the same

pace as before the 2004 slowdown.
2.
The renewed momentum reflects a recovery in investments. A confluence of
negative factors that suppressed investments in the second half of 2004—notably banking
sector turbulence, reduced oil sector profitability due to a tax hike, and the souring of the
investment climate during the end-phase of the Yukos affair—waned during 2005, against
the backdrop of the continued terms-of-trade gains. While fixed investment remains low, at
about 18 percent of GDP, a slow trend increase is discernible.
3.
But consumption is still the main source of growth. Consumption growth remained
robust even as real wage growth weakened when the economy slowed in 2004–05. This
partly reflected a change in the fiscal stance in early 2005 that—in contrast to 2004—allowed
a substantially larger share of the terms-of-trade gain to translate into higher demand, in
particular consumption, see below.
4.
Domestic resource constraints are
tightening, causing increased leakage
through the balance of payments and
continued strong real ruble appreciation.
Following six years with robust GDP growth
and low investments, measures of capacity
utilization are at historical highs. Staff
analysis suggests that potential GDP growth is
about 6½ percent and the output gap close to
eliminated (Box 1). Constraints are
particularly evident in the oil sector. Having

increased by about 10 percent annually through 2003, the increase in crude oil production
has slowed sharply, and appears now to have stabilized at 2–3 percent. This translates into a
reduction in the energy sector’s contribution to GDP growth of more than one percentage
point. The emerging resource constraints have been reflected in a steady increase in the
leakage through the balance of payments—imports relative to GDP in constant prices
increased by 3 percentage points in 2005, to almost 50 percent—and in a rapid real ruble
appreciation—9 percent (year-on-year) by June 2006.
5.
Labor markets are also tightening. The official unemployment rate has fallen to
very low levels in major cities (0.8 percent in Moscow and 2.2 percent in St. Petersburg) and
real wage growth has rebounded sharply since the beginning of 2005 and is now running at
more than 10 percent (year-on-year). There is evidence of large unregistered immigration of
workers from other CIS countries; fewer obstacles to internal labor migration than previously
thought; and substantial inter-sectoral mobility as industry and other slow growing sectors
continue to shed labor.
6.
Potential output growth reflects mainly large gains in total factor productivity.
Staff analysis suggests that the labor force
and the capital stock together only accounted

Box 1. Potential GDP and Output Gap
With an estimated output gap close to zero, GDP growth of 6½ percent or more will be increasingly
difficult to achieve without fueling inflationary pressures.
Based on a production function approach, annual growth of potential GDP is estimated at
about 6¼−6½ percent at present. Potential GDP is calculated as the level of output that is produced
when capital and labor are employed at their natural rates of capacity utilization (i.e. the nonaccelerating inflation rate of utilization) and TFP is at its trend. The non-accelerating inflation rate of
capital utilization (NAICU) is estimated by running a regression of changes in core CPI inflation on
several explanatory factors, including the rate of capital utilization, while the non-accelerating
inflation rate of labor utilization (NAILU) is estimated based on available utilization data from labor
surveys. 1 2 Trend TFP is estimated by fitting an exponential trend to the TFP that is derived from data
on actual GDP and utilization-adjusted levels of labor and capital. The estimation results indicate that
potential GDP growth accelerated during 2002–2005 and was driven largely by potential TFP growth.
Staff’s findings are in line with those of the authorities.
Estimates of potential GDP indicate that the output gap in Russia has been mostly eliminated.
The rate of capital utilization has risen steadily since 1998 and is currently close to the estimated
NAICU. The increase in capital utilization has been a key factor in the narrowing of the output gap in
recent years. The remaining small negative output gap suggests that the scope for growth above the
potential rate without an acceleration of inflation is becoming increasingly limited. However, the
results need to be interpreted with considerable caution because estimates of the output gap and
potential GDP are subject to a more than usual degree of uncertainty in an environment of rapid
structural changes such as in Russia. Data quality is also an issue, not least the estimates of capacity
utilization.

Inflationary pressures have eased somewhat, but remain strong. While
overshooting the 2005 end-year target of 8½ percent, headline CPI inflation moderated from
13½ percent in May 2005 to 9 percent in June 2006, before rebounding slightly in recent
months, to 9½ percent in August (year-on-year). This partly reflects a monetary tightening
and an attendant NEER appreciation, which has ensured that, by comparison to previous
years, more of the fast real exchange rate appreciation associated with strong demand
pressures has been brought about through nominal appreciation rather than inflation. The
decline in inflation also reflects, however, a good harvest, reduced duties on importation of
beef above quota, lower increases in administered prices, and a cap on petroleum prices.
While it is difficult to quantify the impact of these one-off factors, disaggregated data suggest
that it is likely to be non-negligible.

8.
Higher prices of energy and other primary commodities have strengthened the
balance of payments and reserves further (Table 2 and Figure 2). Gross international
reserves rose by $57 billion during 2005, despite large debt pre-payments, and by almost
$85 billion during the first seven months of 2006, to $267 billion.
•

The latest round of oil price increases is boosting the current account surplus
and masking the adjustment to the large terms-of-trade gains of previous years.
The headline current account surplus has increased to about 11½ percent of GDP on
an annual basis from 11 percent in 2005. But the surplus in terms of constant oil
prices is declining relatively fast, by 3¾ percent of GDP in 2005, as a result of rapid
import growth. Indicators of export competitiveness have however not deteriorated:
the real appreciation of the ruble has been broadly in line with the change in the
differential between productivity in Russia and average productivity in the U.S. and
the Euro area; unit labor costs have increased in U.S. dollar terms, but broadly in
parallel with other countries in the region; and non-primary commodity exports have
maintained market shares (Box 2).

10
•

Private capital inflows are rising. They amounted to a net inflow of $27 billion
during the year through mid-2006, compared to $7 billion during the previous year,
reflecting among other factors larger borrowing by Russian corporates and SOEs,
especially in the form of syndicated loans from international banks. The large
increase compared to 2005 partly reflects a recovery from the temporary compression
of net inflows associated with the Yukos affair. Moreover, FDI has finally begun to
rise, in terms of both gross and net inflows, although they remain low by comparison
to other emerging market economies. Yet, there has been only a limited improvement
in the overall capital account as the government has been taking advantage of the
swelling oil stabilization fund to prepay Paris Club creditors, by $15 billion in the
second half of 2005. Russia has prepaid another $22 billion in 2006, the remainder of
its outstanding debt to Paris Club creditors.

11
Box 2. International Competitiveness and Exchange Rate Considerations
Russia has experienced large terms-of-trade gains in recent
years, which have resulted in considerable upward pressure
on the real effective exchange rate. This has raised concerns
about Russia’s international competitiveness.

Russia’s exchange rate appears to be
undervalued. Estimates by the Fund’s research
department suggest that the undervaluation of the
real effective exchange rate is about 15 percent.
Another measure of exchange rate misalignment is
the deviation of a country’s relative price level from
the level that might be expected on the basis of its
relative income. This measure also suggests that the
exchange rate is undervalued.

Equity and real estate prices are rising sharply. The stock market had increased
more than 40 percent since end-2005 before tumbling by 30 percent in late spring, during the
turmoil in emerging markets worldwide. Since then, the market has recovered strongly, to
almost the same level as before the turmoil, and equity prices have doubled in real terms
since mid-2005. Real estate prices in the Moscow-region rose by 25–30 percent annually in
real terms in 2004–05, and have reportedly continued their sharp upward trend in 2006.
B. Economic Policies
10.
A notable fiscal relaxation has been underway since early 2005 (Tables 3 and 4).
The headline surplus of the general government has continued to increase during this period
as oil prices have risen sharply, reflecting marginal tax rates with respect to oil prices of
almost 90 percent. However, the non-oil primary deficit is set to increase by almost 3 percent
of GDP in 2005–06 as oil revenues are being used to reduce taxes and increase expenditures.
Thus, in terms of the combined net impact of changes in energy exports and the headline
government surplus, a negative impulse of about ¼ percent of GDP in 2004 was followed by
a stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP in 2005. A further stimulus of 2 percent of GDP is in
store for 2006, possibly more if the budget is amended, as is currently expected, see below.

Monetary policy remains accommodative despite some tightening during the last
year (Figure 3 and Table 5). Faced with a pick-up in base money growth as the government
began to spend more of its oil revenues and with inflation already running well above target,
the CBR modified its intervention policy and began to allow some limited ruble appreciation.
In nominal effective terms, the appreciation during the year through mid-2006 was 3 percent,
compared to a depreciation of about one percent during the previous 12-month period. This,
in combination with the increased output growth since early 2005, has entailed a limited
tightening of monetary conditions, halting the decline in interest rates. However, this change
notwithstanding, very large unsterilized interventions to stem ruble appreciation have
remained the prominent feature of monetary policy, and monetary aggregates have continued
to grow rapidly, with banking sector credit expanding by almost 45 percent during the year
through April 2006.
12.
Financial soundness indicators are generally favorable, although rapid credit
growth is beginning to strain bank liquidity (Table 7). Profitability in the banking system
is robust and has improved, even as foreign banks have entered the market and increased
competition. Capital adequacy ratios are at comfortable levels by international standards, but
have been falling since 2004 and, for some systemic banks, are now close to the minimum
requirement of 10 percent. This decline is in part the result of rapid credit growth, with some
banks finding it difficult to raise enough capital externally as their business expands,
notwithstanding strong profitability. Several banks are not meeting the minimum requirement
on the basis of international financial reporting standards (IFRS/IAS), which have yet to be
fully implemented.
13.
Concerns about regulatory forbearance and poor prudential data persist. The
CBR has moved decisively to close a large number of small banks involved in money
laundering and other illegal activities, but concerns remain about its enforcement of
prudential standards for the banking system at large. These concerns were reinforced by last

14
year’s admission of banks accounting for 98 percent of total deposits into the new deposit
insurance scheme. Although the new scheme catalyzed improvements in the banking system
and in regulatory practices, several shortcomings remain, including concentrated lending and
lending to related parties. Moreover, while official data show that the overall non-performing
loan ratio is low and declining, except for a considerable increase in past-due loans to
households, questions remain about the quality of this data, reflecting in part problems of
connected lending, accounting weaknesses, and corporate governance more generally. A
possible indication of underreporting of nonperforming loans is the fact that foreign banks
report considerably higher provisions against loans to households than domestic banks.
14.
Structural reforms are progressing only slowly. Although technical preparations
have advanced and the legislative and institutional framework have been strengthened in
important areas, actual implementation has been slow, not least by comparison to the
government’s own goals upon assuming office. This includes reforms of the health and
education sectors, the civil service and public administration, and the natural monopolies. A
case in point is the growth in the number of civil servants, which, despite the authorities’
intentions to reduce it, has increased by almost one third since 2001 and by 10 percent
in 2005. Meanwhile, the forced acquisition of Yukos’ largest asset by Rosneft and the
purchase of Sibneft by Gazprom have fueled concerns that the state is reassuming control
over this strategically important sector.
II. SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
15.
Demand pressures are expected to remain strong in 2006–07, most likely
intensifying (Table 6). Staff projects growth of 6½ percent in both years, slightly above the
consensus forecast, but close to estimated potential growth. Growth in consumption and
investment is expected to remain strong, possibly accelerate, consistent with the WEO
forecast of an increase in the average oil price of $16 per barrel in 2006, and a further,
smaller increase in 2007. These demand pressures also reflect a substantial impulse that is
still coming from the cumulative terms-of-trade gain of 11 percent of GDP during 2003–05,
as spending plans are adjusting only gradually to these gains, not least in the oil sector. The
increase in the oil price is driving a further rise in the current account surplus to above
12 percent of GDP in 2006. But as oil price increases start to taper off, the underlying
increase in the non-energy current account deficit will begin to be reflected in a reduction in
the headline surplus, to about 11 percent of GDP in 2007. The authorities will struggle to
reach their inflation target of 8½ percent by end-2006.
16.
The short-term projections are subject to notable uncertainty. The main nonpolicy risks pertain to assumptions about oil prices and GDP growth already running at or
above potential. The main policy uncertainties arise from the possibility that: (i) a
supplementary 2006 budget and the 2007 budget will entail a combined relaxation of the
non-oil primary deficit of more than one percent of GDP; and (ii) the CBR will not allow
sufficient exchange rate flexibility to meet the inflation target. While risks are, in staff’s

15
view, evenly balanced for GDP growth—in particular since the oil stabilization fund
mechanism provides a significant short-term cushion against movements in the oil price—
they appear to be skewed to the upside for inflation, as discussed below.
17.
While Russia’s external vulnerability is low, corporate and financial sector
vulnerabilities remain (Figure 4 and Tables 7–9). With international reserves almost four
times short-term debt, public debt low and declining rapidly, and a current account surplus of
11 percent of GDP, Russia’s balance of payments position is exceptionally strong, providing
the authorities ample time to undertake corrective policy measures in the event of severe
shocks. However, while there are no significant macro-economic external risks, the rapid
increase in corporate foreign borrowing in recent years, including by de facto state-controlled
companies in the energy sector, is a matter of some concern due to the still weak corporate
governance. Moreover, as discussed below, the banking sector remains vulnerable.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
18.
The overarching issue during the discussions was how to ensure that Russia’s oil
wealth is used to spur economic growth without fueling inflationary pressures and
exchange rate overshooting. Two key issues serve as reference points in this regard:
•

There is considerable scope for increased fiscal spending or lower taxation over the
medium term, once demand pressures ease. Despite the recent relaxation, the 2006
budget is still balanced at an oil price of about $30 per barrel, suggesting that Russia is
currently taxing and saving what amounts to large permanent terms of trade gains, even
under a conservative medium-term outlook for oil prices. An illustrative staff analysis of
the long-term spending envelope using a general equilibrium framework suggests that
this envelope could be relaxed by at least 5 percent of GDP over the long run (Box 4).1
An even larger increase would be possible according to a standard debt sustainability
analysis (Figure 5 and Table 10).

•

But excessive and ill-targeted fiscal relaxation could cause the real exchange rate to
overshoot its long-term equilibrium. Although the process of adjusting to the large
permanent income gain has begun, as reflected in the decline in the non-energy current
account balance and the notable real ruble appreciation, there is still ample room for the
this balance to decline further and the still undervalued exchange rate to appreciate
towards its new equilibrium. In this regard, and in view of the fast real ruble appreciation
and the notable increase in the non-oil government deficit that are underway, a key topic
for discussion with the authorities was the possibility of the exchange rate overshooting
its long-term equilibrium. This could happen if the non-oil deficit is relaxed too quickly

1

See Chapter I of the accompanying selected issues paper for a sensitivity analysis.

16
and by more than is consistent with the permanent income gains from the oil windfall.
Such risks would be further heightened if the relaxation is in support of spending and tax
cuts that do not boost potential growth and if flagging structural reforms prevent a steady
appreciation of the economy’s equilibrium real exchange rate.

Box 3. Policy Implementation and Past IMF Recommendations
Fiscal policy: A key policy recommendation by the staff has been to tax and save the oil
revenue windfalls as long as cyclical pressures persist. Fiscal policy had been broadly in line
with the staff’s suggestions until 2005–06 when the non-oil primary balance of the general
government widened by a cumulative 3 percent of GDP. Staff have also urged that VAT
reform be delayed or, at least, be revenue-neutral to avoid exacerbating inflationary
pressures. The authorities have decided to postpone this reform until 2009. Much of the farreaching structural changes with regard to the tax system and expenditure control are in line
with the considerable Fund TA advise given to Russia in these areas.
Monetary policy: Staff has recommended that monetary policy be primarily focused on
inflation control, unburdened of exchange rate considerations. Starting in 2005, the CBR has
begun to put somewhat greater emphasis on inflation control and has allowed some increase
in exchange rate flexibility. The change has, however, been limited and large unsterilized
interventions have continued to fuel rapid growth of monetary aggregates.
Banking sector reforms: The authorities have implemented many of the recommendations
provided by the large number of Fund-Bank TA missions since the 1998 crisis, but some key
problems remain to be addressed, including full IFRS accounting, concentrated lending,
lending to related parties, and the development of strategic plans for the still dominant state
banks. Staff has supported the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme on grounds that
this would provide the authorities with an opportunity to strengthen prudential standards,
abandoning the regulatory forbearance that has characterized supervision in the past. Staff
agrees that deposit insurance has catalyzed important structural changes in the banking
system, but remains concerned that regulatory forbearance lingers.
Structural reforms: Staff has called for structural reforms that boost long-term GDP growth
and has found the government’s long-term structural reforms program to be comprehensive
and well-targeted, not least its focus on improving the investment climate. However, staff
have also found that the implementation has been disappointing. Developments since the last
consultation discussions have reinforced such concerns.

17
Box 4. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability and Alternative Fiscal Policies
Russia’s large oil and gas reserves play a key role in its economic development, but also pose challenges to macroeconomic
policies. One such challenge is to avoid that current spending out of oil and gas wealth will necessitate a sharp fiscal correction in
the future.
Staff analysis suggests there is considerable room for fiscal relaxation over the medium term without compromising longterm fiscal sustainability.1 The analysis produced estimates of the additional fiscal room relative to actual primary expenditures
in 2005 under three alternative spending rules. These spending rules are consistent with a long-run (i.e. beyond 2055) equilibrium
in which there is no need for fiscal adjustment when oil and gas reserves are depleted. Under the permanent consumption rule,
expenditure is fixed over time in such a way that initially the government runs surpluses to build up financial assets, the return on
which subsequently finances the primary deficits that emerge when resources are depleted. Two variants of this rule were
simulated: one in which expenditure is held constant as a share of overall GDP, and one where expenditure is held constant as a
share of non-oil GDP. Under the third, the bird-in-hand rule, the government invests all hydrocarbon revenues in financial assets
and uses the return on these assets to finance the primary deficit, which is thus allowed to grow over time as more assets are
accumulated. Under each spending rule, there is room for fiscal relaxation over the long term, but there are differences in the short
and medium term. Clearly, relaxing more in the short to medium term limits the additional room in the long term. However, the
scope for fiscal relaxation in the near term should also be evaluated against the cyclical position of the economy. It may be
consistent with fiscal sustainability to relax in the near term, but not with sound macroeconomic demand management. Such
cyclical considerations are not taken into account here.
The data in the table are mainly for illustrative purposes. A more detailed analytical framework as well as better estimates of
Russia’s oil and gas wealth are needed to arrive at more precise estimates of the spending envelopes under the different rules.

The analysis is based on the following projections of government revenues from both hydrocarbon and other taxes. Revenue
projections are the same under all three alternative spending rules.

Oil and gas prices. In line with WEO projections, Russia’s nominal crude oil price increases to $72 per barrel in 2007 and
edges down to $65¾ per barrel in 2011, after which it is assumed to remain constant in real terms at the 2011 level. The gas
price is assumed to follow a similar profile, with the price from 2011 onward assumed to remain constant relative to the oil
price.
Oil and gas production. Oil output growth is assumed to pick up gradually over 2006-11 to reach 4 percent per year in 2011–
12, then decelerate gradually. After 2020, output declines. The stock of proven, probable, and possible reserves is assumed to
be depleted in 50 years. Gas output growth is assumed to be 2 percent per year until 2011, 1 percent per year for 2012–16, and
zero afterwards. The stock of proven and unproven reserves is projected to not be depleted for another 300 years.
Hydrocarbon taxes. The tax burden for the hydrocarbon sector as a share of estimated hydrocarbon GDP remains unchanged
at 57 percent (2005 value). Hydrocarbon tax revenue steadily declines from 14 percent of GDP (2005 value) to zero in 2106.
Non-hydrocarbon tax revenue as a share of non-hydrocarbon GDP is assumed to remain unchanged at the 2005 level.
Accordingly, it increases gradually from about 27 percent of GDP (2005 value) to 35 percent of GDP (in constant prices) in
the long run, in step with the rise in the share of non-hydrocarbon GDP in total GDP.

Chapter I of the accompanying Selected Issues paper discusses the results and the analytical framework of the analysis in more detail.

18
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
Fiscal relaxation will continue in 2007. Staff estimates, based on the
preliminary 2007 budget discussed with the mission, indicate that noninterest expenditures of
the general government will rise by 1½ percent of GDP in 20072, while the non-oil primary
deficit will widen by about ½ percent of GDP. This will bring the deterioration in the non-oil
deficit of the general government since the current fiscal easing began in early 2005 to
3¾ percent of GDP (compared to 2004). Officials explained that the relaxation is likely to be
larger as the 2006 budget is expected to be amended, although the size of the increase and the
extent to which it will carry over to even higher expenditures next year is unclear. Excluding
such an amendment, staff estimates that the combined impact of additional terms of trade
gains and changes in the fiscal stance will amount to a stimulus of 1¼ percent of GDP
in 2007.
20.
The planned fiscal relaxation reflects a trade off between short- and mediumterm considerations. Officials of the Ministry of Economy considered it to be measured in
view of the scope for relaxation over the medium term and of spending needs. They did not
believe that cyclical pressures were set to increase and found the relaxation to be, if anything,
too cautious. Officials of the Ministry of Finance, however, were concerned about such
pressures, noting that the relaxation during the last 1½ years had been associated with a
notable acceleration in the pace of real ruble appreciation. They believed that the further
relaxation would keep the ruble appreciating at a faster-than-desirable pace in real terms. On
the strength of the increased exchange rate flexibility, they hoped that inflation could
nevertheless be kept on the targeted downward path, but saw some upside risks. Still, in their
view, such risks remained manageable, and the proposed fiscal stance was the best that could
have been hoped for considering that the surging oil stabilization fund and the favorable
outlook for oil prices were fuelling calls for accelerated spending of oil revenues. Ministry of
Finance officials were more concerned about pressures for additional relaxation over and
above what was being planned, in the run-up to next year’s elections and beyond.
21.
The authorities were confident that the increase in spending was efficient.
Compared to 2005, non-interest expenditures were set to increase by 1¼ percent of GDP
in 2006–07 at the federal level, and by 2¼ percent of GDP at the general government level.
This included spending of about ¾ of a percent of GDP on a new National Priority Program
(NPP) in 2006–07, consisting of four programs aimed at improving services in the
healthcare, housing, education, and agricultural sectors. Much of this spending is for targeted
wage increases, which the authorities considered essential to facilitate reforms. A similar
2

Noninterest expenditures by the federal government are projected to increase by 1 percent of GDP. The
difference with the general government reflects an assumption by the staff that local governments maintain a
balanced budget.

19
rationale justified large wage increases in sectors not covered by the NPP, notably the
military and judicial sectors. While a considerable part of the increase was thus accounted for
by wages and other current expenditures, the authorities noted that the 2007 budget also
entailed a rise in capital spending.
22.
Staff expressed concern about the pace and composition of fiscal relaxation.
Since 2003, the policy of taxing and saving oil revenues had been key to preventing serious
overheating in the face of unprecedented terms-of-trade gains, and staff expressed concern
that the rapid increase in the non-oil deficit during the last 1½ years suggested that support
for this important policy was flagging. As to 2006–07, with GDP growth already close to
potential and additional large terms-of-trade gains in the offing, further fiscal relaxation
would unhelpfully exacerbate cyclical pressures. Staff suggested that any significant increase
in the non-oil fiscal deficit should be postponed until demand pressures ease. While
acknowledging the scope for higher fiscal spending or lower taxation over the medium term
and the need to balance cyclical considerations against the benefit of spending more on
reforms and investments that could boost potential growth, staff questioned the efficiency of
the increase in spending in 2006–07. It pointed to the notable increase in wages and other
current expenditures, and doubted the effectiveness of targeted wage increases in sectors
such as health and education at a time when comprehensive reforms in these sectors have
been put on hold. Overall, while agreeing that the implications of the fiscal relaxation would
be limited, provided the exchange rate remained sufficiently flexible, staff was concerned
that recent trends foreshadow a slow but steady increase in the non-oil deficit and the gradual
emergence of a government spending structure over the medium term that can not be
sustained in the face of a large drop in oil prices.
23.
The authorities are considering important changes to the tax system, the budgetary
framework, and the administration of the Stabilization Fund:
•

Oil sector taxes will be changed. While the authorities considered the tax burden on
the oil sector to be in line with the practice in other major oil producing countries,
they felt that Russia’s heavy reliance on taxation based on physical quantities rather
than on profits may discourage investments. To improve incentives, they are
considering a ten-year tax holiday for new oil fields in East Siberia and offshore and
tax rebates for existing oil fields that are more than 80 percent depleted. Staff
cautioned that this administratively complex scheme could exacerbate inherent
compliance problems and instead suggested to improve incentives through
accelerated depreciation. The authorities felt that staff’s alternative proposal suffered
from similar compliance problems as it would be difficult to monitor the investments
upon which depreciation allowances would depend.

•

VAT reforms are on hold. Despite strong pressures for a cut in the general rate,
VAT reforms have been postponed, partly because of concerns about political support
in the run-up to the elections for offsetting a cut in the general rate with an

20
elimination of the preferential rate and of exemptions. Staff welcomed the
postponement of the reduction in the rate, reiterating that the VAT is among the least
distortionary taxes in Russia. A stronger case could in the staff’s view be made for
reform of the Unified Social Tax (UST), which introduces a large wedge between net
and gross salaries. Noting that the cut in the UST tax rate in 2005 had failed to
improve compliance, the authorities explained that further reforms of this tax were
not on the agenda.
•

The authorities are considering changes that could buttress the fiscal policy
framework. The Ministry of Finance has gained some support for suggestions to
more explicitly take into account the implications for the non-oil deficit when
determining the headline budget limit. Moreover, starting in 2007, the federal budget
is being framed in the context of rolling three-year budgets with a detailed
expenditure breakdown. Staff agreed that these initiatives could help focus budgetary
discussions on productive use of the oil wealth in a medium-term context, especially
if linked to implementation of the structural reform program. Nevertheless, staff
cautioned that the rolling three-year budget framework, while in principle providing a
stronger anchor for the main parameters of the annual budgets, would not be effective
if these budgets are regularly revised, as it has been the case in recent years. The
authorities also explained the new investment strategy for the Stabilization Fund,
according to which its balance at the CBR is to be converted from rubles into foreign
currency, with a remuneration determined by the yield on a basket of first-rate foreign
sovereign bonds. As this merely entails a redenomination of the CBR’s liabilities to
the Stabilization Fund, it will not affect the foreign exchange position of the CBR.
B. Monetary Policy

24.
CBR officials were confident that inflation will continue to decline. They believed
that the planned fiscal relaxation discussed with the mission is consistent with a downward
inflation path that will get close to the official 8½ percent target for end-2006 and to the
lower end of the 6½–8 percent target range for end-2007. They stressed that the tightening of
monetary policy during the past 12–15 months reflected a gradual shift toward increased
focus on inflation reduction, and a heightened political awareness that some ruble
appreciation is inevitable in the current circumstances. They cautioned, however, that
political support for exchange rate flexibility is still fragile, and that an increase in
inflationary pressures resulting from an even larger fiscal relaxation than currently planned
would seriously test such support. In view of this, they were not prepared to give priority to
meeting the inflation target by committing to scale back interventions as needed to meet this
target.
25.
Staff welcomed the renewed decline in inflation, but cautioned that additional
exchange rate flexibility would be needed to consolidate and extend this decline. It
commended the CBR for the somewhat more flexible exchange rate policy, recognizing that

21
even this very limited change had been politically difficult, partly reflecting the sizeable
negative wealth effect of ruble appreciation due to large foreign exchange savings. Staff
noted, however, that much of the reduction in inflation had been due to one-off supply-side
measures and that monetary policy remained very accommodative. With fiscal policy set to
exacerbate strong cyclical pressures, staff believed that inflation would exceed the end-2006
target unless the CBR allowed accelerated appreciation. In any case, in view of the
uncertainties affecting the short-term outlook, the CBR should stand ready to scale back its
interventions and allow the ruble to appreciate as needed to meet the inflation target.
Responding to the CBR’s reluctance to commit to this, staff cautioned that the risk to
inflation is rising as slack in the economy is being soaked up. Staff reiterated that the CBR
should seek to strengthen confidence in its determination to reduce inflation by refraining
from announcing exchange rate targets, not least by avoiding to set real exchange rate targets
in its annual forward-looking report on monetary policy. While agreeing that formal inflation
targeting is still premature, staff also suggested that the CBR could strengthen its monetary
policy framework by focusing on a continuous inflation path rather than an end-year target.
26.
Looking beyond the near-term, CBR officials were concerned about their ability
to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system. They noted that liquidity injections had
almost entirely resulted from foreign exchange interventions in recent years, and believed
that they did not have the instruments necessary to provide sufficient credit through the
central bank’s domestic window in case the current account surplus waned. They were,
therefore, considering to expand the range of collateral to include high-rated corporate paper.
Staff urged the CBR to exercise great caution in refinancing through use of corporate
collateral. It also argued that a gradual reduction in the current account surplus could likely
be offset by additional capital inflows, attracted by the stable macroeconomic environment,
robust growth, and limited external vulnerability. In this regard, it welcomed the recent
initiative to liberalize the remaining capital account restrictions.3

3

In the context of the 2005 Article IV Consultation, staff determined that Russia maintained only one exchange
restriction under Article VIII. This exchange restriction arose from the provision of an unremunerated reserve
requirement for the payment of commission and the compensation of expenses when acquiring some foreign
securities. (The reserve requirement gave rise to an exchange restriction to the extent that the commission or
compensation of expenses paid by a resident is for the remuneration of services provided by nonresidents,
because it then interferes with payments for a current international transaction). With the abolition of capital
account restrictions implemented on July 1, 2006, the requirement to make unremunerated reserves were also
abolished. However, staff is now ascertaining whether this abolition also applies to the payments of
commissions or expenses related to the purchase of external securities acquired before the effectiveness date of
the new law (i.e., July 1, 2006) as the new provisions are somewhat ambiguous on the issue. Clarification of the
matter from the authorities is imminent.

22
C. Banking Sector
27.
CBR officials regarded recent developments in the banking system as favorable.
They noted the robust profitability and explained that stricter prudential requirements—
spurred by the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme—have fostered transparency and
buttressed resiliency. They considered the high rates of credit growth as generally healthy
and posing limited risk to the system, since the financial sector is still relatively small and
household and corporate indebtedness is still comparatively low. They also noted that there
were no indications of banking system stability being jeopardized, as attested by low and
declining non-performing loan ratios. Nevertheless, they acknowledged that this expansion
warrants close monitoring. They were also carefully watching the decline in the
capitalization rate in the banking system, although it is still high by international comparison.
A planned increase in the minimum capital requirement to Euro 5 million effective
from 2007 was expected to support bank consolidation.
28.
CBR officials explained that banking supervision had continued to improve and
considered the regulatory framework to be broadly adequate. The strengthening of
prudential regulations in 2004–05 had enabled them to withdraw a large number of banking
licenses. They planned to further strengthen prudential oversight by tightening enforcement
of capital adequacy ratio requirements and broadening the definition of related party lending.
More generally, officials were satisfied that the current legislative framework provides them
with sufficient authority to intervene in commercial banks, including by removing bank
management. One remaining concern was the CBR’s still limited ability to impose
bankruptcy on commercial banks.
29.
CBR officials found that risks of a systemic crisis remain low. Stress tests
conducted by the CBR suggest that the system is resilient to large, but plausible, shocks. The
pessimistic scenario assumes shocks similar to the 1998 crisis and no economic growth. For
the 200 largest banks, total losses would amount to 2.9 percent of GDP under this scenario.
In view of these findings, CBR officials believed that banks are generally well capitalized
and sufficiently provisioned. Since profitability and asset quality are also good, they
considered the possibility of a systemic crisis as remote, although episodes of turbulence as
in 2004 cannot be ruled out.
30.
Staff welcomed the improvements in banking supervision, but cautioned that
weaknesses remain. It agreed that the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme had been
a step forward, not least because banks had strived to improve their operations ahead of
entering the admission process. However, noting that the withdrawals of licenses mostly
related to infringement of money laundering and capital control regulations, and that banks
accounting for only a negligible share of deposits had been denied access, staff reiterated its
concern about regulatory forbearance. Pointing to the continued delays in adopting IFRS,
dealing effectively with connected lending, and addressing problems of corporate
governance more generally, staff also questioned the quality of data on loan loss provisions

23
and the value of collateral. Against this background, and considering the favorable
macroeconomic environment at this time, staff was concerned that stress tests might
underestimate potential vulnerabilities.
31.
Staff recommended a further strengthening of supervision. Priority should be
given to supervising banks on a consolidated basis, thoroughly assessing internal credit-risk
models, and ensuring that banks maintain adequate capital levels to cover direct and indirect
risks in their portfolios. A swift move to full IFRS reporting was important in this regard.
The legal and regulatory basis for supervision should also be reinvigorated by: (i) widening
the definition of connected parties; (ii) reinforcing the powers of financial supervisors to
conduct fit-and-proper tests for owners and managers; (iii) improving transparency of bank
ownership; and (iv) strengthening non-bank financial sector supervision. It was agreed that
the Financial Sector Assessment Program Update scheduled for early 2007 would provide a
timely opportunity for an in-depth review of vulnerabilities.
D. Long-Term Growth Prospects and Structural Reforms
32.
Russia’s long-term growth prospects hinge on an improvement in the investment
climate. The authorities concurred with staff’s analysis that TFP had been the main driver of
potential output growth in recent years, while the contribution of capital accumulation had
been negligible. They also noted that labor force growth was becoming increasingly
constrained by Russia’s demographics. Looking forward, there was agreement that scope for
realizing large TFP gains remained, although the authorities were somewhat more optimistic
in this regard than staff. There was also agreement, however, that Russia would need to boost
investment from the current low levels in order to sustain strong growth in potential GDP
over the long run. In this connection, the authorities pointed to the need to strengthen
infrastructure—especially power generation and the pipeline network, where bottlenecks
were already now becoming evident—in addition to advancing the structural reform agenda
more generally.
33.
The authorities pointed to recent advances in reforms. These include: (i) energy
sector reform, with the imminent break-up of RAO UES and steps to attract more private
investment; (ii) judicial reform, with the drafting of a new law to enhance the independence
of judges and the transparency of rulings; and (iii) administrative reforms, with the adoption
of an action plan for streamlining and improving the quality of government services. The
authorities also pointed to several measures to improve incentives for foreign investment in
Russia, including the promulgation of the law on concession agreements and the creation of
special economic zones. Other important initiatives affecting competition and the business
climate include planned changes to: (i) the law on tax administration, aimed at reducing
excessive discretionary powers of tax inspectors, among other objectives; (ii) taxation of the
oil sector, to improve investment incentives (paragraph 23); and (iii) the subsoil and strategic
sectors law, to clarify modalities for foreign investment, including ceilings on foreign
ownership, in particular in the natural resource sectors. The authorities agreed that

24
uncertainties regarding the latter needed to be resolved quickly as investors were in doubt
about the government’s intentions.
34.
Acknowledging that important changes had taken place, staff found that overall
progress remained disappointing, not least in view of the very favorable environment.
Staff welcomed the decision to speed up the long-delayed reforms of the electricity sector
and agreed that judicial and administrative reform would be key to improving the investment
climate over the long run. It noted, however, that several of the changes mentioned by the
authorities were not part of comprehensive reforms, and it felt that the focus continued to be
on changing the legislative and regulatory frameworks, while actual implementation was still
slow. The authorities acknowledged that it had proven difficult to mobilize political support
for implementation as high oil prices and robust growth appear to foster complacency.
35.
Staff urged the authorities to give priority to reforms that are important for the
investment climate. Key reforms in this regard are the restructuring of natural monopolies
and the streamlining and strengthening of the public administration and civil service. Such
reforms would, in turn, need to be carefully sequenced with other comprehensive reforms of
the communal services, military, judiciary, health, and education sectors. Staff raised
concerns about the increased state ownership in the oil sector, questioning whether this
would allow this sector to regain growth momentum and again become an important source
of GDP growth. It felt that the poor performance of the state controlled gas sector was a
sobering reminder in this regard.
36.
The authorities had expected early WTO accession. However, Russia has yet to
conclude bilateral agreements with four countries, including the United States. Key
outstanding issues related to: (i) procedures and measures under Russian legislation for
veterinarian control, an issue that is also outstanding in multilateral negotiations and has
been at the heart of recent trade disputes with several neighboring countries; and (ii) the
application to the service sector of WTO rules for state trading companies, which would in
particular affect Gazprom and Transneft. The authorities were confident that other
substantive issues had been successfully resolved, and that good progress was being made in
addressing concerns about the protection of intellectual property rights. Staff welcomed this
progress, noting that WTO accession could help catalyze reforms and enterprise
restructuring.
37.
The authorities explained that a number of new restrictions on imports from
neighboring countries had been imposed for health reasons. Staff encouraged the
authorities to adhere to a transparent process for imposing such restrictions and to seek a
rapid resolution of disputes, noting that these restrictions have a significant adverse impact

took note of staff’s concerns.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
While oil prices have clearly been a major driver of the economy, the supply
response has been impressive. Even though the economy may struggle to maintain
satisfactory growth if oil prices dropped sharply, the private sector has taken advantage of
the large external inflows associated with the high oil price to upgrade equipment and
technologies and to expand into new activities. These developments are being reflected at the
macro level in strong growth in productivity, real wages, and consumption, and, as such, the
oil windfall has helped to improve the efficiency and growth potential of the Russian
economy.
39.
However, long-run growth prospects depend on progress in strengthening the
investment climate and initiating delayed reforms. The strong growth performance is
being driven largely by increases in total factor productivity rather than by rising investment
and employment levels. This reflects the still significant scope for productivity gains by
upgrading equipment through limited investments and by reallocating resources to more
dynamic sectors. With such catch-up potential not yet exhausted and oil prices likely to
remain high—and with the stabilization fund providing much cushion in case they do not—
near-term growth prospects are good, even without major changes in the investment climate.
But the catch-up potential will inevitably start to diminish, at which point potential growth
will become increasingly dependent on raising investments from their low level. Russia’s
unfavorable demographic trends, which suggest that the labor force will soon start declining,
lend added urgency to the need for improving the investment climate. It is from this longterm perspective that staff considers recent developments to be less reassuring.
40.
The pace of economic reforms is disappointing. Improving the investment climate
will require reinvigorating reforms that are currently stalled or moving only very slowly, in
particular reforms of the highly inefficient and under-capitalized natural monopolies, and
Russia’s overreaching civil service and public administration. These, in turn, must be
carefully sequenced with a broad range of other reforms many of which are also advancing in
a hesitant and piecemeal fashion. Since most of these reforms will be socially sensitive, they
should be advanced now while high energy prices and large productivity gains are boosting
growth and real incomes. And while many of them will be costly to the budget, not least
because of the need to alleviate associated social problems, this cost is well within the scope
for fiscal relaxation over the medium term, suggesting that Russia’s oil wealth offers an
enviable opportunity to accelerate reforms. It is in view of this favorable environment that
Russia should set an ambitious reform agenda for itself and that the somewhat fitful pace to
date is disappointing.
41.
Growth prospects depend much on the strategically important oil and gas sector.
Its contribution to GDP growth has declined in recent years. Changes to the tax regime
designed to improve investment incentives in this sector are therefore welcomed, but the
increased state ownership in the oil sector give rise to concern about its future dynamism.

26
Such concerns are illustrated by the way in which private Russian oil companies took
advantage of the steady rise in energy prices from 1999 to increase investments—achieving a
sharp reversal of the decade-long contraction in output—a development that stands in stark
contrast to the virtual stagnation in the state-controlled gas sector during the same period.
There is a risk that the energy sector might not succeed in again becoming a key engine of
growth if the state retains a strong presence.
42.
The banking sector is strengthening but significant vulnerabilities remain.
Profitability in the banking sector is strong and improving, and direct exposures to market
risks are low. However, banking sector risk management is still weak. Moreover, while the
CBR’s plan for bringing prudential standards and requirements in line with international best
practices is generally ambitious, and the supervisory framework is strengthening, concerns
remain about implementation. In particular, while the CBR has been admirably determined to
withdraw licenses in case of infringement of anti-money laundering and capital control
provisions, the very limited number of deposit-taking institutions barred from deposit
insurance has reinforced concerns about regulatory vigilance. In this context, the favorable
macroeconomic environment could be masking underlying vulnerabilities.
43.
The fiscal relaxation is excessive. The policy of taxing and saving oil revenues has
served Russia well, and the rapid rise in the non-oil deficit now underway raises concerns
about a premature relaxation of this policy. The relaxation in store for 2006-07, when
cyclical pressures are set to remain strong, and possibly increase, is likely to cause inflation
to exceed the targeted path and keep the pace of real ruble appreciation well above what is
politically palatable. While well-targeted expenditures could boost long-term growth, the
current relaxation does not appear efficient as much of it is supporting higher wages and
other current expenditures. More generally, staff is concerned about the effectiveness of the
rapid increase in the spending of oil wealth during a period when the government is
struggling to reinvigorate its structural reform program.
44.
The improved inflation performance is much welcomed, but more exchange rate
flexibility is needed for the progress to be sustained. While the decline in inflation partly
reflects one-off supply-side factors, it also owes much to the increased willingness to allow
more of the inevitable real exchange rate appreciation associated with strong demand
pressures to take place through nominal appreciation rather than inflation. However,
exchange rate flexibility is still limited. Unsterilized interventions continue to cause a very
accommodative monetary policy, and staff believes that an accelerated pace of ruble
appreciation would be required to reach the end-2006 inflation target. Looking beyond the
current year, the CBR should be mindful of the fact that tensions between short- and
medium-term fiscal objectives are likely to persist, suggesting that fiscal policy is set to
continue to exacerbate cyclical pressures. In such an environment, a policy of resisting the
attendant ruble appreciation imparts a potentially destabilizing inflationary bias to the macroeconomic policy mix. In this context, the CBR should give explicit priority to keeping

27
inflation on a downward path by stating that it stands ready to scale back interventions and
allow ruble appreciation if needed to keep to this path.
45.
Overall, risks lie mainly in the medium term. While macroeconomic tensions are
likely to rise in the short term, a major deterioration is unlikely and risks are limited. Indeed,
while the adverse impact of entrenched, high inflation would deserve greater policy attention,
it is reassuring that the authorities have clearly demonstrated no tolerance for rising inflation
and have taken corrective actions if an increase gets underway. Staff’s main concern is with
the pace of the fiscal relaxation and real ruble appreciation against the backdrop of strong
pressure for higher public sector wages and limited support for reforms. In terms of fiscal
policy, the risk is of the gradual emergence of a non-oil deficit and a structure of public
spending that cannot be sustained with oil prices at their long-term trend. Thus,
notwithstanding that both the non-oil deficit and real exchange rate are currently below their
long-term levels, a broad reinvigoration of reforms is needed to prevent the overshooting of
these levels.
46.
From the perspective of imbalances in the global economy, the main concern is
with the investment climate in the energy sector. Considering Russia’s vast oil and gas
reserves, policy changes that would reverse the decline in output growth could have a
significant impact on world energy prices over the medium term, contributing importantly to
reducing global imbalances.
47.
It is recommended that Russia’s next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (US dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (US dollar terms, in percent)

APPENDIX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP

1.
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Bank’s Board in
June 2002, and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) was approved in April 2005. A new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) until 2009 is under preparation in 2006. Overall, the
Bank strategy envisages continued emphasis on support to implementation of structural
reforms at the federal and sub-national levels. In particular, the current CAS emphasizes the
need to (1) improve the business environment in order to encourage new firm growth;
(2) strengthen public sector management (including civil service reform, intergovernmental
finance reform and support of judicial reforms); and (3) safeguard against the social and
environmental risks of transition. The CASPR further emphasizes four areas for
collaboration with Russia for the remainder of the CAS period (through mid-2006) and for a
subsequent Country Partnership Strategy: (1) design and implementation of complex federallevel institutional reforms, (2) regional development, (3) the establishment of an efficient
framework for developing private-public partnerships, and (4) Russia’s integration into the
G-8 framework. The World Bank Group (WBG)’s work in each of these areas is described in
more detail below. Further cooperation until 2009 includes the areas of macroeconomic
stability, the investment climate, diversification, public sector management, regional
development, social services, and assistance with Russia’s growing global role in the
international and donor community. Given limited needs in borrowing by the federal
government, World Bank work will be concentrated increasingly in the regions on the basis
of direct cooperation with selected Subjects of the Federation. Operations will be based
largely on new modalities of cooperation, including direct operations in the regions, cofinancing, and fee-for-service.
Contribution to progress on CAS strategic pillars
Improving the business environment and enhancing competition
2.
Bank support for improving the business environment has taken several forms,
touching on the enabling environment for the private sector and supporting infrastructure. In
particular:
•

A Bank-supported survey (run by the Center for Economic and Financial Research, or
CEFIR) has been informing the investment community of improvements in the
investment climate due to implementation of the “de-bureaucratization” package.
Investment climate diagnostics in ten Russian regions, coordinated by the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service of the Bank and IFC, have helped to develop regional
strategies for improving the business climate. The Bank flagship analytical product—
Russia Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 2004 From Transition to
Development—was devoted to the analysis of constraints to the development of the
competitive environment in Russia. Russian Economic Reports, which have been issued
regularly by the Bank, provide an independent assessment of economic and social
developments in Russia, including reviews of the government’s reform effort. These
reports have attracted significant attention from key media as well as investors. An
Investment Climate Assessment is currently being finalized as a joint project with the

46
Moscow Higher School of Economics. This study is based on a survey instrument that
provides information on many questions related to the competitiveness of Russian
industry. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service of the International Financial
Corporation (IFC) has been conducting special recent work on administrative barriers to
access to land. A new stage of work on the Country Economic Memorandum examines
barriers to growth at the regional level.
•

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided guarantees that aim
at increasing foreign investment and industrial restructuring. It has also continued to
work with several Russian regions on the development of investment promotion
programs. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has continued its strategic
presence in several sectors, most importantly manufacturing, infrastructure, and the
financial sector.

•

As a result of the Land Reform Implementation Support (LARIS) project, some
14 percent of all the districts (rayons) in Russia were supplied with automated land
registration systems and about 90 percent of all land in those districts is now inventoried
for purposes of the state cadastre. Over 60 percent of all cadastre enterprises were
supplied with modern digital equipment.

Strengthening public sector management
3.
The Bank has significantly contributed to the government’s effort to strengthen
public sector management in several areas:
•

Administrative and budget reform: The Bank is working closely with the government on
administrative and civil service reforms. This includes on-going TA on reforming
government administration at the federal and regional levels. In addition, since 2004, the
Bank has been providing technical assistance on the design of a performance-based
budgeting system. The Bank has also worked to improve monitoring and analytical
capacity in the public sector, including a multi-year project on Improving Measurement,
Monitoring, and Analysis of Poverty.

•

Tax, treasury and customs: there are three projects under implementation that assist the
government in the development and upgrade of its administrative, methodological and
human capacity to deliver core government functions: collecting taxes and duties, and
managing budgetary flows through the federal treasury. The Tax Modernization loan is
helping the authorities to launch a country-wide modernization effort. The Customs
Development loan pilots ways to accelerate customs clearance—and hence improve trade
facilitation by customs—while improving the efficiency of collecting fiscal revenues.
The Treasury Development loan assists the government in increasing the efficiency of
processing budget flows, and improving financial control over them.

•

Fiscal federalism: jointly with the ministry of finance, the Bank has developed and
piloted an effective federal-level fiscal instrument for supporting economic, budgetary
and fiscal improvements at the regional level. Under the Fiscal Federalism and Regional

47
Fiscal Reform loan, the Regional Fiscal Reform Fund provided incentive-based fiscal
grants to 15 participating regions that have implemented broad-ranging reforms of their
fiscal and asset management, and budget execution, and have adopted more transparent
regulations for equalizing transfers and tax sharing. As of 2006, this project has expanded
to the municipal level.
•

Public service delivery at the local level: the Bank has been a major provider of
financing for investment in local services. The Municipal Water and Heating Systems
loans aim to significantly increase the efficiency of communal services delivery in
participating regions, upgrade infrastructure, and alleviate the financial burden on
municipalities. The completed Community Social Infrastructure Project developed and
tested a model of the regional social infrastructure development fund.

Mitigating social and environmental risks
4.
During the CAS period, the Bank has been involved in various aspects of social
policy development and implementation at the federal and regional levels:
•

Health care: Bank support to government reform in the health sector has two main
objectives: (i) helping Russia establish a health care system that is accessible, affordable,
and efficient; and (ii) strengthening the public policy response to premature mortality and
the risks of HIV/AIDS. Through the Health Reform Implementation loan, the Bank is
assisting the government to design and pilot methods of health sector restructuring, new
financing mechanisms, and medical protocols. The Bank is supporting the government’s
implementation of its Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Social Diseases. A
US$150 million project is enhancing the country’s capacity to prevent the spread of
HIV/AIDS.

•

Education: in the education sector, the Bank has successfully supported (i) reform of
university level social science education, (ii) development of secondary school textbook
provision (Education Innovation Project), and (iii) development and piloting of regional
models for secondary education upgrade (Education Reform Project). The education
reforms supported by the Bank have led to the introduction of a single entrance exam for
all institutes of higher education in 16 regions and have helped universities introduce
better governance systems and increase efficiency in the use of resources. The pioneering
E-learning in Schools project is ensuring better access to quality education for students in
several remote destinations.

•

Strengthening the social protection system: the Bank is concentrating on the design of
upgraded social assistance and on reforms of social service provision for vulnerable
groups (the poor, children at risk, residents of the North). The Bank completed an
analysis of the labor market and child welfare policies at the regional level. The Northern
Restructuring Pilot Project is providing support in an efficient and affordable manner for
migration from the North.

48
•

Environment: until a few years ago, Russia was one of the world’s largest producers of
ozone depleting substances. This is no longer the case thanks to the Bank-funded
program and the Global Environmental Facility administered by the Bank. The
Sustainable Forestry project has supported drafting of the new Forestry Code, increasing
efficiency of the forest management institutions, and revising the forest lease policies.

Government current priorities and CASPR/CPS focus areas
5.
Russia’s strong fiscal position and access to financial markets limit the need for
sovereign borrowing, while at the same time the country still faces major tasks on many
fronts. Some, like housing and communal reform, are related to an unfinished transition,
while others, like public-private partnerships, aim at creating new drivers for economic
diversification and growth. Progress in transformation across a vast country is
understandably uneven, and attention must be focused on the growing gap between
prosperous and lagging regions. Capacity and financial constraints slow down local
implementation of well-designed reforms. Tackling these constraints on a large scale requires
all the resources Russia can mobilize domestically and internationally.
6.
Russia is interested in defining a partnership with the World Bank that would respond
to the country’s strengths and remaining challenges. This would follow the path of the
Bank’s involvement in other middle-income countries. Consultations in the course of
preparation of the CASPR and CPS have indicated that the government remains committed
to collaborating with the Bank as a source of development knowledge and project
implementation capacity. At the same time, the Russian authorities express strong preference
for a more flexible arrangement that would allow them to tap Bank skills through a wide
menu of instruments and services. The government’s priorities for further collaboration with
the WBG are discussed below.
Design and implementation of complex federal-level institutional reforms
7.
At the federal level, demand for the Bank’s assistance is now limited to high
complexity areas where there is a benefit from the Bank providing an efficient framework for
tapping international experience, and, even more importantly, efficient project
implementation mechanisms. One of possible options is that the Bank would provide only
the start-up and pilot financing and would help to set up project implementation mechanisms
for Federal Targeted Programs. Scaling up such projects would become the government’s
responsibility. Such a project framework may significantly increase the efficiency of
government spending on investment and structural reforms, if relatively large volumes of
government co-financing would leverage the Bank funds.
Regional development
8.
At the sub-national level, the development agenda is huge, and demand by local
authorities for stable project financing and project management expertise is far from being
saturated even in the most prosperous of regions. Work at this level will concentrate on a
small number of regions agreed with the government and be supported by a three-pronged

49
approach in order to address the diverse economic, social and human development needs of
Russia’s regions:
•

Well-performing and creditworthy regions may benefit from fee-for-service arrangements
or lending without sovereign guarantees. This opportunity currently exists through the
IFC municipal development facility, and a first operation has been completed in the
Chuvashia Republic. Russia has expressed an interest in developing cooperation further
these lines, and the WBG is currently considering the adoption of a new instrument that
could expand the scope for such cooperation.

•

For those regions that are making progress, but lack significant resources or
creditworthiness, regional will proceed on the basis of cooperation with the federal
government, donors, and (to a limited extent) the Bank’s own resources. A current
project in the Southern Federal Okrug with a particular focus on government
administration is an example of such cooperation.

Establishing efficient framework for developing private-public partnerships
9.
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) represent a new dimension in the government’s
efforts to improve competitiveness and achieve a range of public policy goals. The WBG will
assist the government in designing and implementing programs to facilitate emergence of
public-private partnerships, including the necessary legal and regulatory structures. These
partnerships would help improve efficiency in targeted sectors, tap many sources of finance,
and provide better service to consumers. Infrastructure projects (transport and the housing
and communal sector) will initially be the primary focus. Yet the Bank will also put effort
into providing assistance to formation of PPPs in other key sectors, e.g., in education,
healthcare, science and technology. Given an apparent regional dimension of PPPs
formation. Support by the WBG will include advisory services, the use of guarantees and
project finance.
Russia’s integration into the G-8 framework
10.
Ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol, approaching accession to WTO, and
Russia’s upcoming chairmanship at G-8 present opportunities for the use of Bank technical
expertise and development experience. The mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol offer
Russia unique opportunities to upgrade its energy infrastructure. The Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and carbon finance instruments and advisory services will present the key
avenues for engagement. With regard to WTO accession, the Bank will continue analytical
work and technical assistance to facilitate knowledge creation on accession opportunities and
costs, in particular in the Russian regions. The Bank is also providing analytical support on
global development issues for Russia’s chairmanship of the G-8, in line with previous
experience with other G-8 countries.
11.
In terms of operational modalities, discussions with the government indicate strong
interest in more flexible access to a broad menu of Bank instruments (AAA, TA, lending,
fee-for-service, guarantees). The Bank-supported projects at the federal level are to be fully
integrated into the Russian Federation budget, including its Federal Targeted Programs, with

50
a three to five year planning horizon to better support the government’s mid-term
development programs. The government is interested in flexible co-financing arrangements
that would minimize sovereign borrowing. More specifically, the government is already
moving to increase its share of financing (up to 90 percent) under some of the on-going and
future projects, and expresses strong interest in the development by the Bank of a facility for
sub-national lending without a sovereign guarantee. Other instruments of significant interest
include investment loans with contingent disbursements, partial credit risk guarantees, and
fee-for-service work with no borrowing requirements.

51
APPENDIX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes. Russia has a reasonably comprehensive and timely statistical
database, but difficulties remain in terms of data accuracy and frequent data revisions. State
and private enterprise activities are measured through forms sent to firms included in
enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly replacing full-count collections. The
authorities are generally cooperative in reporting data to the Fund, mainly through the
resident representative office, and during missions. Russia produces a wide range of regular,
timely publications on financial and economic statistics. The authorities report data for the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the
Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
2.
A draft ROSC module on data dissemination practices was prepared in 1999–2000,
but never published. A new data ROSC was prepared in October 2003 and the authorities
approved the publication of the report on the IMF website in April 2004.
3.
Since January 31, 2005, the Russian Federation is a subscriber to the SDDS.
However, data on general government operations (GGO) in the National Summary Data Page
(NSDP) currently refer to 2003.
4.
Reserves template series for the Russian Federation are available on
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm, and external debt series are available on
http://www.worldbank.org/data/working/QEDS/sdds_countrydata.html.
National accounts
5.
The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) compiles and publishes quarterly and
annual national accounts data on a timely basis, using the 1993 System of National Accounts.
Rosstat introduced chain-linking into their quarterly and annual national accounts in 2006.
Chain-linked data have been published for 2003 onwards. Source data are obtained from
surveys of businesses and households, including financial surveys of businesses and
employment surveys of households, and are supplemented by administrative data. Efforts are
underway to improve coverage, but further progress is needed to cover small and medium
enterprises. The estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are compiled by type of
economic activity and expenditure category; however, the estimates by type of activity are
considered more accurate. The statistical discrepancy between the production and
expenditure approaches is generally no more than 2 percent, which is acceptable by
international standards. The data are also presented by income category. Estimates of the
financial account by institutional sector are not compiled.
6.
The delay in finalizing a modern statistics law⎯requiring firms to provide data with
credible penalties for noncompliance, together with a guarantee of confidentiality⎯is an
impediment to further improvement of national accounts data. Furthermore, revisions to the
data are not flagged when they are disseminated. As a result, it is difficult for users,
including the Fund, to maintain any form of consistent time series.

52
Prices
7.
Rosstat compiles a national consumer price index (CPI) of good quality, which was
developed with Fund technical assistance. Following a moderation of inflation, Rosstat
stopped the weekly publication of headline inflation in January 2003, retaining only monthly
reports. In addition, Rosstat has begun publication of monthly core inflation data. Further
improvements could be made on the basis of a new household budget survey—which has
been under consideration for some time—and by the current efforts to improve the treatment
of seasonal items in the index. World Bank and TACIS assistance is available in these areas.
Rosstat also publishes a producer price index, and the State Customs Committee has initiated
the development of foreign trade price indexes.
8.
Monthly CPI and PPI, both Laspeyres indices (2000=100), cover all regions of the
Russian Federation. In addition to the general CPI index, Rosstat publishes indices for the
foodstuffs, non-food products, and services. However, data on the basic components of the
CPI and PPI are not readily available in time series format, and the weights of the CPI and
PPI components are not disclosed, rendering time series analysis difficult.
Government finance statistics
9.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the federal government and annual information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of local governments and extrabudgetary funds. The published functional
classification of expenditure differs slightly from international standards. Expenditure data,
classified by economic type, need improvement. Presently, annual data are compiled with a
long delay. Data on domestic and external federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made
public only in summary form on a quarterly basis. In addition, there is no unified debt
monitoring and reporting system. In the context of a work program for statistical
improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing improvements in the coverage and
quality of GFS data, although expenditure data remain poor. The reform of budgetary
accounting is well advanced and includes the introduction of accrual accounting for the
whole of government. In the 2005 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), data for
the central, local and general government were reported to 2004 on both accrual and cash
basis in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)
methodology. The Treasury has been reporting aggregate government finance data for
publication in IFS on a cash basis since April 1996.
Monetary statistics
10.
Monetary data are reasonably comprehensive and generally in accordance with
international standards. Classification and sectorization are in line with the methodological
guidelines, except that financial derivatives (which are at an initial stage of development) are
not included in the instrument classification. The basis of recording broadly follows
methodological recommendations. Since 2006, monetary gold is valued at current quotations
set by the CBR. Following the 2003 data ROSC recommendations, the authorities included

53
all non-operational credit institutions in the coverage of the monetary statistics and
reclassified their deposits as restricted deposits. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) intends to
revise further its compilation procedures to conform fully to the guidelines of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
11.
Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported
for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available. The
CBR has yet to conclude compilation of monetary data using new Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). At the request of the authorities, a TA mission is slated to visit Moscow in
April 2007 to assist in expanding the coverage to include other (non-depository) financial
corporations and to facilitate the completion of the SRFs.
External sector statistics
12.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled on the basis of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Though significant improvements have been made to
enhance the quality of balance of payments statistics, there remains scope to improve the
coverage of certain components of the current and the capital and financial accounts. In
particular, improving the detail of data on the financial account would facilitate the analysis
of relatively complex flows.
13.
The State Customs Committee needs to improve substantially the coverage and
valuation of exports and imports. Merchandise imports data published by the State Customs
Service are subject to large adjustments for under recording, especially for “shuttle trade” by
individuals, smuggling, and undervaluation. Large differences between partner country and
customs data on imports persist, although statistical agencies are seeking to reconcile the
data with those of partner countries. The CBR has developed a methodology for calculating
components of export and import transactions unrecorded by the customs authorities. There
is a need to improve the coverage and quality of surveys on direct investment, and trade in
services including travel. The CBR has moved toward direct data collection to address these
limitations.
14.
As noted, Russia disseminates the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity. However, published historic series on reserves have not been corrected for
changes in definitions. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on
a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional detail on reserves
and reserve liabilities through the central bank balance sheet, but this is not as
comprehensive as the reserve template, which is disseminated with a lag of twenty days.
15.
Quarterly external debt data are now published by sector, maturity, instrument, and
currency, with a lag of one quarter as prescribed by the SDDS. However, while
improvements have been made, there are a number of gaps in data, notably the lack of a debt
service schedule and historical external debt data for pre-2003 periods. Information on gross
external payments, for example, for the banking system, is needed for monitoring liquidity

54
risk. There is also a need to monitor corporate sector off-balance sheet obligations and more
generally, information on interest and exchange rate exposure of the sector.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 18, 2006

Since the issuance of the staff report there has been a significant decline in oil prices and the
government has changed proposals for the supplementary 2006 budget and the 2007 budget.
1.
The new WEO oil price projections imply a decline in the average oil price of
7¼ percent in 2006 and 17 percent in 2007, compared to the assumptions in the staff report.
Despite this decline, the average oil price is still projected to be more than 20 percent higher
in 2006 than in 2005. Approximately two-thirds of the lower oil revenues will automatically
be absorbed by lower savings in the oil stabilization fund. Moreover, as discussed in the staff
report, a significant impulse continues to arise from previous years’ large terms-of-trade
gains as spending plans have not yet fully adjusted to such gains. In this regard, recent high
frequency data confirm that the momentum in real GDP growth remains strong. Against this
background, staff has maintained its projections of real GDP growth at 6½ percent in both
2006-07, but has lowered its projections of the current account surplus and reserve
accumulation (Table 1).
2.
Since the issuance of the staff report, the authorities have changed the proposed
supplementary budget for 2006, which is expected to be submitted to the Duma later this
year, and the 2007 budget, which has already passed the second reading by the Duma. The
changes imply increases in spending of about ¼ percent of GDP in 2006 and ½ percent of
GDP in 2007, compared to the projections in the staff report, and an increase in the oil price
at which the 2007 budget is balanced to $40 per barrel (Table 2). In addition, as a result of
the lower oil price assumptions, government revenues are also projected to be considerably
lower than in the staff report. Staff estimates that these changes entail an additional impulse
of ½ percent of GDP in 2006 and ¾ percent of GDP in 2007 in terms of the combined effect
of changes in the terms-of-trade and in the fiscal stance (Table 3). Thus, the relaxation of the
fiscal stance more than compensates for the negative impact of lower oil prices. In view of
this, staff has increased its inflation projection by ¼ percentage points for both 2006 and
2007, compared to the staff report.
3.
The thrust of the staff appraisal has not changed. At the same time, the revisions have
reinforced staff’s concerns that the relaxation in the non-oil fiscal balance at a time when
private sector demand remains very buoyant will add to inflationary pressures, and that there
will emerge over the medium term a non-oil deficit and structure of public spending that
cannot be sustained.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 6, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the Russian Federation
On October 18, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
Propelled by large terms-of-trade gains, GDP has regained momentum. Growth has recovered
from a yearly rate of about 5 percent in early 2005 to about 7 percent at present, broadly the
same pace as before the 2004 slowdown. The renewed momentum reflects a recovery in
investments, as a confluence of negative factors that depressed capital spending in the
second half of 2004 has waned against the backdrop of continued terms-of-trade gains.
Consumption remains, however, the main source of growth, supported by strong real wage
growth and a fiscal relaxation that began in early 2005.
GDP growth is running increasingly close to potential. Domestic resource constraints are
tightening, causing increased leakage through the balance of payments and accelerated ruble
appreciation. Following six years with robust GDP growth, but relatively low investments,
measures of capacity utilization are at historical highs. Constraints are particularly evident in
the oil sector. Having increased by about 10 percent annually through 2003, the increase in
crude oil production has slowed sharply, and appears now to have stabilized at 2–3 percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Labor markets are also tightening, reflected in very low unemployment rates in key regions
and strong real wage growth.
Adding to the demand pressures is a notable fiscal relaxation. In 2004 fiscal policy had been
saving most of the oil windfall to mitigate the pressures arising from the large terms-of-trade
gains, but the non-oil primary deficit is set to rise by almost 3 percent of GDP in 2005–06, as
oil revenues are being used to reduce taxes and increase expenditures. The draft 2007 budget
entails a significant further easing.
Despite some tightening, monetary policy has remained accommodative. The Central Bank of
Russia (CBR) has allowed somewhat more nominal exchange rate flexibility, and this has
helped to reduce inflation from a yearly rate of 13½ percent in May 2005 to 9 percent in June
this year. However, while inflation has eased, unsterilized foreign exchange interventions have
remained high, leading to an acceleration in the growth of monetary aggregates. Recently,
there has been a renewed pick up in inflation.
Progress with structural reforms outside the banking sector has been generally somewhat
slow. This includes reforms of the health and education sectors, the civil service and public
administration, and the natural monopolies.
Demand pressures are expected to remain strong in 2006–07 and possibly intensify. Staff
projects GDP growth of 6½ percent in both years. Growth in consumption and investment is
expected to remain robust, partly on the strength of high oil prices. The strong demand also
reflects the substantial impulse that is still coming from the cumulative terms-of-trade gains of
11 percent of GDP during 2003–05, as spending plans are adjusting only gradually to these
gains, not least in the oil sector. Inflation, which was already 7 percent in the first eight months
of this year, is likely to exceed the official end-year target of 8½ percent once again. A large
current account surplus, rapidly increasing foreign exchange reserves and declining external
debt point to low external vulnerability.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the strong performance of the Russian economy in recent years,
reflected in robust real GDP growth, strong external and fiscal positions, and growth in
productivity and consumption. They attributed this not only to high oil prices, but also to
significant supply responses from the private sector in the context of generally prudent
macroeconomic policies, not least the policy of taxing and saving the large oil windfall.
Directors expected robust growth to continue in 2006 and 2007 under the current outlook for
oil prices, but—with the economy running close to potential—saw a more challenging
macroeconomic environment going forward. In these circumstances, Directors noted the
importance of refraining from further fiscal relaxation in the near term considering the
buoyancy of demand and still strong inflationary pressures and of increasing the focus of
monetary policy on inflation control, supported by more exchange rate flexibility.
Directors stressed that long-term growth prospects depend on accelerating the implementation
of structural reforms and strengthening the investment climate. They noted that the rise in
investment and employment levels has been limited and the strong growth performance so far
has been mainly based on increases in total factor productivity, reflecting still significant scope
for efficiency gains through equipment upgrade and resource reallocation. Directors cautioned
that this catch-up potential will inevitably start to diminish, leaving growth increasingly
dependent on raising investment and instituting reforms over the medium term.

3
Against this background, most Directors were concerned that the pace of economic reforms
has remained slow. A reinvigoration of reforms in the inefficient and undercapitalized natural
monopolies as well as the public administration is particularly urgent. Directors observed that
these reforms should be carefully sequenced with other reforms, including reforms of the
communal services, judiciary, health, and education sectors. Recognizing that these are
socially sensitive areas, they encouraged the authorities to advance reforms now while
favorable energy prices and large productivity gains are boosting growth and real incomes.
Directors emphasized the importance of the oil and gas sectors for growth prospects. In this
connection, they welcomed the recent changes to the tax regime designed to stimulate
investment in these sectors. They expressed concern, however, that the increased state
ownership in the oil sector might negatively impinge on the future dynamism in this sector.
The disappointing performance of the state-controlled gas sector during recent years, despite
record high energy prices, was seen as a sobering reminder in this regard.
Directors were encouraged by the strengthening of the banking sector, but expressed
concerns about regulatory vigilance. They noted that profitability is high and direct exposure to
market risk low, and welcomed the gradual emergence of a better supervisory framework.
However, they observed that risk management by commercial banks needs to be improved.
Directors congratulated the CBR for its steadfast determination in recalling licenses of banks
that have violated anti-money laundering provisions. Nevertheless, they expressed concern
that the limited number of deposit-taking institutions barred from deposit insurance might
reflect insufficient regulatory vigilance. In light of this, Directors cautioned that the favorable
macroeconomic environment could be masking vulnerabilities that might become evident in
the event of a major drop in oil prices. Greater attention should also be paid to the implications
of the de-dollarization process that is currently under way. Directors welcomed the planned
FSAP update as providing a good opportunity for a further analysis of banking sector
vulnerabilities and the measures needed to bolster the regulatory framework.
Directors noted that the policy of taxing and saving oil revenues in the face of surging oil prices
has served Russia well, preventing overheating amid strong demand pressures from the large
terms-of-trade gains. They were concerned, therefore, about a premature relaxation of this
policy, and urged the authorities not to weaken the non-oil balance further at this juncture.
While acknowledging that there is considerable scope for additional, growth-oriented
expenditures in the medium term, Directors were concerned that the rapid loosening since
early 2005 has mainly supported higher wages, recurrent expenditures, and tax cuts that are
unlikely to boost potential growth. They cautioned that such spending, together with sluggish
structural reforms, could cause the exchange rate to overshoot its long-term equilibrium and
lead to the emergence of an unsustainable non-oil deficit and spending structure. They
stressed that harnessing Russia’s oil wealth in support of policies that will strengthen long-term
growth would require reforms to be reinvigorated. The authorities were encouraged to move
toward a medium-term budgetary framework with clear rules, including an explicit role for the
non-oil balance.
As to monetary and exchange rate policies, Directors welcomed the decline in inflation in the
first half of 2006, but most cautioned that more exchange rate flexibility would be needed for
the progress to be consolidated. The renewed increase in inflation pressures in recent months
was a timely reminder of the risks in this regard. Directors urged the CBR to give clear priority
to its inflation target, standing ready to scale back interventions and allow ruble appreciation if
inflation exceeds the targeted path.

4
Directors welcomed the elimination of all capital account restrictions and the concurrent
elimination of the one outstanding restriction on current account transactions, arising from
regulations accompanying the 2004 Federal Law on Foreign Exchange Regulation and
Foreign Exchange Control.
Directors noted the Russian authorities’ assurances that a number of restrictions on imports
from neighboring countries had been imposed for sanitary reasons. The authorities were
encouraged to seek a rapid and transparent resolution of these issues.
Directors were disappointed that Russia’s accession to the WTO has again been delayed.
They looked toward a swift resolution of outstanding issues holding up bilateral agreements.
Directors urged the authorities to resist calls for prolonged transition agreements, noting that
WTO accession would promote structural reform and boost trade and investment.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
