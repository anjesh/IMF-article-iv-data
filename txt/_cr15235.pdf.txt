IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Iraq
On July 29, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2015
Article IV consultation1 with Iraq.
Iraq is facing a double shock arising from the ISIS insurgency and the plunge in global oil prices.
In 2014, real GDP contracted by 2.1 percent mainly due to the impact of the conflict, while oil
production and exports increased slightly compared to 2013. This year, overall economic activity
is expected to see a modest recovery of 0.5 percent thanks to oil sector expansion, while non-oil
activity is expected to contract further.
The decline in oil prices has driven the decline of Iraq’s international reserves (including the
Development Fund for Iraq) from $84 billion at end-2013 to $67 billion at end-2014. Fiscal
pressures are intensifying, with the government deficit expected to expand from 5.3 percent of
GDP last year to 18.4 percent of GDP in 2015 due to continuing weak oil prices and rising
humanitarian and security spending.
The authorities have appropriately maintained the exchange rate peg. Liberalization steps taken
by the Central Bank of Iraq led to a decline in the parallel market spread to less than 2 percent by
end-2014. The imposition of new restrictions triggered significant market volatility and a sharply
wider spread in the first months of this year, but their recent removal has helped narrow the
spread back to 4 percent by July.
Medium term growth prospects remain positive, though less favorable than before the crisis.
Growth will be driven by the projected ramp-up in oil production and the rebound in non-oil
growth supported by the expected improvement in security and implementation of structural
reform. Risks remain very high, however, arising primarily from an escalation of the conflict,
political tensions, and poor policy implementation.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Fund is supporting Iraq through a disbursement under the Rapid Financing Instrument in the
amount of SDR 891.3 million ($1.242 billion), equivalent to 75 percent of quota2.
Executive Board Assessment3
Directors noted the severity of the double shock facing Iraq as a result of the continuing ISIS
insurgency and the global oil price decline. The risks remain very high, emanating from an
extension of the conflict, political tensions, weak policy implementation, and further shocks from
oil markets. In this context, Directors noted that the steps taken by the authorities are in the right
direction, but urged further determined efforts to address the large financing gap and maintain
the momentum for reforms.
Directors welcomed the 2015 budget as a good step toward addressing pressures from lower oil
revenues amid higher humanitarian and security spending, and commended the introduction of
new revenue measures. While recognizing that the current adjustment plans may be socially and
politically challenging, Directors saw a need for additional measures to help close the large
financing gap and build fiscal buffers. Some Directors expressed disappointment over the delay
in implementing the electricity tariff reform. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to implement the reform as soon as possible or adopt compensatory fiscal measures.
They also recommended expenditure rationalization while safeguarding priority social and
capital spending and making social safety nets more efficient. Directors urged the authorities to
tap domestic markets and seek further external financial support, while avoiding the buildup of
domestic and external arrears. Over the medium term, strengthening public financial and debt
management will be crucial.
Directors noted that indirect central bank financing of the government is necessary at this
juncture given the lack of other sources of financing, but stressed that this should not become a
recurring source of financing. They, therefore, welcomed the authorities’ intention to firmly limit
such support and clarify the terms of the related financial operations between the central bank,
the state-owned banks, and the government. Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to
maintain the exchange rate peg, which has served as a sound nominal anchor for Iraq. They also
welcomed the steps taken to liberalize the foreign exchange market and urged the removal of
remaining exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice as external conditions evolve.

The Executive Board approved the Rapid Financing Instrument for Iraq on July 29, 2015 (see Press Release
No. 15/363)

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors underscored the risks from rising tensions in the banking system arising from the
impact of the crisis on the assets and activity of private banks, and the increasing role of
state-owned banks in financing the government. In this regard, they welcomed the steps taken to
strengthen banking supervision and the authorities’ commitment to press ahead with the
restructuring of Rasheed and Rafidain banks. Directors emphasized the importance of bringing
Iraq’s frameworks for combating corruption, money laundering, and terrorism financing in line
with international standards and implementing them effectively.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need to maintain the momentum on
restructuring the economy despite the current difficulties, and emphasized the importance of
staying committed to reforms. They highlighted the need to diversify the economy and improve
the resilience and inclusiveness of economic growth. They supported the focus on strengthening
fiscal institutions, completing the transition to a market economy through further private banking
sector development and state-owned enterprise restructuring, and improving the business
environment, governance, and the labor market. In this context, they noted the need for Fund
technical assistance in strengthening Iraq’s institutions. Recognizing the difficult circumstances,
Directors agreed that a realistic implementation timeline is important, while pressing ahead with
high-priority reforms. Looking ahead, a forward-looking policy framework could help the
adjustment process and allow the authorities to build a track record of strong policy
implementation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$1.24 Billion in Financial Support for Iraq
On July 29, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved
SDR 891.3 million (about US$1.24 billion or 75 percent of quota) for Iraq under the Rapid
Financing Instrument (RFI)1. The purpose of this financial assistance is to help Iraq address
present and urgent balance of payment and budget needs in 2015 related to the ISIS
insurgency and a decline in oil prices. The IMF financing will support the authorities’ current
economic program, which includes fiscal adjustment measures and structural reforms.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Iraq, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, IMF Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair of the Board, issued the following statement:
“The twin shocks faced by Iraq from the ISIS insurgency and the drop in global oil prices
have severely widened the government deficit and caused a decline in international reserves.
The authorities’ policies to deal with the shocks, including sizable fiscal adjustment and
maintenance of the exchange rate peg, go in the right direction. Access under the IMF’s
Rapid Financing Instrument will help address Iraq’s urgent balance of payments and budget
needs. However, large fiscal and external financing gaps remain.
“The large financing gap calls for the rigorous implementation of the authorities’ policies,
but also additional fiscal adjustment measures and identification of domestic and internal
financing. In this context, it will be important to implement the new electricity tariff schedule
as soon as possible, or adopt compensatory measures. Looking ahead, the authorities should
lay the ground for medium-term structural reforms that would better support macroeconomic
policy management and boost the economy’s resilience to shocks.”

1

The RFI provides rapid and low-access financial assistance to member countries facing an urgent balance of
payments need, without the need to have a full-fledged program in place. It can provide support to meet a broad
range of urgent needs, including those arising from commodity price shocks, natural disasters, conflict and postconflict situations, and emergencies resulting from fragility. Access under the RFI is limited to 75 percent of
quota per year and 150 percent of quota on a cumulative basis. Financial assistance under the RFI is provided in
the form of outright purchases without the need for a full-fledged program or reviews.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR PURCHASE UNDER THE RAPID
FINANCING INSTRUMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context: Iraq is facing a double shock arising from the ISIS insurgency and the sharp drop
in global oil prices. The conflict is hurting the non-oil economy through destruction of
infrastructure and assets, disruptions in trade, and deterioration of investor confidence. The
impact of the oil price decline—already felt in 2014—will fully unfold in 2015, affecting the
budget, the external sector, and medium-term growth potential. The authorities are
responding to the crisis through mix of fiscal adjustment and financing, maintaining their
commitment to the exchange rate peg.
Rapid Financing Instrument: To help address the present and urgent balance of payment
and budget needs triggered by the ISIS insurgency and the collapse in oil prices, the
authorities have requested financial assistance under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI)
for 50 percent of quota (SDR 594.2 million).
Outlook and Risks: Assuming a resolution of the conflict in the coming years, the baseline
medium-term outlook still looks positive, even though it would be significantly less
favorable than at the time of the 2013 Article IV report. Under much improved security
conditions, the macroeconomic scenario would continue to be driven by the expansion in oil
production and non-oil sector growth, assuming the implementation of structural reform to
diversify the economy and support private sector development. But risks remain very high,
arising primarily from a worsening of the conflict, political tensions, and poor policy
implementation.
Key Article IV Policy Recommendations:



In 2015, strong fiscal consolidation is needed to address the fall in oil revenues and
contain central bank financing to the budget.



In the medium term, continued fiscal discipline, supported by stronger public financial
management, will be essential to raise investment and eventually rebuild fiscal buffers.



The exchange rate peg remains appropriate, but the authorities should press ahead
with the gradual liberalization of the foreign exchange market.



Close monitoring of the financial sector is warranted in light of the impact of the
conflict, the state-owned banks’ financing of the budget, and AML/CFT shortcomings.



The authorities should continue to pursue medium-term structural reform, including:
strengthening public financial management and governance and streamlining public
spending; improving the business environment and restructuring state-owned
enterprises; and promoting private sector job creation.

BACKGROUND: A DOUBLE-EDGED CRISIS
A. Crisis Triggers
1.
Iraq is facing an existential threat from the ISIS insurgency and a large external shock
from the collapse in oil prices. The insurgency that started in June 2014 is putting the political and
social structure of the country under unprecedented stress. Almost simultaneously, the Iraqi
economy—highly dependent on hydrocarbons—has been hit by the fastest decline in oil prices in
five years, with severe consequences for its external position, budget revenues and fiscal space.
2.
One year into the conflict, ISIS remains
firmly entrenched in Iraq. Since last summer,
government forces have retaken some of the ISIScontrolled territory, but progress has been slow and
the recent loss of the key city of Ramadi shows that
the fight against ISIS is likely to be protracted. The
conflict has also created a humanitarian crisis
(Box 1).

3.
As the insurgency was expanding, world
oil prices started a dramatic decline. Its impact on
Iraq has been particularly intense given Iraq’s
extreme dependence on oil. In 2014, oil exports
represented almost 100 percent of total exports; oil
sector GDP was more than 50 percent of the total
(with much of the non-oil activity indirectly driven
by oil revenues); and oil exports constituted over
93 percent of government revenues.

worsened as the government focuses on the

performance has proved more resilient than expected;



Non-oil activity has been harmed by the violence, particularly in the ISIS-controlled areas, but
also in the rest of Iraq as productive assets and infrastructure have been destroyed, internal and
external trade disrupted, and the confidence of households and investors undermined. In
addition, lower oil revenue is leading to a compression of government spending, particularly
investment, further dragging down the economy.

Box 1. Humanitarian Conditions in Iraq
The conflict in Iraq has created one of the largest internally displaced populations in the world. Over three
million have been displaced internally since mid-2014. Close to 10 million Iraqis (or almost one third of the
population) are deemed to need humanitarian assistance. Living conditions across the country have deteriorated,
and the government’s ability to provide basic public goods and services is highly curtailed. Destruction to physical
infrastructure is hampering access to—and services provided by—schools and hospitals due to lack of medical
facilities, supplies and healthcare assistance: 14 major hospitals and over 170 health facilities are reportedly
dysfunctional or destroyed. Food security is at risk given destruction to agricultural, livestock and irrigation systems.
Water, power, and sanitation cuts are also reportedly widespread. More than 2.9 million Internally Displaced Persons
(IDPs) are expected to need nonfood
assistance (including shelter)
throughout the remainder of 2015,
mostly in the center and south of Iraq.
Poverty rates have risen in conflict
areas given escalating inflation due to
supply disruptions. Support in these
areas through the Public Distribution
System (PDS) is limited, with fourfifths of households reportedly
receiving no rations in April.
According to Iraq Body Count, the
number of casualties since the
beginning of 2015 has climbed to
over 7,300, following 17 thousand
reported deaths during 2014.
Iraq has also received about a
quarter of a million Syrian refugees.
Refugees—60 percent of whom are
women and children—mostly reside in
the north, including the Kurdistan
Regional Government where they
have been granted residency status
including rights to work. This refugee
inflow is adding to the already difficult
internal humanitarian situation faced
by the Iraqi government.

Source: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The government response is constrained by the budgetary crisis, but is receiving support from the
international community. The government is struggling to meet rising humanitarian spending needs. Outlays on
socio-economic infrastructure have been delayed or postponed, and payment of salaries in some regions has been
delayed. However, the Ministry of Displacement and Migration has started rolling out new smart cards to IDPs
allowing families to withdraw about $336 as monthly financial assistance. The government has also set up a
$500 million Reconstruction Fund. The U.N. has launched a $500 million humanitarian response plan for Iraq in
Brussels in June 2015, targeting over 5.5 million Iraqis over a six month period. The U.N. also recently welcomed a
$300 million donation from Kuwait as a humanitarian response for both Iraq and Yemen. Nevertheless, delivering aid
to affected areas is challenging because of restrictions to access and limited security.

B. Recent Developments and Short-Term Outlook
Growth slows down
5.
Economic growth has been slowing since 2013. An expansionary fiscal stance pushed GDP
growth to 6.6 percent in 2013, but the economy contracted by 2.1 percent in 2014 because of the
onset of the insurgency and the slowdown in government spending. GDP is expected to register
only a modest recovery of 0.5 percent this year:


Oil production and exports were flat in 2013 over 2012 because of technical issues, security
problems (particularly the sabotage of the northern pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan), and
the suspension of exports from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).1 In 2014, oil
production and exports rose at a moderate pace (Box 2 and Selected Issues Paper), but are
projected to rise by 11 and 23 percent in 2015, respectively, partly on account of the agreement
with the KRG.



Non-oil sector growth accelerated to 10 percent in 2013 due to strong government spending,
but contracted by almost 9 percent in 2014 because of the collapse of activity in the areas
occupied by ISIS and the contraction of government spending. In 2015, these factors will
continue to weigh on the non-oil activity, which also suffered from the recent exchange
restrictions in the first half of the year, given the importance of cash transactions for big-ticket
items and dependence on imports.

Box 2. Why Oil Production and Exports Have Held Up Despite the Conflict
Despite the security challenges, Iraq’s oil sector has expanded slightly in 2014 as most of the oil
infrastructure is in the south, beyond ISIS’ reach. While oil exports in value fell by about 7 percent in 2014 from
the previous year, oil production increased by 0.1 million barrels per day (mbpd), supported by the southern fields,
which accounted for most of the production (87 percent) and exports (98 percent). In contrast, deteriorating
security took a toll on oil sector activities in northern Iraq. The northern Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline—the principal
export outlet for the Kirkuk oil fields—has been put out of commission indefinitely in March 2014, effectively
shutting down oil exports from the Kirkuk fields. As a result, northern Iraq produced 0.40 mbpd oil, 40 percent less
than in 2013, and exported just 0.06 mbpd compared to 0.26 mbpd in 2013.
The December 2014 agreement between Baghdad and KRG is opening up northern exports again. The
landmark agreement envisages the resumption of the budget transfer from Baghdad to the KRG (equivalent to
17 percent of the federal budget, minus certain central expenditures) in exchange for exports of 0.25 mbpd from
the KRG and 0.3 mbpd from the Kirkuk fields, now controlled by the KRG. The northern oil is exported to Ceyhan
through a new pipeline in the KRG that bypasses ISIS-controlled territory. But the agreement is vulnerable to
continued tensions between Baghdad and Erbil on the balance between budget transfers and oil exports from the
north.
The crisis will negatively affect the medium-term outlook for the oil sector. Already this year, International Oil
Companies (IOCs) have lowered their investment plans
6

at the request of the Ministry of Oil to reduce pressure

on struggling government finances (the government

also triggered the renegotiation by the federal

government of the existing service contracts, which
may be modified to link IOCs’ profits to oil price levels.

Article IV 2013
Weak oil prices will also make IOCs less inclined to

invest in expanding production.
2

As a consequence, oil production targets are being
revised downward. The Iraqi government aimed to
increase oil production capacity to over 13 mbpd when
it signed service contracts with IOCs during 2009–10.
Production targets have been revised downwards
repeatedly since then. In line with most market
analysts, Fund staff has revised downward mediumterm production and exports. Oil production is now
seen to reach 4.7 mbpd in 2018 compared to 5.7 mbpd
at the time of the 2013 Article IV consultation, and
exports have been reduced from 4.75 mbpd to
3.84 mbpd.

Nevertheless, Iraq will remain a big player in the oil
market. According to the International Energy Agency, Iraq is still expected to account for the largest individual
contribution (40 percent, or 1.07 mbpd) to OPEC’s crude oil production capacity growth over 2014–20, albeit lower
compared to 61 percent projected a year earlier.

6.
Inflation remains in the low single digits, but is probably underestimated. In line with
weakening domestic demand and world commodity prices, CPI inflation was about 2 percent in
2013–14 and just 0.5 percent at end-April 2015. However, official data do not cover the four ISISoccupied provinces, where fuel and goods shortages are reportedly pushing prices much higher.
Inflation is projected to rise slightly to 3 percent by end-2015 because of continued trade
disruptions and the volatility in the parallel market.
7.
Credit growth to the private sector moderated to 5 percent in 2014, likely due to
falling business confidence. Broad money growth slowed to 4 percent (compared to 17 percent in
2013) largely because of the contraction of net foreign assets, but is expected to grow by about
18 percent this year as foreign exchange sales decrease.

External sector conditions deteriorate
8.
Reflecting expansionary fiscal policies in 2013 and the conflict and oil price collapse in
2014–15, Iraq’s foreign assets have been declining steeply. Total foreign assets (including the
Development Fund for Iraq (DFI)) declined by $21 billion over 2013–14.2 In the first five months of
2015, international reserves grew slightly to $68 billion, due to the weak imports by the private
sector and government’s postponement of imports and some foreign payments. But, the continued
weakness of oil prices will push the current account deficit to almost 9 percent of GDP, and reserves
are expected to decline to $50 billion by end-year (just below seven months of imports).
9.
Foreign exchange market conditions improved in 2014, but worsened this year
following the imposition of new restrictions, which have been since partly lifted. Steps toward
liberalization taken by the CBI in the course of 2013–14 resulted in a decline in the parallel market
spread to less than 2 percent in December 2014, despite the security crisis. In January 2015,
however, the CBI reduced the volumes of cash currency sales and imposed a 15-day advance
deposit requirement for foreign currency transactions. In addition, the government introduced a
5 percent customs duty advance payment and a 3 percent presumptive income tax to be paid at the
time of request for foreign exchange to finance imports. In June, because of the negative impact on
the parallel market (the spread rose to a record 16 percent) the authorities removed this measure
and shortened the advance deposit requirement to five days. As a result, the spread quickly declined
to about 6 percent by end-month. As of end-April, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate
(measured using the official rate) appreciated by about 16 percent since end-2012, largely because
of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

2

The DFI was closed in May 2014, and its balances transferred to the CBI as part of its international reserves. Oil
revenues now feed directly into CBI reserves, and a government account at the CBI is credited correspondingly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

The fiscal position weakens
10.
Fiscal performance weakened in 2013–14. In 2013, when prices were still high,
government spending increased strongly, also because of the April 2014 elections, and the
government balance moved to a deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP, from a surplus of 4 percent of GDP
in 2012 Article IV. In 2014, the fiscal rule triggered by the absence of a parliament-approved budget
improved the fiscal position slightly to a deficit of 5 percent of GDP by automatically prorating
current spending and postponing new investment projects. In addition, escalation of the
disagreement between Baghdad and Erbil over oil revenue sharing led to the suspension of the
budget transfer to the autonomous region, delivering savings of about 9 percent of the federal
budget. However, limited financing forced the government to accumulate external arrears to the
International Oil Companies (IOCs) of $6.8 billion—which were repaid in the first half of 2015—and
of ID 2.3 trillion (1 percent of GDP) to domestic contractors.

11.
Fiscal pressures are intensifying this year. Revenues are expected to decline by 21 percent
this year due to the full-year effect of the oil price decline. At the same time, government spending
cannot be easily compressed in light of large security and humanitarian expenditures. As a result,
even with the large adjustment in spending that is underway, the government deficit is expected to
rise to 17 percent of GDP.

2016: still not out of the woods
12.
In 2016, growth is expected to pick up, but fiscal conditions will continue to be
challenging. Oil production and exports will continue to grow in line with the revised medium term
projections. Furthermore, assuming that the conflict with ISIS will start to be resolved in 2016, the
non-oil economy is projected to recover by about 2 percent. Total GDP is expected to grow by
about 8 percent. The improvement in export revenues will push the trade balance into positive
territory and lower the current account deficit to around 7 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, CBI
international reserves are still projected to fall to $41 billion by end-year (5.5 months of imports).
The government’s fiscal position is projected to improve thanks to higher oil revenues and
moderating expenditures, but the deficit will still remain high at around 10 percent of GDP.

C. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
13.
The baseline medium-term outlook is still positive, but hinges on the resolution of the
conflict. Assuming that the conflict with ISIS is resolved starting in 2016–17, the macroeconomic
scenario would be driven by the expansion in oil production and non-oil sector growth. Even under
much improved security conditions, however, the baseline outlook is significantly less favorable than
at the time of the 2013 Article IV report, reflecting lower oil prices and the impact of the conflict:


GDP growth should recover to around 7.5 percent on average during 2016–20, driven by the
expansion in oil production, albeit at a slower pace than forecasts before the crisis, as the
government’s financial difficulties and lower oil prices slow down investment in the sector (see
charts in Box 2). Non-oil sector growth is expected to stabilize at about 4 percent on average
during 2017–20, about half the pace of 2008–13, supported by structural reforms to diversify the
economy, develop the financial sector, and improve the business environment.



Inflation is expected to remain low at 3 percent, reflecting a differential of 1–2 percent over
U.S. dollar inflation.



The fiscal position should improve from 2016 thanks to the ramp-up in oil export volumes and
continued fiscal discipline, moving to surplus from 2019. Current spending growth is projected
to moderate gradually, reflecting the full impact of the measures taken in 2015 and the
assumption of zero real growth in other current items. Capital spending would increase
gradually in line with growing fiscal space to accommodate Iraq’s reconstruction and investment
needs.3

3

Security spending is assumed to remain relatively high beyond the end of the ISIS insurgency, partly to reflect
reintegration/demobilization costs.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ



International reserves of the CBI are expected to decline until 2016–17, but should start a
rebound in 2018, reaching $60 billion, or 5 months of next year’s imports of goods and services,
in 2020. In parallel, the current account deficit is expected to improve gradually in line with the
fiscal consolidation and the recovery in exports, returning to surplus in 2017, and remaining at
about 2 percent of GDP during 2018–20.

14.
The medium-term fiscal path is consistent with intergenerational equity
considerations. Based on the revised outlook, a non-oil primary deficit of no more than 50 percent
of non-oil GDP (in line with the 2013 Article IV results) would be needed to ensure adequate saving
of oil revenues for future generations, based on a Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) framework
consistent with the staff’s baseline macroeconomic scenario. The projected medium-term fiscal path,
which takes into account the social and reconstruction needs of the country, would converge to the
PIH-consistent non-oil primary balance by 2023–25.
15.

But, downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook are very high:



Key domestic risks: The main risk to the outlook is an entrenchment or escalation of the
conflict, which could in an extreme case extend to areas currently spared by the violence. In such
a scenario, non-oil growth would continue to stagnate or even decline further, while the
expansion in oil production would be delayed. In addition, political tensions could rise,
threatening the reform effort or undermining the agreement with the KRG over oil revenue
sharing, leading to lower oil production. Poor fiscal policy implementation could undermine the
government’s ability to address the crisis, depress investment in the oil sector, and harm
medium-term growth and the economy’s resilience to shocks. Finally, the intensification of
foreign exchange restrictions could lead to a deterioration of the foreign currency market, with
negative impact on the economy.



Key external risk: Oil revenues could be affected by a further decline in oil prices or a
weakening of world demand. Possible adverse regional security developments continue to
represent a destabilizing factor.

16.
Iraq’s undiversified economic structure and high oil dependency exacerbates its
vulnerability to a fall in oil prices. In staff’s adverse scenario, a 20 percent decline of oil prices,
which would then converge only gradually to the baseline, would cause a significant drop in growth,
putting pressure on external and fiscal accounts (Figure 2).
17.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s macroeconomic outlook, but were more
optimistic about oil sector expansion and oil prices. The authorities shared staff’s view that
support for growth and containment of risks should come from well-designed fiscal consolidation,
improvement in oil revenue management, build-up of fiscal buffers, reform of the banking sector,
removal of impediments to business environment, and, overall, reduction of the economy’s
dependence on the oil sector. They underlined that restoring security will be a precondition to
achieve these goals. They thought however that staff was overly cautious on the pace of oil sector
expansion, pointing to their plans for large investment in oil production and export infrastructure.

ECONOMIC POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS
Discussions on policies to address the immediate impact of the crisis focused on: (i) measures to deal
with the fiscal crisis in 2015 and put the economy on a sustainable medium-term fiscal path; (ii) the
external imbalance and the decline in CBI international reserves; and (iii) threats to financial stability
and development of the financial system.

A. Managing the Fiscal Crisis
The authorities are addressing the fiscal pressure through a mix of adjustment and financing. The
immediate priorities are introducing consolidation measures and identifying adequate financing
sources, relying if needed on indirect financial support from the CBI.
18.
The 2015 budget was designed to address the fiscal pressures from low oil revenues
and the conflict. In the initial draft 2015 budget, the government tried to balance weakening oil

The government is introducing additional measures amounting to 6 percent of GDP.
The authorities plan to increase soon electricity tariffs (ID 2.5 trillion for 2015), and further rationalize
the capital budget (ID 9 trillion) by end-July through a rigorous prioritization process. These
measures became necessary partly to compensate for the delayed introduction of the 2015 budget’s
tax measures and the custom tariff increase to August because of legal and technical issues. As a
result, the spending envelope would decline to 58 percent of GDP (a reduction of 4 percentage
points of GDP in spending compared to 2014, adjusting for the KRG transfer) and the deficit would
fall to 17 percent of GDP.
20.
The authorities stepped up their efforts to identify financing sources. With fiscal buffers
in the DFI almost completely depleted by end-2014, the authorities have to borrow from stateowned banks, which will be supported in

considering filling the shortfall by tapping
the domestic bond market and loans from international partners. Staff inquired whether further
reduction in spending, particularly current items such as public sector wages and subsidies (other
than electricity) could be undertaken, but the authorities felt that they are already reaching the limits
of politically and socially feasible adjustment.
21.
Relying on indirect CBI financing is not ideal, but there are no viable alternatives. In
the authorities’ views, the CBI’s support for the banking sector is a liquidity intervention and as such
is allowed by the 2004 CBI law. Staff noted that discounting large volumes of government securities
could undermine the CBI’s independence and credibility, and weaken the government’s incentives to
maintain fiscal discipline. However, in the current crisis, the lack of alternative sources of financing
makes this option unavoidable given the infeasible level of adjustment in government spending that
would otherwise be needed, which would threaten Iraq’s delicate social and political balance.
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

Inflation concerns are limited, because of the overall contraction in government spending, partial
leakage through foreign exchange purchases, and current low inflation.
22.
Consolidation efforts should continue in 2016 and beyond. In 2016, the measures
introduced this year will bring savings for about 4 percent of GDP, which, combined with the
expected increase in oil revenues and a very gradual increase in capital spending should allow the
government to lower the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP. However, given limited borrowing
available from the domestic banking system and no plan for further indirect CBI support, in staff’s
projections a residual gap of about 8 percent of GDP will remain even counting for World Bank
support and Eurobond issuance. The authorities might fill this residual gap with domestic debt
issuances or further international borrowing, but should also consider additional fiscal consolidation.
In following years, the medium term scenario is predicated on continued fiscal discipline bringing
fiscal surpluses starting in 2019.
23.
Public debt remains sustainable, but its rapid increase calls for stronger debt
management. Borrowing required to finance the 2015 budget deficit is projected to raise total debt
from 39 percent of GDP (of which 10 percent of GDP is domestic debt) in 2014 to 69 percent of GDP
(of which 33 percent of GDP is domestic debt) this year, with further domestic borrowing expected
for 2016. The DSA shows that risks increase, but also that the debt is sustainable and will decline
over time, converging to 48 percent of GDP in 2020. In this context, the authorities should develop
a debt management strategy to ensure debt sustainability while minimizing costs and risks of
borrowing to the government. The issuance of Eurobonds and, internally, of domestic bonds, would
increase debt management capacity, contribute to the development of an efficient government
securities market, deepen Iraq’s financial system, and reduce the government’s reliance on T-bills.

B. Addressing External Pressures
The authorities are appropriately maintaining the exchange rate peg with the dollar despite the
worsening of the external position, but the recently introduced restrictive measures increased the
spread between the official and parallel market exchange rates.
24.
The authorities are committed to maintain the peg with the US dollar. The peg has
provided a key nominal anchor in a highly uncertain environment with weak policy capacity. The

25.
The restrictive foreign exchange measures helped
maintain reserves. The effective depreciation of the
exchange rate and the increase in the parallel market rate
contributed to lower demand for foreign exchange this year.
As a result, in the first half of the year foreign exchange sales
were on average much lower in 2015 than in previous years.
However, the uncertainty on the availability of foreign
currency also undermined confidence and impacted trade.
Nevertheless, the authorities saw this as a useful side-effect
of the measures to the extent it avoided pressure on
international reserves, which actually increased slightly in the
first five months of the year.

The level of international reserves still appears adequate (Annex I). Compared to the
2013 Article IV report, the projected external position is much weaker. Nevertheless, the projected
level of international reserves at end-2015 exceeds conventional reserve adequacy indicators, at
almost seven months of imports of goods and services and 175 percent of the Fund’s reserve
adequacy (ARA) metric. Reserves are projected to decline further by end-2016, but they are
expected to remain at over five months of imports.
27.
The authorities are adopting a cautious approach to foreign exchange liberalization.
Since the last Article IV consultation, Iraq has removed most of the exchange restrictions previously
maintained. However, one new exchange restriction has been identified arising from the weekly
limits on cash purchases by financial institutions from the CBI.5 Furthermore, Iraq continues to
maintain a Multiple Currency Practice (MCP), which arises from the absence of a mechanism to
ensure that the official exchange rate and the parallel market exchange rate do not deviate by more
than two percent (see Informational Annex). The CBI confirmed its intention to remove the
remaining exchange restrictions and the MCP, in line with Iraq’s objective of accepting Article VIII
obligations. The authorities also removed the advance customs duty and income tax payment
because of their negative impact on market volatility. They also committed to removing the weekly
limits on cash transactions, once external conditions allow. Staff welcomed these steps and
recommended that the CBI set the appropriate pace of liberalization on the basis of the volumes
of auction sales and the behavior of the spread, which could be a good gauge of depreciation
pressures. Staff underlined that AML/CFT concerns should be best addressed through the
improvement of the relevant legislative and institutional framework.

In addition, Iraq continues to impose two exchange restrictions identified in 2009 (see Informational Annex).

The CBI plans to centralize the management of international reserves. Currently, CBI
reserves are mainly managed through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other central
banks. The CBI has as a long-term objective to move management of its reserves back to Baghdad,
which will require planning and implementation of concrete steps. Staff supported the CBI’s
intentions, but recommended to adopt a very gradual approach hinging on the build-up of
adequate capacity at the CBI. Furthermore, with technical assistance from the Fund the CBI updated
the 2008 guidelines for reserve management to bring them in line with the CBI Law and address
quantitatively all key reserve management strategic objectives, such as Strategic Asset Allocation,
credit risk limits, or liquidity needs. The next challenge for the CBI will be to effectively implement
this new framework.

C. Monitoring Financial Risks
The crisis is putting the banking system under stress, prompting the authorities to increase financial
system monitoring and push ahead with the reform of state-owned banks.
29.
The crisis will delay the development of the banking sector. With end-2014 deposits
of 22 percent of GDP and credit to the private sector of 7 percent of GDP, the banking system
remains underdeveloped due to lack of competitiveness, dominance of state-owned banks, and
limited business opportunities. The largest

NPL data should be treated with caution as Iraq does not compile Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) that are in
line with international standards. Upcoming technical assistance in this area from the Statistics Department of the
IMF, funded by the UK Department for International Development, will enhance CBI capacity to monitor banking
system developments.

The fiscal crisis risks worsening the financial condition of the state-owned banks. The
ballooning financing needs of the government—even though partially alleviated by CBI
refinancing—are putting additional stress on the state-owned banks, in particular Rasheed and
Rafidain banks. The banks have long suffered from extensive quasi-fiscal operations—such as loans
to state owned enterprises to pay employee salaries—and as a result are illiquid and likely insolvent,
despite a recent, modest increase in their capital. Furthermore, to allow state-owned banks to
provide more liquidity to the government, the CBI recently started allowing all commercial banks to
substitute half of their reserve requirement held as liquidity at the CBI with government securities.
Staff noted that this measure can be detrimental to banks’ liquidity and welcomed the authorities’
intentions to reverse it as soon as market liquidity conditions allow.
31.
Mindful of the risks, the CBI is stepping up the monitoring and supervision of the
banking sector. Supervisory coverage is still spotty, with state-owned banks effectively outside the
CBI supervision. Resources are limited, and standards are poor. To address these long-standing
weaknesses, the CBI continues its collaboration with Ernst and Young (E&Y) to co-train inspectors
and support the implementation of the CAMEL system (on-site inspections have already been
carried out for 15 out of 50 private banks) and has requested Fund technical assistance to improve
supervision regulatory framework and practices. The CBI also hired 35 additional staff in the
supervision department. It is promoting the implementation of information technology (IT) core
banking system in their operations. The CBI indicated that it would review the reserve requirement
measure as soon as conditions allow.
32.
The authorities are committed to accelerate the restructuring of Rasheed and Rafidain
banks. The authorities intend to speed up the restructuring process of these banks, which has been
dragging on since the signing of an MOU between the MOF, CBI, and the Board of Supreme Audit in
2006. The MOF and the CBI recently reviewed the implementation of the MOU, assessed the banks’
end-2014 financial stance, and set a timetable to fulfill unimplemented items. Staff recommended
a more ambitious approach, which could start with an audit of the banks’ balance sheets by an
international company, to be conducted in parallel to the legal clean-up of legacy losses. Staff
underlined that a revision of the draft law on state-owned banks to ensure arms-length relationship
between the MOF and bank management would also support state-owned banks.
33.
Money laundering, terrorist financing and governance issues risk undermining the
Iraqi financial system (Box 3). These threats are very high in Iraq, and are compounded by major
vulnerabilities of the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework underlined by the 2012 World Bank assessment report adopted by the Middle East and
North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF).

Box 3. Strengthening the Anti-money Laundering and Combating the Financing
of Terrorism (AML/CFT) and Anti-Corruption Frameworks in Iraq
Iraq faces serious corruption, money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (FT) risks that may
undermine the financial system and the wider economy. Surveys suggest that the perception of
corruption is very high in Iraq.1 Furthermore, the operations of ISIS increase the risks of terrorism financing.
ISIS relies on funding from a wide range of sources including the appropriation of cash held at state-owned
banks, exploitation of oil fields, and extortion of part of salary payments of Iraqi government employees.2
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) identified Iraq as a jurisdiction with AML/CFT strategic
deficiencies. In October 2013, Iraq made a high-level political commitment to work with the FATF and
MENAFATF to address these weaknesses based on an agreed action plan, but they remain as of the FATF
June 2015 assessment. Due to lack of sufficient progress in improving its AML/CFT regime, Iraq might be
subject to countermeasures that could impede its access to global financial markets.
The AML/CFT measures laid out in the action plan are powerful tools in addressing corruption3 and
limiting the ML/FT risks, and will allow Iraq to exit the FATF listing. In light of the security and capacity
constraints and the volatile political situation, a risk-based approach to the implementation of these
measures would assist in mitigating the main ML/FT risks. The priority is to adopt the draft AML/CFT law—
now under consideration by parliament—to bring it in line with the revised standards and allocate resources
for its effective implementation. It is also important to develop an AML/CFT comprehensive national strategy
and strengthen the existing key stakeholders—including the financial intelligence unit and the CBI AML
supervision (including banks having branches under ISIS control). Moreover, targeted financial sanctions in
line with the United Nations Security Council resolutions should be used to prevent and suppress terrorism
and terrorist financing.
Anti-corruption measures could also be stepped up to improve governance. Measures could include
adopting an anticorruption strategy, strengthening the asset declaration regime, and enhancing the
transparency of the procurement system.

STRUCTURAL REFORM FOR DIVERSIFIED, INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
Beyond the emergency, discussions focused also on the actions needed to diversify Iraq’s revenues,
streamline government spending, and strengthen the management of oil revenues through better
public financial management (PFM) and a stronger architecture for buffers. More broadly, Iraq needs
to reduce its dependency on oil by promoting private non-oil sector activity, and make growth more
inclusive by reducing the scope of public sector employment and improving labor market mechanisms.
While this ambitious reform plan will be difficult to implement in the current challenging
circumstances, the discussions provided clarity on prioritization and the medium-term reform path.

A. Stronger Institutions to Support Fiscal Discipline and Oil Revenue
Management
34.
Weak policy implementation underlines the need to strengthen the fiscal framework.
The impact of the oil price shock highlights the fiscal dependency on oil, while the 2013 government
spending boom undermined the capacity to react to the 2014 shocks by ratcheting up expenditures,
depleting fiscal buffers and making it more difficult to downsize spending when needed. This
experience points to the need for:


Introducing non-oil taxation to diversify revenue sources (medium term): The non-oil
revenue measures undertaken in the context of the 2015 budget, while bringing small yields, are
an important first step to strengthen revenue collection. The MOF should build on these
measures and consider the introduction of broader-based, simple revenue instruments such as:
(i) excises on big-ticket items, such as cars; (ii) a low-rate General Sales Tax (GST), less efficient
but simpler to administer than a Value Added Tax; (iii) property tax, e.g., on real estate;
(iv) consolidation of stamp taxes and fees (most of these have not been changed in nominal
terms and are essentially now “nuisance taxes”).



Streamlining government spending to improve service delivery (short/medium term). The
World Bank’s 2014 Public Expenditure Review pointed to areas that can generate savings and
improve the quality of government spending, such as (i) review of public employment and ghost
workers; (ii) reduction of subsidies, in particular in the energy sector and the Public Distribution
System (Box and Selected Issues Paper); and (iii) rationalization and prioritization of public
investment. The authorities have started work in some of these areas, e.g., by reviewing ghost
military personnel and prioritizing investment projects.

Box 4. Subsidy Systems in Iraq
Subsidies in Iraq are concentrated in food, fuel, and electricity. The authorities have raised fuel prices in
the past and made some progress reforming food subsidies (the Public Distribution System-PDS), and are
now planning to revise electricity tariffs. However, there is further room to streamline subsidies to make
them better targeted, more efficient, and less costly—but reform remains politically difficult. While
reforming the PDS would help improve governance and targeting of the poor, most savings would come
from eliminating energy subsidies, which cost the government ID 33 trillion in 2013 (over 12 percent of
GDP). But any reform would have to be accompanied by a broad improvement of social safety nets to
alleviate the impact on the poor.
Food subsidies (PDS). The PDS is an in-kind ration card system through which the government provides a
list of subsidized commodities to almost one-fifth of the population. The basket included flour, wheat,
sugar, vegetables, and children’s milk prior to the ISIS insurgency, but the conflict has affected the
efficiency of the distribution system, with only wheat—the most subsidized item—reportedly now available.
Most commodities are imported and subject to administered prices determined by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cabinet. The government to some extent restricted eligibility in recent years, but the cost
of the PDS still stood at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014. The government previously attempted to replace the
PDS with a cash transfer system, but widespread protests forced it to abandon the reform. Better targeting
could yield large savings: for example, excluding one-fifth of those currently eligible (an assumption to
proxy high-income quintiles in the absence of income distribution data) would bring savings of around 0.5
percent of GDP. Improvement in procurement timing could also save on import costs.
Fuel subsidies. Fuel prices at the pump in Iraq are low compared to

covered by pump prices. The structure of fuel subsidies is complex,
spanning the entire chain of production, refinery, and distribution phases. According to the Ministry of Oil,
direct costs of energy subsidies for fuel products are roughly ID 5 trillion a year (2.5 percent of GDP).
Raising pump prices would bring large savings: an increase of fuel prices to 80 percent of import price
would deliver ID 5 trillion (2.5 percent of GDP) in savings. A more comprehensive reform plan could identify
structural deficiencies, restructure some companies, and revisit pricing along the energy chain.

progressive tariff structure, with much higher rates levied
on top end consumers which is estimated to bring savings of ID 5–7 trillion (3–4 percent of GDP). The
reform is expected to have minimal effect on lifeline consumption and overall limited social impact as
assessed by a distributional analysis prepared by the World Bank, even though the results may be affected
by limited data availability. In addition, with World Bank support, the government is implementing a Social
Protection Strategic Framework which strengthens social safety nets in parallel to subsidy reform.



Strengthening PFM to contain spending pressures and increase resilience of the economy
(short term): A weak PFM framework has resulted in lack of fiscal discipline and overly
politicized allocation of oil resources. With technical assistance from the Fund and other
partners, the government should pursue priority PFM reforms, such as: a stronger role of the
MOF in managing the budget process; GFS-consistent budget classification; preparation of
monthly cash-flow projections in coordination with the CBI; reconciliation of government
financial flows and stocks; establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA); and a simple and
robust integrated financial management information system (IFMIS).



Restoring the DFI architecture to support fiscal buffers accumulation (medium term): The
fact that central bank resources are being tapped only in an extreme situation bears witness to
the robustness of the overall architecture. Staff recommended maintaining the legal framework
establishing the independence of the central bank, and, in parallel, restoring a governmentowned, CBI-managed DFI when the fiscal situation allows for the reconstitution of fiscal buffers.

B. A Diversified Economy and a Bigger Role for the Private Sector
35.
Iraq’s transition to a market economy is incomplete. Iraq still presents elements of a
transition economy, such as a financial sector dominated by large state-owned banks, pervasive
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and a business environment not conducive to growth. Staff and the
authorities agreed on the need to improve on these areas:


Leveling the playing field for private banks and strengthening financial infrastructure
(short/medium term): The restrictions placed on private banks in obtaining government
business have put them at a huge disadvantage compared to state-owned banks. The
authorities are taking steps to address this issue. Public entities can now accept letters of
guarantees and certified checks issued by private banks. The Ministry of Finance is allowed to
open letters of credit with private banks up to $10 million ($6 million previously). The threshold
to collect state fees by private banks has been increased, and the government is now allowing
SOEs to open accounts, make deposits, and pay salaries through private banks, which could
however weaken the governance of SOEs and the Ministry of Finance’s control over their
liquidity. Moreover, the CBI is finalizing regulations to introduce a credit bureau with the
assistance of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and is
considering establishing a deposit insurance scheme. Staff welcomed these steps and noted that
the deposit insurance scheme needs to be carefully designed, following best practice, to ensure
adequate capitalization and minimize contingent fiscal liabilities.



Reforming SOEs (medium term): 176 SOEs employing more than 500,000 workers, of which
most are inefficient and loss-making, are burdening the public sector. The authorities have
prepared a study on their reform, envisaging a systematic cost-benefit assessment of each
enterprise with the objective of deciding towards closure, privatization, or maintaining state
ownership after proper restructuring. Success of this reform will depend on a rigorous,
depoliticized assessment of SOEs including the application of strict, transparent criteria based on
international accounting standards. Realistic, but relatively rapid timelines and tight budgets
would also be needed to keep to a minimum pre-privatization preparations, including
restructuring and recapitalization, and the use of public resources.



Improving the business environment (medium term). Iraq does not do well on a number of
international indicators which point to the difficulties faced by the private sector (Figure 3). The
country ranks 156th out of 189 in the 2015 World Bank cross-country ranking of doing business,
down from 151st position in 2014. It ranks particularly low in starting a business, access to credit,
trading across borders, enforcement of contracts, and resolving insolvency. The procedures and
cost of land registration and constructions permits need to be streamlined. Road networks,
communication, and other infrastructure, and particularly production and distribution of
electricity should undergo major upgrading. Lastly, Iraq suffers from poor governance in the
public sector, and weak rule of law and judicial systems which also hinder the implementation
of effective anti-corruption frameworks.

C. More Inclusive Growth
36.
Despite high GDP growth in past years, Iraq has yet to achieve sustainable and
inclusive growth. Job creation has been weak, averaging around 1 percent a year as the oil sector—
the main driver of growth—is a capital intensive industry and hence absorbs only about 1 percent
of the labor force. At end-2014, the unemployment rate was 11 percent in 2014, and is particularly
high among the youth (20 percent) and women (21 percent).7 Female participation in the labor
force, at only 13 percent, is particularly low by international and regional standards. Aggregate labor
market indicators mask large geographical disparities, with unemployment of up to 20 percent in
some provinces.
37.
Even prior to the conflict, poverty was still relatively high, and most likely it has been
rising, especially because of the large refugee population. The headcount poverty rate declined
from 23.6 percent in 2007 to 19.8 percent in 2012, a relatively small gain compared to the
cumulative increase in non-oil GDP (50 percent) over the same period, before rising to 23 percent
at end-2014. Furthermore, poverty is concentrated in rural areas where it was on average 30 percent
at end-2013. The poor suffer from severe shortages of electricity and housing, their school
enrollment is low and they have limited access to water and sanitation. Iraq’s poor social conditions
are reflected in its 120th place in the 2013 Human Development Index. Shortfalls in inclusive growth
point to the need for:


Creating the conditions to compensate a shrinking role of the government in creating jobs
(medium term). About 50 percent of the working population is employed by the public sector.
But, given its increasingly tight budget constraints, the government will be able to take in much
fewer entrants to the labor market, and will have to reduce the generous pay structure in the
public sector which has increased the reservation wage and crowded out private employment.

7

2014 data exclude the conflict-affected areas. While data are not available, the conflict may have had mixed effects
on unemployment. The large number of IDPs may increase unemployment but the increase in security forces may
have had the opposite effect.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

While economic diversification and non-oil private sector growth will be important, job creation
will also require reforms in labor legislation and vocational and education systems with a view to
increasing labor force flexibility, creating better working conditions, enhancing protection for
private jobs, and matching the skills of the labor force with market demand.


Improving social safety nets (short/medium term). Iraq will have to start moving away from
public sector employment and universal subsidy systems as the main social support for the poor,
in favor of supporting private sector-led growth and developing more targeted social safety
nets. The authorities are strengthening the social safety nets with the support of the World Bank.

PURCHASE UNDER THE RAPID FINANCING
INSTRUMENT
38.
Iraq is facing present and urgent balance of payment and budget needs in 2015. Under
the baseline, which reflects the authorities’ adjustment efforts and access to external financing
including from the Fund, the ISIS insurgency and a collapse in oil prices are creating a balance of
payments deficit, leading to a decline of oil export revenues by 28 percent, budget revenues by
21 percent, and international reserves by 25 percent compared to 2014.
39.
The Iraqi authorities requested Fund financing under the RFI for 50 percent of quota.
Fund financing under the RFI would help address the budgetary impact of the ISIS insurgency and
the decline in oil prices. The RFI is designed to assist member countries that face a present and
urgent balance of payments need without having an upper-credit tranche quality economic
program in place. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide urgent financing to Iraq, which is not in
a position to undertake upper credit tranche conditionality at the present time because of limited
policy implementation capacity. The purchase of 50 percent of quota (equivalent to
SDR 594.2 million, about $839 million) would partly finance the budget, reflecting the fiscal
component of the balance of payments need and the need to support central bank independence.
Fund financing to the budget—and the borrowing from the markets and international financial
institutions that it would facilitate—would smooth the required fiscal adjustment over time and help
preserve the independence of the central bank by reducing recourse to indirect central bank
financing of the budget. To safeguard Fund resources, a Memorandum of Understanding will be
signed between the CBI and the Ministry of Finance, establishing the responsibilities and procedures
related to the use of resources provided under the RFI for support of the government of Iraq.8

8

In light of the nature of Iraq’s balance of payments problems, the resources provided under the 2010 Stand-By
arrangement were also intended for budget support and are being regularly repaid to the Fund.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

IRAQ

40.
As described in the Letter of Intent, the purchase under the RFI would help support a
comprehensive set of policies, composed of three elements:


Fiscal adjustment: The measures undertaken and planned by the authorities would contain the
deficit already this year. Assuming the full-year impact of some of these measures (e.g.,
electricity tariff increases, a prior action), further rationalizing of the investment budget and
deepening of other reforms starting next year, the fiscal position would return to a sustainable
path, with decreasing deficits in 2016–18 and a small surplus in 2019.



Financing: Stepped-up engagement with the Fund through RFI financing may facilitate lending
from the World Bank and reassure investors, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful
Eurobond issuance. The existence of a residual financing shortfall after taking into account these
potential financing sources is consistent with the RFI, which is not a Fund arrangement and as
such does not require full financing for the program period.



Structural reform: The authorities see the crisis as an opportunity to lay the ground for a
structural reform plan to improve fiscal management, gradually liberalize the foreign exchange
market, strengthen the financial system, and diversify the economy.

41.
The authorities are aware of the risks to CBI independence arising from its indirect
financial support to the government. To limit the negative effects on the credibility of the CBI and
the exchange rate peg, the authorities commit to draft MOUs to formalize the financial transactions
between the MOF and the commercial banks, and between the banks and the CBI, which will lay out
the terms and modalities of the operation (prior action). In the attached Letter of Intent, the
authorities also set a cap of ID 19 trillion to CBI liquidity operations in 2015.
42.
Iraq is expected to be able to repay its obligations to the Fund. With the proposed
purchase, and including the outstanding purchases of the 2010 SBA, the Fund’s exposure to Iraq in
2015 will reach $0.9 billion or 1.8 percent of gross international reserves and 1.4 percent of total
external debt. Iraq’s debt profile will increase mainly due to large domestic borrowing, including
related to indirect CBI financing, this year and especially in 2016. Projected medium-term external
debt is also higher than in the 2013 Article IV baseline because of the conservative assumption that
non-Paris Club debt will not be restructured before 2020, despite the authorities’ best efforts to
reach an agreement with the non-Paris Club creditors to whom Iraq has incurred sovereign arrears
(such debt restructuring operations will be reflected when concluded). The steep increase in debt in
2015–16 and the downside risks in the economic scenario underline the potential debt
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, Iraq’s debt is expected to remain sustainable over the medium-term.
43.


28

The authorities’ 2015 adjustment program is subject to a number of risks:
Worsening of the security situation: A serious military setback could weaken the authorities’
economic management and raise social and political tensions, making economic reform even
more challenging.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ



Further fall in oil prices: Given high volatility since last summer, prices could still slide further
from current levels during 2015, with adverse consequences for exports and budget revenues.



Weak implementation of the program: The introduction of fiscal measures under the
program, most of which are politically and socially sensitive, might proceed more slowly than
envisaged. Adoption of a forward-looking framework agreed with staff, ideally under a Staff
Monitored Program (SMP), would mitigate this risk.

44.
As Iraq is requesting access under the RFI, the authorities commit to undertake an
update Safeguards Assessment in the Letter of Intent. The most recent assessment of the CBI
was completed in 2010. The CBI continues to maintain important safeguards, including the annual
external audit by a reputable audit firm and publication of the CBI’s audited financial statement.
Given the logistical and technical complications of carrying out the Assessment, preparations will
start as soon as possible.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Iraq is facing a double shock arising from the ISIS insurgency and the sharp drop in
global oil prices. The shocks are putting the economy under extreme stress and are undermining
the authorities’ capacity to respond.
46.
The policies put in place by the authorities to deal with the shocks are in the right
direction. In the fiscal area, the authorities are addressing the fall in revenues with a mix of fiscal
adjustment and financing to smooth consumption and dampen the impact on the economy. In the
external area, the authorities are appropriately maintaining the peg with the U.S. dollar, which
provides a key anchor to the economy.
47.
But, risks are very high. The main risk derives from the stagnation or extension of the
conflict. But the outlook is also vulnerable to political tensions, poor policy implementation, and
further oil market shocks. To mitigate these risks, staff recommends implementing policies
rigorously and front-loading priority reforms to the extent possible.
48.
The 2015 budget represents a sound initial effort to address the pressure from lower
oil revenues and higher humanitarian and security spending. Staff welcomes the introduction of
new revenue measures, which should however be implemented swiftly and rigorously. The
composition of the fiscal effort is not ideal, as much of the adjustment will come from capital
spending rather than current items.
49.
But, insufficient financing will likely require further consolidation. Even with indirect
support from the CBI and financing from the Fund, the World Bank, and the markets, a large residual
financing shortfall remains. While it may be possible to obtain more borrowing from domestic and
external sources, the authorities may have to consider further fiscal measures to close the gap. The
authorities should however avoid the buildup of domestic or external arrears.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

IRAQ

50.
Some indirect central bank financing of the government is necessary at this juncture.
As other sources of financing are not immediately available, staff considers the indirect recourse to
central bank borrowing—subject to a well-defined limit—as appropriate because domestic
adjustment is right now already at its limits. Staff welcomes the cap to CBI support and the
authorities’ intention to transparently formalize the financial relations between the government, the
CBI, and the state-owned banks.
51.
The fixed exchange rate should be supported by the satisfaction of all bona fide
demand for foreign currency for current international transactions. Staff agrees with the
authorities’ commitment to maintaining the peg. International reserves are at an adequate level and
can absorb the projected decline in oil export revenues if the needed fiscal adjustment takes place.
Staff welcomes the recent elimination of the advance custom duty and income tax payment applied
to foreign exchange transactions and urges the authorities to meet all bona fide demand for foreign
currency for current international transactions. The authorities should also strive to minimize
volatility in the parallel market to avoid undermining the credibility of the CBI and of the exchange
rate regime, and negatively affect Iraq’s import-dependent, dollarized economy. Staff does not
recommend approval of the three exchange restrictions and the MCP described in paragraph 27 and
the Informational Annex, since the authorities have no timetable to remove such measures.
52.
The crisis is increasing tensions in the banking system. In light of the crisis’ impact on
private banks and the role of state-owned banks in financing the government, staff welcomes the
steps taken by the CBI to strengthen banking supervision and the authorities’ commitment to press
ahead with the restructuring of Rasheed and Rafidain banks.
53.
The authorities should bring the AML/CFT and anti-corruption frameworks in line with
international standards and effectively implement them. This would prevent illicit financial flows
in the financial sector, disrupt the financing of terrorist groups, and enhance the business climate.
Making progress in the AML/CFT area—first of all by adopting the draft law under examination by
parliament—is also crucial to address the listing of Iraq as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT
deficiencies by the Financial Action Task Force.
54.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintain momentum on the
restructuring of the economy. The authorities are aware that broad structural reform is needed to
improve the resilience and inclusiveness of economic growth. Key elements include strengthening
fiscal institutions to support continued consolidation and insulate the economy from shocks;
completing the transition to a market economy by pushing ahead with the private banking sector
development and SOE restructuring; and improving the business environment, governance, and
labor markets institutions. Most of these reforms can be realistically be put in place only in the
medium term, but staff urges the authorities to press ahead with the high-priority measures,
particularly in the PFM area.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

55.
Work on improving the quality and availability of economic data should continue.
Statistics, in particular in the fiscal and balance of payment areas, has serious shortcomings that
significantly hamper surveillance. The IMF stands ready to provide further technical assistance in this
area.
56.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for an RFI with access equivalent to
SDR 594.2 million (50 percent of quota). The policies laid out in the LOI are adequate to deal with
the present and urgent balance of payments and budget needs triggered by the ISIS insurgency and
the collapse in oil prices. In the future, staff recommends adopting a forward-looking framework,
ideally under an SMP, to be monitored jointly with the authorities, which would help facilitate
implementation of the adjustment strategy and allow for building a track record of sound policies.
Such framework may be particularly important in light of the persistence of the external financing
need at least through 2016 and the large downside risks.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
July 9, 2015
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431, USA
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
With this letter, we request financial assistance from the IMF at an utmost difficult time in our
country’s history. Iraq is facing a mortal terrorist threat, while the economy has been hit by the
collapse in oil prices.
1.
The terrorist attack by the so-called ISIS has put Iraq in great danger. The Iraqi security
forces have made notable progress in the fight against the terrorists, with the help of our
international partners. In fact, a significant portion of the territory captured by ISIS after its invasion
has been already retaken. However, the war is not likely to end soon and will continue to affect the
lives of Iraqis as well as the national economy.
2.
The terrorist attack has resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and caused a dramatic
humanitarian crisis. More than 3 million people have been displaced in the northern regions since
June 2014, in addition to 250 thousand Syrian refugees whom Iraq has been sheltering since the civil
war in neighboring Syria. Nearly half of the internally displaced persons are children, forced to live in
difficult conditions and to face serious health risks. The refugee crisis is also putting great pressure
on Iraq’s infrastructure system and public services. Furthermore, the war has destroyed public and
private assets and infrastructure, is seriously hampering economic activity in the non-oil sector, and
has undermined domestic and external trade.
3.
As the ISIS terrorist threat expanded, world oil prices fell by 40 percent in the space of a few
months, causing a huge external shock to our balance of payments and our budget revenues, which
depend predominantly on oil export receipts. The shock has caused a strong deterioration of the
current account balance, drained our international reserves, and boosted the Iraqi government
budget deficit.
4.
Against this background, we request access of 50 percent of quota (equivalent to
SDR 594.2 million, about US$ 828.9 million) through the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). We also
request that the assistance under the RFI be channeled to the budget. It is our expectation that the
IMF financial support will have a catalytic effect in helping generate additional financial resources to
close the fiscal gap and ease pressure on our balance of payments for the coming year. In this Letter

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

of Intent (LOI) we describe our policies for 2015. We believe that the policies set forth in this LOI are
adequate to address the present and urgent balance of payments problem.
Economic developments
5.
Overall, GDP declined by 2.1 percent in 2014, and is expected to grow modestly by
0.5 percent in 2015. The non-oil economy is suffering from the struggle against the so-called ISIS.
Non-oil activity in the four provinces has collapsed in 2014 and remains very low, contributing to a
decline in non-oil GDP growth of almost 9 percent in 2014, compared to 10 percent growth in 2013.
In 2015, non-oil activity is expected to decline further due to the impact of the conflict, the decline
in private sector investment and FDI, and limited government spending, particularly on investment
projects, because of the decline in oil prices.
6.
The oil sector has continued to expand, despite the exceptionally difficult environment. The
main impact of the conflict on the oil sector so far has been the suspension of oil exports through
the pipeline to Ceyhan, which is now essentially out of commission because of continued sabotage.
In contrast, we have increased production of southern oil fields, which comprise about 90 percent of
production. In 2014, oil production rose by 4.5 percent from 2013, reaching 3.11 million barrels per
day (mbpd), and exports increased by 5.3 percent to 2.52 mbpd. This year, according to conservative
projections production should rise to 3.45 mbpd (11 percent over 2014) and export should hit
3.1 mbpd (23 percent). These results will be possible thanks to the agreement reached in December
of last year between the Federal Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG),
envisaging a contribution to exports from northern fields (including Kirkuk) of 550 thousand barrels
per day (bpd), on average.
7.
Notwithstanding the economic shocks and high uncertainty, inflation has remained low
outside ISIS-controlled areas. Inflation at end-2014 was 1.6 percent, declining further to 0.5 percent
in April 2015 largely because of deflation in food and commodity prices. However, our estimates
exclude inflation for four governorates because of the security situation, although anecdotal
evidence suggests that inflation rates are higher in these areas.
8.
Despite the good performance in production and export volumes, the collapse in oil prices
in the second half of 2014 has dealt a huge blow to our external balance, as revenues from oil
exports decreased from $89 billion in 2013 to $83 billion last year and are expected to decline to
$62 billion this year. Therefore, the current account balance turned negative in 2014, to a deficit
of 2.8 percent of GDP, and is expected to deteriorate further in 2015 with the deficit increasing to
almost 8.6 percent of GDP. This decline is expected despite the compression of private sector’s
imports of goods, a narrowing of the service deficit and the postponement of the final war
reparation payment for Kuwait to next year. This year, net capital outflows, largely due to the
settlement of arrears with International Oil Companies (IOCs) contracted in 2014, are also forecast to
contribute to an increase in the balance of payment deficit.

9.
As a result of these external pressures, international reserves (including the DFI) have
declined from $84 billion at end-2013 to $67 billion at end-2014, and are expected to fall further to
$50 billion by the end of 2015. Reserves, however, continue to be adequate, are not expected to
decline below 6 months of imports and 85 percent of the deposit base in 2015. Gross international
reserves of the CBI now include the balance of the Development Fund for Iraq, which was closed
down as a foreign account in May 2014 and replaced with a government account in dollars at the
CBI. Foreign exchange receipts from oil exports are now collected directly in the CBI accounts
abroad, with the equivalent amounts credited to the government account in Baghdad.
Fiscal sector
10.
Due to the difficult political situation, the 2014 budget was not approved. The government
was still able to contain the deficit at slightly above 5 percent of GDP, down from nearly 6 percent
of GDP in 2013. The lack of budget approval triggered a fiscal rule that capped monthly outlays to
one-twelfth of their annual level during 2013 and blocked new investment projects. In addition, the
transfer to the KRG was lower than expected due to a lack of agreement on oil revenue sharing.
However, under strong security and humanitarian spending pressures, and the decline in oil prices in
the second half of the year, the government was forced to accumulate $6.8 billion in arrears on
investment spending and IOCs and ID 2.3 trillion ($2.0 billion) to domestic contractors.
11.
Partly due to repressed spending in 2014 and continued needs arising from the struggle
with ISIS, the initial draft 2015 budget was expansionary, envisaging a 33 percent expenditure
growth. Persistently weak oil prices convinced us of the need to further strengthen the fiscal
position. As a result, the government pulled the budget already in parliament and introduced a
number of revenue-enhancing and expenditure-reducing measures. Revenues measures include
introducing the customs tariffs from the 2010 Customs Law and sales tax on cars, tobacco, alcohol,
mobile phone cards and internet usage. The revised budget draft was swiftly approved, with a
spending envelope of ID 117.8 trillion (58 percent of GDP) and a deficit of ID 24 trillion (12 percent
of GDP).
12.
With some delay due to the difficult political situation, the non-oil tax measures have been
published in the official gazette at end-May and will be implemented starting on August 1. The full
application of the 2010 Custom Law tariff schedule has been delayed by technical difficulties arising
from its simultaneous introduction on all national borders. However, the final preparations are about
to be completed and we plan to start applying the new tariff schedule on all border posts in August.
On a temporary basis, the Cabinet of Ministers asked the MOF to introduce a 5 percent advance
custom duty payment and a 3 percent advance income tax applied to the purchase of foreign
exchange for import purposes, starting in March in order to compensate for the loss of revenue.
However, this measure increased the volatility of the parallel foreign exchange market, and we
removed it in June.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13.
Partly to address the loss in revenues from these delays, we have instituted an interministerial committee, chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister, to reprioritize investment expenditures
leading to the elimination or postponement of less necessary projects that have not been executed
to date. The committee is examining project selection and procurement practices, with the objective
of improving project selection, implementation capacity and monitoring, while maintaining the
rights of contractors and suppliers. This process involves identifying investment priorities based on
a number of criteria, such as (i) actual cumulative execution rates of projects, (ii) geographic location,
(iii) intersectoral linkages, (iv) national security and foreign exchange considerations, (v) degree of
labor intensiveness and resource use, (vi) profits achieved or losses realized as a result of making
financing available or withholding it. In this connection, the Ministry of Finance commits to sign an
MOU with the Ministry of Planning to execute only high priority investments projects, as early as
possible.
14.
In the context of our efforts to improve the delivery of electricity to the Iraqi population and
contain energy subsidies, the Ministry of Electricity has recently finalized the reform of electricity
tariffs, which introduces strongly progressive rates for the largest consumers with minimal impact on
the rates for low-income households. The reform, which is expected to bring in annual savings of
ID 5–7 trillion, is an important step to advance the reform of the energy sector. Cabinet will soon
approve the tariff reform (Prior Action).
15.
Over the past years, we have increased domestic fuel prices, which are now among the
highest in oil producing countries. The government is planning to take further steps to liberalize the
sector and improve its efficiency. In particular, we intend to improve the distribution network for
high-octane gasoline in all stable governorates, while encouraging international companies to
operate in Iraq, with the objective of establishing additional fueling stations. We are also
undertaking steps to lay the ground for the adoption of fuel cards system for gasoline, gasoil, and
LNG, which should be rolled out by year-end. We are assessing potential savings from the reduction
of gasoline imports which would result from raising gasoline prices to cost-recovery levels.
16.
As a result of these additional measures, we expect the deficit to be contained to around
ID 35 trillion (17 percent of GDP) this year, including taking into account an additional $10 billion
payments to the IOCs. In 2016, the full impact of the fiscal measures introduced this year and the
containment of other current spending, together with higher oil revenues thanks to stronger oil
exports, should lower the deficit to about 10 percent of GDP.

Our strategy to finance the deficit relies on tapping available financing domestically as well
as from external sources. We have obtained loans from the Trade Bank of Iraq for $2 billion and
placed a total of ID 8.4 trillion of T-bills with state-owned banks Rasheed and Rafidain. Of these
T bills, ID 4 trillion were made possible by a recent CBI regulation allowing the substitution of
50 percent of the reserve requirement with government securities. The CBI plans to reverse this
measure as soon as market liquidity conditions allow. Furthermore, we are drawing on our 2009 SDR
allocation at the IMF. Based on the provisions of the 2015 budget, we have tasked three investment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

IRAQ

banks to prepare the issuance of $6 billion. We plan to issue the first tranche of $2 billion in the
coming months. The placement of the following tranches will be facilitated by the issuance of a
credit rating, which we are actively pursuing. Finally, we are seeking financial support from the
international financial institutions, primarily from the IMF (in the form of the RFI purchase, for
$0.8 billion) and the World Bank (Development Policy Loan and emergency reconstruction
assistance for a total of $2 billion).
18.
In light of the already large fiscal effort and the limited available financing, the CBI has
started facilitating commercial bank lending to the government by discounting government
securities for about ID 5 trillion. In the course of 2015, given the importance of meeting obligations
towards the IOCs and in case such support is needed, the CBI may consider discounting up to an
additional 14 trillion in the secondary market to facilitate liquidity conditions of commercial banks,
possibly through longer-term bonds. This liquidity support will be soon formalized in separate
MOUs between (i) the CBI and the state-owned banks and (ii) the state-owned banks and the MOF
(Prior Action). The MOUs, as relevant, will lay out (i) terms of repayment of the securities used for
the financial support; and (ii) the government’s commitment to provide the state-owned banks with
the amounts needed to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Additional MOUs could be signed
subsequently with other commercial banks as needed. Despite all identified financing, we are left
with a residual financing gap of ID 13 trillion, which we expect to fill with domestic and foreign
sources.
19.
We are pursuing a prudent debt management strategy. We are considering developing and
deepening the domestic debt market through the introduction of new instruments, which would
diversify our financing sources. In addition, we will step up monitoring of domestic debt to maintain
it at sustainable levels. In 2015, additional borrowing will be necessary to mitigate the impact of the
oil price shock and the ISIS terrorist attack, but external debt is expected to remain broadly
unchanged at about $64 billion in 2015 (37 percent of GDP) thanks to the planned settlement of
arrears of US$ 6.8 billion to IOCs this year. We are making progress in negotiations with non-Paris
Club creditors, which account for about $40 billion, and we expect to conclude agreements with
some creditors in the course of this year for rescheduling at terms comparable to the 2004 Paris
Club agreement. Full rescheduling of this debt at these terms would reduce it to $9.3 billion. Given
Iraq’s fiscal and external sectors’ heavy dependence on oil export receipts, we will stay current on
external payment obligations to IOCs.
20.
We are strengthening our public financial management procedures to support fiscal
discipline and efficient use of oil resources. With the support from the World Bank, we are working
on the introduction of an integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS). The
Shura Council is examining a new public financial management law, to be effective for next fiscal
year, which among other measures lays out steps to introduce a Treasury Single Account. We intend
to continue relying on technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank to support these
efforts.

Exchange rate and financial sector policies
21.
Recognizing that a strong and stable currency provides a key nominal anchor to the
economy, we maintained the peg to the U.S. dollar despite the instability created by the ISIS terrorist
attack and the balance of payments pressures triggered by the oil price shock. Thanks to the efforts
of the CBI to push forward the liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the spread between
the official and parallel exchange rates fell from 8 percent in May 2013 to below 1 percent in
November 2014, a striking outcome considering the start of the ISIS terrorist attack in June last year.
However, the exchange rate spread has increased in the course of 2015, reaching 16 percent in midJune, partly due to the introduction of the advance customs duty and presumptive income tax, and
the CBI’s steps to contain dollar cash sales in an effort to shift demand to the wire market and limit
illegal cash outflows from the country. Therefore, to reduce the parallel market spread we removed
the advance customs duty and presumptive income tax and we reduced the advance deposit
requirement to five days in June. These measures had an immediate calming effect on foreign
exchange market. We also expect that the rigorous implementation of a circular issued in February
this year, which liberalizes further the foreign exchange market, will help reducing the spread.
22.
We have intensified our efforts to strengthen the management of the international reserves
of the CBI. Based on several years of experience, we have amended 2008 reserve management
guidelines to reflect the operational needs of daily reserve management and to align them with the
CBI law. We are also working towards our long-term goal to bring active management of
international reserves to the CBI in Baghdad. We are greatly benefitting from the technical
assistance provided by the IMF in this area.
23.
We are closely monitoring the impact of the crisis on the financial sector and stand ready to
take measures as needed. The financial sector is suffering as the violence destroys physical assets,
daily economic activity is disrupted and trade disruptions affect import financing. Furthermore,
contraction in investment spending is greatly affecting the private sector and in turn bank credit.
Therefore, growth in credit to private sector fell from 16 percent in 2013 to 5 percent in 2014 but is
expected to contract by 2 percent this year. We also expect increase in nonperforming loan (NPL)
ratios because of falling business confidence, lower private sector activities, and physical destruction
and robberies of some banking institutions at the beginning of the ISIS terrorist attack. In order to
better monitor risks to the financial sector, we are stepping up our surveillance, including through
the improvement of financial reporting and monetary data with the help of technical assistance from
the IMF. In particular, we are working with the IMF to improve our Financial Soundness Indicators to
internationally acceptable standards.
24.
We are stepping up our efforts to develop the banking sector, a key element in our longterm strategy to strengthen the non-oil economy and private sector activity. To increase public trust
in the banking system and deepen financial intermediation, Cabinet is examining the law on the
deposit insurance scheme, which will be fully funded by the government and participating
commercial banks. We will facilitate the increase in information coverage through the forthcoming

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

IRAQ

Credit Information Bureau to support commercial banks’ credit assessment of clients. To level the
playing field between private banks and state-owned banks, we have allowed the public entities to
open accounts and pay salaries through private banks starting May this year. These initiatives will
create new important opportunities for private banks to provide services and compete with the
state-owned sector.
25.
We are pressing ahead with the restructuring of the state-owned banks Rasheed and
Rafidain. The Executive Committee for Restructuring has made progress, mainly analyzing in detail
the impact of inherited debt and war losses on the balance-sheets of the banks and urging the
banks to implement the unfulfilled paragraphs of the MOU.
26.
We are taking measures to strengthen banking supervision. The CBI has recently extended
its contract with Ernst & Young, which assists us in improving an off-site and on-site supervision
practices and train our employees. The bank has also hired 35 new contractual staff to strengthen
enforcement in the banking supervision department. The CBI is paying increased attention to bank
reporting with the aim to detect potential problems at early stage, and intends to enhance and
modernize the banking supervision. The banking supervision department is also stepping up the
monitoring of state-owned banks Rasheed and Rafidain, which are of systemic importance in line
with the CBI’s duties of supervising the entire banking sector.
27.
To enhance safeguards, we confirm that the CBI remains the exclusive authority in charge of
foreign exchange reserves. As we are requesting access under the RFI, we commit to completing an
updated safeguards assessment of the CBI. The CBI will provide the Fund staff all the requested
information needed for the assessment, including the most recent external audit report and the
authorization to speak with its external auditor and stands ready to receive a safeguards mission as
soon as needed. We are also committed to prepare and implement an action plan with regard to
recommendations that will emerge from the safeguards assessment. We agree to update the
Memorandum of Understanding between the CBI and the Ministry of Finance dated February 17,
2011, covering management of foreign exchange reserves and the channeling of IMF budget
support under the RFI to the latter.
Conclusion
28.
We believe that the policies set forth in the letter are adequate to address the present and
urgent balance of payments problem. We will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose.
29.
We intend to continue to maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund in an effort to
strengthen Iraq’s balance of payments, refrain from measures or policies that would compound
Iraq’s balance of payments difficulties and maintain macroeconomic stability. The government does
not intend to impose new, or intensify existing, restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, introduce new, or intensify existing, trade restrictions for
balance of payments purposes, or enter into bilateral payments agreements which are inconsistent
with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly.

Annex II. External Assessment
1.
The joint assessment of the level of international reserves and the exchange rate
shows that Iraq’s external position remains sustainable. Iraq’s external position has worsened
recently due to the collapse in oil prices but should recover with the planned ramp-up of oil
production and the implementation of sound fiscal policies. The fiscal adjustment in 2015 is
assumed to continue over the medium term, allowing for the resumption of fiscal surpluses from
2019. This fiscal path would help achieve current account surpluses and attract foreign investment
flows, overall strengthening balance of payment outcomes.
Adequacy of international reserves
2.
The current level of international reserves of
the CBI seems adequate. Reserve accumulation was
strong during 2010–2013, before starting to decline
from 2014.1 Nevertheless, reserves continue to exceed
conventional measures of reserve adequacy and reserve
buffers are projected to remain adequate over the
medium run. A cross-county comparison indicates that
the current level of the CBI reserves as a percentage of
GDP is comparable to that of other oil exporting
countries.

Exchange rate assessment
3.
Iraq’s real and nominal effective exchange rates (REER and NEER) have appreciated
over the past two years. From end 2012 until April 2015, the NEER appreciated by 27 percent on
a cumulative basis, in line with the appreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis Iraq’s trade partner
currencies. Negative inflation differentials have persisted between Iraq and its main trade partners,
with differentials declining over the years. As a result, the REER appreciated by 16 percent over the
same period. Falling oil prices have translated into a large negative terms of trade shock over the
medium term.
4.
The External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) for Iraq suggests that the REER is broadly
in line with the fundamentals. The current account in 2015 is projected to record a deficit of
8.6 percent of GDP, compared to a fitted value of 11.6 percent. The widening of the current account
deficit is driven by lower oil prices which also hurt the fiscal position, thus creating a fiscal policy gap
of –3.8 percent of GDP. Together with the fitted current account deficit derived from the model, this
policy gap results in a current account gap of –0.8 percent of GDP, implying a slight overvaluation of
Iraq’s REER by 3.5 percent. This result should however be treated with caution due to uncertainties
arising from Iraq’s dependence on oil export revenues, limitations of estimates of the fitted current
account, and sensitivity of the model to underlying assumptions.

Annex III. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
The collapse of international oil prices and the ISIS insurgency have exerted fiscal pressures and are
expected to significantly increase the fiscal deficit in 2015 despite consolidation efforts. As a result,
public debt is projected to increase significantly more than anticipated in the 2013 Article IV, mainly
because of additional borrowing required to finance the large fiscal deficits projected for 2015 and
2016 and more conservative assumptions about the rescheduling of non-Paris Club debt. The domestic
debt stock is expected to more than double in 2015, raising total public debt to 69 percent of GDP in
2015, and to reach a peak at around 73 percent of GDP in 2016. But the debt remains sustainable over
the medium-term, given the projected fiscal path envisaging fiscal consolidation and improved growth
prospects, supporting a reduction of public debt to 48 percent of GDP by end 2020.
1.
Iraq’s public debt has averaged around 35 percent of GDP in recent years but is
projected to rise sharply in 2015 and 2016 to finance large fiscal deficits before embarking on
a downward trend in 2017. The increase in the debt ratio in 2015 to 69 percent of GDP is explained
by new borrowing necessary to finance the large projected fiscal deficit, a sharp nominal GDP
contraction and a negative GDP deflator of 22 percent resulting from oil price declines. Funds will
mainly be raised from the domestic banking system. State-owned banks in particular are expected
to buy government securities which will be discounted by the Central Bank of Iraq. The stock of
domestic debt is estimated to increase from 10 percent of GDP in 2014 to 33 percent of GDP in
2015. The planned issuance of Eurobonds, funding from the IMF and the World Bank and
unidentified external financing assumed to fill part of the fiscal financing gap would increase
external debt to about 37 percent of GDP, up from 29 percent of GDP in 2014. As progress in
negotiations of non-Paris Club debt is expected to be slow, staff conservatively assumes that nonParis Club debt will not be rescheduled over the projection period (even though the authorities are
exercising their best efforts to reach agreement on rescheduling with non-Paris Club creditors) and
that external debt will decline only gradually until 2020. Debt as a share of GDP is forecast to breach
the critical threshold of 70 percent of GDP in 2016 mainly as a result of additional domestic
borrowing to fill the fiscal financing gap, before embarking on a downward trend in line with
projected improvements in the fiscal stance and faster economic growth. Public debt is projected to
fall to about 48 percent of GDP by 2020, mainly due to a reduction in domestic debt.
2.
An assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions for Iraq (forecast track record
compared to other countries) is hampered by severe data weaknesses. Available data point to
optimism in historic forecasts for real GDP and the primary balance, while the inflation forecast
error—on average—has only recently been in line with the inter-quartile range of other countries.
Since growth is mainly driven by the oil sector, GDP forecasts change with underlying assumptions
about oil price developments. Staff projects slow growth in 2015 due to the negative impact of the
ISIS insurgency and lower oil prices, and a rebound in 2016 on the back of base effects and
improvements in the outlook for oil revenues. Over the medium-term, growth is expected to
average 7-8 percent, a downward revision from the 2013 Article IV projections which assumed
significantly higher oil prices. It is important to note that Iraq continues to be highly dependent on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

IRAQ

oil export receipts, making it vulnerable to further oil price volatility, and thereby to macroeconomic
imbalances which raise risks to longer-term public debt sustainability.
Shocks and Stress Tests:
3.
Standardized stress tests indicate that Iraq’s debt level and financing needs are
sensitive to shocks. Iraq is particularly vulnerable to GDP growth shocks (which could materialize in
case of a deterioration of the security situation or delays in the ramp-up of oil production) and
shocks to the primary balance which would raise the debt ratio significantly over the medium run.
Permanently higher interest rates would raise debt levels particularly towards the end of the
projection period. Large gross financing needs which arise from high rollover requirements of debt
owed to the central bank present a risk under all stress scenarios.


Growth shock. Under this scenario, the baseline real GDP growth profile is reduced by one
standard deviation calculated over the recent 9-year period (based on available data). This
corresponds to an average growth rate of 5.8 percent of GDP over 2016–20, compared with
baseline average growth of 7.6 percent. Under this scenario, the public debt ratio increases by
6 percentage points of GDP in 2016 and 15 percentage points of GDP in 2017, bringing the debt
ratio to 61 percent of GDP by 2020. On average, the debt path is 13 percentage points of GDP
higher than in the baseline over the period 2016-2020.



Primary balance shock. This scenario increases the noninterest expenditure to GDP by about
4 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017 (excluding any effect on revenues). The scenario further
assumes an interest rate increase of 25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP deterioration in the
primary balance. This shock would increase public debt to GDP by 4 percentage points of GDP in
2016 with the incremental annual debt increase widening over the medium term compared to
the baseline, raising total public debt to 58 percent of GDP by 2020.



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications of a large increase in nominal
interest rates relative to the baseline throughout the projection period. The shock would slow
the process of debt reduction down and would bring the public debt ratio to 68 percent of GDP
in 2020.



Real exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes a one-time 4 percent depreciation in the real
exchange rate. Given the relatively small stock of external debt, the shock would increase the
total debt-to-GDP ratio by 1 percentage point of GDP on average over the medium term. Gross
financing would be correspondingly higher.



Combined shock. The combined shock for Iraq leads to a notably higher public debt path to
GDP, reflecting: (a) lower GDP growth by 4.5 percentage points in 2016 and 2017, (b) higher
nominal interest rates (by around 20 percent on average), (c) a 4 percent real exchange rate
depreciation, and (d) increases in the noninterest expenditure to GDP by about 4 percent of
GDP. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is pushed up to 81 percent of GDP in 2016 and
rises to 94 percent of GDP in 2020, with gross financing needs increasing accordingly.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

4.
Oil price shock. This scenario models the effect of a decline in real GDP growth as a
consequence of a sharp oil price shock in 2016. Oil prices are assumed to fall by 20 percent in 2016
and to converge only gradually to the baseline over the medium run. Real GDP growth would drop
by more than 5 percentage points in 2016 but the effect of the shock would gradually phase out in
the following years. The path of government revenues, the fiscal balance and financing needs would
also be altered. Debt to GDP in this scenario would increase to around 86 percent of GDP in 20162018 and then fall to 71 percent of GDP towards the end of the forecast period.

45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ EMBIG (bp), an average over the last 3 months, 10-Feb-15 through 11-May-15.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG (bp).
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = effective nominal interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments
The most recent safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) was completed in 2010
under the SBA that expired in February 2013. While the assessment concluded that significant
safeguards risks remain, it noted that the CBI maintains important safeguards recommended by
previous assessments, including annual external audits by reputable audit firms and publication of
the CBI’s audited financial statements.
Exchange Arrangement
Iraq’s de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements have been retroactively reclassified to a
conventional peg arrangement, effective January 15, 2012. The Central Bank Law provides the Board
of the CBI with power to formulate exchange rate policy, and the Board has maintained its policy to
keep the official exchange rate at 1,166 per U.S. dollar since January 15, 2012. The CBI stands ready
to provide foreign exchange at the official exchange rate plus commissions for permissible
transactions through its daily auctions (allocations), establishing a peg. However, because certain
transactions are excluded from the access to the CBI auctions, many transactions take place at
parallel market exchange rates. The CBI publishes the daily volume of the auction allocation on its
website.
Iraq continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2 but no
longer maintains any exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices subject to Article XIV,
Section 2, and currently maintains three exchange restrictions and one multiple currency practice
(MCP) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. Two of four exchange
restrictions identified in 2009 have been removed, with two remaining. All exchange restrictions
identified in 2012 have now been removed. Although the various measures limiting the availability
of foreign exchange, which gave rise to the MCP identified in 2012, have evolved and changed over
the last three years, the MCP remains in place. One new exchange restriction has been identified in
2015.
The foreign exchange system in Iraq has been constantly modified over the last few years. Until
March 2009, Iraq maintained a generally open current and capital accounts. However, access to
foreign exchange from the official auction organized by the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) became
subject to various limits starting in 2009. The limits were modified several times, in part reflecting
the authorities’ efforts to liberalize the system while keeping speculative demand for foreign
exchange cash under control, as well as volatile security conditions and pressure on official reserves
from fluctuations in global oil prices.
In 2009, the Fund identified four exchange restrictions, two of which have now been removed. The
two exchange restrictions that have been removed were based upon CBI circulars that have now
been nullified. These restrictions arose from (i) the requirement to submit a tax certificate and a
letter of nonobjection stating that the companies do not owe any taxes to the government before

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

IRAQ

non-Iraqi companies may transfer proceeds of current international transactions out of the country;
and (ii) the requirement that before non-Iraqis may transfer proceeds in excess of ID 15 million out
of Iraq, the banks are required to give due consideration of legal obligations of these persons with
respect to official entities, which must be settled before allowing any transfer. The exchange
restrictions that remain in place arise from (i) the requirement to pay all obligations and debts to the
government before proceeds of investments of investors, and salaries and other compensation of
non-Iraqi employees may be transferred out of Iraq; and (ii) an Iraqi balance owed to Jordan under
an inoperative bilateral payments agreement.
All exchange restrictions identified in 2012 have now been removed. In 2012, the Fund identified five
additional exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice (MCP). In 2013, four of these five
exchange restrictions were removed as the relevant circulars were nullified. These measures were:
(i) the requirement to submit a tax clearance certificate that all taxes (even unrelated to the
transaction) have been paid before foreign exchange for payment and transfer of certain current
international transactions can be purchased in the auction; (ii) the limitation that corporates can
purchase foreign exchange in the auction for import transactions only; (iii) a limit of US$75,000
a week on the availability of foreign exchange cash in the auction for money transfer companies
(MTCs) and money exchange bureaus (MEBs); and (iv) a limit of US$4 million a week on the
availability of foreign exchange cash in the auction for banks. In 2015, the final exchange restriction
identified in 2012, arising from the limit on individual purchases of cash foreign exchange, was also
removed. This exchange restriction originally arose from the US$5,000 limit on individual purchases
of cash foreign exchange, imposed by Circular No. 19 of October 1, 2012. The CBI reports that this
limit is now only indicative, due to the repeal of previous circulars, and therefore this measure no
longer gives rise to an exchange restriction. However, this has been communicated to banks only by
informal electronic message. Therefore, this measure no longer gives rise to an exchange restriction
as the limit is now only indicative.10
The 2015 Article IV mission identified one new exchange restriction arising from weekly limits on
purchases of cash by financial institutions from the CBI.11 Recently these limits have been raised to
$300,000 per week for banks with capital of at least ID 250 billion, $150,000 per week for MTCs, and
$50,000 per week for MEBs. Similar limits on the availability of foreign exchange in the CBI auction
10

The advance deposit requirement for purchase of foreign exchange, originally identified in 2014, no longer gives
rise to an exchange restriction given that the authorities assert that it is for purposes of assessing the bona fide of
exchange transactions within the now “normal” 5-day limit. This measure was originally imposed by Circular No. 2/24
(Jan. 25, 2014); however, most provisions of this circular were nullified by Circular No. 9/3/26 of February 2015. The
advance deposit requirement continues in force by virtue of paragraphs b (wire sales) and h (cash sales) of the
February 2015 circular. The original requirement was that banks wishing to purchase foreign exchange must deposit
with the CBI the Iraqi dinar equivalent of the amount requested for purchase “one week prior to the date of actual
purchase.” The period was subsequently changed to 15 days by the February 2015 circular, then to 10 days on
May 25, 2015 by a verbal instruction of the CBI, and to five days in June 2015.

11

The mission also discussed another new exchange restriction arising from a requirement for importers to pay a
portion of custom duties and income tax that will be due on imports at the time of purchase of foreign exchange
necessary for such imports. The requirement was cancelled in June 2015, and hence the exchange restriction was also
removed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

for banks, MTCs, and MEBs were originally imposed beginning in 2010 and found to give rise to
exchange restrictions. Later these measures were removed, and thus the exchange restrictions were
also removed).
The MCP was originally identified by the Fund in 2012 and continues to remain in place, even
though the various measures limiting the availability of foreign exchange have evolved and
changed. The MCP arises from the official action to limit the purchase of foreign exchange, with no
mechanism to ensure that exchange rates in the official auction and in the market do not deviate
from each other by more than two percent. The average spread between the official and market
rates was around 10 percent in May 2015.
In addition, one exchange restriction maintained for security reasons should be notified to the IMF
under the framework of Decision 144–(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
Iraq is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on May 13, 2013. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 13/217) was published on July 19, 2013,
and is available on the internet at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=40802.0.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 30, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General
Data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Macroeconomic statistics have suffered from years of neglect and recent turmoil has added to the
difficulties. While the Central Statistics Organization (CSO) remained in place, it lacks adequate
technical expertise and resources to address the requirements for a modern statistical system. At
the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), statistical capacity is slightly better, but issues of interagency data
sharing and data collection responsibilities are hampering progress on external sector statistics.
Since 2003, the Statistics Department (STA) has provided considerable technical assistance (TA) in
all major datasets, including on dissemination standards.
National Accounts
CSO compiles annual and quarterly national accounts at current and constant (2007) prices. Annual
data of GDP by activity are available on the website of CSO for 2003–13, and quarterly GDP data up
to the third quarter of 2014.
The national accounts follow the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA), however, with technical
assistance from STA, CSO is moving towards implementing the concepts of the 1993 SNA. The
quality of the national accounts compiled is poor due to the lack of comprehensive source data for
estimating value added by activity and for GDP by expenditure. A Household Budget Survey (HBS)
was conducted during 2007 and the results have been incorporated. CSO still includes the
Kurdistan Territory’s contribution to GDP by economic activities as percentages for each activity
based on results obtained from previous estimates dating back to 1990. Other activities that
started in the Kurdistan Territory after 1990 are not included. There are limited price and volume
data for deriving volume measures of GDP. The base year was recently updated to 2007
There is a shortage of quarterly and monthly indicators of economic activity and a lack of timely
data for services. Quarterly GDP estimates are based on a limited number of indicators––crude oil
output, electricity, rent of dwellings, and government expenditure.
Price Statistics
Based on the HBS 2007, CSO compiles and disseminates a monthly CPI for all-Iraq (including
Kurdistan) and for each governorate. However, the CPI only covers the urban areas in all
governorates and resources are insufficient to expand coverage. Starting June 2014 official data on
CPI do not include the four conflict-affected provinces. A quarterly PPI is also compiled and
disseminated within two months of the reference quarter. The index is based in 2007 which needs
to be updated, and capacity building is needed to implement improvements to methodology.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

Government Finance Statistics
Despite the difficult security situation, which has a direct impact on data compilation and analysis,
the provision of fiscal data for program monitoring purposes has been satisfactory. Infrequent
submission delays occur, and coverage of the Kurdish region remains sketchy. However, the
authorities are taking measures to address these shortcomings.
In March 2015, an STA mission—overlapped with the Article IV mission—discussed a work plan
aimed at improving the frequency and timeliness of fiscal reporting data and setting a migration
plan to improve fiscal statistics based on Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014).
Iraq resumed reporting government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). Currently there are no fiscal statistics published by the government
beyond the summary of central government budgetary estimates and outturn.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Notable progress has been made in developing the components and structure for compiling a
depository corporations survey, but the quality and timeliness of the data continue to be hampered
by the lack of staff capacity, particularly at the commercial bank level. While most banks, including
state-owned banks are using the new report forms, which were developed based on the IMF’s
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, some banks continue to have data reporting problems
(e.g., missing data, reporting errors, and reporting delay). Therefore, the old report forms are still
used to compile data for other depository corporations (ODCs). Monetary statistics does not cover
the northern region (Kurdistan) due to problems with data collection from that region. As a result,
the CBI reports data for publication in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics with a lag of more
than three months and the latest reported data for ODCs are marked “preliminary,” indicating that
there are problems with their data collection and compilation.
Financial sector surveillance
Iraq has not yet compiled financial soundness indicators (FSIs) as set out in the IMF’s FSI
Compilation Guide. Following a discussion with the IMF (STA) during the 2015 Spring Meetings in
Washington, D.C., the CBI requested technical assistance in compiling FSIs. STA will decide on the
tasks, dates, and alternative location for a technical assistance mission upon receiving adequate
information, including source data for commercial banks from the CBI.
External Sector Statistics
Balance of Payments and IIP Statistics
Balance of payments statistics are available to the Fund for 2005–2013 in the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) format. The CBI also compiles and disseminates an annual
international investment position (IIP) statement. The quality of the information for recent years has
marginally improved but timeliness remains a key concern. Further, the presentation is still limited
due to coverage problems and some deviations from the internationally acceptable
methodologies. Issues regarding the full recording of external debt data continue to impact the
coverage and timeliness of balance of payments and IIP statistics. International reserves are
compiled consistent with international methodologies and published in the IFS since end-2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

IRAQ

The quality of the information remains hampered by the lack of data submission to the CBI from
other government institutions and the private sector, which is evidenced by large and growing
errors and omissions with persistent negative sign. The paucity of data exists particularly in the
areas of external trade in goods and services and foreign direct investment. To help address these
and other issues, a February 2012 mission proposed several recommendations, including improved
interagency cooperation on direct investment statistics.
External Trade Statistics
External trade data have serious problems of timeliness and are of poor quality. A new customs
form for imports is available but it is not being used at the customs border due to the security
situation and the lack of Customs Department resources at the border outlets.
Coverage of private sector imports is constrained by data sources. Only goods that are paid for
through the Iraqi banking system are captured. Thus goods that are imported under external
payments arrangements (for example, imports for direct investment projects) are not recorded in
the balance of payments. The coverage of the external trade statistics excludes the northern region
of the country (Kurdistan), and no estimates for smuggling are made.
Export data from the oil sector are received from the BOPSD at the CBI. The nonoil export data,
which amounts to the equivalent of 3–5 percent of total exports, are compiled based on
information from the customs export form. Nonoil export data are provided to the CBI on a
monthly basis for crosschecking purposes.

II. Data Standards and Quality
The country is a GDDS participant. However, most of
its metadata, with the exception of the real sector
and socio-demographic metadata, have not been
updated since October 2002. At the authorities’
request, STA has conducted an SDDS assessment,
providing a draft action plan that could lead to
SDDS subscription.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR PURCHASE UNDER THE RAPID
FINANCING INSTRUMENT—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION AND SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER OF INTENT
Approved By
Aasim M. Husain and
Taline Koranchelian

Prepared By
Middle East and Central Asia Department

1.
The authorities have requested increased financing under the Rapid
Financing Instrument, in line with the recent change in Fund policy. In the
attached Supplementary Letter of Intent, the authorities request a purchase of
75 percent of quota (SDR 891.3 million, $1.242 billion) under the Rapid Financing
Instrument (RFI), to be channeled to the budget (see attached revised Decision). Higher
access compared to the 50 percent of quota (SDR 594.2 million, $828.9 million)
requested in the Letter of Intent dated July 9, 2015 would be in line with the increase in
RFI access limits recently endorsed by the Board in the context of the Fund’s efforts to
enhance the financial safety nets for developing countries.
2.
Higher access under the RFI would strengthen Fund financial support to
Iraq, but would still not close either the balance of payments or the budget gaps.
The revised macroeconomic framework (see attached tables) includes additional Fund
financing of about $413 million (0.2 percent of GDP) compared to the staff report.
Prior actions
3.
The prior action on signing MOUs between the state-owned banks, the
Central Bank of Iraq and the Ministry of Finance has been completed. Both the
MOUs between the state-owned banks and the ministry of finance, and those between
the state-owned banks and the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) have been signed (prior
action, see Letter of Intent, Table 1).

IRAQ

4.
The prior action on Cabinet approval of the new electricity tariff schedule
will not be implemented before the Board meeting. The Iraqi authorities have
informed staff that the Cabinet will not be able to prepare and fully implement the
tariff increase in the foreseeable future, due to the authorities’ increasingly strained
capacity to overcome the political and social difficulties in the context of the recent
setbacks in the conflict with ISIS. The new tariff reform was expected to deliver about
2.4 percent of fiscal savings on an annual basis, or 1.2 percent of GDP for 2015. In a
worst-case scenario in which the tariff reform is not implemented this year, the
government deficit would be 18.4 percent of GDP compared to 17.2 percent of GDP
under the staff report baseline, and the unidentified financing gap would reach
7.5 percent of GDP compared to 6.3 percent of GDP under the baseline (adjusted to
reflect a purchase of 75 percent of quota). In this scenario, end-2015 public debt would
reach 70 percent of GDP, compared to from 68.5 percent of GDP under the baseline,
because of higher financing needs. Staff expects the reform to be implemented, or
compensating measures to be introduced. Therefore, projections for 2016 and the
medium term are affected only marginally.
5.
The authorities remain committed to implement the tariff reform as soon
as possible (see attached Supplementary Letter of Intent). The authorities see the
introduction of the new electricity tariff schedule as important to provide fiscal savings
and to accelerate the reform of the energy sector, and intend to proceed with the tariff
increase as soon as possible, which may be after the summer when the high demand
for electricity, causing more frequent outages, subsides. However, the delay underlines
the high risk that the tariff increase may not be approved in 2015, in which case the
authorities commit to find compensatory fiscal measures. In this regard, Cabinet has
approved this week a 40–50 percent cut in salaries for the high-level government
officials, ranging from the Prime Minister to department directors, and a reduction in
salaries for members of parliament. The measure is not expected to bring significant
savings but has a high symbolic value.
External Sector
6.
The CBI has informed staff that international reserves of the CBI were
$65.5 billion at end-June 2015. The update is in line with staff’s projection of
$50.4 billion at end-2015 (taking into account increased Fund financing).
7.
The foreign exchange market has stabilized. The parallel market spread has
remained stable at about 4 percent as of July 21st.

Staff Appraisal
8.
Staff supports the request of a purchase of 75 percent of quota under the
RFI. Increased financing from the Fund would better contribute to address the present
and urgent balance of payments problem, helping reduce the gap arising from
unidentified domestic and external financing. The increased access does not
significantly alter staff’s assessment of Iraq’s capacity to repay the Fund.
9.
Staff urges the authorities to quickly implement the agreed tariff reform
(or equivalent contingency measures) given the large financing gap. The delay in
raising electricity tariffs increases the fiscal deficit and the financing gap, thus
increasing the need for further fiscal adjustment in 2015-16. However, the tariff
reform—while still macrocritical given the large residual financing gap and the current
low level of tariffs in Iraq compared to other countries in the region—has turned out to
be more challenging than expected. Ultimately, the delay reflects the authorities’
weaker than previously envisaged policy capacity, further undermined by the
government’s focus on the ISIS conflict and the increasingly tense social and political
situation. In light of this capacity issue, in accordance with the Fund’s Guidelines on
Conditionality, staff recommends that the electricity tariff reform not be a prior action
for the purchase under the RFI, thus giving the authorities more time to implement this
measure.

Supplementary Letter of Intent
July 24, 2015
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431, USA
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
This letter complements the Letter of Intent dated July 9, 2015. We understand that the Executive
Board of the IMF has recently adopted policies to enhance the financial safety nets for developing
countries, including by raising the annual access limits of the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) from
50 percent of quota to 75 percent of quota. We therefore request access of 75 percent of quota
(equivalent to SDR891.3 million, or about US$1.242 billion) under the RFI. The additional financing
from the Fund would help us address the present and urgent balance of payments need caused by
the conflict with ISIS and the collapse in oil prices. We also request that the assistance under the RFI
be channeled to the budget to reduce the residual fiscal financing gap.
Cabinet approval of the new electricity tariff reform is not possible at the moment, but we commit to
implement this measure as soon as possible or find compensatory fiscal measures.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director and Maya Choueiri, Senior Advisor to
Executive Director
July 29, 2015
1.

Iraq is facing a double shock resulting from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

(ISIS) conflict and the sharp drop in global oil prices, which compounds very challenging
security and political conditions that have been prevailing for several years. The armed conflict
has created a humanitarian tragedy, causing over three million people to be displaced
internally, one of the highest numbers in the world, at a time when a quarter of a million Syrian
refugees have sought shelter in Iraq. Living conditions across the country have markedly
deteriorated since the onset of the conflict and the government’s ability to provide basic public
goods and services is severely hampered. The violence has also caused extensive damage to
infrastructure and productive assets, disrupted internal and external trade, and deteriorated
investor confidence. The two shocks have severely affected the Iraqi economy, which contracted
by about 2 percent in 2014 despite solid growth in the oil sector and is projected to achieve only
a modest recovery this year. At the same time, the fiscal and external positions are expected to
weaken considerably in 2015 relative to 2014, as reflected in a 21 percent drop of budget
revenues and 25 percent decline in international reserves.
2.

The authorities strongly appreciate the support provided by the international community

in response to the country’s difficult situation, particularly the United Nations’ humanitarian
support plan for Iraq and the generous contribution by the State of Kuwait. They are
implementing several policy measures in response to the crisis, including large-scale fiscal
adjustment and financing to address the fall in revenues, while maintaining the peg to the
U.S. dollar, which provides a key anchor to the economy. Despite very difficult circumstances,
the authorities have successfully implemented many of the 2013 Article IV recommendations.
They are seeking assistance from the Fund under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) in
support of their efforts to help address the impact on the balance of payments resulting from the
ISIS conflict and the decline in oil prices. They believe that the RFI would also help generate
additional resources by facilitating the planned borrowing from the markets and financing by
other international financing organizations.

2
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
3.

The revised 2015 budget aimed at addressing the fiscal pressures from low oil revenues

and the ISIS conflict. It introduced wide-ranging revenue-enhancing and expenditure-reducing
measures which reduced the deficit by 13 percent of GDP. Revenue measures, which aimed at
introducing non-oil taxation to diversify revenue sources, consisted of introducing a higher
custom tariff schedule and sales taxes on cars, tobacco, alcohol, mobile telephony and internet
usage, while large expenditure cuts were agreed with line ministries.
4.

Moreover, the authorities are in the process of introducing additional measures which

would result in budgetary savings of about 5 percent of GDP consisting of the rationalization
of the capital budget through a rigorous prioritization process. In this connection, an interministerial committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister has been established to
examine project selection and procurement practices, with the objective of improving project
selection based on objective criteria (LOI ¶13) and enhancing implementation capacity and
monitoring.
5.

The authorities had planned the introduction of a more progressive electricity tariff

structure, with much higher rates levied on the largest consumers and minimal effect on lifeline
consumption and an overall limited social impact. The reform was expected to deliver about
2.4 percent of fiscal savings on an annual basis. Nonetheless, Cabinet approval of the new
electricity tariff reform is not possible at the moment, given the increasingly difficult political
and social context resulting from the conflict with ISIS. The authorities commit to implement
the electricity tariff measure as soon as possible or to find compensatory fiscal measures. In this
connection, the Cabinet decided in its meeting of July 21, 2015, to reduce significantly the
salaries and allocations of high-level government officials. This includes a 50 percent reduction
for the Prime Minister and his deputies and a 40 percent reduction for Ministers. While the
reductions, which will be effective on August 1st, 2015, are not expected to bring significant
savings, they carry a high symbolic value.
6.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned consolidation efforts, a large fiscal deficit would

remain, largely reflecting continued acute spending pressures to respond to the country's
considerable security and humanitarian needs. The authorities' view is that these categories of
spending cannot be easily compressed at this juncture, given the difficult environment. The

3
remaining deficit also reflects arrears on investment spending and international oil companies
accumulated the previous year. In light of the above, the authorities stepped up their efforts to
identify financing sources. They have secured loans from the state-owned banks financing,
which will be supported in turn by the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) via the discount of
government bonds for about 9 percent of GDP in 2015. They have also strived to find other
financing sources, including Fund financing through the drawdown of the SDR allocation and
the RFI purchase, a $6 billion Eurobonds issuance over two years, with an issuance this year of
at least $2 billion, as well as possible World Bank financing in urgent reconstruction financing
and a potential Development Policy Loan. The authorities plan to fill any remaining financing
gap with domestic and foreign sources.
7.

The authorities are pursuing a prudent debt management strategy. They are considering

developing and deepening the domestic debt market through the introduction of new
instruments, which would diversify their financing sources. In addition, they will
strengthen the monitoring of their public debt to maintain it at sustainable levels. They are
making progress in negotiations with non-Paris Club creditors and expect to conclude
agreements with some creditors in the course of this year on terms that are consistent with the
2004 Paris Club agreement.
8.

The authorities have launched an initiative to reform state-owned enterprises to help

alleviate the burden on the public sector. They have prepared a study envisaging a systematic
cost-benefit assessment of each enterprise that would assess its viability and enable decisions
towards closure, privatization, or maintaining state ownership after proper restructuring.
9.

The authorities are also strengthening their public financial management procedures to

support fiscal discipline and efficient use of oil resources. With support from the World
Bank, they are continuing to work on the introduction of an integrated financial management
and information system. In addition, the Shura Council is examining a new public financial
management law which paves the way for the introduction of a Treasury Single
Account. They will continue to rely on Fund and the World Bank technical assistance in
support of their efforts in these areas.

4
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies and Reforms
10.

The stability of the exchange rate provides a key nominal anchor to the economy in an

uncertain environment. The authorities are therefore committed to maintaining the peg to the
U.S. dollar despite the deteriorating external position. In an effort to address concerns related
to illegal cash outflows from the country, the CBI reduced the volumes of cash currency sales
and imposed a 15-day advance deposit requirement for foreign currency transactions in early
2015. In addition, the government introduced a 5 percent customs duty advance payment and a
3 percent presumptive income tax to be paid at the time of request for foreign exchange to
finance imports. However, the authorities soon removed the latter measures and shortened the
advance deposit requirement to five days in June, given the rise in the spread between the
official and parallel exchange rates. As a result, the spread quickly narrowed to about 6 percent
by end-June. They are committed to removing the weekly limits on cash transactions once
external conditions allow.
11.

The CBI intensified its efforts to strengthen the management of international reserves,

which despite a recent decline, continue to exceed conventional adequacy indicators. With the
support of Fund technical assistance, it updated the 2008 guidelines for reserve management to
bring them in line with the CBI Law and address quantitatively all key reserve management
strategic objectives, including the strategic asset allocation, credit risk limits, and liquidity
needs. The CBI is working towards a long-term goal to bring active management of its
international reserves to Baghdad.
12.

The shocks affecting the economy are adversely impacting the financial sector and the

authorities expect nonperforming loans to rise as a result of falling business confidence, lower
private sector activity, physical destruction and the robbery of some banking institutions at the
beginning of the conflict with ISIS. Accordingly, the authorities are stepping up the monitoring
and supervision of the banking sector, including through the improvement of financial reporting
and monetary data. They are also working with the IMF to improve their financial soundness
indicators to internationally acceptable standards. The CBI has recently extended its contract
with Ernst & Young, which helps improve off-site and on-site supervision practices and co-train
inspectors. The CBI has also hired 35 new staff in the banking supervision department. The
banking supervision department is also stepping up the monitoring of state-owned banks

5
Rasheed and Rafidain, which are of systemic importance. The authorities intend to speed up the
restructuring of the two banks (LOI ¶25).
13.

The authorities are stepping up their efforts to develop the banking sector, a key element

in their long-term strategy to strengthen the non-oil economy and private sector activity. In order
to level the playing field between private banks and state-owned banks, they have allowed
public entities to accept letters of guarantees and certified checks issued by private banks. The
Ministry of Finance can open letters of credit with private banks up to $10 million ($6 million
previously). The threshold to collect state fees by private banks has been increased, and the
government is now allowing SOEs to open accounts, make deposits, and pay salaries through
private banks. It is hoped that these initiatives will create new opportunities for private banks to
provide services and compete with the state-owned sector. With the support of USAID, the CBI
is finalizing regulations to introduce a credit bureau and is considering establishing a deposit
insurance scheme.
14.

The CBI continues to maintain important safeguards, including the annual external audit

by a reputable audit firm and publication of its audited financial statement. As the authorities are
requesting access under the RFI, they commit to completing an updated safeguards assessment
of the CBI (LOI ¶27).
Conclusion
15.

Iraq is facing a particularly difficult time in its history, which is putting the economy

under extreme stress. The authorities are doing their utmost to address the situation. In support
of their effort, they are seeking Fund assistance under the RFI. They will maintain a close
dialogue with the Fund to preserve macroeconomic stability. They would like to express their
appreciation for the Fund’s Executive Board, Management, and staff, for their support under
difficult circumstances.
