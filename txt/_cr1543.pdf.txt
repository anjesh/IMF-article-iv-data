STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 23, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Moroccan authorities have taken strong policy actions to reduce the
vulnerabilities of the economy, but important challenges remain to strengthen growth,
reduce unemployment, and tackle poverty. Real GDP growth slowed in 2014, hampered
by negative agricultural output growth and the impact of weak external demand, but
economic activity is showing signs of recovery. Inflation has remained low. The fiscal
deficit was reduced as planned; and the external current account deficit is narrowing,
leading to a buildup of international reserves. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain in the
external and fiscal sectors. The financial system remains sound.
Outlook and risks. Subject to steadfast implementation of reforms, and assuming a
continued recovery of external demand, real GDP growth is projected to increase,
starting in 2015, and to stabilize over the medium term in the 5-5½ percent range.
Inflation is expected to remain low at about 2 percent. The external position should
continue to improve. While the medium-term outlook is favorable and risks have
decreased, they remain substantial, particularly because of Morocco’s strong ties to the
euro zone, which make it vulnerable to a protracted period of slow growth in that
region.
Policy discussions. Morocco has made important strides in maintaining macroeconomic
stability in a difficult environment; nonetheless, more efforts are needed to reduce
external and fiscal vulnerabilities, achieve higher and more inclusive growth, and further
reduce poverty. The period ahead provides an opportunity to consolidate gains in
macroeconomic stabilization and “aim higher and try harder” to build a better future;
hence, the discussions focused on: (i) the appropriate policy mix to continue rebuilding
policy buffers; (ii) the adaptation of the policy framework to strengthen the economy’s
resilience and adaptability; and (iii) fiscal, business environment, and labor market
structural reforms to boost the country’s potential beyond the pre-crisis level.

BACKGROUND
1.
The authorities have made progress in reducing vulnerabilities, but important
challenges remain to strengthening growth, reducing unemployment, and tackling poverty.
After significant negative shocks to external demand and terms-of-trade in 2012, fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms (including, the reform of the subsidy system) have been instrumental in
reducing fiscal and external vulnerabilities. But much remains to be done to promote higher growth,
reduce unemployment, and lower income, gender, and regional inequalities. The IMF is supporting
the authorities’ program through a two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement,
which provides insurance against external risks.1

A. Recent Developments
2.
Growth slowed in 2014, but is showing signs of recovery (Figure 1). After a bumper crop
in 2013, agricultural growth contracted in 2014. Furthermore, weak demand from Europe and low
business and consumer confidence affected nonagricultural output, mainly in the manufacturing and
construction sectors in the first half of the year. Nonetheless, there have been recent signs of
recovery in activity, and exports from newly developed aeronautics and automotive industries are
booming. Overall GDP growth is expected to have decelerated to about 3 percent from 4.4 percent
in 2013, with agricultural activity contracting by 1.3 percent and other sectors growing over
3½ percent. Inflation remained low at 0.4 percent on average and 1.6 percent year-on-year in 2014,
as a decline in food prices helped offset the direct and indirect impact of the price increases of some
formally subsidized petroleum products and of electricity tariffs. Unemployment has remained high
at 9.6 percent (October 2014), especially among the youth (20.6 percent, up from 19.6 percent at
end 2013).
3.
In 2014, the overall deficit contracted by 0.3 percent of GDP and reached 4.9 percent
of GDP, following a significant adjustment (by 2.2 percent of GDP) in 2013.2 Weaker economic
activity hurt tax revenue, which is estimated to have fallen by 0.8 percent of GDP from 2013, to
22.2 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, higher disbursements of grants from Gulf countries and a
significant reduction in energy subsidies contributed to containing the fiscal deficit despite some
increase in the use of goods and services and grants. The lower subsidy bill mostly reflected the full
year impact of measures taken in 2013 as well as further reductions in 2014 in the per-unit subsidies
of some products. Lower international oil prices did not generate significant saving to the budget as,
since September 2013, the retail domestic prices of gasoline, diesel and fuel, have been indexed on
international prices (Box 2). Public debt is estimated to have risen by close to 3 percent of GDP to
66.4 percent of GDP.

See companion staff report for first review under the PLL.

2

The 2013 fiscal deficit was revised downward from the previous estimate by 0.3 percent of GDP to 5.2 percent of
GDP as data related to certain revenue from local government became available with a lag.

4.
The current account deficit contracted significantly. It decreased from 9.7 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2013 and is estimated to have declined further to about
5.8 percent at end-2014. This result is owed in part to the trade balance, which improved by
6 percent in January–December relative to the same period in 2013, reflecting a surge in exports
(6.1 percent, in nominal dirham) against a slight decline in imports (-0.2 percent). Exports of goods
were driven by automobile (26.2 percent) and electronics (26 percent). Imports of petroleum
products contracted by 10.1 percent owing to the drop in oil prices. For the year as a whole, it is
expected that oil imports will have decreased by 1½ percent of GDP, contributing to about ¾ of the
reduction of the current account deficit.
5.
External stability has improved, but vulnerabilities remain (Annex I). The diversification
of export products achieved over the last decade has mitigated the decline of traditional exports,
notably textile and phosphates. Owing to recent improvements in the current account, the external
balance assessment (EBA) indicates that the real effective exchange is in line with fundamentals.
Financial inflows dominated by FDI and loans, remain broadly stable in percent of GDP. They were
buoyed by corporate and sovereign bond issuances in the second quarter of 2014 and the delivery
of financial assistance by development partners. External debt, though on the rise, remains relatively
low and is sustainable. However, standards shocks (exchange rate depreciation or a shock to noninterest current account) would result in a significant increase in debt-to-GDP ratio. Reserves have
increased and now exceed five months of imports or 93.6 percent of the assessment of reserve
adequacy (ARA) metric at end-December, an adequate level given existing capital controls. However,
such a level would not be comfortable enough to withstand significant external shocks.
6.
Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) recently lowered its policy rate in consideration of weak
growth, improving reserves, and low inflationary pressures. BAM lowered its policy rate to
2.5 percent with two cuts of 25 basis points each, in September and December 2014. The policy rate
had remained unchanged since March 2012, although BAM had already lowered the reserve
requirement ratio from 4 percent to 2 percent in March 2014 in response to tight bank liquidity. As a
result of this action, but also reflecting the better international reserves position and the lower fiscal
deficit, bank liquidity has improved. BAM’s 7–day advances decreased by 45 percent in November
2014 compared to the previous year. By contrast, longer-term interventions (3 months) have
increased, in the context of a program to support lending to very small, small, and medium-sized
enterprises (VSME). After reaching a decade-long low of 3.8 percent in 2013, credit growth has
slightly increased but remained subdued at 4.3 percent in November 2014. Low credit growth
resulted from weaker demand in the context of protracted low growth in Europe and low domestic
confidence, together with supply-side factors including still relatively tight liquidity conditions, slow
deposits growth, and rising nonperforming loans (NPLs).
7.
The financial system remains sound overall. At end-June 2014, overall capital-adequacy
ratio remained well-above the Basel III requirement. BAM is in the process of implementing the new
definition of prudential capital and, according to provisional data, the new regulatory capital-to-riskweighted assets ratio slightly increased to 13.5 in June 2014. Banks’ profitability remained adequate
despite slow lending activity. It benefited from the appreciation in the fair value of the T-bills trading

portfolio as the market yield dropped and from activities in sub-Saharan Africa, which constituted an
important source of revenue for the three major banks. Reflecting the weaker economic activity,
NPLs continued to increase reaching 6.9 percent of total loans in November 2014, but they
remained adequately provisioned.

of this achievement, policy action also
played a key role, as shown, for example, by the increased public spending on health, better access
to sanitation, and greater reach of financial services. In these areas, progress has been significant
and higher than in other oil-importing countries of the region. Nevertheless, poverty persists,
particularly in rural areas, and inequalities have slightly increased. Despite the efforts already made,
more is needed to reduce structural unemployment, increase female labor force participation and
reduce the gender gap, improve healthcare, and reduce regional inequalities.3 Shortcomings in the
quality of education are also widely recognized as a key impediment to improving social and
economic indicators. Improvements in those areas are crucial to achieving more inclusive growth
and reaching a higher potential output.

Growth is expected to rebound in 2015 and remain robust in the medium term.
Building on the recovery observed in most recent indicators in 2014, overall growth should
accelerate close to 4½ percent in 2015, supported by improved external demand, strengthened
domestic confidence, and a return to normal agricultural output. Over the medium term, the

implementation of structural
reforms. Inflation is expected to
stabilize at about 2 percent. The reduction in the fiscal deficit and improvement in international
reserves are also expected to continue to improve liquidity conditions which, together with the
strengthening the financial policy framework, will help support continued adequate financing of the
economy.
10.
The external position is expected to improve over the medium term (Annex I). In 2015
and over the medium term, the current account deficit should continue to narrow and the reserve
position to strengthen, benefitting from the growth in newly developed export sectors, recovery in
the other sectors, stronger external demand and, in the near term, also by a large positive terms-oftrade shock mostly triggered by the fall in international oil prices. The latter will help reduce oil
imports by more than 3 percent of GDP in 2015. The capital and financial accounts are expected to
remain strong, particularly FDI, as political and social stability and relatively strong economic
performance make Morocco an attractive destination. The external debt-to-GDP ratio stood at
32.1 percent at end-2014 and is expected to stabilize at that level over the medium term. However,
stress tests show that 30 percent exchange rate depreciation or a shock to non-interest current
account would result in a significant increase in debt relative to GDP. The net international
investment position (NIIP), which deteriorated significantly following the global financial crisis, is
expected to stabilize over the next few years as external buffers strengthen.
11.
Risks have declined but remain substantial. A protracted period of slow growth in
advanced economies, in particular Europe, would affect the economy through low exports, FDI, and
remittances. An increase in world energy prices resulting from geopolitical tensions in the Middle
East and Russia/Ukraine could worsen the current account deficit. An abrupt surge in global financial
market volatility would increase interest rates and raise the cost of financing and indirectly affect

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in staff’s view). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff’s views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSION
12.
Morocco has made important strides in rebalancing the economy, but higher and
more inclusive growth is needed to reduce poverty. A significant reduction in vulnerabilities was
achieved over the past two years (Box 1). The authorities should consolidate gains in stabilization
and “aim higher and try harder” to build a better future. Well managed, the current period offers an
opportunity to enter a virtuous cycle of growth, confidence, and investment. This requires pursuing
an appropriate policy mix, adapting the policy framework to strengthen the economy’s resilience
and adaptability, and implementing a vigorous program of structural reform to boost Morocco’s
potential beyond the pre-crisis level. The present Article IV consultation therefore focused on three
main themes: (i) the policy mix to sustain the ongoing stabilization; (ii) the policy framework for a
more resilient economy; and (iii) structural policies for higher and more inclusive growth.

Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly in line with past Fund advice.
Fiscal policy. The authorities removed subsidies on all liquid petroleum products, thereby eliminating risks
to the budget linked to the volatility of oil prices, while they expanded support to the most vulnerable
through dedicated social programs. A new organic budget law was adopted by the parliament, which will
help strengthen the budgetary framework once comments from the Constitutional Council have been
addressed. The parametric reform of the public pension system is expected to be implemented in 2015.
Monetary policy. Inflation remains low and inflation expectations are well-anchored. Given low inflationary
pressures, low growth and improving reserve position, BAM lowered its main policy interest rates to
2.5 percent in December 2014. Preparation for a more flexible exchange rate has progressed, including with
technical assistance from the Fund.
Financial policies. A new banking law approved by the parliament in November 2014 will help strengthen
the regulatory, supervisory and macroprudential frameworks, including with respect to the international
activity of Moroccan banks. However, more work is needed on cross-border banking resolution.
Structural reforms. Morocco made progress in doing business indicators, but much remains to be done to
further improve the business climate, as discussed below.

A. Policy Mix: Sustaining the Stabilization
13.
Public debt has been on the rise, but remains sustainable (Annex II). As the fiscal deficit
widened, public debt rose from 47 percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 66.4 percent of GDP in
2014. It is expected to peak at about 68 percent of GDP in 2015—a relatively high level for an
emerging market—before decreasing to about 63 percent of GDP by 2019. The debt sustainability

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MOROCCO

analysis (DSA) shows that debt remains sustainable and robust to various shocks and that the
primary balance is projected to be higher than its debt-stabilizing level, putting debt firmly on a
downward path. However, relatively large public and external financing needs are a source of
vulnerability under certain shocks, and debt sustainability is also dependent on growth materializing
at the expected level and on continued fiscal consolidation. The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment that the debt remains sustainable. They stressed that while financing needs were high,
the domestic debt market was liquid and capital controls limited rollover risks, given the lack of
alternative options for investors.
14.
The authorities have embarked since 2013 on a fiscal consolidation aimed at external
adjustment and fiscal sustainability, while seeking not to compromise growth. In response to
rising public debt and widening external imbalances, the authorities have aimed to gradually reduce
the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2017. After a sharp reduction in the deficit in 2013, the pace
of adjustment slowed in 2014 in face of

expected to come mainly from a
reduction in expenditure, as tax revenue as a share of GDP is already among the highest in the
region.4 Staff supported the authorities’ planned fiscal path for 2015–17. It considered that this path
was consistent with the need to rebuild fiscal buffers, including putting the debt firmly on a
downward path and reducing financing needs, while avoiding being a significant drag on growth. It
noted the need to sustain efforts to further lower the fiscal deficit beyond 2017 to ensure a
continued reduction of the debt-to-GDP level. To promote higher and more inclusive growth, it will
also be important to ensure that the fiscal space created by actions to lower the cost of subsidies
and efforts to reduce wage bill translates into higher capital and social spending. Staff noted that
the 2015 budget misses an opportunity in that respect, as goods and services expenditure are set to
increase by 0.3 percent of GDP while investment is to decline by almost one percent of GDP.
15.
As fiscal consolidation is pursued, the central bank has appropriately loosened
monetary policy. Although the exchange rate is pegged, the existence of capital controls provides
some scope for monetary policy. In a context of low inflation, low growth, slowing credit growth,
still-negative output gap, weak domestic and external demand, and improved reserves position,
BAM’s recent cuts in interest rate were appropriate and are expected to help support credit demand
4

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

by fostering lower lending rates. Other measures put in place by BAM to ease liquidity pressures and
foster greater access to credit, including the intervention under the VSME funding program, are
expected to help support bank lending to the private sector while remaining consistent with low
inflation, as pressures on consumer prices are set to remain subdued. In the context of the current
exchange rate peg, the overall policy mix remains consistent with strengthening macro-stability.
Further monetary loosening may be considered should the timid recovery stall and reserves
continue improving; however, BAM should remain vigilant, in case second-round effects on inflation
stemming from the subsidy reform materialize, or external risks worsen.

B. Adapting the Policy Framework to Strengthen the Resilience of the
Economy
16.
As the economy recovers from the global crisis, adapting the policy framework will
help increase its resilience. The current policy framework has served Morocco well, but the recent
period of global and domestic economic stress has tested its limits. A stronger fiscal and financial
policy framework will help contain existing or potentially new sources of fiscal, external, and financial
risks, while adapting the exchange rate and monetary regime would make the economy more
nimble. The authorities have embarked on important reforms to this end.
17.
A new organic budget law (OBL) is expected to strengthen the budgetary framework.
A new law was adopted by parliament in November 2014. However, the Constitutional Council ruled
in late December that some provisions were unconstitutional, partly for procedural reasons. These
relate to the dates of implementation of the new law as well as a provision that stated that only
finance law could modify tax or custom legislation. The government intends to resubmit the law to
parliament in its Spring session to address the Council’s comments. Once definitely adopted, and as
its provisions gradually enter into force over the next few years, the new OBL will introduce multiyear and program budgeting, establish a golden rule to limit new net borrowing to the financing of
capital spending, make binding the ceilings on wage appropriations, and restrict the carryover of
investment appropriations from one budget to the next. The last two features address budget
framework weaknesses observed in 2012. Staff looks forward to the final adoption of the law, once
the Constitutional Council’s comments have been addressed, as it will modernize the fiscal
framework, enhance its efficiency, and increase transparency and financial control. Staff noted that
some provisions could have been strengthened to further reduce fiscal risks, for example, tighter
restrictions on the creation of new special treasury accounts or adding an escape clause to the
golden rule. The new provisions of the OBL are expected to be introduced gradually between 2016
and 2020. The Fund stands ready to provide technical assistance (TA) to support a prompt and
successful implementation of the new law.
18.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to transition to a more flexible exchange rate,
with accompanying changes in the monetary policy framework. Although the peg has provided
a useful nominal anchor for the economy in the past, a more flexible regime would better support
the ongoing diversification of trade and financial flows, help preserve competitiveness, and facilitate
the absorption of external shocks. The Fund is supporting the preparation of this transition by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MOROCCO

providing TA on options for and operational management of a more flexible exchange rate regime.
It has also provided TA to strengthen BAM’s macro-modeling capacity in preparation for a new
monetary regime, such as inflation targeting. In staff’s views, a gradual transition could start with a
widening of the band around the peg and a reexamination of the weights in the currency basket to
which the dirham is pegged. The improvement in the external and fiscal positions offers an
opportunity to transition to a new exchange rate regime under better conditions. Staff and the
authorities agreed that once the forthcoming FSAP is completed, which will further assess the
preparedness of the financial sector to withstand greater exchange rate fluctuations, the various
strands of TA and surveillance work in this area could usefully be pulled together to inform further
decisions in this area.
19.
The financial supervisory and regulatory framework is being further strengthened. A
healthy financial sector is crucial to macro-stability, and supports more inclusive growth by
facilitating access to finance. In turn, sustained financial system health depends on the quality of the
regulatory and supervisory framework. The authorities are committed to further strengthening
financial regulations and supervision. In this connection, they are gradually integrating the norms of
Basel III. Furthermore, parliament approved in November 2014 a new banking law, which
strengthens BAM’s supervisory and regulatory powers, upgrades the macroprudential framework (an
area where the Fund is also providing TA), and provides the framework for the development of
Islamic finance. A new central bank law was submitted to the general secretariat of the government.
It aims to strengthen BAM’s independence and extend the scope of its supervisory powers. Staff
supports these efforts and encourages a timely completion of the revision of the central bank law.
The FSAP update, for which the main mission is scheduled in April 2015, will offer an opportunity to
take a comprehensive and in-depth view of financial stability and development and of the evolving
policy framework.
20.
The evolution of the financial policy framework is also taking into account the
challenges posed by the international expansion of Moroccan banks. Three major Moroccan
banks have rapidly expanded their operations in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly through acquisitions of
local banks. The international activity of the Moroccan banks constitutes about 19 percent of total
volume of activity of the sector (17 percent for activity in Africa alone). This expansion brings new
opportunities for Morocco and host economies but also comes with challenges and opens new
spillover channels. Staff and the authorities concurred on the main steps needed to tackle new
supervisory challenges, and staff welcomed progress already made in that area. In particular, a
supervisory college for one of the three cross-border banks was already established and plans for
setting up the other two are well advanced. In addition, one of the cross-border banks has already
started simplifying its structure, which had become increasingly complex as the bank expanded
internationally. The authorities also noted that the new banking law and the forthcoming new
central bank law will significantly strengthen BAM’s supervision and crisis resolution abilities.
Looking ahead, it will be important to implement the Basel framework for dealing with domestic
systemically important banks through an assessment methodology and higher loss-absorbency
capital requirements; to continue encouraging reliance of subsidiary operations on local funding;
and to ensure that cross-border banks have strong risk management frameworks including strict

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

controls on their subsidiaries. Progress on cross-border crisis management and resolution
mechanisms is also crucial, though, as recognized by staff and the authorities, inherently more
difficult given the many actors involved in the home and host countries.5

C. Structural Policies in Support of Higher and More Inclusive Growth
21.
Staff welcomed the impressive progress in subsidy reform, which is instrumental in
reducing fiscal vulnerabilities and creating space for growth-enhancing spending (Box 2).
Subsidies on all liquid petroleum products (diesel, gasoline, fuel) have been eliminated since last
year, including the earlier-than-planned completion of a gradual reduction in the per-unit subsidy to
diesel prices. Furthermore, the authorities have decided to fully liberalize their prices in 2015. These
efforts helped significantly reduce the subsidy bill to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2.3 percent of
GDP expected in 2015 from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2012. They also considerably shield the budget
from international price volatility, lowering associated fiscal risks in case oil prices rose again. The
authorities are considering ways to gradually reduce subsidies on wheat, sugar, and butane, with
care not to hurt the most vulnerable population that depends on these subsidies. Already, the
reduction in fuel subsidies has been accompanied by an expansion of social programs in health and
education, and the introduction of a number of mitigating programs.
22.
Reforming the tax system is important to bolster the contribution of the fiscal sector
to growth. Following the recommendations of their national tax conference in April 2013, the
authorities have initiated reforms to make the tax system more equitable and better able to support
competitiveness. The aim is to widen the tax base, significantly reduce tax expenditures, review
income and VAT rates, and improve tax administration. Staff has been supportive of the reform,
while cautioning against lowering tax rates before ensuring that the gains from broadening the tax
base are solid. Following measures introduced in 2014, including steps to ensure progressive
taxation of large agricultural firms, the 2015 budget introduces new, if not bold, steps to reduce the
number of VAT rates and includes measures to better enforce tax payments from self-employed and
liberal professions. Staff noted the Fund’s readiness to provide technical assistance on implementing
the fiscal reform.

Box 2. Fuel Subsidy Reform
The subsidy system in place since 2000 was a drain on the budget while being largely ineffective in
helping the poor.1 The system mostly focused on petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, industrial fuel oil
and fuel oil used for electricity generation) while the prices of wheat flour and sugar have also been
subsidized. With global oil prices increasing threefold from 2000 to 2012, the government’s subsidy bill
almost tripled from less than 2½ percent of GDP to more than 6½ percent of GDP during the period. With it,
the fiscal deficit exceeded 7 percent of GDP in 2012.
To address this important source of vulnerability, the authorities have implemented significant
reforms leading to an impressive reduction in the cost and fiscal risks related to fuel subsidies. The key
milestones in the reform were:


Early 2012: Establishment of three technical commissions to prepare the reform, including government
and civil society representatives. The commissions were to evaluate the macroeconomic impact of
possible reforms, formulate proposals to revise the price structures of subsidized products, and develop
alternative targeted social protection schemes.



June 2012: Increase in the retail price of diesel, gasoline, and fuel oil by 14 percent, 20 percent, and
27 percent respectively, yielding an estimated saving for the budget of 0.7 percent of GDP for the year.



September 2013: Partial indexation of the domestic prices of diesel, gasoline, and industrial fuel oil to
world prices effective August 16, 2013, which significantly reduced the vulnerability of the budget to
international oil price fluctuation.2 The indexation was accompanied by a hedging operation for diesel to
cap the price increases that might be needed in the first year of the indexation system.



February 2014: Removal of subsidies on the domestic prices of gasoline and industrial fuel oil (excluding
fuel used for electricity generation). First reduction of the per-unit subsidy on diesel with a plan to
gradually eliminate it by mid-2015. Introduction of measures to alleviate the impact of the reform on
the poor; these include expanding existing targeted social programs (providing support to school-age
children and helping the poor with medical expenses) and introducing new programs to support lowincome widows and physically disabled individuals, as well as support for the public transportation
sector, to mitigate the cost of higher fuel prices and limit fare increases.



April 2014: Second reduction of the per-unit subsidy on diesel.



June 2014: Removal of subsidies on industrial fuel oil used for electricity generation. Introduction of
program contract with the public electricity company (ONEE) that includes direct transfers during the
next four years as well as a

23.
The pension system urgently needs reform to ensure its viability and broaden its
coverage. The main civil public pension fund (CMR) is already receiving less in contributions than it
pays in benefits and, absent reform, could exhaust its reserves by 2021. The government announced
in June a parametric reform that includes increases in contributions and in retirement age and lower
benefits. It submitted its proposal for review to the Economic, Social and Environmental Council
(ESEC), which endorsed the principle of the reform but advised somewhat less ambitious parametric
changes.6 The government’s intention is to gradually implement the reform starting in 2015. This
first step will pave the way for a broader structural reform that has been prepared to put the entire
pension system (public and private) on a long-term sustainable footing while gradually expanding
its coverage to workers who currently have no coverage, an important social goal. The parametric
reform under the government’s proposal would prolong the viability of the regime (that is, push
back the deficit) by eight years to 2022 and the depletion of the fund’s reserves to 2031 instead of
2022, allowing time for the broader reform to be implemented (by contrast, the CESE’s proposal
would prolong the viability of the regime by only five years). Staff welcomed the plans to reform the
pension system. It underscored the urgency of the reform, given the difficult financial situation of
the CMR, and stressed that the more ambitious the parametric changes, the more durably the
financial soundness of the fund will be restored. It considered that moving ahead with the broader
structural reform was also important to expanding the coverage of the pension system to the large
number of workers currently without pension benefit.
24.
The business environment has improved but much remains to be done to increase
competitiveness and business opportunities. The authorities’ efforts to improve the business
environment are driven by a national committee chaired by the head of government. Based on an
updated methodology, Morocco ranks 71 among 189 countries in the 2015 World Bank Doing
Business indicators, against 87 in previous estimates. The World Bank report notes that governance
and the business environment improved recently thanks notably to easier procedures for property
transfer, construction permits, and trading across borders, the reduction of electricity connection
costs, and some streamlining of administrative procedures. However, more efforts are needed to
reduce government bureaucracy, further improve transparency, competition, and governance, and
address corruption, all of which have been identified as key impediments to doing business in
Morocco. The reform of the judiciary—a crucial piece of these efforts—is ongoing. Strengthening
the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering AML/CFT framework is also needed for Morocco to
keep pace with more competitive emerging markets.

6

The parametric changes under the government’s June 2014 proposal include a gradual increase in the retirement
age from 60 to 65 (with an initial increase to 62 in July 2015), a raise in the contribution rate over two years (2015–16)
from 20 to 28 percent (split equally between the employee and the state), reductions in the accrual rate (from
2.5 percent to 2 percent) and in benefits (calculating pension benefits based on the average of the final eight years’
salary instead of the final year) gradually over four years. The CESE proposal includes a lower increase in retirement
age (from 60 to 63).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25.
The labor market needs further reform to help reduce unemployment. The
unemployment rate declined from 14 percent in 1999 to 9 percent in 2009, but has hovered
between 9 percent and 10 percent since then, despite relatively high growth. Youth unemployment
exceeds 20 percent (15 percent for graduates). The government aims to reduce the unemployment
rate to 8 percent by 2016. The authorities noted that they are completing an overhaul of existing
employment support programs and have initiated a dialogue with social partners to examine the
labor code. Staff supported these efforts. It noted that high hiring and firing costs have been
identified as important impediments to job creation. Also, insufficient access to information hampers
the smooth functioning of the job market. The education and vocational training systems need to
adapt to reduce the gap between labor force skills and business needs. While the highest valueadded industries often provide professional training to fulfill their needs for skilled workers, a broad
reform of the education system is needed to improve the quality of education, and to increase
school attainment and female enrollment rates.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Policy action has helped maintain macroeconomic stability and rebuild buffers in a
persistently difficult environment. However, the economy still faces important challenges as
growth has slowed and unemployment remains high. Low business and consumer confidence,
coupled with still weak European economic activity, has hampered nonagricultural growth while
agriculture has contracted following the bumper crop of 2013. A significant drop in food prices has
contributed to a reduction of the already low inflation. The fiscal deficit in percent of GDP was
further reduced as subsidy expenditures were reined in and higher external grants offset lower tax
receipts. The public debt, though on the rise, remains sustainable. The surge in exports, coupled with
a slowdown in import growth aided by lower energy prices, helped improve the external current
account markedly and rebuild international reserves.
27.
The outlook is positive but risks remain substantial, calling for sustained
implementation of reforms. Growth should rebound in 2015 to exceed 4 percent on the back of
improved prospects in Europe, a return of domestic confidence, and a positive contribution of
agriculture. Assuming continued steadfast implementation of structural reforms, it should continue
increasing in the medium-term. The current account is expected to continue to improve as a result
of growth in newly developed export sectors, stronger external demand, and lower oil prices.
Morocco’s stability makes it a choice destination for FDI. Nevertheless, the economy remains
vulnerable to global conditions, notably the risk of a protracted period of slow growth in Europe or
an oil price surge resulting from geopolitical tensions. Hence, it is important for the authorities to
continue implementing reforms to rebuild external and fiscal buffers, strengthen competitiveness,
and increase the resilience of the economy.
28.
The authorities’ fiscal and monetary policy mix has been appropriate to sustain the
ongoing stabilization of the economy. The current fiscal adjustment path aims to support the
external adjustment and ensure fiscal sustainability while preserving growth. As public debt has
reached a relatively high level and is accompanied by large financing needs, the planned

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

improvement in the primary balance is important to bring debt back onto a downward path. Efforts
to reduce the fiscal deficit should continue beyond 2017, for which the authorities target a deficit of
3 percent of GDP. At the same time, the projected reduction in subsidy and wage bills will free space
that should be used to increase growth-enhancing capital spending. Monetary policy has been
appropriately loosened in the context of low inflation, slow credit growth, and a negative output
gap.
29.
Adapting the policy framework is important to strengthen the resilience of the
economy. Although stronger provisions in some areas would have been warranted, the new OBL is
expected to strengthen and modernize the fiscal framework by enhancing its efficiency, improving
financial control, and increasing fiscal transparency. Staff urges the authorities to address the
Constitutional Council’s comments as quickly as possible to avoid further delay in the
implementation of the law. Transitioning to a more flexible exchange rate regime would better
support the diversification of trade and financial flows while helping preserve competitiveness, and
would better insulate the economy against shocks. Staff supports BAM’s efforts to strengthen the
financial supervisory and regulatory framework to ensure the continued soundness of the financial
sector. In particular, BAM’s is appropriately tackling the challenges that come with the international
expansion of major Moroccan banks. The upcoming FSAP update will provide an opportunity for an
in-depth assessment of the stability and development opportunities of the financial sector.
30.
Fiscal reforms have a central role to play in reducing vulnerabilities and promoting
higher and more inclusive growth. The authorities are to be commended for the remarkable
progress in reforming the subsidy system, a pillar of the efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and create
space for growth-enhancing and social spending. Similarly, the reform of the tax system aims to
bolster the contribution of the fiscal sector to growth by making the system more equitable and
better suited to support competitiveness. The pension reform is urgently needed to ensure the
financial viability of the system and extend its coverage to a larger share of the workforce.
31.
Steadfast implementation of structural reforms is needed to support higher and more
inclusive growth. Improving the business environment is important to strengthen competitiveness
and open more business opportunities. Although progress has been made, more efforts are needed
to improve transparency, competition, and governance, streamline bureaucracy, and address
corruption. The ongoing revamping of programs in support of employment is welcome. Lowering
hiring and firing costs and improving the quality of education are also crucial to significantly
reducing unemployment.
32.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
External sustainability is strengthening
The current account deficit has narrowed considerably since 2012 and is expected to continue
improving over the medium term. The current account deficit is estimated to have decreased by
almost 4 percentage points of GDP from its 2012 peak to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2014. Fiscal
consolidation, the strong export performance of newly developed industries, slower imports
reflecting better prices but also a slowdown in domestic investment all contributed to this
improvement. As a result, reserves exceeded five months of imports at end 2014 or 93.6 percent of
the Fund’s reserve adequacy (ARA) metric for emerging markets, up from 86.5 percent at end-2012.
In 2015 and over the medium term, the current account deficit is expected to continue narrowing
and the reserve position to strengthen while the capital and financial accounts are expected to
remain strong, particularly FDI, as Morocco remains an attractive destination owing to domestic
stability and sound economic fundamentals.
The external debt remains sustainable.
The debt-to-GDP ratio stood at
32.1 percent at end-2014 and is expected
to stabilize around that level over the
medium term. However, a 30 percent

exchange rate depreciation or a shock to

in a significant increase in debt relative to

GDP (Table 3, Figure 1—External DSA). The

(NIIP), which deteriorated strongly

expected to gradually improve over the next few years as external buffers strengthen.
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) indicates that the real effective exchange rate is in line
with fundamentals, reflecting improvements in the current account (Table 2). The current
account approach of the IMF’s EBA methodology points to a current account gap of -1.7 percent of
GDP (compared to -2.6 percent for the 2013 assessment). The equivalent overvaluation of the
dirham (5.5 percent) suggests that policy efforts to reduce imbalances should continue, particularly
in the fiscal sector. On the positive side, the rebuilding of reserve buffers has contributed to closing
the current account gap relative to fundamentals. The external sustainability approach, which

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

MOROCCO

assumes the implementation of planned policies over the medium term, points to a current account
deficit that is slightly smaller than the norm current account, and thereby an undervaluation of the
dirham by 6 percent (as compared to a small overvaluation in previous assessments). Taken
together, the two results suggest the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals.
An increasing diversification of export products is also improving the economy’s resilience to
external shocks (Figure 2). The diversification strategy launched in 2008 (Plan Emergence) is
bearing fruit, as testified by the emergence of newly developed industries (automobile, aeronautics,
and electronics), which are offsetting the relative decline of traditional exports such as textiles and
phosphate. The continued flow of FDI to these new sectors should sustain their expansion over the
medium term. The decline of phosphate and related products results from the normalization of their
prices from their peak in the late 2000s. From 2000 to 2008, the prices of phosphate and its
derivatives increased more than fivefold before declining at end-2013 to about three times the
prices of 2000. A further decline is expected over the medium term, making the emergence of new
export sectors even more important to sustain the improvement of the external position.

Trade is slowly diversifying away from the euro area, but Europe remains Morocco’s principal
external partner (Figure 2). The share of exports to the euro area in total exports declined from
69 percent to 56 percent between 2003 and 2013. Over the same period, exports to Latin America
grew from 3 percent to 7 percent of total Moroccan exports. Moroccan imports from the euro area
also declined from 53 percent to 44 percent of total Moroccan imports between 2003 and 2013. At
the same time, imports from the MENA region (dominated by oil imports), emerging Asia, and the
United States as a share of total Moroccan imports grew by 6, 4, and 3 percentage points
respectively. As a result, between 2003 and 2013, Morocco’s trade balance improved vis-à-vis subSaharan Africa (SSA) and Latin America.
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

As part of its diversification strategy, Morocco has successfully increased its trade with subSaharan Africa.7 Exports to SSA grew more than fivefold in nominal terms during the period 2003–
13. They were 2 percent of total exports in 2003 and 6 percent of total exports in 2013. As of 2013,
SSA is the only region with which Morocco has a trade surplus. However, in spite of the recent surge
of exports to SSA, the market share of Morocco in total SSA imports was only 0.3 percent in 2013.
Morocco aims to increase its market share of SSA imports, including through the development of

Other competitiveness indicators are improving
Morocco’s global competitiveness position indicator improved over the past year. Morocco
moved up to 72nd position in the 2014–15 Global Competitiveness Report, partially reflecting a
recovery from the previous year’s drop (77th position in 2013–14, 70th position in 2012–13).8 The
report attributed the better ranking to improved institutions (reflected by social and political
stability), economic diversification toward exports of higher-value-added industries, efforts made
over recent years to modernize the business environment, the reduction of the budget deficit
between 2012 and 2013, and improvements in primary education and innovation. The report also
flagged other competitiveness strengths, such as physical security, some positive aspects of goods

The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) attempts to quantify the impact of a number of key factors that contribute
to create the conditions for competitiveness, with a particular focus on the macroeconomic environment, the quality
of the country’s institutions, and the state of the country’s technology and supporting infrastructure.

markets efficiency, and a solid and efficient banking sector. However, it noted that Morocco should
continue its effort to address key competiveness challenges, including boosting the quality of
education and the ease of access to it (secondary education in particular), as well as reforming its
labor market. Boosting the use of information and communication technologies by businesses and
individuals would also greatly benefit the country’s competitiveness.
The external position remains subject to significant risks.
While recent trends of the external sector are encouraging, the current account deficit
remains relatively high and further trade diversification is needed. At 5.8 percent of GDP at
end-2014, the current account deficit remains relatively high. Despite the diversification of trade
toward other regions achieved in recent years, Europe remains Morocco’s dominant external
partner, with more than 50 percent of trade, FDI, and remittances (Figure 2). As a result, shocks
emanating from Europe continue to have substantial impact on the economy, making the external
position vulnerable to a protracted period of slow growth in Europe. The dependence on oil imports,
which amounted to about 10.2 percent of GDP in 2014, is another source of vulnerability: a reversal
of the current fall in oil prices could significantly and rapidly widen the deficit again. Further
diversification of energy sources would mitigate this risk, as would further reforming energy
subsidies. The current account deficit is financed with net FDI inflows and debt issuance. Should a
shock to these sources of financing occur, for instance stemming from an abrupt surge in global
financial market volatility that would increase world interest rates and risk-aversion, pressure on
reserves would recur and external buffers could erode again.

Morocco
Background. The current account (CA) deficit is expected to decrease from 9.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to
5.8 percent of GDP in 2014 (6 percent cyclically adjusted), reflecting strong export growth driven by newly emerging
sectors and contained import growth. This trend is expected to continue and the current account is projected to
reach about 2.8 percent of GDP over the medium-term, absent a protracted slowdown in Europe and a spike in oil
prices.
Assessment. The EBA CA model estimates that the CA gap (CA relative to its norm) is about 1.7 percent of GDP at
end-2014. On the other hand, the ES approach indicates that if planned policies are implemented over the medium
term, the CA would be broadly in line with fundamentals over that horizon. These two results suggest that policy
efforts to reduce imbalances should continue, including a diversification of export base and destinations.
Background. The dirham is pegged to a basket of euro and dollar in the proportion 80/20. The recent depreciation
of the euro relative to the dollar resulted in a similar movement of the dirham relative to the dollar.
Assessment. The EBA REER regression was not applied to Morocco because of the lack of required data. The other
EBA methods indicate that the REER is in line with fundamentals.
Background. Capital inflows are dominated by FDI and loans. FDI originates mostly from Europe and flows
particularly into the industrial sector. Access of the sovereign to the international financial market is well established
and corporate access, though modest, is growing.
Assessment. The risk of sudden capital flow reversal is small. Continued implementation of the government’s
structural reform agenda, including improvement in the business environment, is key to strengthening Morocco’s
competitive position and to maintaining Morocco as an attractive destination for FDI. The government’s
commitment to fiscal consolidation will also help maintain favorable access to international financial markets.
Background. Reserves have been growing, reflecting strong performance of emerging export sectors, contained
energy import bill, and stable capital flows. They now represent about five months of imports and 93.7 percent of
the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric for emerging markets (ARA).
Assessment. The level of reserves is adequate for normal time, in spite of being less than 100 percent by the ARA
metric, because of the capital controls that remain in place in Morocco.
Background. Morocco’s NIIP at end-2014 is estimated at about -67 percent of GDP, with assets representing
28 percent of GDP and liabilities 95 percent of GDP. The liabilities are dominated by FDI (48 percent of GDP) and
external debt (32.1 percent of GDP).
Assessment. The NIIP is sustainable, as improvements in the current account balance are expected to stabilize it
around 61 percent of GDP over the medium term. Also, portfolio liabilities, which are the most volatile components
of liabilities, represent only a small share of total liabilities. In addition, the external debt is sustainable,
notwithstanding its sensitivity to some external shocks.

1/ This ratio is based on debt and GDP in dollar term.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

Annex II: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Morocco’s public sector gross debt-to-GDP ratio declined between 2000 and 2010. However, since
then, external shocks and domestic factors have caused the ratio to rise. Nevertheless, at about
64 percent of GDP at end-2013, public debt remains sustainable. The DSA shows it to be resilient to
various shocks. Vulnerabilities linked to the level and profile of the debt appear moderate, for the most
part. However, gross financing needs have been high (mainly linked to the rollover of existing debt)
and have exceeded the benchmark of 15 percent of GDP over the past three years, highlighting some
risks despite the relatively moderate level of debt.
This DSA updates the analysis conducted for the request for a successor arrangement under
the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The overall picture has not changed significantly from
the previous analysis. A downward revision to real output growth projections has resulted in a slight
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
After declining over the previous decade, Morocco’s public debt-to-GDP ratio started rising in
2010 as macroeconomic performance deteriorated. Rising international commodity prices
contributed to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, mainly through the cost of higher food and
fuel subsidies, and public debt rose from 47 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 64 percent in 2013.
About half of this increase occurred in 2012 as the economy was severely affected by the crisis in
Europe (Morocco’s main trade partner) and higher oil prices and the authorities encountered
difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit. However, the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts are
expected to help bring the debt ratio down toward 60 percent of GDP in the medium term.
The debt level is generally resilient to shocks, but there are risks linked to financing needs
and, to a lesser extent, to shocks to growth and the primary balance (see heat map below).
Baseline projections are realistic when compared to a group of market access countries. Morocco’s
projected fiscal consolidation efforts, aimed at lowering the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP in the
medium term, do not appear exceptional relative to the distribution of other country cases. The debt
level remains below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets when
various shocks are assumed, except in cases of shocks to real GDP growth or to the primary balance.
Vulnerabilities linked to the profile of debt are mostly moderate, except for an exceptional increase
in short-term debt in 2013; however, short term debt represents a very small part of total debt
(about 5½ percent). Relevant indicators exceed the lower early-warning benchmarks but not the
upper risk assessment ones (see chart). Gross financing needs exceed the benchmark of 15 percent
under the baseline in 2013 (about 20 percent of GDP) and are not expected to decline under the

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

benchmark until 2017. The limited number of investment alternatives in the local domestic market,
coupled with existing capital controls, mitigates risks linked to high financing needs, but this
nevertheless highlights the importance of continuing fiscal consolidation to reduce debt-financed
deficits and of carefully managing the maturity profile of debt instruments.

3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions
relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN
Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with
Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the
exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a
conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 80 percent
and 20 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value
of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international
exchange markets. As of December 3, 2014, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 13.02.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on January 31, 2014. The discussions for the 2014 consultation were held in Rabat
and Casablanca during November 5–17, 2014.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Morocco

On February 6, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2014 Article IV consultation.1
Morocco has made important strides in maintaining macroeconomic stability in a difficult
environment, but challenges remain to reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities, strengthen
growth, create jobs and tackle poverty. Growth slowed in 2014 as a result of a contraction in
agricultural activity following an exceptional 2013 crop and weak demand from Europe.
However, growth is expected to rebound in 2015 to about 4.4 percent and remain robust in the
medium term as external demand and domestic confidence strengthen. Inflation has remained
low and the financial sector remains sound. The 2014 current account deficit narrowed to an
estimated 5.8 percent of GDP due to booming exports from newly developed sectors and lower
oil prices. International reserves increased to above 5 months of imports. The 2014 fiscal deficit
was also reduced to 4.9 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy actions which have
reduced economic vulnerabilities. Fiscal and current account deficits have declined and
international reserves have increased. However, Directors noted that Morocco’s economy still
faces significant risks given the challenging external environment. They encouraged the
authorities to continue with an appropriate policy mix and reforms to consolidate the gains thus

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in Summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

far, further build external and fiscal buffers, reduce unemployment, and promote higher and
more inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the progress made in fiscal consolidation. They commended the impressive
reduction in subsidies, in particular the removal of subsidies on all liquid petroleum products. To
further reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and create space for the much needed growth-enhancing
investment and social spending, Directors encouraged the authorities to rationalize and better
target remaining subsidies to reduce budgetary costs while protecting the most vulnerable.
Directors underscored the need for continued fiscal consolidation to put debt firmly on a
downward path and to address vulnerabilities arising from the large public and external financing
needs. They commended the progress made in adopting the new organic budget law, which is
expected to strengthen and modernize the fiscal framework by enhancing its efficiency,
improving financial control and increasing transparency. They called for the timely
implementation of this law, once concerns from the Constitutional Council have been addressed.
Directors stressed the urgency to reform the pension system. They also highlighted the need to
further reform the tax system.
Directors agreed that monetary policy has been appropriate. Noting the improving
macroeconomic situation, they supported transitioning to a more flexible exchange rate regime,
in coordination with other macroeconomic policies, as it would foster trade and financial flows
diversification while helping preserve competitiveness and better insulating the economy against
shocks. Directors welcomed Bank Al-Maghrib’s (BAM) efforts to strengthen the financial
supervisory and regulatory framework to ensure continued financial sector soundness. They
commended the BAM’s proactive efforts to tackle the supervisory and other challenges linked to
the international expansion of Moroccan banks and agreed that the forthcoming central bank law
would strengthen the BAM’s supervision and crisis resolution abilities. Directors looked forward
to the upcoming FSAP update as it would provide an opportunity for a comprehensive
assessment of the financial system.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms remain critical for reducing unemployment,
diversifying the economy, and promoting higher and more inclusive growth, including by
improving the business environment and strengthening competitiveness. Directors called for
further action on enhancing transparency and governance, streamlining administrative procedure,
and addressing corruption. Continued efforts toward reforming the labor market, increasing the
efficiency of spending on education and vocational training, and raising female participation
remain important going forward.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
February 6, 2015
Introduction
In a still unfavorable international environment, notably a weak economy in the euro
area, the Moroccan authorities have been successful in maintaining macroeconomic
stability and broadly satisfactory growth performance. This performance owes much to
the economy’s strong fundamentals, the authorities’ sound fiscal, monetary and financial
policies, and accelerated pace of implementation of their comprehensive structural reform
agenda to provide an enabling environment for private sector development, strengthen
and diversify the production and export base, further enhance the economy’s resilience,
and promote stronger and more inclusive growth and higher job creation. While
demonstrating unwavering commitment to their economic and financial program, they
have also redoubled their efforts at strengthening the social safety net and reducing
poverty and exclusion. Building on the gains achieved so far, the authorities are
committed to staying the course of sound policies and structural reform. They broadly
agree with staff assessment and recommendations and are grateful for the fruitful
dialogue during the Article IV consultations. They also thank the Executive Board and
management for their support.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
GDP growth declined to about 3 percent in 2014 from 4.4 percent in 2013, mainly
reflecting lower agricultural production compared to the 2013 bumper crop. However,
nonagricultural GDP growth strengthened, reflecting a recovery in manufacturing,
mining, and services with the exception of tourism which suffered from weak demand in
Europe. Average inflation declined to 0.4 percent, notwithstanding the price hikes
implemented under the subsidy reform, and should stabilize at 1.5-2.0 percent in 2015
and over the medium term. While growth is projected to reach 4.4 percent in 2015,
reflecting continued strengthening in the nonagricultural sector, the recent declines in
world oil prices could boost consumption and growth since, with the elimination of
subsidies on liquid petroleum products and the indexation of their prices to international
prices, these declines will be passed on to the consumer, even though they will be partly
offset by the appreciation of the US dollar. Favorable rainfall so far also augurs for
improving agricultural production. Therefore, it is likely that growth in 2015 would be
stronger than projected.
Morocco’s medium-term outlook is favorable, underpinned by political and social
stability, a strong institutional framework, and sound economic and financial policies.
Growth is currently projected to accelerate over the medium term to 5.5 percent, but the
authorities intend to reassess the growth outlook to take into account the impact of the
fall in commodity prices. After declining to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2014, down from
7.6 percent of GDP in 2013, the current account deficit is projected to fall further to reach
3.3 percent of GDP in 2015 and stabilize at around 3 percent thereafter, financed in full
by FDI. Sustained implementation of structural reforms, together with sizable investment

2
in infrastructure and renewable energy, bodes well for future growth and the economy’s
capacity to attract higher FDI and generate increased employment opportunities.
Fiscal developments and policies
Fiscal developments through end-December 2014 were in line with the PLL objective
and the authorities’ medium term fiscal consolidation program of achieving a 3 percent of
GDP deficit by 2017. The deficit fell from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 4.9 percent in
2014. Compared to the original estimate of 5.5 percent of GDP for 2013 in the PLL
request report, the decline is larger, amounting to 0.6 percentage points of GDP.
Reflecting lower-than-projected GDP growth, revenue increased less than expected (by
3.7 percent), but growth in total expenditure was even lower (2.9 percent), mainly
reflecting a sharp decline in fuel subsidies and a decline in the wage/GDP ratio. The
composition of spending shifted significantly toward capital expenditures, including
capital transfers, which increased by more than 8 percent, compared to a moderate
increase of 1.8 percent for current expenditures.
The authorities are confident that their fiscal policy and related structural reforms will
help achieve their medium-term objectives of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of
GDP in 2017 and putting the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm declining trend as of 2016. The
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio has already slowed down significantly, with the ratio
stabilizing at less than 64 percent in 2014. The 2015 budget targets a further reduction of
the fiscal deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the full effect of the subsidy
reform and continued wage moderation.
Table 3 in the staff report indicates a decline in total investment in 2015 compared to
2014. Part of this decline is due to the reclassification of some 0.22 percent of GDP of
expenditure from the capital to the current budget, consistent with the new OBL. This
reclassification also explains to a large extent the increase in goods and services spending
between 2014 and 2015 referred to in ¶14 of the staff report. The reassessment of the
impact of the decline in global commodity prices on growth and the budget outlook in
2015, along with efforts to strengthen revenue collection and control on non-priority
spending, should help create additional space for investment spending, while achieving
the deficit reduction target.
Progress continues to be made on implementation of fiscal structural reforms and
strengthening the fiscal policy framework. In this regard, the authorities attach high
priority to early adoption and effectiveness of the new Organic Budget Law (OBL). A
revised draft, to comply with the Constitutional Council finding that some of the
dispositions of the adopted law were unconstitutional, was approved by the Council of
Ministers on January 29 and will be submitted to parliament shortly. The authorities are
also working closely with social partners to reach agreement on the planned pension
system reform.

3
Monetary, exchange rate, and financial policies
Monetary policy continues to aim at maintaining low inflation while ensuring the
conditions for adequate financing of the economy. The new window for financing very
small, small, and medium-sized enterprises has been successful in responding to the
needs of this crucial segment of the economy. The ongoing reform of the central bank
law should enhance its independence and effectiveness of monetary policy. The
authorities agree with staff assessment that the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals.
They are reassessing their exchange rate regime and options of reform, with Fund
technical assistance, in order to help promote greater integration into the world economy,
enhance export diversification, and better absorb external shocks. They intend to draw
conclusions on available options after the FSAP mission scheduled in April. In the
meantime, the central bank is strengthening its analytical and forecasting tools and
capabilities to support the transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime and a new
monetary framework.
The financial sector remains sound and resilient, and further progress has been made in
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, including gradual
implementation of Basel III, as indicated in the Written Communication. The new
banking law increases the supervisory role of the central bank and creates a framework
for Charia-compliant (so-called Islamic) banks, which should increase financial
inclusion. The revised central bank law will enhance its role in promoting financial
stability. The central bank is closely monitoring the expansion of Moroccan banks in
Sub-Saharan Africa, and is strengthening cross-border supervision in close cooperation
with host supervisors.
Structural policies
The authorities' bold and comprehensive structural reform agenda to raise potential
growth, diversify the economy, and promote competitiveness—including by improving
the business climate and the incentive structure for private investment and by developing
infrastructure—is paying off, as evidenced by the improved Doing Business rating and
the ongoing structural transformation of the economy. New high growth sectors, such as
automobile, electronics, and aeronautics have taken over the position of phosphates and
derivatives as the largest source of exports, but traditional exports have also recovered
recently and are expected to continue to grow over the medium term. The authorities are
committed to further improving the business climate, reforming the judiciary, and
increasing efficiency of spending on education and vocational training.
The complete elimination of subsidies on liquid petroleum products ahead of schedule
constitutes a major leap forward in significantly reducing one of the key vulnerabilities of
the economy. It attests to the resolve of the authorities to strengthen macroeconomic
stability and enhance the resilience of the economy by taking politically difficult
measures even in a pre-election period. This reform is supported by continuous
strengthening of resources earmarked for social assistance to the poor and vulnerable
population under the conditional cash transfer programs of RAMED and TAYSSIR.

4
Implementation of the authorities' ambitious program of diversification of energy sources
toward renewable resources, in particular windmill and solar power generation, in order
to protect the environment and reduce dependence on fossil fuel, is proceeding broadly as
scheduled with private sector participation. In this regard, the share of solar and windmill
energy in total power generation should increase from 4 percent in 2009 to 17 percent in
2015 and is projected to reach 28 percent in 2020.
PLL Review
Performance under the 2014 PLL was strong. The indicative target for Net International
Reserves for September 2014 was met with a wide margin. The indicative target for the
fiscal deficit was exceeded by 0.7 percent of GDP, reflecting the authorities’ decision to
ease private sector liquidity constraints by accelerating VAT refunds and budgeted
transfers to some public enterprises, with no impact on end-2014 fiscal deficit, which
declined to 4.9 percent of GDP, as targeted. Reserves increased further both in terms of
import coverage and in percent of the Fund's reserve adequacy metrics. On the structural
reform agenda, subsidy reform was ahead of schedule, the Banking Law was adopted,
and significant progress was made on the OBL, the pension reform, and the revised
central bank law.
The staff report reaffirms Morocco’s eligibility to the PLL. While it continued to perform
strongly in the monetary policy, financial sector, and data areas, there was a significant
progress in the two areas where vulnerabilities remained. External vulnerabilities
declined, reflecting stronger current account and reserves position, as well as the return of
the exchange rate to full alignment with fundamentals. Fiscal vulnerabilities also declined
following the subsidy reform and the progress made on the OBL. Nevertheless, the
exogenous risks faced by Morocco remain substantial, as reflected in the external stress
index and, notwithstanding improved reserves position and continued progress in
reducing vulnerabilities, the PLL will continue to play an important role in mitigating
these risks. The authorities are committed to achieving the objectives of their economic
and financial program supported by the PLL, which they will continue to treat as
precautionary.
