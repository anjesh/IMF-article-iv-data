EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. GDP growth is likely to rebound to 6 percent in 2006, helped by high steel
export prices and strong domestic demand. The latter is underpinned by rapid income growth
and reinforced by a credit boom. With domestic price pressures already significant, rising
prices for energy imports have stoked CPI inflation, which will likely exceed 12 percent.
Booming domestic demand, real currency appreciation, and rising energy prices are likely to
shift the current account into a small deficit. Monetary policy has continued to be anchored
by a de facto peg, while fiscal policy remained broadly neutral in 2006.
Outlook. Growth will likely slow to 4½ percent in 2007, and the current-account deficit
increase further to 4 percent of GDP, as import prices for natural gas continue to edge up.
Inflation would likely drop to about 8 percent, given the authorities’ intention not to continue
pass-through of energy-price increases to consumers. The medium-term outlook is sensitive
to external developments and policy responses. A benign external environment, featuring
even higher steel prices and FDI, could produce growth in excess of 7 percent, but inflation
could prove hard to control under a peg. Under an adverse external outlook, by contrast, the
peg could lead to external sustainability problems.
Policy discussions. The discussions focused on the following issues:
•

Monetary framework. The authorities foresee a very gradual transition to a more
flexible exchange rate regime, reflecting their more sanguine view on the external
outlook and concerns about the risks of abandoning the present de facto peg. Staff
argued that the NBU should accelerate the transition. This would deliver better
inflation control and help insulate the economy against adverse external
developments.

•

Coping with financial sector vulnerabilities. Authorities and staff agreed that
Ukraine’s long-standing credit boom and heavy external borrowing had raised
vulnerabilities, particularly owing to foreign-exchange lending to unhedged
borrowers. Staff urged a strengthening of the regulatory framework and a temporary
increase in the capital-adequacy ratio.

•

Fiscal framework. The authorities intended to target a fiscal deficit of about
2½ percent of GDP, while reducing both recurrent spending and taxes over the
medium term. Staff viewed this as an appropriate framework, both from a debt
sustainability and a policy-mix perspective, but specific policies planned for 2007
raise concerns, including a tilt toward expanding subsidies and tax preferences.

•

Accelerating growth. The authorities saw spurring investment spending as key to
boosting growth. Staff concurred but also noted that the really binding growth
bottlenecks seemed to be insecure property rights, corruption, and a regulatory
jungle—structural deficiencies that were also reflected in underdeveloped financial
markets.

6
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since the last Article IV discussions, Ukraine’s economy has proven surprisingly
resilient. With growth having slowed sharply through 2005, the economy was hit by a
65 percent hike in the price of imported natural gas in early-2006. Political developments
were also inauspicious: parliamentary elections in March 2006 triggered drawn-out political
wrangling, and a new government took office only in August. In this setting, the authorities
and IMF staff expected another year of below-potential economic performance. In the event,
growth rebounded, spurred in part by resurging export prices for steel—Ukraine’s main
export—while CPI inflation moderated through most of 2006, helped by administrative
delays in pass-through of higher energy prices.
2.
Ukraine’s macroeconomic challenges remain massive, however. Ukraine lags in
its transition, and the new government’s overarching objective is catching up with the income
levels of its more advanced transition peers. At the same time, external risks to
macroeconomic stability, particularly a sharp decline in the terms of trade, loom large.

Box 1. Reactions to IMF Advice
While the authorities generally concur with IMF policy advice, implementation, particularly
on structural issues, has been slow or uneven. This record may reflect an ingrained
preference for gradualism but also a polarized body politic that has found it difficult to reach
and sustain consensus on implementing market-friendly policies.1
Fiscal policy. In 2005, the authorities met the recommended cash deficit target of
2½ percent of GDP. For 2006, they targeted a higher deficit than recommended (3¼ versus
2¼ percent of GDP), but may well undershoot their original target. At the same time, staff
has been critical of the large increases in recurrent spending during 2005-06, mainly in
public pensions and wages.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. While agreeing in principle with the staff’s longstanding case for greater exchange rate flexibility, the NBU favors a very gradualist
approach. But, IMF advice, particularly through technical assistance, has been instrumental
in facilitating steps in liberalizing the foreign-exchange market and enhancing the NBU’s
policy-making capacity.
Financial sector. The NBU has been responsive to IMF advice. However, past staff
proposals to hike the minimum capital-adequacy ratio from 10 to 12 percent have been
rejected. Moreover, political consensus on various legal initiatives that would enhance
transparency of banks’ ownership structures and strengthen minority shareholder rights
remains elusive.
Structural reforms. There were several recent advances in leveling the playing field for
businesses and liberalizing foreign trade (see Table 1 for details). However, progress in
other areas, including reforming the energy sector, tax administration, and public
procurement, has stalled or even backtracked.

II. BACKGROUND
Recent growth and inflation developments have been better than expected.
3.
After nose-diving in 2005, real activity staged a surprise rebound in 2006, with
growth returning to par with regional peers. This volatility reflected several cross-currents
(Figure 1):

Temporary impacts of postOrange-Revolution policies.
Activity in trade and
construction in particular
contracted sharply in 2005,
reflecting a clampdown on tax
loopholes, smuggling, and
corruption, as well as cutbacks
in public-sector investment.
Moreover, a re-privatization
debate temporarily chilled
investor sentiment, delaying
some private investment
into 2006.

•

Temporary export shocks. Export volumes slumped in 2005, reflecting a marked
real currency appreciation, higher business-tax collections, and intensified thirdcountry competition in steel markets. However, pulled along by resurgent steel prices
and robust trading-partner growth, exporters regained their footing in 2006.

•

A fiscal-policy-driven consumption boom, reinforced by rapidly expanding
household credit. While respecting low deficit targets, fiscal policy in 2005–06
reshuffled resources from higher-saving businesses (mainly by raising tax collections)
to lower-saving households (mainly by raising public pensions and wages). Over the
same time period, household credit expanded by well over 100 percent. As a result,
private and public consumption have boomed, and the national savings rate is likely
to have dropped by some 8 percent of GDP.
After CPI inflation had come down in line with food
price inflation, it has accelerated again.

Inflation moderated through
most of 2006, but has recently climbed
back into double digits, boosted by
energy-price pass-through. Monthly CPI
headline inflation has swung widely over
the last two years, even by regional
standards (Figure 2). Notwithstanding
booming consumption, high CPI inflation
started to moderate in mid-2005. This
reflected slowing real activity, low import
price inflation, and a host of one-off
factors, including temporary Russian
import bans on Ukrainian meat and dairy
products. However, as pass-through of

Ukraine’s steep terms-of-trade gains came to an abrupt halt in 2006. Prices for
steel exports have skyrocketed, rising well above trend since 2003 (Figure 3). While import
prices, particularly for oil, also increased sharply through 2005, the cumulative terms-oftrade improvement during 2003–

comes against the backdrop of
highly inefficient energy use and
an energy trade deficit that is already one of the highest among transition economies.1
6.
The current account has switched from large surpluses into deficit, but capital
flows have picked up and international reserves have reached healthy levels. With
domestic demand booming, export volumes slumping, and the terms of trade reverting, the
current account shifted from a surplus of 10½ percent of GDP in 2004 to a likely deficit of
1 percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 3, Figure 4). At the same time, capital inflows, FDI in
particular, have been buoyant, reflecting improved perceptions of Ukraine as an investment
location. As a result, foreign-exchange reserves have more than doubled since end-2004 to
about 4½ months of imports and are projected to exceed the level of short-term external debt
at end-2006, mitigating external vulnerabilities.

The hryvnia’s real undervaluation has narrowed considerably. Staff work
in 2004 suggested that the hryvnia was heavily undervalued in real terms, although
quantitative estimates varied widely. A re-assessment using the latest data and based on the
IMF’s macroeconomic-balance approach points to a much reduced gap between Ukraine’s
actual and estimated equilibrium current account (Figure 5).2 This analysis suggests a real
effective exchange rate undervaluation of between 3 and 15 percent. Alternative approaches
based on purchasing-power-parity and dollar-wage comparisons across countries are broadly
consistent with this assessment. However, these approaches also highlight that Ukraine’s real
effective exchange rate should be expected to appreciate substantially over the longer term as
its per capita income catches up with more advanced economies.
Notwithstanding low fiscal deficits, spending and tax policies have shifted the economy on
to a high-consumption path.
8.
The authorities have proven adept at hitting low fiscal deficit targets, and
explicit public debt has plunged. The 1998 financial crisis, which was triggered by the
government’s inability to roll over its short-term debt, has left fiscal-policy makers with an
acute sense of vulnerabilities related to high deficits and debt. Thus, in 2005, despite a
slowing economy and no financing constraints (privatization receipts alone reached 5 percent
of GDP), the tight general government cash deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP was easily
met. Through November 2006, the authorities seemed on track to undershoot the 3 percent of
GDP annual deficit target (Table 5). The combination of low deficits and strong nominal
growth has reduced explicit public debt to about 17 percent of GDP, down from over
60 percent in 1999. However, contingent liabilities remain high at some 30 percent of GDP,
largely reflecting the so-called lost-savings deposits (Box 2), but also implicit contingent
liabilities of state enterprises.
9.
Reflecting a redistributionist shift in fiscal policy, recurrent spending and tax
collections from businesses have both ratcheted upward. In 2005, average public wages
and pensions were raised by over 50 percent (against an inflation target of just under
10 percent). As a result, pension spending commitments soared from 12 percent of GDP
in 2004 to about 17 percent in 2005, likely the world’s highest ratio (Figure 6). To finance
this recurrent-spending boom, while reducing the fiscal deficit, the government curtailed
capital spending by some 1¾ percent of GDP and raised tax collections by some 6 percent of
GDP, the latter especially through canceling tax breaks for the free economic zones (FEZs)
and administrative improvements. The 2006 budget largely preserved the thrust of these
policies.

Box 2. Ukraine’ Lost-Savings Problem
The savings deposits of Ukrainian citizens depreciated to almost nothing during the early1990s hyperinflation. But the deposits were recognized as a government liability in 1996,
amounting then to about 160 percent of GDP. However, the law only requires a minimum
annual repayment of about 0.1 percent of GDP, and since the liability was neither indexed
nor paid interest, it has shrunk to some 24 percent of GDP. Recently, there have been
several proposals to speed up repayment, which, if implemented, could significantly ratchet
up the fiscal cost of resolving the lost-savings problem.

The monetary framework has remained anchored by a de facto peg.
10.
Monetary conditions have continued to adjust passively to the requirements of
the peg and are currently loose. Although the NBU has allowed the interbank exchange
rate to fluctuate within a narrow band of Hrv/US$5.00-5.06, the exchange-rate regime has
remained a de facto peg. In this setting, base money growth has been mostly driven by
foreign-exchange interventions and changes in the government’s deposits at the NBU
(Figure 7, Table 6). During most of 2006, the NBU’s monetary reactions implied an
automatic tightening of its stance, only partly off-set by lower reserve requirements and a cut
in NBU interest rates. More recently, monetary conditions have loosened again, reflecting a
pickup in foreign-reserve accumulation and drawdown of government deposits. Real shortterm interest rates have remained highly negative throughout this period.

unhedged. Banks are also faced with
rising foreign-currency liquidity risk, reflecting their increased reliance on short-term foreign
funding (Table 7). While an influx of foreign banks since 2005 likely had a beneficial effect
on credit-risk management practices, recent financial soundness indicators, particularly
declining capital-adequacy ratios, suggest that the sector as a whole continues to be
vulnerable to downside risks.
12.
Financial markets remain heavily underdeveloped. While equity-market
capitalization is relatively high, daily turnover is miniscule and individual stock prices move
in lockstep, suggesting that the market plays little role in allocating capital across companies
(Figure 9). The government-securities market has also stayed illiquid and shallow, reflecting
strong preferences toward foreign financing: between August 2005 and October 2006, no
significant primary issuances took place. Finally, the size and liquidity of foreign-exchange
markets, including forward markets for hedging exchange-rate risks, has been constrained by
the de facto peg and a sizeable tax on non-cash foreign-exchange transactions.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
13.
The authorities and staff agreed that Ukraine faced interconnected
macroeconomic challenges. With external uncertainties looming large, discussions focused
on the appropriate monetary and fiscal frameworks—both key to adjust to external shocks
and control inflation—and measures to address rising banking-sector risks. At the same time,
unlocking convergence growth clearly remains Ukraine’s key longer-term challenge, and
discussions also covered growth strategies.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
14.
There was agreement that Ukraine’s external environment was highly uncertain.
Natural gas prices were expected to rise further toward Western European levels over the
medium term, and this would undoubtedly have adverse implications for growth, inflation,
and the current account.4 Less clear was the scope for raising energy efficiency and,
consequently, lowering energy-import volumes. On the export side, prices for steel were
surrounded by large margins of uncertainty: some observers (producers) foresaw continuing
increases, while others (traders) expected declines. Finally, it was difficult to discern how
capital flows, FDI in particular, would respond to different combinations of shocks and
policies.5
15.
The authorities’ external outlook was much more favorable than that of staff.
They expected benign conditions: sharply higher export prices for steel; falling non-energy
import prices; and strong capital inflows. By contrast, under staff’s external baseline, steel
prices would revert toward trend over the medium term in line with the WEO’s metal price
projections, and non-energy import prices would follow WEO export-price trends in
Ukraine’s trading partners. As a result, most of Ukraine’s recent terms-of-trade gains would
be reversed over the next five years (Figure 10). In staff’s external baseline, depending on
policies, the current-account deficit could be pushed well beyond reasonable estimates of the
equilibrium deficit, resulting in real overvaluation.
16.
The authorities planned several significant policy changes, and, given their
benign external outlook, expected the economy to perform well over the medium term.
Most notably, recent budgetary policies that had cut into national savings would be reversed,
with public wages and transfers restrained to reduce consumption growth. Assuming
favorable terms-of-trade developments, the authorities saw these policies as sufficient to
restore the previous pattern of large current-account surpluses. With budgetary savings, the
authorities intended to raise public-sector investment, particularly in the energy sector, to

Another external uncertainty relates to potentially significant receipts from trading carbo emission rights under
the Kyoto Protocol.

mitigate the impact of rising gas-import prices. A range of tax preferences, subsidies, and
structural reforms would spur higher private investment. In this environment, FDI inflows
would be buoyant, and growth robust in the 6–7 percent range. A stable nominal exchange
rate, careful management of supplies in domestic markets, and administered price restraint
would bring CPI inflation down and keep it in single digits.
17.
Staff analysis suggested, however, that the authorities’ policies could create
medium-term macroeconomic tensions, both under staff’s baseline and a benign
external outlook.
•

Under the baseline external outlook, CPI inflation could still drop to just over
8 percent in 2007, since the authorities do not intend to pass through higher energy
prices to consumers (Figure 11, Table 8). However, over the medium term, the
combination of negative external shocks and a pegged nominal exchange rate could
result in currency overvaluation, rising current-account deficits, and falling
international reserves. This would not be an environment where capital inflows would
be buoyant, nor would growth be strong.

•

Under the baseline external outlook, there could be risks to external debt
sustainability. Ukraine’s gross external debt would rise, reflecting increasing currentaccount deficits; moreover, in response to an array of other adverse shocks, it could
reach uncomfortably high levels. Public debt sustainability would be maintained,
although large-scale realization of contingent liabilities could ratchet it up
considerably. (Appendix I).

•

In contrast, under a benign external outlook and the authorities’ likely policies,
including a maintained peg, the currency would likely remain undervalued. Given
past monetary-policy behavior under the peg, the authorities might not be able or
willing to sterilize large foreign-exchange interventions. Monetary expansion could
therefore lead to medium-term inflationary pressure regardless of administrative price
restraints.

18.
More robust policies would therefore be needed to forestall medium-term
macroeconomic tensions. Staff saw the authorities’ fiscal framework and incomes-policy
intentions as broadly appropriate. However, the authorities should allow pass-through of
higher energy import prices not only to producers but also consumers, shift to a monetary
framework based on a more flexible exchange-rate regime, and restrain second-round
inflation effects of higher energy prices through an appropriately tight monetary stance.
These policies should be seen as a package: not implementing some recommended policies
could put too high a burden on other policy areas.
19.
The recommended policy frameworks would allow the authorities to cope with
both baseline and benign external outlooks. Under the baseline external outlook, current-

1/ Both baseline and benign external scenarios assume natural gas prices converge to Western European levels
(adjusted for transit) by 2010. The benign external scenario assumes substantially higher steel prices through 2011,
faster export volume growth, and higher FDI relative to the baseline external scenario.
2/ The authorities' policies are assumed to include (i) a fixed exchange rate through 2009, followed by a gradually
widening exchange rate corridor; (ii) full pass-through of rising energy import prices to industry, but zero pass-through
to consumers; and (iii) annual real wage growth of 5 percent.
3/ Staff recommended policies include: (i) full pass-through of energy import prices; (ii) a more flexible exchange rate
starting in 2007; and (iii) minimum wage growth in line with the CPI excluding energy.

26
account deficits could be contained at some 5 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the
economy’s savings constraints and investment needs (Table 9, Figure 11). Ukraine’s sharply
increased need for gross external financing would also prove manageable. There would be
some temporary increase in CPI inflation owing to continued energy-price pass-through to
consumers, pushing inflation to 10½ percent by end-2007. However, the recommended
policies would help contain second-round impacts, and lower inflation to about 5 percent in
the medium term. Growth could moderate to 4½ percent in 2007, but return to some
5½ percent in the medium term. Under the benign external outlook and recommended
policies, there would still be near-term adverse macroeconomic effects from the energy-price
shock, including higher inflation and lower growth. However, strong FDI would lift mediumterm growth and exports, while a more flexible exchange rate regime would allow the NBU
to counteract the inflationary impact of balance-of-payments inflows.

A more flexible exchange rate
regime should be the centerpiece of a more
robust overall policy framework.6 Ukraine’s
economy is vulnerable to large terms-of-trade
fluctuations and increasingly also to shifts in
capital flows. Thus, maintaining the peg
would require that fiscal and incomes policies
would be able and willing to shoulder the
potentially large burden of maintaining
external balance if shocks occur—an unlikely
prospect, in staff’s view. Moreover, the peg
would also likely continue to have difficulties
delivering low and stable inflation and
encourage excessive risk-taking by unhedged
borrowers.7

The NBU agreed in principle with the potential benefits of a more flexible
exchange-rate regime, but felt that these were still currently outweighed by risks.
Exchange-rate movements, in either direction, could undermine the hard-earned trust in the
currency, evoke distributional conflicts, and, in case of depreciations, have adverse balancesheet effects. Also, monetary policy could not yet be operated effectively given
underdeveloped financial markets. Thus, while preparations toward inflation targeting would
be continued, no significant fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate were foreseen for the
next few years.

22.
While taking note of the authorities’ concerns regarding adverse balance-sheet
effects, staff suggested that the timing for shifting to greater flexibility seemed right.
Political uncertainties have receded, the exchange rate is significantly better aligned with
fundamentals, and fiscal and income policies are set to tighten over the medium term,
providing a supportive environment. Moreover, conditions in international markets are
benign, while the level of international reserves should provide adequate insurance against
portfolio shifts. As regards adverse balance-sheet effects, staff’s analysis (see Box 3 below)
suggests that a large, sudden depreciation could indeed test the banking sector’s resilience.
While this concern argued for a measured shift to a more flexible exchange rate, it also
seemed to caution against shifting only very gradually given the scope for significant
overvaluation building up under scenarios that combine a maintained peg and an adverse
external environment. Therefore, for 2007, the exchange rate should be allowed to move
within the Hrv/US$4.95-5.25 corridor announced in the NBU’s 2007 Monetary Policy
Guidelines, and the exchange-rate corridor should be gradually widened over time
23.
Because events might overtake a very gradual transition strategy, swifter action
in several other areas seemed called for:
•

The NBU should introduce a short-term policy rate for monetary operations, and
proceed with technical preparations for inflation targeting, on which much headway
has already been made (Table 10).

•

The government should provide the NBU with a clearer mandate to pursue price
stability as its primary objective. Thus, the signing of a joint Memorandum of
Understanding between the NBU and the government could send a useful signal to
the public that the government backs a shift to inflation targeting. However,
ultimately the NBU Law should be amended in that direction.

•

And the government should also more actively support financial-market development,
including by eliminating the foreign-exchange transaction tax as well as relying more
on domestic borrowing and issuing benchmark securities. The authorities were
receptive, but cited fiscal-cost considerations and shallow domestic markets as key
reasons to phase out the foreign-exchange transactions tax only gradually and to
continue relying mainly on external borrowing.

24.
Views differed on how proactive monetary policy should be in containing
underlying inflation pressures. The NBU and staff agreed that the government’s inflation
objective of 7½ percent for end-2007, which implies an estimated disinflation of
4½ percentage points relative to end-2006, could not be reached if energy price hikes were
passed through to consumers. In that event, there was agreement that first-round effects
should be accommodated. The main issue was, however, what monetary stance would be
appropriate for containing pressures on underlying inflation, i.e. CPI excluding energy. The
NBU viewed current monetary conditions as appropriate and envisaged broad money growth

28
in the range of 28-33 percent for 2007. Staff, noting substantial excess liquidity in the
banking system and highly negative short-term interest rates, viewed current monetary
conditions as too loose and argued for tighter liquidity conditions to slow broad money
growth significantly below the range envisaged by the NBU.
C. What Should Be Done to Contain Banking-Sector Vulnerabilities?
25.
In view of the uncertain external outlook, there is some urgency to upgrade
banks’ capacity to deal with risks. For example, in a risk scenario where rising
macroeconomic imbalances caused large capital outflows, an overshooting exchange rate
could severely impact borrowers’ repayment ability. Stress tests (Box 3) based on a number
of sensitive assumptions suggest that the cushions in some banks might not be sufficient to
withstand such a shock. Indeed, high credit concentration in some banks could accentuate the
shock, and the heavy reliance on collateral, which may prove to be overvalued and difficult
to repossess, could also backfire. Rating agencies are also concerned about the vulnerability
of the banking sector and continue to rate many banks at far-below investment grade.
26.
The authorities shared these concerns and have already taken measures to limit
risks. Drawing on the lessons from the country’s past financial crises⎯including a nearliquidity crisis in late-2004 during the Orange Revolution⎯the NBU has started to enhance
its own risk-management plans and tightened various banking regulations. In particular, it
has strengthened quality standards for bank capital, raised minimum-capital requirements,
differentiated required reserve ratios by currency, and introduced higher provisioning ratios
for unhedged borrowers in foreign exchange. Staff welcomed plans to raise provisioning
requirements further and apply higher capital-adequacy risk weights for loans in foreign
exchange, and recent legal changes that require the transformation of banks into open jointstock companies are a positive signal for banking-sector transparency.
27.
However, additional measures would be warranted. In the short term, the public’s
awareness of exchange-rate risks should be raised by information campaigns. Banks’ risk
management practices should be strengthened by issuing NBU guidelines on foreignexchange risk management and mortgage lending, setting upper limits on debt service-toincome and loan-to-value ratios for mortgage loans, and enforcing stricter collateral valuation
rules. Over the medium term, the authorities should continue moving toward more risk-based
supervision, where bank-specific capital requirements would be better matched with bankspecific risks. Pending these developments, the NBU should raise the minimum capitaladequacy ratio from 10 to a more prudent 12 percent. The NBU broadly agreed with most
proposed steps, but regarded raising the capital-adequacy ratio as unnecessary given recent
steps to tighten the definition of capital, particularly by limiting the amount of revaluation
gains. Finally, there was agreement that adopting the amendments to the NBU Law allowing
the authorities to suspend early deposit withdrawals in times of crisis would respond to
heightened liquidity risks.

29
Box 3. Foreign Currency-Induced Credit Risk: A Sensitivity Analysis
While the banking system seems well-positioned to deal with orderly exchange-rate
fluctuations, it would be vulnerable to a sharp hryvnia depreciation. A key assumption for
testing banks’ resilience is the relationship between exchange-rate movements and
nonperforming loans. Broadly in line with international experience for dollarized economies,
the analysis assumes that a 20 percent depreciation of the hryvnia would increase
nonperforming loans by 30 percent, requiring additional provisions of 15 percent of foreigncurrency loans. The chart below shows that such a shock would push the banking sector’s
capital-to-asset ratio from a current 12 to 6.5 percent (13 of the largest 15 banks would fall
below that level). A 5 percent depreciation, on the other hand, would leave the capital-toasset ratio close to 10 percent.

D. Is Ukraine’s Fiscal Framework Adequate?
28.

Two elements of the authorities’ fiscal framework should serve them well:

•

The authorities intend to target a fiscal deficit of about 2½ percent of GDP over
the medium term. Achieving such a target would stabilize the explicit public debt at
10–15 percent of GDP, providing a significant cushion against realization of
contingent fiscal liabilities. Even so, speeding up repayment of the contingent large
lost-savings liability could have undesirable macroeconomic and fiscal effects, and
any proposal to this end would need to be carefully designed. Moreover, if the

30
exchange-rate peg were to remain in place and adverse external conditions
materialized, the framework’s fiscal-deficit target could prove too loose for
maintaining external and internal balance.
•

The authorities intend to reduce recurrent spending and taxes over the medium
term. They saw the intended reduction in the size of government as a stimulus to
growth. In fact, incomes policy restraint—the increase in the public wage bill in 2007
would be limited to just 6½ percent—could also assist monetary policy in the
transition to a more flexible exchange rate: by improving competitiveness, it could
reduce pressure for abrupt exchange-rate movements, and thus help mitigate balancesheet risks. To assist with re-orienting the structure of spending and designing
sustainable tax cuts, staff noted the need to improve the medium-term budget
framework.

29.
However, the management of risks arising from the still large state-enterprise
sector was seen in need of considerable improvement. This sector is loosely monitored, a
significant drain on the budget, and a source of potentially large quasi-fiscal activity. In
particular, rising energy-import prices could have significant adverse effects on stateenterprise balance sheets, making improving governance even more urgent.8 The authorities
noted that they had allowed pass-trough of energy prices in 2006 and indicated that they were
attempting to exert greater control over enterprises’ financial plans.
30.
Fiscal policy plans for 2007, as adopted by parliament in early-December 2006,
raise several issues and risks:
•

Achieving the authorities’ 2007 fiscal target of just below 3 percent of GDP could
prove quite challenging, notwithstanding the authorities’ proven record of meeting
ambitious revenue targets. Under staff’s baseline, revenues would be lower, and some
1¼ percent of GDP of measures might be needed to compensate.

•

Measures, if needed, should focus on reductions in recurrent spending: the adopted
2007 budget projected nominal recurrent spending to rise by some 15 percent, leaving
the recurrent spending ratio well above 40 percent of GDP. This outcome is at odds
with the government’s fiscal framework intentions.

•

The authorities’ intention to pass through higher energy-import prices to producers
but not to consumers in 2007 could have a quasi-fiscal cost of about ½ percent of
GDP, even accounting for the availability of cheaper domestically-produced gas. The
authorities argued that a freeze on pass-through to consumers was warranted in light
of the large 2006 price hikes, worries about declining payment discipline, and the

8

31
additional fiscal cost as more lower-income households become eligible for cost
subsidies. However, the impact of further price increases could be cushioned by the
large recent real wage and pension increases as well as an already existing
differentiated tariff scheme to protect small users. Staff noted that to help dilute the
influence of political imperatives on setting domestic energy prices, more
independence should be given to the energy regulator to set prices in line with cost.

pressures.

32.
The authorities saw shifts in the structure of the budget and in the tax regime as
key to unlocking higher investment and growth. The savings from tight incomes and
transfer policies would fund higher sectoral subsidies, significantly higher public investment,
and tax relief. Initially, tax relief would be selective, coming in the form of restored tax
breaks in FEZs to help diversify Ukraine’s manufacturing base away from steel and
chemicals; in the medium term, corporate and VAT rates would be reduced. These measures,
in combination with other structural policies and the authorities’ benign medium-term
external outlook, were projected to ratchet up both investment- and savings-GDP ratios,
consistent with large future current-account surpluses.
33.
Fiscal policy could be a catalyst for investment and growth, but the authorities’
specific policies presented problems and a key challenge:

•

A new round of sectoral subsidies and selective tax relief would inhibit the flow of
resources to more productive uses, even while raising fiscal-revenue risks. Thus, new
tax preferences for FEZs should be avoided, and if this advice could not be heeded,
the zones should be subject to best international practices, with limited indirect tax
relief and measures to contain fraud.

•

Sustainably reducing recurrent expenditures would require not only curtailing the
high public-wage bill but also tackling the large imbalances in the pension fund.
Indeed, these would only grow worse over time as Ukraine’s demographic situation
deteriorated. To this end, a reform plan should focus on broadening the social
contribution base, raising retirement ages, tightening pension eligibility, and building
up a funded second-pillar system, which could also provide a boost to financialmarket development.10

34.
Improving the investment climate would also be indispensable for unlocking
catch-up growth. Ukraine’s large efficiency gap in using available resources seemed well
explained by the weakness of its market-supporting institutions—proxied by variables
capturing security of property rights, corruption, and regulatory quality (Figure 12). In fact,
the World Bank’s Doing Business survey continues to rank Ukraine’s investment climate
near the bottom among transition economies. This suggested that private investors’
difficulties to appropriate the returns on their investments constituted a binding bottleneck on
Ukraine’s growth. Moreover, lagging financial-market development was simply another
symptom of weak market-supporting institutions, as, for example, weak corporate
governance and uncertain minority-shareholder rights crippled stock markets.

government has pledged to act swiftly and comprehensively to advance structural reforms.
However, recent measures such as the introduction of restrictions on grain export and
renewed withholding of VAT refunds were steps away from building a functioning market
economy. Staff advocated that these decisions should be reversed. In the case of VAT
refunds, staff recalled long-standing Fund advice to address the underlying fraud issue
through fundamental reforms of the tax administration and not ad-hoc measures.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Despite turbulent politics, the economy has proven resilient and has become
better balanced. Growth has returned to near trend, and CPI inflation moderated through
most of 2006. Moreover, after several years of large surpluses, the current account is close to
balance, foreign-exchange reserves are at a comfortable level, and the hryvnia’s previously
large margin of undervaluation has narrowed considerably. The authorities have also shown
their mettle in achieving fiscal-deficit targets, and explicit public debt has fallen to low
levels.
38.
However, surging prices for energy have rekindled short-term macroeconomic
tensions, and external prospects are uncertain. Higher prices for energy imports amount to
a negative productivity shock. To their credit, the authorities passed through energy-import

35
price hikes in 2006, notwithstanding the short-run inflationary impact. Looking ahead, prices
for imported natural gas seem set to continue to approach Western European levels. At the
same time, there are uncertainties related to prospects for steel prices and capital flows.
39.
Ukraine also needs to address three longer-standing challenges. First, and despite
measurable progress over the last 1½ years, the country lags in adopting market-friendly
institutions, and, as a consequence, falls far short of reaching its potential income level given
available human and real resources. Second, the present monetary framework, which is
anchored by a de facto peg, is likely to face increasing difficulties in maintaining internal and
external balance given Ukraine’s volatile macroeconomic environment. Finally, financial
dollarization remains high, and a long-lasting credit boom and heavy external borrowing by
banks and corporates have created mismatches on banks’ and borrowers’ balance sheets. This
has increased concerns about the banking sector’s stability, particularly if large adverse
shocks should materialize.
40.
A coordinated package of policies is needed to address Ukraine’s short- and
long-term challenges. Allowing continued pass-through of higher energy prices to
consumers, introducing a more flexible exchange rate, tightening income policies, and
restraining monetary and fiscal policies would be the best policy option for maintaining
external and internal balance, regardless of the size and direction of external shocks. At the
same time, the banking sector’s ability to cope with adverse shocks needs to be strengthened.
Finally, accelerating structural reforms and reversing the recent shift to a consumptionoriented budget structure should boost underlying growth.
41.
Against this backdrop, the authorities’ fiscal framework intentions are welcome,
but budget plans for 2007 raise concerns. The new government’s intentions to target a
general government deficit close to 2½ percent of GDP, while reversing the recent surge in
recurrent spending over the medium term, fit policy requirements well. But the adopted 2007
budget represents a lost opportunity as regards containing recurrent spending, and it also
appears to be based on overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions. Moreover, specific
undertakings to hike sectoral subsidies and the intention to reopen, albeit partially, tax breaks
in the free economic zones are not appropriate, particularly as they may turn out to be only
first steps down a slippery slope. The authorities should continue allowing full pass-through
of energy prices in 2007 and beyond to help raise Ukraine’s low energy efficiency and avoid
quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector. Social groups vulnerable to energy price increases
can and should be protected using targeted support.
42.
From several perspectives, a more flexible exchange rate would be better suited
to Ukraine’s evolving challenges. It would facilitate external price adjustment and help
improve control of inflation, regardless of whether external upside or downside risks
materialize. And, by withdrawing the present de facto exchange rate guarantee, it would help
stem financial dollarization, while providing scope for developing hedging markets for
foreign-exchange risks. Thus, preparatory steps taken by the NBU toward introducing

36
inflation targeting are welcome. However, as a matter of insuring against risks, the
authorities should accelerate the transition to inflation targeting beyond the presently
envisaged very gradual pace. And the government should support the transition by flanking
measures, including by eliminating the foreign-exchange transactions tax and by pursuing a
deficit-financing strategy more focused on developing domestic securities markets.
43.
Rising balance-sheet vulnerabilities, particularly related to foreign-exchange
lending, call for more proactive regulation and supervision of the banking sector. Given
an unabated domestic credit boom, increasingly driven by household lending, and heavy
external borrowing, the ability of many banks to cope with rising risks may be called into
question. In this context, the NBU’s recent steps to improve regulatory and supervisory
safeguards in the banking sector are welcome. However, over the medium term, there is a
need to better match bank-specific capital requirements and risk management with bankspecific risks. An increase in the minimum capital-adequacy ratio from 10 to 12 percent
would therefore provide an additional safeguard for banking stability until risk-management
practices improve. Finally, the envisaged update of the FSAP in 2007 would provide a
welcome and timely opportunity to extend and deepen the diagnosis of financial sector
vulnerabilities.
44.
Ukraine’s difficult investment climate and underdeveloped financial markets are
key binding constraints on Ukraine’s economic development. Priority steps should
include WTO accession, adopting legislation to strengthen investor rights and removing legal
inconsistencies between laws, reactivating a transparent and fair privatization process, and
reforming the energy sector to boost efficiency and transparency. Retrograde steps, such as
the recent introduction of restrictions on grain exports, should be reversed.
45.
Official statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, but policy makers need
better data to gauge external and financial vulnerabilities. Better measurement is vital for
policy focus. It is therefore important to compile and disseminate better-quality data on trade
prices, the state-owned enterprise sector, and sectoral financial flows and stocks.
46.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the standard 12-month cycle.

Per capita GDP: US$ 1,747 (2005); Poverty (percent of population): 31.7 (2001; national headcount index);
Life expectancy at birth: 68.2 years (2002); Infant mortality (per 1,000): 16.0 (2002); Gross primary enrollment (percent net): 84 (2002)
Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Authorities' policies under the baseline external outlook. Policies include: (i) a fixed exchange rate; (ii) full pass-through of rising energy import prices
to industry, but zero pass-through to consumers; (iii) a fiscal deficit target of 2.9 percent of GDP; and (iv) growth in the minimum wage of 12.5 percent.
2/ Staff recommended policies under baseline external outlook. These include (i) increased flexibility in the hryvnia/U.S. dollar exchange rate; (ii) full
pass-through of rising energy import prices to both industry and consumers; (iii) a fiscal-deficit target of 2.5 percent; (iv) end-period minimum wage
growth of 8 percent; and (iv) a monetary policy that aims to reduce core inflation.
3/ From 2003 onward, based on an accounting treatment that excludes offset-based amortization to Russia, which decreases
revenues and increases net external financing (and the budget deficit) by 0.2 percent of GDP relative to previous years.
4/ Cash balance adjusted for the net accumulation of expenditure and VAT refund arrears, as well as for non-cash property income.
5/ Government and government-guaranteed debt and arrears, plus NBU debt. Excludes debt by state-owned enterprises.
6/ Annual GDP divided by end-period broad money (M3).
7/ Period averages; (+) represents real appreciation; based on GDP deflator and INS trade weights (1999-2001).

Sources: National Bank of Ukraine; and staff estimates.

1/ NPLs are those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss.
2/ Increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) in 2003 partly due to new classification rules.
3/ The NBU estimates that as of end-March 2004, 6.2 percent of loans classified as substandard were being timely serviced.
4/ About half of the drop in the provision to NPL ratio from end-2002 to end-2003 is due to new loan classification rules.

6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to
the Stand-by Arrangement, approved on March 29, 2004. The safeguards assessment was
completed on July 14, 2004. The assessment found that the NBU has made progress in recent
years to strengthen its safeguards framework, however, further improvements can be made in
some areas, notably the financial reporting, legal structure and independence areas. Most of
the assessment’s recommendations have been implemented. Outstanding issues include (i)
the full adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and (ii) a detailed
review of the NBU Law, and other legislation that impinges on the central bank, in order to
strengthen the NBU's independence.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (Hrv) at a conversion rate of
karbovanets (Krb) 100,000 to Hrv 1. The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar. In
September 1997, the peg was replaced by a formal band of Hrv 1.7–Hrv 1.9 per U.S. dollar.
The limits of the band were moved on several occasions, most recently on February 9, 1999,
to Hrv 3.4–4.6 per U.S. dollar. From March 19, 1999, the exchange rate for the hryvnia was
allowed to be determined by the interbank market for foreign exchange. On
February 22, 2000, the NBU officially confirmed its intention of allowing the free float of the
hryvnia. However, the authorities intervene regularly to limit fluctuations in the exchange
rate, so the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2001, as a
conventional pegged arrangement. In April 2005, the hryvnia the appreciated by 4¾ percent
to Hrv/US$ 5.05. On November 30, 2006 the official hryvnia/U.S. dollar rate stood at 5.05.
On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in
May 1997. A number of new restrictions were introduced in September 1998. The

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents
all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations-except for SRF
repayment expectations-would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board
upon request of the debtor country. SRF repayments are shown on their current expectation dates, unless
already converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

55
restrictions on current international transactions introduced in September 1998 were removed
in March 1999.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
Ukraine is on the standard 12-months consultation cycle. The staff report and Ex Post
Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement (IMF Country Report No. 05/415), the
Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 05/416), and Statistical Appendix (IMF Country
Report No. 05/417) were considered by the Executive Board on November 9, 2005, and
published November 28, 2005.
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Ukraine financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) between
May 10–24, 2002. An update mission visited Ukraine between February 18–21, 2003, and
the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340)
was considered by the Executive Board on May 14, 2003. The observance of the following
standards and codes was assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision;
Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies; CPSS Core
Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; OECD Principles for Corporate
Governance; Accounting and Auditing Practices; World Bank’s Principles and Guidelines for
Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and AML/CFT Methodology. A further
FSAP follow-up mission visited Kyiv between July 25-August 2, 2005 and the review was
published in the Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 05/416). A Data ROSC Module
was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was considered by the Executive Board on
August 5, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A Fiscal Transparency Module
(experimental) was issued in September 1999, and an update in April 2004 (IMF Country
Report No. 04/98).

APPENDIX III: UKRAINE—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(September 2006)
Country Assistance Strategy
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ukraine was approved on
October 23, 2003. It covers fiscal years 2004-07, and its major focus is to support the
“European choice” agenda of Ukraine—including further institutional reform that would lead
to a business-friendly environment and a more inclusive and responsive government. It
emphasizes the need to work toward Ukraine’s European goal both from the top, through
reform of institutions and policies, and from the bottom, through strengthening of civil
society, which will help to increase public sector accountability. The strategy proposes a
US$2.4 billion Base Case lending program. Allowance is also made for a more ambitious
High Case (up to a maximum of US$3 billion).
A distinct feature of the Ukraine CAS is its results orientation—the amount and content of
financial assistance will depend on the ability of the Government to accomplish the relevant
benchmarks.
On July 5, 2005 the Executive Board reviewed the CAS Progress Report which assessed the
first two years of the CAS implementation and discussed proposals for the program
adjustment. While the overall goals remain broadly unchanged, the strategic priorities
outlined in the CAS were adapted to the country’s evolving needs.
World Bank Program
There are 13 operations under implementation in the current project portfolio with total net
IBRD commitments of US$1,163 million.
The new series of Development Policy Loans were designed to integrate government and
donor activities under three broad themes to improve public governance: investment climate;
public administration and public finance management; and social inclusion. The first loan in
the series—DPL 1 (US$250 million) was disbursed in FY06.
Among other projects in the public sector are the State Tax Service Modernization Project
(US$40 million), and a Statistical System Modernization Project (US$32 million).
In the area of rural development, the World Bank supports establishment of the unified
registry under Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (US$121 million).
The Bank’s support for the energy sector has been significant and is expected to increase
with a sequence of sector investment loans. The first one, the Hydropower Rehabilitation
project (US$106 million), was approved in June 2005. The project on power transmission
(US$150 million) is under preparation. The Kyiv District Heating Improvement Project
(US$160 million) is under implementation, and the US$18.29 million Kyiv Public Building
Energy Efficiency Project has been successfully completed in June 2005.

58
In the infrastructure, the Lviv Water and Wastewater Project (US$24.25 million) is under
implementation. An Urban Infrastructure Project (US$140 million) is under preparation, and
is designed to provide loans to local governments and utilities for priority investments in
water, wastewater and solid waste sector. Another project in the pipeline addresses the issues
of roads and their safety management (US$300 million).
In the financial sector, the Bank has recently added two projects to its portfolio: the Access
to Financial Services project (US$150 million) aiming to provide for increased access by the
rural population and by municipalities to financial services, and a Second Export
Development Project (US$154 million) to build upon the success of the first project and to
promote the Ukrainian economy’s export capacity and to strengthen the institutional capacity
of Ukreximbank.
The Bank has devoted considerable resources to social sector assistance. The US$50 million
Social Investment Fund Project supports the development of community-based social
services for the most vulnerable groups. An Equal Access to Quality Education project
(US$86.6 million), aims to improve the efficiency and quality of education, and to prepare
students to compete in a knowledge economy. A project aimed at modernization of the Social
Assistance System (US$99 million) was approved in November 2005.
The Bank is also providing significant non-lending support. Through the People’s Voice
Program, the World Bank initiated a new generation of programs in Ukraine that focus on the
development of civil society. This program is aimed at building integrity at the municipal
level through strengthening the voice of citizen groups demanding better governance and
services, and by facilitating more responsive public organizations.
The Bank also carries out an extensive program of economic and sector work, including
recent studies on the economic and social consequences of energy price increases; labor
issues; poverty monitoring; transport; procurement system; and financial accountability.
Recently published reports also include a Public Expenditure Review, and a package of
policy notes linked to the PAL/DPL program.

59
APPENDIX IV: UKRAINE—RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(September 2006)
Since Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992, the Bank has been active in supporting Ukraine’s
transformation toward a market economy, promoting the business environment, and
improving the investment climate for all investors. This has been supported by a range of
technical cooperation activities and policy dialogue with the government. The latter has
included membership of the Foreign Investment Advisory Council and the EBRD’s cochairmanship of the Energy Sector Task Force and the Transport Working Group recently
established between EBRD and the Ministry of Transport.
Since the adoption of the 2002 Country Strategy, the main elements of the EBRD’s
operational strategy have been: encouraging privatization and commercialization of major
utilities; encouraging energy efficiency in both the state and private sectors; providing
funding through the banks to develop the small and medium business sector (SMEs); and
providing working capital to the agricultural sector. This approach was endorsed in a first
Program of Co-operation signed in April 2003 by the Government of Ukraine and the EBRD.
The K2R4 project was approved by the EBRD Board and signed in July 2004. The EBRD
will lend US$42 million, with a further US$83 million from the European Commission
(Euratom), to finance post start-up safety and modernization measures at two nuclear
reactors. The loan also requires that tariff levels within the nuclear sector should be sufficient
to enable the authorities to establish a decommissioning fund, as well as other funds to
commence a program of safety upgrades at the other 13 nuclear plants in Ukraine. The
respective loan and guarantee agreements were ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine in
September 2005.
The EBRD continues to finance small and medium enterprises through local banks without
sovereign guarantee including with a US$88 million sovereign SME II Credit Line. A new
US$200 million framework for SME/MSE lending through local banks was approved in
December 2004. During the strategy period, the EBRD also contributed to the progress in
developing the Warehouse Receipt Programme (WHR) through the finalization of three
projects based on the provision of working capital financing against WHRs. In 2004, the
EBRD continued its efforts in establishing a framework for direct lending to municipalities.
The Bank began the preparation of the first investment project in the municipal sector
without a sovereign guarantee for the city of Dnipropetrovsk.
The current EBRD Country Strategy for Ukraine, approved by the EBRD Board in
May 2005, outlined three main areas of operational focus:
•

Helping to improve the business climate and the competitiveness of private sector by
encouraging and sharing risk with foreign direct investors, promoting syndications,

60
enhancing integrity and corporate governance in local private sector projects, and
supporting environmental and energy efficiency related projects.
•

Strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial sector and increasing the
level of finance for micro enterprises and SMEs by supporting consolidation in the
banking sector, providing specialized credit lines, working with more banks and
starting to work with insurance companies and other non-bank financial institutions.

•

Supporting the restructuring and modernization of Ukraine’s road, railway, harbor,
airport infrastructure, power and oil & gas sectors by financing sovereign guaranteed
projects that help promote transition goals such as greater commercialization or more
cost reflective pricing, and promoting new non-sovereign guaranteed structures and
providing pre-privatization finance.

The new strategy was underpinned by a second Program of Co-operation for 2005–06 signed
in September 2005 by the Government of Ukraine and the EBRD. The agreement identified
priority projects including in the transport, energy and municipal infrastructure sectors.
The EBRD’s portfolio in Ukraine has increased from 5 projects in 1994 to 64 by the end of
August 2006. These amount to a historical net cumulative business volume of
EUR2,200 million. About 55 percent of the portfolio (operating assets plus undrawn
commitments) was assigned to the private sector and the remaining to the state sector.
Operating assets amounted to EUR683.9 million at the end of August 2006.
Outstanding commitments to Ukraine represent about 8 percent of the total of the EBRD’s
commitments to all its countries of operation as of end-August 2006. There are in addition
Technical Cooperation activities in Ukraine which, as of March 2005, included 245 projects
with a total value of commitments of almost EUR60 million. These are mainly related to
project preparation and implementation.
Projects in the financial sector account for about 23 percent of the EBRD’s commitment to
Ukraine, with much of this to support the development of small and medium size companies
through lending via local commercial banks. The energy sector accounts for a further
16 percent of net commitments. The largest single project in this category is in the power
sector; other projects include the development of oil and gas resources, gas transit and energy
efficiency. Projects in general industries, including agribusiness, represent about 33 percent
of net cumulative commitments, while transport and municipal and environmental
infrastructure account for about 22 percent of all commitments.
The EBRD will prepare a new country strategy for Ukraine during the second quarter
of 2007.

61
APPENDIX V: UKRAINE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance, but
there are some important shortcomings. Statistical deficiencies remain for the national
accounts and balance of payments, including the absence of proper quarterly price indices for
exports and imports. The compilation of accurate data on external assets by sector, and by
extension the net international investment position and sectoral balance sheets, suffers from
the non-classification of many items.
The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was
prepared in 2002, and published on IMF’s website on August 19, 2003. The data ROSC
recommended strengthening the independence of the State Committee on Statistics (SCS).
On January 10, 2003, Ukraine became the first CIS country to subscribe to the SDDS.
Ukraine’s first international investment position was compiled by the National Bank of
Ukraine (NBU) in 2002. The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996.
While the Fund’s technical assistance in statistics has been significantly reduced in recent
years, various multilateral and bilateral sources continued to play an important role. A
mission by the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) visited in Kyiv in June 2004 to assist in
revising the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) and assess the quality of
current account data.
Real sector statistics
The 1993 System of National Accounts is the general framework for compiling national
accounts and the classifications used are largely in accordance with international standards.
The source data are obtained from the extensive survey program of the SCS, supplemented
with data from administrative and other sources. The main survey report forms have been
revised significantly in recent years to bring them in line with the definitions, scope, and
classifications of national accounts data, and the new chart of accounts of enterprises.
Significant improvements have been introduced in the compilation of the quarterly GDP
estimates as data are now compiled on a discrete basis and fourth quarter estimates are
consistent with the other quarters’ estimates. Seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP data are also
now compiled, but have been disseminated to only a few selected users. However, quarterly
price indices for exports and imports are still in the development phase, and as yet not
suitable for analytical purposes.
A real sector mission by the IMF Statistics Department in March 2005 found that the lack of
appropriate price indices hamper production of accurate long-term GDP volume series using
the new classification of economic activities adopted since 2001. The authorities also agreed
that the methodology covering the informal economy needs to be improved.

62
A further improvement of the data collection and production environment is needed, in
particular, through greater use of sample surveys, and improving data flow management and
processing. To address the shortcomings, it is important to revive the Statistical Council to
provide guidance to the SCS on the quality of the statistical series and on strategies for
improving data production.
The weights of the consumer price index (CPI) are annually updated; however, their
geographical coverage is limited to urban areas. The CPI excludes price changes for owneroccupied housing.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and State Treasury have made considerable progress in the
compilation of fiscal data. The Ministry of Finance publishes monthly data on central and
regional government operations within 25 days of the reference period. The economic
classification of transactions and outstanding debt are consistent with the methodology
outlined in A Manual on Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). From 2002, the
functional classification has been consistent with the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). All central government transactions and local government
revenue transactions are recorded in the Treasury Single Account. Reporting on arrears, both
for receipts and payments, should be improved. More importantly, significant delays in
reporting on the operations of special social funds, which together represent almost half of
general government spending, need to be addressed
The authorities report Government Finance Statistics (GFS) under the GFSM 2001 for
publication in the IMF GFS Yearbook. The last year reported is 2005 and data covered the
general government and its subsectors.
Monetary and financial statistics
The data ROSC recommended that the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central
bank be improved using the daily accounting records on monetary operations. Ukraine uses
both SDDS flexibility options for monetary data: for timeliness of the analytical accounts of
the banking sector and central bank.
The authorities have implemented the Standardized Report Forms (SRF) for reporting
monetary data to STA. Data beginning from December 2001 have been converted into the
SRF framework and published in the September 2006 issue of IFS Supplement. Updates are
available online to IFS users.

63
External sector statistics
The balance of payments is compiled in broad conformity with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual and reported quarterly to STA. The principal data sources are
the ITRS, administrative data sources, and a survey of enterprises.
Following the recommendations of the data ROSC, the authorities have expanded the survey
on inter-enterprise arrears to include information relevant for balance of payments purposes.
A one-off pilot survey of travelers is to be conducted and it is hoped that this will be the basis
for improving the quality of shuttle trade, compensation of employees, and travel estimates.
The technical assistance mission of June-July 2005 recommended that reconciliation with
partner country data be used to check the coverage of general merchandise and reported that
some methodological weaknesses exist in private portfolio and FDI surveys.
Though the cooperation between different government agencies has improved in recent
years, problems still exist in coordinating the work of the National Bank of Ukraine, the SCS,
and the Ministry of Finance, particularly regarding short-term external debt.
The authorities have made progress in disseminating international reserves data. The release
of monthly data, in line with the Fund’s reserve template, started in mid-2002. Ukraine also
started disseminating external debt data meeting SDDS requirements in September 2004.
However, accurate data on external assets suffers from the non-classification of many items,
affecting estimates of the net international investment position and sectoral balance sheet
information.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 12, 2007
1.
Since the issuance of the staff report, more information about 2006 developments has
become available, the government agreed with the President to revisit the adopted 2007
budget’s wage and pension increases, and the NBU is considering administrative curbs on
foreign-exchange lending. This additional information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Preliminary below-the-line data for 2006 indicate that the general government cash
deficit may have reached only 11⁄4 percent of GDP, compared with 23⁄4 percent of GDP
projected in the staff report. If confirmed by the final data, this overperformance likely
reflects a combination of stronger-than-projected cash revenue growth and underexecution of
spending; information about end-December VAT refund arrears is not yet available.
3.
Despite the budget overperformance, the government borrowed an additional US$600
million externally in December, contributing to international reserves exceeding the staff
report’s projection by US$1.1 billion.
4.
End-year CPI inflation was contained at 11.6 percent. The undershoot, relative to
staff’s forecast of 12.5 percent, reflects legal delays in implementing the envisaged large
utility price increases in Kyiv in December.
5.
The government and president have agreed to consider additional wage and pension
increases in April 2007. The President first vetoed the original 2007 budget law in lateDecember and only signed an almost unchanged version subject to this condition. His
proposals would increase average minimum wage growth in 2007 from 15 to 17 percent, and,
based on staff estimates, could add 1⁄2 percent of GDP to recurrent spending.
6.
In late-December, the NBU discussed with commercial banks administrative options
to curb the rapidly rising foreign-currency-denominated domestic bank lending, particularly
to consumers. The NBU’s proposals, which are still being developed, could set limits
depending on the type of the borrower and the maturity of the foreign-currency loan.
7.
The authorities have passed legislation toward WTO accession and expect the WTO
to review Ukraine’s accession prospects soon. The ban on the sale or transfer of agricultural
land has been extended for one more year, and will now expire in 2008.
8.
The proposals to further raise wages and pensions underscore staff concerns that the
opportunity to reduce recurrent spending is being missed in 2007. Staff continues to view
increases in provisions and in the minimum capital-adequacy ratio as the first line of defense
against rising indirect credit risk. Administrative curbs on lending would need to be carefully
monitored, including to prevent shifts into less well-regulated markets and instruments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 22, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Ukraine
On January 12, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ukraine.1
Background
After nose-diving in 2005, real activity staged a surprise rebound in 2006. Fiscal policy
in 2005-06 reshuffled resources from higher-saving businesses (mainly by raising tax
collections) to lower-saving households (mainly by raising public pensions and wages),
touching off a consumption boom, which has been reinforced by rapid credit expansion.
In 2005, this boom helped to offset the drag on the economy from marked real currency
appreciation, weaker steel exports owing to intensified third-country competition, higher
business-tax collections, and post-Orange-Revolution reforms, which clamped down on
tax loopholes, smuggling, and corruption. In 2006, robust consumption has been
matched by stronger export markets, including resurging steel prices, and more buoyant
investment, as reforms began to bear fruit in attracting higher foreign direct investment
(FDI).
Inflation moderated through most of 2006, but has recently climbed back into double
digits, boosted by energy-price pass-through. Notwithstanding booming consumption,
high CPI inflation started to moderate in mid-2005, reflecting slowing real activity, low
import price inflation, and a host of one-off factors, including cuts in import tariffs and
temporary Russian import bans on Ukrainian meat and dairy products. However, as
pass-through of energy import price hikes accelerated in late-2006, inflation surged back
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
into the double digit range. Domestic price pressures, as measured by the GDP deflator
and labor costs, have remained significant throughout this period.
Ukraine’s steep terms-of-trade gains came to an abrupt halt in 2006. Ukraine’s
cumulative terms-of-trade improvement during 2003-05 amounted to some 20 percent,
as skyrocketing prices for steel—Ukraine’s main export—offset sharply higher oil prices.
However, amid a dispute with Russia in early-2006, the price of imported natural gas
was hiked by 65 percent. As one of the most inefficient users of energy among transition
economies and as a heavy net energy importer, this price hike was enough to offset the
impact of still higher average metals prices and a higher fee for transit of gas. As a
result, the terms of trade deteriorated by about 1 percent.
The current account has switched from large surpluses into deficit, but capital flows
have picked up and international reserves have reached healthy levels. With domestic
demand booming, export volumes slumping, and the terms of trade reverting, the
current account shifted from a surplus of 101⁄2 percent of GDP in 2004 to a likely deficit
of about 1 percent of GDP in 2006. At the same time, capital inflows, FDI in particular,
have been buoyant, reflecting improved perceptions of Ukraine as an investment
location. As a result, foreign exchange reserves have more than doubled to about
41⁄2 months of imports and are projected to exceed the level of short-term external debt
at end-2006.
The authorities have proven adept at hitting low fiscal deficit targets, and explicit public
debt has plunged. In 2005, despite a slowing economy and no financing constraints
(privatization receipts reached 5 percent of GDP), the tight general government cash
deficit target of 21⁄2 percent of GDP was met. Preliminary data for 2006 indicate that the
general government cash deficit may have reached only 11⁄4 percent of GDP, compared
the 2006 deficit target of about 3 percent of GDP, reflecting robust Value Added Tax
collections and expenditure restraint. A combination of strong nominal growth and low
deficits will reduce explicit public debt (including government-guaranteed debt) to a
projected 17 percent of GDP by end-2006, down from over 60 percent in 1999.
However, contingent liabilities remain at a still high 30 percent of GDP, largely reflecting
claims from the so-called lost savings deposits from the early 1990s hyperinflation.
Reflecting a redistributionist shift in fiscal policy, recurrent spending and tax collections
from businesses have both been ratcheted upward. In 2005, average public wages and
pensions were raised by over 50 percent (against an inflation target of just under
10 percent). As a result, pension spending commitments soared from 12 percent of GDP
in 2004 to about 17 percent in 2005. To finance this recurrent-spending boom, while
reducing the fiscal deficit, the government curtailed capital spending by some
13⁄4 percent of GDP and raised tax collections by some 6 percent of GDP, the latter
especially through an across-the-board cancellation of tax breaks for the free economic
zones and administrative improvements. The 2006 budget largely preserved the thrust
of these policies.

3
Monetary conditions have continued to adjust passively to the requirements of the
exchange rate peg. Although the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has allowed the
interbank exchange rate to fluctuate within a narrow band of Hrv/US$5.00-5.06, the
exchange rate regime has remained a de facto peg. In this setting, base money growth
has been mostly driven by foreign-exchange interventions and changes in government
deposits at the NBU. During most of 2006, the NBU’s reaction function implied an
automatic tightening of the monetary stance, partly softened by the NBU lowering
reserve requirements and its main refinancing rate. More recently, however, monetary
conditions have loosened again, reflecting a pickup in foreign reserve accumulation and
drawdown of government deposits.
A long-lasting credit boom has increased the balance-sheet vulnerabilities of banks and
their borrowers. Real credit growth has averaged about 40 percent since 2001. The
corporate sector’s debt (two thirds of which is denominated in foreign currency) now
exceeds 50 percent of GDP. Household sector debt, mostly in foreign exchange, has
also surged over the past 18 months, partly driven by banks’ fierce competition for
market share. The boom has created substantial credit risk, in particular indirect foreigncurrency risk, since most borrowers are unhedged. It has also raised banks’ foreign
exchange liquidity risk as banks have increasingly relied on foreign funding, much of
which is at short maturities. While an influx of foreign banks since 2004 has improved
credit-risk management practices in some parts of the banking system, recent financial
soundness indicators, particularly declining capital-adequacy ratios, suggest that the
sector as a whole remains vulnerable.
Financial markets remain underdeveloped, reflecting history, deficient policies, and
lagging legal frameworks. The government securities market remains illiquid and
shallow with no significant primary issuances between August 2005 and October 2006.
Equities markets also remain illiquid due to the delay in passing a joint-stock company
law that would protect minority shareholders. Domestic corporate bond issuance has
been more buoyant, but starting from a low level. A key tax barrier to financial sector
development, the foreign exchange transactions tax, has been reduced marginally, but
remains in place.

4
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Ukraine’s economy has proven resilient over the last year
in the face of higher energy prices and domestic political uncertainties. Directors also
noted that the economy had become better balanced externally, with the current
account now near balance after several years of large surpluses. However, They also
observed that rising prices for imported energy have rekindled short-term
macroeconomic tensions, while uncertainties about future steel export prices and capital
flows loom large.
Directors stressed that Ukraine also needs to address three longer-standing challenges.
First, while welcoming recent progress in adopting more market-friendly institutions, they
noted that structural reforms still lag considerably. Second, Directors thought that the
present monetary framework could face increasing difficulties in achieving internal and
external balance given Ukraine’s volatile macroeconomic fundamentals. And third,
Directors expressed concern that the sustained credit boom and heavy private-sector
external borrowing had created balance-sheet vulnerabilities, raising risks to the banking
sector.
Turning to policies, Directors considered that a gradual move toward greater exchange
rate flexibility would facilitate external adjustment and help improve control of inflation. A
more flexible exchange rate could also help stem financial dollarization while providing
incentives to develop markets to hedge foreign-exchange risks. Several Directors
cautioned, however, that the pace of transition needs to be managed carefully and be
kept aligned with the development of supporting conditions. Directors therefore
welcomed the preparatory steps taken by the NBU toward introducing inflation targeting,
and encouraged the authorities to move forward with the transition.
Directors stressed the importance of stepping up the implementation of policies that will
support increased exchange rate flexibility. These should include measures to develop
the foreign-exchange market, including by eliminating the foreign-exchange transactions
tax, and domestic securities markets, particularly by adopting a government financing
strategy that relies more on domestic debt issuance. Moreover, an appropriately
restrained incomes policy would reduce the pressure for large nominal exchange rate
movements in the face of a highly uncertain external environment.
Directors underscored the criticality of more proactive regulation and supervision of the
banking sector. They therefore welcomed the NBU’s recent steps to improve regulatory
and supervisory safeguards. Most Directors considered that capital-adequacy should be
strengthened until banks’ risk management practices improve and, in this regard, noted
that consideration should be given to increasing the capital-adequacy ratio from 10 to
12 percent. In this context, Directors welcomed the envisaged Financial Sector
Assessment Program update in 2007 as timely.

5
Directors viewed the authorities’ fiscal framework as broadly appropriate. The
authorities’ intention to target a general government deficit close to 21⁄2 percent of GDP
would keep explicit debt low, providing a prudent cushion given significant contingent
fiscal liabilities. At the same time, plans to reverse the recent surge in recurrent
spending over the medium term would create fiscal space for tax cuts and public
investment.
Directors urged the authorities to implement policies consistent with this fiscal
framework. In particular, they emphasized to do more to restrain recurrent spending in
the 2007 budget. Increases in sectoral subsidies and the reopening of tax breaks in the
free economic zones should be avoided, as they could encourage rent seeking.
Directors also stressed that opening significant fiscal space would require tackling large
public pension fund imbalances, although pension reforms were also imperative for
demographic reasons.
Directors commended the authorities for passing through recent energy import price
hikes to domestic users and urged them to continue pass-through in 2007 and beyond.
This would help avoid rising quasi-fiscal deficits and provide incentives to improve
Ukraine’s very low energy efficiency.
Directors stressed that raising growth in Ukraine required improvements in the country’s
difficult investment climate. They particularly noted the pressing need to adopt
legislation to strengthen investor rights, clarify inconsistencies between the economic
and civil codes, reactivate a transparent and fair privatization process, and reform the
energy sector.
Directors welcomed the passing of legislation towards WTO accession in 2007, but
urged reversing recent retrograde actions against exporters, particularly the introduction
of restrictions on grain exports.
While noting that official statistics were broadly adequate for surveillance, Directors saw
a need to improve data on trade prices, the state-owned enterprise sector, and sectoral
financial flows and stocks.
