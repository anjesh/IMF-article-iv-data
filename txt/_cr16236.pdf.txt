IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under ECF Arrangement for
Sierra Leone and Approves US$34.12 Million Disbursement Sierra Leone
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review of Sierra Leone’s performance under the economic program supported by an
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.1 Completion of the review enables the
disbursement of SDR 24.44 million, about US$34.12 million, bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to SDR 162.22 million (about US$226.45 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for an
extension of the ECF arrangement by about two months until end-December 2016.
Sierra Leone’s ECF arrangement was approved by the Executive Board for SDR 62.22
million (about US$86.86 million) on October 21, 2013 (see Press Release No. 13/410) and
was augmented twice (see Press Release 15/86 and Press Release 14/441). It supports the
government’s economic reform program for stronger and more inclusive growth, and it also
plays a catalytic role for bilateral and multilateral assistance.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Sierra Leone, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“After many years of strong growth, Sierra Leone’s economy has deteriorated significantly
since mid-2014 when the country was hit by twin shocks: the Ebola epidemic and sharply
lower iron ore prices. Growth declined from 4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.1 percent in 2015.
The budget and exchange rate came under pressure, while banking vulnerabilities have
increased. On the positive side, the World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone Ebolafree for the second time on March 17, 2016.
“Despite these serious challenges, program performance has been relatively good. All
end-December 2015 quantitative performance criteria were met. While performance against

end-September 2015 indicative targets was mixed, with policy corrections all end-December
2015 indicative targets were met. Meanwhile considerable progress was made in key
structural reform areas, although a few structural benchmarks were met with delays, and
others missed.
“Growth is expected to recover moderately in 2016, with average inflation edging up
slightly, driven mainly by further exchange rate depreciation. However, budget
implementation is expected to be even more challenging than in 2015, given the expected
decline in budget support and constrained domestic financing, combined with overspending
on wages and the failure to eliminate fuel subsidies.
“To address these challenges, the authorities are committed to stepping up reforms and
improving public financial management. Key reforms include liberalization of the
telecommunications gateway, imposing Goods and Service Tax on all electricity bills, and
significant reductions in tax exemptions and duty waivers.
“Decisive implementation of structural reforms aimed at economic diversification will be key
to achieving strong and sustainable growth and reducing poverty. Priority should be given to
improving the business climate, enhancing infrastructure, and supporting private sector
development.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation for Sierra Leone
On July 1, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV consultation1 with Sierra Leone.
After a dozen years of strong growth, benefiting from both improved polices and booming
commodity prices, Sierra Leone has been hit by twin shocks since mid-2014: the Ebola epidemic
and sharply declining iron ore prices. As a result, economic outcomes have deteriorated sharply
over the past two years. Growth declined dramatically from 20.7 percent in 2013, to 4.6 percent
in 2014, and further to -21.1 percent in 2015. The budget is under severe pressure. Between mid2014 and end-2015, the Leone depreciated 22 percent against the US dollar. Banking sector
vulnerabilities have increased. Living standards have also deteriorated significantly since late
2014. The World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone Ebola-free for the second time on
March 17, 2016.
The medium-term outlook is somewhat positive, with growth projected to recover to 4.3 percent
this year, increasing gradually to around 6.5 percent by 2020, given that the twin shocks have
largely wound down. The risks to the outlook are firmly to the downside, given a potential
possible slowdown of reform efforts and various uncertainties: a further slowdown in China
could worsen the economic outlook, and iron ore production may again shut down if the
company continues to produce at a loss.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The authorities, in partnership with the international community, designed and began
implementing a post-Ebola Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). The plan has three main
elements: getting to and staying at zero new Ebola cases; implementing immediate recovery
priorities through social measures, education and sanitation; and transitioning back to the
Agenda for Prosperity Plan in the medium term. Sustained reform efforts are needed to achieve
these robust growth rates over the medium term, and improve Sierra Leone’s living standards.
Program performance has been relatively good. All quantitative performance criteria at endDecember 2015 were met. While some end-September2015 indicative targets were missed, with
policy corrections all end-December 2015 indicative targets were met. While considerable
progress was made in key structural reform areas, a few structural benchmarks were met with
delays, and others missed.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Sierra Leone’s steadfast implementation of the Fund-supported
program especially under difficult circumstances. However, Directors noted that the Ebola
epidemic and lower iron ore prices have posed significant challenges. The country also remains
vulnerable to external risks. Directors encouraged the authorities to decisively implement their
post-Ebola Economic Recovery Plan, in close cooperation with donors. They emphasized that
sustained reform efforts are needed, particularly in the fiscal and financial sectors, to generate
robust and sustainable growth which can facilitate poverty reduction.
Directors agreed that making fiscal space for priority spending is critical. To this end, they
encouraged the authorities to push forward with strong measures to increase domestic revenues
and rationalize expenditure. On the revenue side, Directors saw need for action to broaden the
tax base, remove tax exemptions, and improve tax administration. They also encouraged the
authorities to implement a prudent wage policy and eliminate fuel subsidies, which will help
increase excise revenues. Directors welcomed the adoption of a new Public Financial
Management (PFM) Act and called for its speedy implementation. The PFM Act should help
enhance the transparency and efficiency of expenditures.
Directors noted that although Sierra Leone’s risk of debt distress is moderate, the economy
remains vulnerable to further shocks. They encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent
borrowing policies, especially in view of the narrow export base and the fragile fiscal position.
Financing needs, particularly for large-scale investment projects, should continue to be covered
mostly with grants and concessional loans.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors supported the central bank’s intention to target price stability in support of economic
recovery. Going forward, they encouraged the authorities to continue to enhance monetary policy
instruments and liquidity management. Limiting intervention in the foreign exchange market will
also be important to preserve foreign exchange reserves. Directors emphasized the need to
strengthen the banking system to support financial intermediation, and to resolve any underlying
stresses, especially non-performing loans, through a timely diagnostic of key troubled banks.
Directors emphasized that economic diversification is key to strong and sustainable growth and
reducing poverty. They encouraged the authorities to accelerate efforts to improve the business
environment, increase the role of the private sector, and address infrastructure bottlenecks.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
FIFTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY AND
FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW AND REQUEST FOR AN
EXTENSION OF THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: After a dozen years of strong growth, benefiting from both improved polices and booming
commodity prices, Sierra Leone has been hit by twin shocks since mid-2014: (i) the Ebola epidemic
and (ii) sharply lower iron ore prices. As a result, economic outcomes have deteriorated sharply.
Growth declined dramatically from 4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.1 percent in 2015. The budget is under
severe pressure, with the authorities having difficulty funding routine expenditures in a timely manner.
Between mid-2014 and end-2015, the Leone depreciated 22 percent against the US dollar. Banking
sector vulnerabilities have also increased. The World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone
Ebola-free for the second time on March 17, 2016. The Article IV discussions were conducted together
with the fifth review under the Extended Credit Facility.
Article IV discussions: The consultation focuses on four key medium-term economic challenges
facing Sierra Leone: making fiscal space for priority spending; strengthening public financial
management; enhancing financial stability and unlocking macro-financial synergies; and diversifying
the economy.
Outlook and risks: The medium-term outlook is somewhat positive, yet highly uncertain. Growth is
projected to recover gradually to around 6.5 percent in 2020, driven primarily by non-iron ore growth.
However, sustained reform efforts are needed, particularly in the fiscal and financial sectors,1 to
achieve these robust growth rates and improve Sierra Leone’s living standards, which have
deteriorated significantly since late 2014. The risks to the outlook are firmly to the downside, given
the potential for slow implementation of needed and various externals risks, including a possible
further slowdown in China, which would reduce exports, or a renewed cessation of iron ore
production if it cannot be made profitable.
Program performance has been relatively good: All quantitative performance criteria at
end-December 2015 were met. All end-December 2015 indicative targets were met while
end-September 2015 indicative targets were mixed. While considerable progress was made in key
structural reform areas, a few structural benchmarks were met with delays, and others missed. The
prior action set for this review has been met.
Staff supports the completion of the fifth review under the ECF and the authorities’ request for
a two-month extension of the ECF arrangement, to allow time to complete the final review.

BACKGROUND
A. Context
1.
After the end of its civil war in 2002, Sierra Leone experienced more than a decade of
strong economic performance, building on improved policies and high commodity prices,
which allowed a sharp expansion of
iron ore mining. Between 2003 and

8 percent per year, while inflation fell

targeted social measures, the discovery

In 2014, however, the economy was hit by twin shocks—an outbreak of the Ebola Virus
Disease (EVD) and a sharp drop in

losses in the private sector, while
agricultural exports and manufacturing
output declined 30 and 60 percent,
respectively (SIP 1).2 As the
government was trying to generate
additional resources to fight the EVD,
iron ore production came to a halt in
early 2015, largely as a result of the
sharp drop in iron ore prices (Text Figure 3). GDP fell more than 21 percent while domestic revenue
as a percentage of non-iron ore GDP dropped to 10.5 (end-2015) from 12.6 (end-2013) prior to the

over US$219 million in assistance during
2014–15 (about 5 percent of 2015 GDP), significantly above what had previously been planned. This
helped alleviate the impact of the twin shocks on both the balance of payments (BOP) and the
budget. The authorities made adjustments internally, focusing the budget on EVD response,
economic recovery, and poverty reduction. Program performance suffered initially, but regained
traction in 2015.

4.
Although still undergoing adjustment, the economy is showing signs of recovery.
Sierra Leone was declared Ebola free for a second time on March 17, 2016. This has contributed to
the resumption of economic activity and a pickup in revenues. The authorities, in partnership with
the international community, designed and began implementing a post-Ebola Economic Recovery
Strategy (ERS). The plan has three main elements: getting to and staying at zero new EVD cases;
implementing immediate recovery priorities through social measures, education and sanitation; and
transitioning back to the Agenda for Prosperity Plan (A4P) in the medium term (MEFP ¶3).
5.
The 2016 Article IV discussions were conducted together with the fifth review under
the ECF in March 2016, and continued during the Spring Meetings. The Article IV consultation
focused on critical medium-term (including 2017) issues, while the fifth review focused on
immediate and short-term challenges.

B. Recent Economic Developments, Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
6.
As a result of the twin shocks, Sierra Leone’s economy in 2015 deteriorated severely.
Growth is estimated to have declined from 4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.1 percent in 2015. Between
mid-2014 and end-2015, the Leone depreciated 22 percent against the US dollar. Despite the loss of
iron ore exports and the resultant more than 55 percent decline in total exports, the current account
(CA) deficit improved from 20.1 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2014 to about 15.5 percent in 2015.
This was driven by a more than 20 percent decline in imports—largely Ebola related imports of

goods and services and fuel products—and still strong current transfers related to Ebola. In early
2016, the largest iron ore producer resumed operations, albeit at significant loss.4
7.
On the fiscal front, the deficit further widened to 4.4 percent in 2015 from 4.0 percent
of GDP in 2014. Domestic revenue in percent of GDP declined to 10.5 percent in 2015 from
10.8 percent in 2014, mainly due to the loss of revenue from minerals and the ongoing impact of
Ebola. This was a somewhat better performance than anticipated at the time of the last review, as
revenue was nearly 0.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP, due to enhanced tax audits, minimization of
duty concessions, and stricter enforcement. Staff and authorities estimate that about half, of the
over-performance in revenue was from structural measures in better administration that could be
sustained going forward, while the rest was from one-time measures. Expenditures were broadly in
line with expectations, about 0.1 percent of non-iron ore GDP higher than targeted. Combined, the
fiscal deficit in 2015 widened moderately. However, revenue shortfalls led to periodic accumulations
of arrears,5 which in turn contributed to problems in the financial sector, discussed below.

Inflation remained contained in 2015, despite significant exchange rate depreciation.

Consumer price inflation averaged
9 percent in 2015, slightly below staff’s
projection during the last review,
compared with 8.3 percent in 2014.
The increase in inflation reflected
exchange rate depreciation, reduced
food supply due to lower agriculture
production, and disruptions in cross
border trade with Liberia and Guinea.

receipts remained negligible. Interventions in the foreign exchange market by the Bank of
Sierra Leone (BSL, central bank of Sierra Leone) increased markedly between the second
half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, reaching US$19 million in December 2014. In the
second half of 2015 and early 2016, BSL reduced interventions to about $3–4 million per
week and since the second week of February 2016, the BSL has intervened only
infrequently, to preserve reserves.


The reserve coverage remains adequate at 3.8 months of imports at end-2015 (Annex I).
This is higher than both the standard 3-month norm and the suggested level by the LIC
reserve template, at 2.8 months of imports. The REER is estimated to be overvalued
between 12–14 percent as of December 2015, suggesting continued pressure on the
exchange rate. This will help reduce the current account deficit, particularly through
reduced imports, as Sierra Leone’s exports are less responsive to exchange rate.

9.
The financial sector is in distress. At end-2015, there were significant problems with
respect to prudential norms. Compared to 2014, the number of banks that were non-compliant with
the minimum liquidity, capital adequacy, and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios increased. Partly
caused by the twin shocks, the NPL ratio jumped from 22 percent at end 2013 to 38 percent in
mid-2015.6 Poor loan quality reflects continuing fragility in the private sector, problems in banking
supervision, and governance and connected lending issues in the two majority state-owned banks.
Loan sector concentration remains high with international trade, construction, and services
accounting for about three quarters of total loans. The top five borrowers account for 35 percent of
total gross loans.
10.
The economic environment in 2016 remains very challenging. Iron ore production by the
largest mining company (Shanghai Iron and Steel Group, SISG) has resumed, providing a modest
impetus to real GDP.7 However, given the low international iron ore price and the significant
discount at which SISG’s iron ore is sold on the international market, its contribution to nominal GDP
will be marginal.8 The economic recovery in the near term will largely from non-iron ore and
agriculture sectors as the authorities’ economic diversification effort and post Ebola recovery plan.
Overall, staff projects a return of economic growth in 2016, with total real GDP projected to increase
by 4.3 percent, with non-iron ore GDP increasing by 3.3 percent. Average inflation is projected to
edge up slightly to 9.5 percent, driven by further exchange rate depreciation, offset somewhat by
improvements in domestic food production.

6

Though the NPL ratio declined to around 32 percent at end 2015, the amounts of outstanding loans and provisions
were largely unchanged. This may indicate that at least part of the decline in NPLs was achieved through issuance of
new loans to pay off overdue loans.
7Discussion

is also on-going for a second mining company to resume production as soon as agreement can be
reached on a repayment schedule for tax arrears. Staff has not incorporated this into the medium-term projection
given the uncertainty.
8 Given the uncertainties in the sector, staff agreed with the authorities to base 2016 and 2017 macroeconomic
projections on assumed iron ore exports that are roughly half the level SISG projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

11.
The 2016 fiscal environment is even more challenging than in 2015, despite the fact that
domestic revenues are increasing 0.4 percent of GDP from last year. This increase in revenues is
mainly due to policy measures discussed in more detail below, and comes despite the fact that the
authorities failed to adhere to their commitment, in the context of the last review, to eliminate
implicit fuel subsidies. The approved budget accounted for the fact that budget support is declining
by more than 1 percent of GDP from 2015. However, it has proven challenging to mobilize the
domestic financing assumed in the budget (3 percent of GDP), despite very significant increases in
interest rates on treasury obligations, as continued BSL sales of foreign exchange have drained
liquidity from the system. Combined with some overspending—particularly on wages—and the
failure to eliminate fuel subsidies as committed in the last review, the budget faces a financing gap
for 2016 of more than 1 percent of GDP. Staff and the authorities agreed on measures to close these
gaps, as discussed below and in the MEFP (¶22–25).
12.
Monetary policy is expected to focus on price stability, while liquidity management
should be enhanced. The overly tight liquidity9 in early 2016 calls for improvement in BSL’s liquidity
management, as well as a halt to BSL foreign exchange sales. The BSL is struggling to balance the
need to provide adequate liquidity to enable the effective operation of commercial banks and to
avoid an overshooting of interest rates, with the desire to fight further leone depreciation.
13.
The current account (CA) deficit is projected to deteriorate modestly. With the
resumption of iron ore production in early 2016, exports are projected to rise by 13.7 percent, to
$662 million. The trade deficit is projected to improve to US$669 million, helped by resumption of
iron ore exports and declining oil prices. However, the CA deficit is projected to increase slightly to
over 16 percent of GDP due to declining current transfers, and will be predominantly financed by
FDI-related inflows. A significant boost to FDI is expected to come from investments in the
agriculture and food processing sectors, as well as predicted capital flows from the parent company
to cover the incurred losses of the iron ore company.
14.
Over the medium term, economic prospects are expected to improve given that the
twin shocks have now largely wound down. Staff projects medium-term growth gradually picking
up to around 6.5 percent in 2020 from 4.3 percent in 2016. Inflation will decline to 7.5 percent in
2020 from 9.5 percent in 2016. The fiscal and current accounts deficits will decline to 3.3 and
15 percent in 2020 from 4.9 and 16.6 percent in 2016, respectively. The projected deterioration in
the current account deficit from 2017 onwards is mostly driven by the need to increase reserves, as
well as by the projected cessation of World Bank budget support. As a result, a balance of payments
financing gap is projected to emerge in the medium term.
15.
The unusual situation in the iron ore sector makes the medium-term projections highly
uncertain. As noted above, staff does not have sufficient data to firmly determine the cost of iron
ore production, but it is clear the current mine is operating at a loss. Since it is unclear why SISG
chose to resume production at a loss, it is hard for staff to forecast the likelihood of continued

SIERRA LEONE

production, or the realistic prospects for the proposed resumption of production at the second
mine.
16.
Given these uncertainties, staff has attempted to assess what the first-round impacts
on the economy would be if iron ore production halted again. If there were zero iron ore
production in 2017 and 2018, growth would decline to an estimated 1.8 and 5.0 percent,
respectively (compared to 5.0 and 5.8 percent in the baseline). The direct fiscal impact would be
surprisingly limited, as the mine currently only pays royalties. Thus, the estimated loss of fiscal
revenue would be around 0.2 percent of GDP per year. The loss of iron ore exports would be
partially offset by declining iron ore related imports, but nonetheless the current account would
deteriorate by $75–100 million per year; closing this gap would be perhaps the biggest challenge
from a loss of iron ore exports.
17.
The risks to outlook are firmly to the downside. Beyond the risks related to iron ore
production, projected FDI flows may fail to materialize, particularly, in the medium term, posing
significant downside risk to both the DSA and the balance of payments financing, as this would
cause both growth and exports to be lower. In addition, if the high NPL problem and weaknesses in
the state-owned banks are not tackled rapidly, the weaker exchange rate and higher inflation
combined with low growth could further compromise the overall stability of the banking system and
result in potential high fiscal costs for possible bank recapitalizations and/or resolution. Other
domestic risks which could pose negative impacts on outlook include poor implementation of fiscal
policy or reemergence of Ebola. External risks include persistently lower energy prices and structural
weak growth in emerging economies, particularly a further slowdown in China. These risks
emphasize the importance of domestic revenue mobilization and expenditure prioritization. On the
monetary and financial policy front, they underline the urgency of timely implementation of the
recommendations of the diagnostic studies of the two banks.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities broadly concur with staff’s projections. The authorities agreed with staff’s
views on growth and inflation prospects for the medium term, which are better than assumed at the
time of the last review (MEFP ¶5). They noted that several initiatives and the large FDI in the
agriculture sector will boost activity in the non-iron ore sectors and help the economy diversify.
Given the uncertainty of the iron ore and other commodity prices, the authorities acknowledged the
downside risk from a prolonged shock in the mining sector. In particular, since the iron ore company
is producing at significant loss, the sustainability of their operation remains a major concern. The
authorities agreed with staff projections of revenues and expenditures for the medium term
(MEFP ¶28). Their key aims will be to increase non-iron ore revenue (MEFP ¶40) while improving
expenditure management (MEFP ¶41).

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING THE
FOUNDATIONS FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
STRONGER GROWTH
The challenge facing Sierra Leone is to achieve fiscal sustainability and return to a path of strong,
sustainable economic growth, which can facilitate a significant reduction in poverty. The staff agreed
with the authorities that there are four key medium-term economic challenges facing Sierra Leone, as
it seeks to achieve this goal: making fiscal space for priority spending, strengthening public financial
management, enhancing financial stability and macro-financial synergies, and diversifying the
economy.

A. Policy Theme #1: Making Fiscal Space for Priority Spending
19.
A key structural challenge confronting the authorities is the very low domestic
revenue to GDP ratio, an estimated 10.9 percent of non-iron ore GDP for 2016, even after the
measures discussed below to close the fiscal financing gap (Table 2b). This is especially critical as
expenditure pressures mount relating to the post-Ebola recovery and the Agenda for Prosperity, as
external budget support is expected to further decline in the medium term, and as the sustainability
of iron ore production remains unclear. Thus, the authorities and staff agree that increasing
domestic revenues is the most important challenge facing the government (MEFP ¶36).
Accomplishing this will require continued efforts to enhance tax administration, as well as a
fundamental reconsideration of tax policies.
20.
The importance of increasing domestic revenues is underlined by the limited
availability of domestic financing. The authorities’ fiscal anchor under the program is determined
by an upper ceiling in domestic financing of the budget of 2 percent of GDP. This anchor is
consistent with fiscal sustainability given the spending needs of the government, domestic resources
available to the authorities and the depth of the domestic debt market. There was a temporary
relaxation of this anchor to 3 percent of GDP for 2015 in the face of severe shocks facing the
country. Given the continuing fiscal challenges, including the needs for post-Ebola recovery
spending, the program envisions a gradual return to the anchor. Thus, the anchor will be set at
2.5 percent of GDP in 2016, and return to 2 percent in 2017.
21.
Thus, given the constraint of the fiscal anchor, staff’s main recommendation is to
increase fiscal space through higher and more diversified revenues, with steady increases in
revenues as a share of GDP each year over the medium term. Staff believes the increased fiscal
space should be used for higher expenditures, especially in pro-poor spending and capital projects
to address critical infrastructure needs in energy, education, and health.
22.
The greatest challenge in tax administration is non-compliance. To address this
difficulty, the authorities are increasing their audit and collection efforts. However, more needs to be

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

done to run tax collections on a systemic basis instead of through ad-hoc efforts to meet short-term
expenditure pressures and year-end targets. In this regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ push to
automate GST collections, which is expected to reach completion by end-2017. Human capacity
needs to be enhanced to review tax returns of large companies that may be underestimating their
obligations, especially in the telecommunications, extractive and financial sectors. In addition, it will
be important to continue efforts to simplify customs clearance, whose existing complexity is
facilitating tax evasion.
23.
With regard to tax policy, it will be vital to broaden the tax base. Currently, tax policy
focuses on collecting revenue from a small portion of the economy, with key sectors and businesses
exempted from excise taxes and/or the GST. In the context of the last review and the 2016 budget,
the government eliminated all exemptions not approved by parliament, generating an amount
estimated 0.10–0.15 percent of non-iron ore GDP. In addition, as detailed below, the authorities
have begun scrutinizing exemptions requested by NGOs to ensure they relate strictly to their core
activities, and henceforth hotels will not be granted exemptions beyond the construction phase.
Further to these efforts, staff has urged the elimination of the exemption for imported rice; however,
the authorities have shown reluctance citing socio-political reasons, especially as they view local
production to be insufficient to meet local demand. Overall, staff strongly urges the government to
review the entire list of tax exempt items and activities, and the cost of each exemption, with the aim
of eliminating most exemptions. The staff is confident that a careful review of exemptions will lead
the authorities to conclude that the costs of most exemptions—both in terms of lost revenue, and
distortions imposed on the economy—greatly exceed any benefits.
24.
Staff also strongly urged the authorities to follow through on their previous
commitment to eliminate implicit fuel subsidies, which would lead to a significant increase in
excise revenues. Currently, the government adjusts the excise rate charged retail fuel consumers at
periodic intervals to maintain prices stable. When international oil prices rise, the excise revenue
they collect declines to insulate the retail price from the changes in the global markets, resulting in
an implicit subsidy in the form of foregone revenue of about 0.4 percent of GDP per year.
25.
Measures to increase revenues will pay off gradually. In the meantime, addressing fiscal
challenges will require spending restraint. Under current spending policies, and assuming a gradual
increase in revenues based on the measures discussed above, staff estimates fiscal gaps for 2017 of
0.5 percent of GDP, and in the medium-term of more than 1 percent of non-iron ore GDP. These
gaps would emerge, despite revenue gains and expenditure savings that would accrue from
structural measures agreed to close the gap in 2016, for two reasons. First, a significant part of
domestic financing shifted to the 364-day treasury bills, the interest rate on which have increased to
more than 20 percent compared to an assumption of 10 percent during the last review. This
development will increase the domestic interest rate cost by more than double beginning in 2017,
and it will only gradually decline over the medium-term. Second, external budget support is
expected to continue to decline. To close the financing gaps will require further expenditure
restraint.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SIERRA LEONE

26.
Wages are a significant source of budgetary pressure, projected to be more than
7 percent of non-iron ore GDP and taking up more than 65 percent of domestic revenue in
2016, up from 46 percent in 2013. In consultation with staff, the authorities have prepared a
medium-term wage strategy that aims to reduce and contain the wage bill within 6 percent of GDP
and 50 percent of domestic revenue by 2019 through a number of steps, inter-alia: committing to a
nominal freeze of the existing wage bill for 2017; ensuring sectoral hiring and wage increases
thereafter consistent with the medium-term wage target of 6 percent of GDP; harmonizing
subvented agency wages with the civil service pay scale, including a commitment to freeze the
creation of new agencies and hiring of new staff for the existing agencies for at least one year;
eliminating ghost workers and continuous monitoring thereof; and ensuring staff who are supposed
to be retired do not continue to be on the payroll.
27.
To strengthen the fiscal position beyond 2016, a number of steps will need to be
taken. For 2017, the fiscal gap—after measures taken in 2016—stands at approximately at
0.4 percent of GDP. In 2018 and beyond, the gap is approximately 1 percent of GDP. The following
medium-term measures (Box 1, Text Table 1) were discussed and agreed with the authorities to
address the emerging medium-term gaps (MEFP ¶28).
Box 1. Measures to Close the 2017 and the Medium-Term Fiscal Gap
 Revenue: Implementation of the fuel subsidy reform, effective January 1, 2017. This would raise an
estimated 0.3 percent of non-iron ore GDP. This should be combined with further elimination of
exemptions and other unidentified revenue measures, targeted at raising an additional 0.1 percent of
non-iron ore GDP. With these in effect, domestic revenue would increase 1.2 percent of GDP from 2016.
Staff and authorities agree they should target annual increases in revenues of at least 0.7 percent of
GDP for 2018 and 2019, increasing domestic revenue as percent of GDP to 14.6 by 2021.
 Expenditures: The authorities conveyed that goods and services expenditures and domestically
financed capital spending would decrease each by 0.1 percent of GDP in 2017, from their 2016 levels. In
2018 and thereafter, staff and authorities project increases of between 0.2 and 0.4 percent of non-iron
ore GDP in goods and services and domestically financed capital spending.

consistent with the last review.
The domestic primary deficit would improve to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2016 from 5.1 percent in 2015
and 4.7 percent programmed at the time of the last review, due to lower domestic borrowing, as
discussed above. In 2017, the primary deficit would improve further to 2.7 percent on the back of

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

aggressive revenue increases. From 2018 onward, the primary deficit would converge to around
2.3 percent GDP partly reflecting lower domestic borrowing consistent with returning to the fiscal
anchor of 2 percent of GDP.
Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities agree with staff that significant structural changes must take place in
fiscal policy to ensure the budget can be executed effectively and without arrears (MEFP ¶22,
24, 28). The government also agrees that aggressive revenue measures must be taken to close
emerging fiscal gaps in 2016 and the medium-term. The authorities agree that further elimination of
GST and import duty exemptions is a priority, and can generate significant resources. To facilitate
their efforts to enhance tax administration, the authorities have requested a TADAT mission to
conduct a comprehensive review of tax administration, and highlight critical areas of needed
improvement. The authorities are inclined to stress potential savings in expenditures, especially in
domestically financed capital spending, as they believe significant portions of capital spending will
continue to be financed by donors. They underline the point that an excessive reliance on revenue
generation would risk adding duress to the currently fragile recovery of the non-iron ore sector.
Finally, the authorities agree that, on its current trajectory, the wage cost has become fiscally
unsustainable. The authorities agree that they should target a wage cost of 6 percent of GDP in the
medium-term through strong measures already detailed in their medium-term wage strategy
discussed above. (MEFP¶ 22–23, 25, 38).

B. Policy theme #2: Enhancing Public Financial Management
30.
The very limited resources available to the government heighten the importance of
ensuring those resources are used effectively. Staff has conducted a study assessing fiscal risks in
Sierra Leone, which include the risks from weak public finance management practices (SIP 2).
Unpredictability of the budget, large public investment project plans, lack of comprehensiveness
and transparency in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) and SOE reported operations; and
poor oversight of fiscal risk from contingent liabilities, among other PFM weaknesses, are among the
key fiscal risks.
31.
Most of these deficiencies in public finance management should be mitigated by the
provisions of the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act, which was passed by Parliament in
early June. There are two main areas of weakness in the existing PFM framework. The first is the
ad-hoc basis on which MDAs submit off-budget expenditure requests beyond their original
allocations, preventing effective cash management and planning by the Ministry of Finance
(MOFED). The PFM reform would put an official cap on these requests, giving MOFED more control
over the approved budget spending plans. The second area of weakness is the autonomy of
resources under the control of MDAs beyond the reach of MOFED. This de-facto autonomy both
deprives the budget of resources that may be sitting idle or spent inefficiently, and allocates them
away from the expenditure priorities established in the budget. The PFM reform will unify the unruly
network of accounts containing these revenues into a Treasury Single Account (TSA), making these

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SIERRA LEONE

resources transparent, and rendering them accessible to MOFED in case of budgetary need, while
preserving their original assignment to the MDAs. The PFM Act also establishes a budget process
that is anchored by macro-fiscal objectives, which will include an annual Fiscal Risk Statement, as
well as a more rigorous framework for assessing requests for government guarantees, a framework
for evaluating public investment proposals, and a system of budget adjustments that allows
sufficient flexibility for government to respond to exceptional circumstances.
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities agree that implementing the PFM Act is a priority if scarce resources
are to be employed effectively (MEFP ¶37). They will be working closely with FAD in the coming
months to set up the appropriate regulatory framework for the implementation of the Act. They
agree that if properly implemented, the PFM framework will give MOFED more control of a budget
process that will be consistent with the macro-fiscal framework. Furthermore, they agree that the
PFM Act will enable the government to more effectively incorporate a medium-term outlook into
budget planning.

C. Policy Theme #3: Enhancing the Monetary Framework, Strengthening
Financial Stability, and Unlocking the Potential of Macro-Financial
Synergies
33.
While the legal mandate of the BSL is price stability, the BSL has not established a
framework for monetary policy that would allow it to respond quickly in case of a sudden rise
in inflation, nor one that, by stabilizing interest rates, can reduce uncertainty for borrowers
and support growth. The BSL’s monetary policy operations are heavily constrained by the fiscal
dominance in the banking system. Monetary policy is formulated by the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC). The MPC meets every quarter to discuss economic developments influencing monetary
policy. A press release is issued after each MPC meeting summarizing the Committee’s policy
deliberations and decisions on the Monetary Policy Rate and the interest rates of the BSL’s reverse
repurchase operations and standing credit facility. Monetary policy is implemented in the context of
reserve money targeting. Financial markets remain underdeveloped and monetary policy
transmission through the interest rate channel is weak. Moreover, monetary policy is largely reactive
to current events and past developments, instead of responding to long-term underlying economic
and financial market trends and sustained inflationary pressures
34.
The BSL should focus monetary policy on price stability and limit its intervention in
the foreign exchange market. Making the economic environment more predictable is the most
important way the BSL can support faster growth in Sierra Leone. The need to finance a modest
deficit within limited resources will remain a strain on the financial system, but a shift in the BSL’s
decision making toward medium-term goals can help reduce volatility in interest rates, the exchange
rate, and inflation. Staff welcomes the BSL’s commitment to enhancing the effectiveness of its
monetary policy operations, as well as liquidity management through its secondary market
operations and foreign exchange interventions (MEFP ¶30). As the exchange rate will continue to be

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

under pressure, the authorities plan to migrate gradually to intervention aimed at smoothing
exchange rate volatility, and to introduce a reserve requirement on foreign exchange deposits
(MEFP ¶31). Starting from 2017, the projected evolution of cash flows to Sierra Leone implies that
the BSL will need to be a net buyer of foreign exchange from the market in order to meet its foreign
exchange reserve target.
35.
Weaknesses in the financial sector are a major impediment to Sierra Leone’s economic
progress. These weaknesses come in two forms: concerns about the financial soundness of the
banking system, and the very low levels of credit available. With regard to the former, the two stateowned banks suffer from exceedingly high non-performing loans (NPLs), as well as a range of other
weaknesses, including concentrated and connected lending. Staff welcomes the independent
diagnostic study of these two institutions funded by the World Bank, to determine their true
situation, and how the risks they pose for the financial system can be most effectively addressed.
Timely and aggressive implementation of the recommendations of these studies will be critical.
36.
However, concerns about soundness are not limited to these public banks. A number of
other banks suffer from high NPLs, as well as excessive exposure to large borrowers. It is essential
that the BSL work to further strengthen banking supervision, to address these challenges. Banks are
also failing to serve the key function of providing credit to the private sector. Banking system credit
to the private sector stands below 5 percent of GDP, a figure that has declined in recent years.
Combined with the high share of loans going to the five largest borrowers, this means that, for most
private sector businesses, credit is virtually impossible to attain. Business development and
expansion require access to credit on appropriate terms, and it will be essential to address the
factors that prevent the banking system from providing that credit.
37.
With that in mind, staff conducted a pilot exercise of the Fund’s new macro-financial
analysis (Appendix 2). The pilot focused on issues related to strengthening financial stability and
unlocking the potential synergies of macro-financial linkages. Specifically, the pilot focused on the
following areas: (i) assessing and explaining the financial landscape and vulnerabilities in
Sierra Leone; (ii) spelling out the linkages between the various components of the story: fiscal
dominance, fiscal arrears, NPLs, banking supervision, governance and management of state-owned
banks, and the extremely low credit to GDP ratio; (iii) analyzing the potential cost of cleaning the
balance sheets of one or both state-owned banks; and (iv) analyzing the impacts on the taxpayers,
the budget, and the payment system if one or both of the state-owned banks had to be closed. Key
findings of the pilot exercise are as follows.
a. The financial sector, dominated by the state-owned banks, is in poor shape. Reflecting
weak governance and poor management of some banks, as well as the effects of the Ebola
outbreak and the crisis in the mining sector, banks’ asset quality and capital buffers have
deteriorated sharply in recent years. As of end June 2015, non-performing loans accounted
for nearly 40 percent of total loans, having doubled in two years. The NPL ratios of the two
state-owned banks stood at 74 and 48 percent respectively, at end 2015.

b. The system suffers from fiscal dominance (Text Figure 6). Net claims on the central
government account for 14 percent of GDP while credit to private sector accounts for less
than 5 percent of GDP. In addition,

feedback loop between the
financial and real sectors. On one
hand, poor governance and management of some banks, combined with weaknesses in
banking supervision, limit the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the real
economy. On the other hand, a lack of bankable projects in the private sector limits the
healthy expansion of the financial sector, while returns on treasury bills are attractive. As a
result, credit to the private sector is very low while the banking sector sits on substantial
liquid assets.
Sources: The BSL; and IMF staff compilation.
* Total banking assets and net claims on central governmentexcludes 2013 onwards IMF augmentation.

d. The system is significantly dollarized. Net foreign assets of commercial banks are more
than 25 percent greater than total credit to the private sector. Foreign currency deposits
account for 32 percent of total deposits. Local currency deposits are subjected to a
12 percent reserve requirement while foreign currency deposits are not subject to reserves
requirement. This contributes to preference of holding foreign currency deposits.
38.
To address these issues, a comprehensive and sequenced reform roadmap is needed to
address the financial sector vulnerabilities and unlock the macro-financial synergies in
Sierra Leone. Based on the urgency of the issues, staff believes the following sequence of reforms is
advisable: The first priority is to address the two problem state-owned banks. The second priority is
to address the NPLs of other banks. The third priority is to create an enabling environment for
banking sector development. In parallel, the coordination of macro-economic policies could be
strengthened.
39.
This first priority should be carried out immediately, the second priority should be
done in the short-term framework (within one year), and the third priority should be done in
the medium term.


16

Ensuring swift completion of the independent diagnostic studies of the two largest banks,
and then aggressively addressing the findings of those studies, will be important to
improving the health of the banking system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE



Intensifying efforts to strengthen banking supervision to increase the health of the banking
system. For example, the BSL should review the situation of other banks with either high
NPLs, or violations of prudential regulations, and ensure that those banks take necessary
steps meet the prudential requirements (MEFP ¶32, 33).



Adopting reforms to improve the enabling environment for financial sector development. In
this regard, the introduction of a registry of movable collateral is welcome. The authorities
are encouraged to accelerate efforts aimed at making this registry operational. It will also be
important to introduce unique identification numbers, which are essential to enable the
credit reference bureau to be effective. Furthermore, it is important to promote private
sector development so that there will be more bankable projects. In addition, it is advisable
to introduce a reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits, while lowering the reserve
requirement on domestic currency deposits, so that the net impact is no change in required
reserves. Finally, the authorities should minimize fiscal arrears to eliminate one source of
NPLs of banks.

Authorities’ Views
40.
The authorities acknowledge that vulnerabilities in the banking system have increased
and are taking measures to address them. The authorities are committed to award the contract
for the independent studies by end-June, with the aim of completing them by end-September. To
further strengthen supervisory abilities, they requested the IMF to provide a long-term resident
expert in banking supervision (MEFP ¶32, 33).
41.
The authorities welcome the findings of the macro-financial pilot and its
recommendations. They noted their continuous effort to improve the financial sector environment,
in particular through the operation of the credit registry. The authorities also see merit in the staff
recommendation on the unique identification. There is not yet a timeline and plan to introduce this,
but if introduced, this unique number could also serve as a tax identification number.

D. Policy Theme #4: Strengthening Economic Diversification and External
Sustainability
42.
Economic diversification is an essential prerequisite to strong, sustainable, poverty
reducing growth. This was demonstrated clearly by the consequences to Sierra Leone of the
collapse in metal prices; a more diversified economy would have been more resilient in the face of
this shock. But achieving economic diversification is a difficult and long-term challenge.
43.
Unfortunately, in recent years Sierra Leone’s economy has become less diversified, as
shown by staff’s study on export diversification (SIP 3). Prior to 2010, export diversification had
been improving in Sierra Leone over the previous five decades. The country’s export diversification
fared well relative to its peers. However, the large-scale iron ore investment and subsequent related
exports, and their impact on the exchange rate, have significantly reduced both export product and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SIERRA LEONE

market diversification. Moreover, most of Sierra Leone’s traditional export products have failed to
grow over the past decade. As supported by cross country experience, Sierra Leone can achieve
greater export, and hence economic, diversification by attracting more FDI, improving human capital
and easing infrastructure bottlenecks.
44.
A key part of the challenge in achieving economic diversification will be to enhance
the economic infrastructure. Unfortunately, while the needs are extensive—increased electricity
supply, improved roads and ports, enhanced water and sanitation systems, strengthened health and
education systems, and more—the resources available to address these needs are extremely limited.
In this regard, the previous three challenges feed directly into the economic diversification
challenge: more effective use of increased domestic resources would enable the government to
address more of these infrastructure challenges, while a strengthened financial sector would enable
the private sector to expand and diversify.
45.
Given the many needs and limited resources, a two-pronged approach is needed here.
First, it will be critical to effectively prioritize the infrastructure needs. Second, the limited domestic
resources can be supplemented by borrowed external resources. However, given the country’s
already high level of external debt, only a limited amount of additional external debt can be
acquired without putting the country at high risk of debt distress. This makes it vital that the
government be selective in determining which projects it seeks external financing for, and that it
seeks the best terms possible for such financing, relying almost exclusively on concessional
financing.
Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities concurred with the thrust of the analysis. They noted that Sierra Leone
was performing better than peers in export diversification and shared the concern that iron exports
have made exports less diversified. They agreed that export diversification can be achieved by
boosting infrastructure and human capital as well as attracting more FDI, all of which will require
mobilizing fiscal revenues and providing macro-economic stability. They also noted the importance
of conducting Sierra Leone-specific sectoral analysis on the constraints to the development of
certain sectors.
Data Provision
47.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, with some key
shortcomings in national accounts, price and external sector statistics. The authorities are working
with Fund staff, including from AFRITAC, to address these shortcomings.

SIERRA LEONE

PROGRAM ISSUES
A. Review of Recent Program Performance
48.
Performance relative to program commitments in the latter half of 2015 was relatively
good. All end-2015 quantitative performance criteria were met. All continuous PCs have also been
observed. While end-September 2015 indicative targets on net domestic bank credit to the central
government, net domestic assets (NDA) of the central bank, and poverty-related expenditures were
missed, policy corrections were put in place and all end-December 2015 indicative targets were met.
49.
Progress on structural reforms was mixed. Several structural benchmarks were met,
including the preparation of a rolling biweekly treasury cash flow table and semi-annual report on
PIP execution, submission of the PFM Bill to Parliament, the introduction of a wholesale foreign
exchange auction, the issuance of a tender for a diagnostic study of the two state-owned banks, and
finalizing the business process engineering for a customs single clearance window. In addition,
several structural benchmarks for end-March 2016 have also been met, including the establishment
of a registry of moveable collateral and the introduction of a daily liquidity forecasting framework.
However, progress on other structural measures was not consistent with program benchmarks. Most
importantly, the delay in passage of the PFM Bill meant that the benchmarks on the establishment
of a Treasury Single Account and a Natural Resource Revenue Fund by end-December 2015 were
missed, as these are embodied in the PFM Act. With the recent passage of the PFM Act, the
authorities are now proceeding with the establishment of the TSA and Natural Resource Revenue
Fund. In addition, the authorities had committed to introduce to parliament a new Tax
Administration Act by December 2015, but have not yet done so. The following structural
benchmarks for end-March 2016 were also missed: adoption by cabinet of a revised medium-term
wage, establishment of a primary dealer system, finalization of BSL’s rule governing the inter-bank
foreign exchange market, and completion of an independent diagnostic study for the two stateowned banks. It will be important to accelerate structural reform efforts, if the objectives of the
government’s program are to be achieved.

B. Review of Forward-Looking Policies
50.
During the early months of 2016, a significant financing gap emerged in the budget.
This budget gap is driven by several factors, including wages running well above budget and the
failure to unify retail and commercial fuel prices at the commercial level. Combined with a shortfall
in net domestic financing due to tight liquidity in the banking system, these factors produced a
financing gap for the 2016 budget of nearly 1 percent of GDP.
a. The 2016 budget called for wages to be unchanged in nominal terms relative to 2015,
but several factors have made that goal unattainable. First, government wages increased
15 percent on July 1, 2015; the application of this higher wage for all of 2016 would naturally
increase the wage bill. The authorities had assumed retirements and other routine
reductions in staffing would offset this impact; these anticipated savings have not

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SIERRA LEONE

materialized. In addition, the government’s inability to control wages of subvented agencies
created severe wage pressures; the wage bill of subvented agencies in the first quarter of
2016 was almost 30 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Combined, this resulted
in a wage bill being 0.6 percent of GDP higher than assumed in the program. The authorities
have since begun taking of measures to reduce this initial projection, discussed in detail
below in the context of the measures to close the gap, which should reduce the wage bill by
about 0.15 percent of GDP.
b. The budget’s revenue forecast had been based in part on the authorities’ intention to
unify retail and commercial fuel prices at the commercial level. This was projected to
increase excise revenues by 104 billion leones, 0.4 percent of GDP. However, this unification
has not happened. The authorities had made a commitment to implement this reform as
part of the budget for 2016 at the time of the 3rd and 4th Review. This was both a significant
revenue measure and an important structural commitment for the medium-term. The
presence of implicit subsidies in the separate pricing formula for retail users is regressive
and subject to abuse as it is administratively impractical to enforce the separate application.
Hence, many commercial, wealthy users buy fuel at the retail price (as opposed to the higher
commercial price that has complete pass-through from the international markets), becoming
the main beneficiaries of the implicit subsidy contained in the retail formula. However, in the
context of a fragile economic recovery from Ebola, the authorities cited the political cost of
removing the subsidy in an environment of declining global oil prices as the key reason
(MEFP ¶21) they cannot now honor this commitment. The authorities expressed a firm
commitment to pass the fuel subsidy reform in the context of a possible successor
arrangement.
51.
In addition to these problems, the authorities have continued to accrue fiscal arrears
during the year as a result of periodic cash constraints.10 Usually difficulties in financing relating
to unexpected delays in external budget support and tightness in the domestic financial market
combined with overruns in statutory spending are the main contributors to this problem; that has
been the case in 2016. Although the authorities have always cleared these arrears by the end of the
year, the delays in payments during the year are borne by government contractors working on
domestically financed capital projects or certain wage earners. These delays in turn contribute to
both an inefficient execution of capital projects and lack of confidence in the government's ability to
honor its obligations, and result in non-performing loans for the banking sector. Higher mobilization
of domestic revenue will help reduce the budget's sensitivity to external budget support and relieve
the pressure on the domestic financing market. On the other hand, better cash management,
including through the effective implementation of the recently passed PFM Act, will help the
authorities reduce unexpected spending overruns.

10

The government does not have any external arrears except legacy loans owed to commercial creditors, dating back
to the Civil Conflict. The arrears mentioned in this paragraph emerged during the year as a result of cash constraints,
but are cleared before the beginning of the next fiscal year.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

52.
Staff supports the authorities’ plans to implement the following combination of
revenue and expenditure measures to close this gap, as discussed in detail in the MEFP,
paragraphs 22–26, and Text Table 2 and MEFP. The gateway liberalization took place April 1, 2016,
and instructions have been issued tightening exemptions for NGOs and hotels. In addition, the PRU
and mining arrears have already been collected. While staff and the authorities agreed to
incorporate into the framework a conservative revenue estimate of 1 percent of GDP from these
measures, staff believes the potential yield from these revenue measures could be greater.

1/ This scrutiny will be applied to the high-income professionals and government contractors previoulsy not fully captured by the tax network.
2/ This represents the net additional savings (beyond last review's assumption) generated by closer scrutiny on NGO exemptions and hotels.
3/ These measures include limits on discretionary spending, freezing of new government contracts and shift toward domestic currency payment for
existing contracts. The residual gap that these measures are supposed to cover is estimated to be approximately 0.1 percent of GDP, but these measures
will likely generate more savings.

53.
Staff projects these measures will produce a fiscal deficit for 2016 consistent with
available financing. Compared to the last review, the fiscal stance in 2016 will tighten due to lower
net domestic financing. The overall balance including grants is now programmed to be 4.9 percent
of non-iron ore GDP compared to 5.3 percent in the last review.
54.
Staff expects the authorities to meet the June 2016 quantitative performance targets
and Structural Benchmarks. Revenue performance is so far in line with expectations. In the first
quarter, domestic revenue was more than 2 percent higher than expected, mainly as a result of
aggressive monitoring of and eliminations of exemptions (consistent with program commitments)
and continuation of strengthened administrative measures, including higher scrutiny on taxes owed
by professional previously not scrutinized. With the Gateway Liberalization effective March 1,
expected to bring 0.25 percent of GDP higher revenue annually, second quarter revenue should
continue to over-perform. Accordingly, staff expects the authorities to comfortably meet its June
revenue floor. Although expenditures were running above target in the first quarter due to the
overruns in the wage bill, the spending restraint enacted currently and the effect of frontloading of
some expenditures of to the first quarter should get spending back on track with the program in the
second quarter. The target on Net Banking Credit to Government is also expected to be met given
the restraints on commercial bank borrowing observed so far. The prior action on passage of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SIERRA LEONE

PFM Bill by Parliament was met on May 31, paving the way for completion of the review. The
authorities are on track to meet all end June structural benchmarks.
55.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to be designed primarily to contain
inflation, while ensuring adequate liquidity in the banking system. Monetary policy will be
geared to keeping inflation broadly unchanged at around 9 percent. In this context, the BSL is
committed to continue efforts to strengthen liquidity management, including by improving liquidity
forecasting. In addition, the authorities and staff agree that the BSL should introduce reserve
requirements on foreign currency deposits, in part to eliminate the bias favoring foreign currency
deposits. Finally, staff strongly recommended that the BSL halt routine sales of foreign exchange,
intervening in the market only to offset excessive temporary moves in the exchange rate. The
authorities agreed in principle, but felt it would be desirable to gradually move in that direction.
56.
It will also be critical for the BSL to intensify its efforts to strengthen banking
supervision and increase the health of the banking system. Ensuring the swift completion of the
independent diagnostic studies of two state-owned banks, and then aggressively addressing the
findings of those studies, will be important to improve the health of the banking system. It will also
be necessary to review the situation of other banks with either high NPLs, or violations of prudential
regulations, and ensure them to take necessary steps to meet prudential requirements.
57.
Strong external debt management will be vital to ensure that debt levels do not rise to
the point of putting Sierra Leone at a high risk of debt distress. The resumption of iron ore
exports and the additional fiscal revenue measures since the last review have improved the debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) of Sierra Leone (Annex II). Previously identified vulnerabilities from the
November 2015 update, which stemmed from low exports and revenues, have somewhat eased in
the baseline scenario. As a result, the borrowing space to contract external debt without
jeopardizing debt sustainability may have increased. However, given the precarious viability of iron
ore production under the near-term price dynamics, the authorities should remain cautious in their
borrowing plans. Moreover, the potential fiscal cost of restructuring the banking system poses an
additional downside risk to public DSA. Staff and authorities have agreed to keep the current limit of
the performance criteria on the external borrowing unchanged at this stage as the borrowing
program that will most likely materialize before end-June 2016 is well below the current limit.
Beyond June 2016, an indicative debt limit that would preserve Sierra Leone’s current moderate risk
rating is around $150 million in NPV—or $80 million more than the end-June 2016 ceiling. The
authorities should strive to borrow within this limit to maintain the moderate risk of debt distress.
58.
However, if downside risks to the growth outlook materialize, this will result in weaker
fiscal performance. Revenue will be lower and the financing gap higher. In this case, staff’s
recommendations will focus on further eliminating subsidies and exemptions and increasing
spending efficiency.
59.
Sierra Leone’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate. Sierra Leone has a good
track record of timely payment of its external debt obligations, including to the Fund. Debt service
obligations to the Fund declined substantially in 2015–16 thanks to debt relief under the CCR Trust.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

The total outstanding debt to the Fund is expected to peak in 2016 at SDR 231 million
(111.5 percent of new 2016 quota). As discussed in the last program review, staff proposes that
SDR 15.56 million be used as indirect budget support, out of the SDR 24.44 million from the current
disbursement. As in the combined third and fourth reviews, the BSL would lend the Leone equivalent
of the disbursed IMF budget support resources to the Treasury and sell the foreign exchange as
government spending occurs; the MOU between the BSL and MOFED, signed at the time of the third
and fourth reviews, also covers this disbursement.
60.
The 2015 safeguards assessment found that the modernization of the internal audit
function at the BSL had stalled. In order to address this, the assessment recommended
strengthening the capacity of the function. Other recommendations aimed to improve the oversight
bodies. While most measures have been implemented as scheduled, enhancing the capacity of
internal audit is ongoing.
61.
Financing assurances review. Staff has assessed that the expected disbursement of IMF
financing following the completion of the fifth ECF review by the Executive Board is consistent with
IMF’s policy on lending into arrears. Prompt Fund support is crucial for the implementation of
Sierra Leone’s economic program for the remainder of 2016. Staff assess that the authorities are
making good-faith efforts to resolve the issue of private external arrears, dating back to civil war
period, estimated at US$203.8 million as of December 2015. The authorities have already entered
into a collaborative process with creditors, and are leveraging World Bank technical assistance to
help clear these arrears.
62.
Staff and authorities agreed to leave unchanged the quantitative PCs for end-June
2016 established in the previous review. In order to improve revenue related policy traction, the
authorities have proposed a new structural benchmark on “revision of consolidated tax and nontax
obligations for mining companies and preparation of a list of expired mining agreements”. They
have also proposed that the continuous benchmark on treasury cash flow table be changed from
“monthly” to “biweekly” frequency. In recognition of the delay in initiating the procurement process,
they request that the end-June benchmark on the diagnostic study of the two state-owned banks be
changed to “complete contracting process”. Staff supports these requests. The definitions of the
variables monitored are provided in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). Structural
benchmarks are proposed as shown in the MEFP, Tables 4 and 5.

STAFF APPRAISAL
63.
Staff welcomes the relatively strong performance of the Sierra Leone government
regarding its commitments in the ECF arrangement, under extremely difficult circumstances.
Meeting all end-December 2015 performance criteria while GDP was declining by more than
21 percent demonstrates the authorities’ very strong commitment to the program. However,
progress on structural reforms has been mixed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SIERRA LEONE

64.
Given the continued fragility in the iron ore sector and the declining external
financing, it remains critical for the authorities to diversify and increase domestic revenues,
especially in the non-iron ore sectors. To this end, staff regrets the authorities’ decision to not
eliminate fuel subsidies as planned, and urges them to ensure their elimination no later than
January 1, 2017. Staff believes elimination of tax exemptions, especially in import duties, offers the
most promising additional potential for increasing revenues in the near term. Staff commends the
authorities’ request for a TADAT mission to have a comprehensive review of tax administration in
Sierra Leone, to identify priority areas for structural improvement. Going forward, it will be vital to
ensure that tax revenues steadily increase as a share of GDP.
65.
On expenditures, staff regrets the slippages on the wage bill in 2016 and advises the
authorities to make space for priority spending. Staff urges the authorities to freeze the nominal
wage bill in 2017, as a step toward capping it at no more than 6 percent of GDP over the medium
term while making space for priority spending in such areas as social protection, energy, education,
and health.
66.
Staff welcomes the passage of the new PFM Act, and urges the authorities to
aggressively strengthen public financial management. This will help MOFED in improving cash
management and exercising greater control over planning and execution of the budget. The PFM
Act implementation will also consolidate various sub-accounts of MDAs with possibly idle revenue
under one umbrella and increase the transparency of these accounts and their accessibility for more
efficient use.
67.
Staff supports BSL’s continued objective of price stability and encourages BSL to
enhance its monetary policy framework and liquidity management capacity to improve the
efficiency of the financial system. To protect foreign exchange reserves, staff welcomes the BSL’s
plan to migrate from regular foreign exchange sales to a regime aimed at smoothing short-term
exchange rate volatility, and urges them to do so as soon as practical. Staff also advises the BSL to
introduce reserves requirement on foreign exchange deposits, to eliminate the existing bias in favor
of such deposits.
68.
Staff remains concerned by the serious NPL problem in the banking sector and urges
the authorities to strengthen financial stability. Staff urges the authorities to move quickly to
complete the independent diagnostic study of the two largest banks, and to work closely with the
staffs of the IMF and the World Bank to quickly and decisively implement the resulting
recommendations to resolve the problems found in the that study. In addition, staff continues to
urge the BSL to further strengthen supervisory capacity, including the hiring of a long-term export
on banking supervision, enforcement of prudential guidelines, and advancement of financial sector
reforms to support healthy financial intermediation.
69.
Further measures to improve the business environment and governance are needed to
provide a favorable environment for strong private sector investment. Staff sees the merit of
full utilization of the established credit reference bureau, and urges the adoption of a national
identification number system as soon as possible. Staff also urges the authorities to move quickly to

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

complete all necessary technical steps for introducing a one-stop window for imports clearance to
improve the easiness of doing business in Sierra Leone.
70.
Staff urges the authorities to continue prudent borrowing policies and strengthening
economic diversification. Staff reiterates that in all projects, options for concessional loans should
be exhausted before looking into nonconcessional loans.
71.
Staff urges the authorities to accelerate efforts to strengthen macroeconomic data
collection and analysis. A major and sustained improvement in the coverage and timeliness of
economic data will require greater interagency coordination and restructuring of the institutional
framework.
72.
Staff recommends completion of the fifth review of the ECF-supported program and
supports the request for a two-month for an extension of the current program to December
21, 2016, to enable adequate time to complete the final review. It is proposed that the next
Article IV consultation take place in accordance with the Decision on Article IV consultation cycles
for program countries (Decision No. 14747-(10/96), as amended).

Spending increased in 2015 to finance
higher capital expenditure, but is
expected to decline slightly in 2016.

Fiscal deficit widened in 2015, but is
expected to tighten in 2016 reflecting
higher revenue and lower percentage of
GDP spending.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to

materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern
as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term”
and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
The real effective exchange rate (REER) seems overvalued by 12-14 percent (Text Table 1). The Leone
depreciated some 14 percent against the US dollar in 2015, while the REER declined 3.8 percent. The
REER misalignment was assessed by employing the external sustainability (ES) approach based on
the 2014 indicators, the latest available actual data. Using the current account (CA) elasticity of
-0.35 percent, the REER is estimated to be overvalued by 16–18 percent. For instance, to stabilize
Sierra Leones’s international investment position (IIP) at -34.6 percent of GDP (2014 level), REER will
have to depreciate by some 18 percent. REER overvaluation reduces to 16½ percent, if IIP is to be
stabilized at -40 percent of GDP (the median of middle income countries). Considering 3.8 percent
REER depreciation that already took place during 2015, as of end 2015, the REER is possibly
overvalued between 12–14 percent. The EBA-lite methodology is not applicable to Sierra Leone
given the poor quality of BoP data, which renders unreliable historical CA deficits.

Annex II. Response to Fund Advice from the
2013 Article IV Consultation
Implementation of previous staff advice has been mixed. The authorities have responded to the
Fund’s policy advice on economic diversification and inclusive growth which is now embedded in
the first pillar of the A4P, 2013–18, commenced fiscal consolidation, supported PFM reform, and
coordinated fiscal and monetary policy implementation through the Cash Management Committee.
However, measures to reform the fuel subsidies have not yet been taken, there has been only
modest reduction in duty waivers to date, and governance and expenditure management remain
weak. High dependence on the extractive industries exposed the country to significant
macroeconomic challenges as a result of declining commodity prices. Achieving economic
diversification remains a key policy deficit. In addition, delayed implementation of policy advice on
privatization, especially for the two state-owned banks, could elevate fiscal and financial sector risks.
On the external front, the authorities have exercised restraint in pursuing prudent borrowing
policies, which have helped to keep the debt distress risk at moderate. Enhancing non-resource
revenue mobilization, improving expenditure management, advancing PFM reform, and maintaining
debt sustainability remain the key policy goals going forward. Please see table 1 below for details.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

June 16, 2016
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA

Dear Madame Lagarde:
1.

In 2014–2015, the Sierra Leone economy was hit by two severe shocks: the Ebola epidemic

and the sharp drop in iron ore prices. At the height of the epidemic, many lost their sources of
income, as business and farm activities were disrupted. The economic impact was compounded by
the shutting down of two iron ore mining companies in 2015, which together accounted for more
than a fifth of national income and two-thirds of exports. It appears these twin challenges are now
largely behind us as Sierra Leone has been declared Ebola-free since November 2015, and iron ore
production has resumed. Nonetheless, the problems are not over: post-Ebola challenges remain
prevalent in health and human development and iron mining remains on a small scale.
2.

The implementation of the Post-Ebola Recovery Strategy has gained momentum since the

beginning of 2016. The strategy builds on our poverty reduction strategy (Agenda for Prosperity),
with a special focus on the following areas for quick-wins: health, education, water and sanitation;
social protection; agriculture; and private sector development. We are hopeful that continued
financial support from Sierra Leone’s development partners would enable us to achieve our
strategic vision.
3.

Notwithstanding the immediate post-Ebola challenges we faced, the implementation of

policies and reforms under the ECF-supported program continued. At end-December 2015, all
quantitative performance criteria (PC) on net domestic bank credit to government, net domestic
assets of the central bank, and gross foreign reserves of the central bank were met. We also
observed the continuous ceilings on the PV of external debt, on short-term external debt owed or
guaranteed by the public sector, and on external payment arrears of the public sector. Targets on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

SIERRA LEONE

poverty-related spending, domestic government revenue and on the domestic primary balance
were also met.
4.

Despite this relatively strong performance on the quantitative criteria, the structural reform

agenda stalled due to delays in implementing agreed measures. The Public Finance Management
Bill, submitted to Parliament in August 2015, was tied up in the legislative process for most of the
last quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. As a result, the establishment of the Treasury Single
Account and the Natural Resource Fund were delayed. The contentious issues in the Bill have been
addressed, with technical assistance from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, and passage into law
occurred only at end-May. The provision on removal of fuel subsidies contained in the 2016 Finance
Bill was expunged by Parliament, and in deference to political sensitivities, government has decided
to shelve the implementation for the time being. Implementation of other structural measures is
progressing.
5.

We recognize the risks to the financing of our 2016 program following some expenditure

overruns in the first quarter of the year. Therefore, a comprehensive program of revenue
enhancement and expenditure rationalization was adopted by Cabinet in early March 2016. These
measures are expected to bring in additional revenue, while curtailing expenditures across the
board in the first half of the year. In addition to these temporary measures, permanent measures
will provide sustainable improvement to our public finances in the long run. These include
liberalization of the telecommunications gateway, which allow us to capture as revenue those funds
which had previously gone to the monopoly controller of the gateway; imposing Goods and Service
Tax on all electricity bills, and significant reduction in tax exemptions and duty waivers.
6.

The Government believes the policies and reforms presented in the attached MEFP are

adequate to achieve the program’s objectives. However, it stands ready to take any additional
measures that may become necessary for this purpose. We will consult with the IMF on the
adoption of any additional measures and in advance of revisions to policies contained in the
attached MEFP, in accordance with IMF policies on such matters.
7.

The Government requests the completion of the fifth review of Sierra Leone’s program

supported by the IMF under the ECF arrangement, and the disbursement of the respective tranche
in the amount of SDR 24.44 million, upon the completion of the review by the IMF Executive Board,
SDR 15.56 million of which will be lent to the budget. Finally, in order to allow adequate time for
the completion of the final review under this arrangement, we request a two-month extension of
our ECF arrangement until December 21, 2016.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached to it; and the staff report, including placement
of these documents on the IMF website, in accordance with IMF procedures.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
Freetown, June 16, 2016
INTRODUCTION
1.

This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements the one dated

October 30, 2015. It reports on performance under Sierra Leone’s economic and financial program
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), and
outlines key policies and reform measures for the remainder of 2016. These policies aim to rebuild
the economy, support macroeconomic stability, and generate sustainable growth.
2.

In 2014, the Sierra Leone economy was hit by two severe shocks: the Ebola epidemic and

the sharp drop in iron ore prices. At the height of the epidemic, many lost their sources of income,
as business and farm activities were disrupted. The economic impact was compounded by the
shutting down of two iron ore mining companies in 2015, which together accounted for more than
a fifth of national income and two-thirds of exports. It appears these twin challenges are now
ebbing, as Sierra Leone has been declared Ebola-free and iron ore production has resumed.
Nonetheless, the problems are not over: post-Ebola challenges remain prevalent in health and
human development and iron mining remains on a small scale.
3.

The implementation of the Post-Ebola Recovery Strategy has gained momentum since the

beginning of 2016. The strategy builds on the Government’s poverty reduction strategy (Agenda for
Prosperity), with a special focus on the following areas for quick-wins: health, education, water and
sanitation; social protection; agriculture; and private sector development. We are hopeful that
continued financial support from Sierra Leone’s development partners will allow for the
achievement of our strategic vision.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.

Real GDP declined significantly in 2015, by more than 21 percent. Many sectors were

adversely affected by the Ebola outbreak in the first half of the year, including construction, trade
and tourism, transport, and manufacturing. The impact of Ebola on these sectors was exacerbated
by the closing of borders with neighboring countries to contain the spread of the disease, and a
reduction in investment-related spending as a number of foreign-financed investment projects
were halted or scaled-down. As a result, growth in the non-iron ore economy was limited to
1.4 percent, compared with a 5.5 percent in 2013. IMF staff analysis indicates that this decline is
almost entirely due to the longer than anticipated duration of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

However, as EVD receded in the second half of 2015, a gradual recovery began in the non-iron ore
economy, mainly contributed by the rebound in agriculture sector.
5.

Growth prospects for 2016 and the medium term are better than assumed at the time of

the last program review. The agriculture sector is projected to grow by 4 percent in 2016, and by
3.5 percent in 2017 and 2018. Growth in this sector is driven by more than US$500 million in
investments in commercial and industrial agriculture businesses, most of which will commence
production between 2016 and 2018. These include investments in ethanol, palm oil, tobacco, and
rice. In addition, various ongoing interventions in subsistence agriculture are expected to increase
crop yield. Growth in the mining and quarrying sector will be driven by the resumption of iron ore
mining by Shandong Iron and Steel Company (SISC) in early 2016. Other minerals such as bauxite,
diamond, and gold are projected to record roughly unchanged production, given global price
dynamics. The manufacturing and services sectors are expected to benefit significantly from
ongoing energy reforms. As a result of these, overall GDP growth is projected at 4.3 percent in 2016
and 5 percent in 2017.
6.

Consumer price inflation averaged 9 percent in 2015, compared with 8.3 percent in 2014,

reflecting exchange rate depreciation, reduced food supply due to lower agriculture production,
and disruptions in cross border trade with Liberia and Guinea. In 2016, inflation is projected to
average 9.5 percent as international and domestic oil prices are expected to remain low, and
domestic food production improves supplemented by supplies from World Food Program
interventions. There is however, a possibility that exchange rate depreciation pressures could
threaten price stability.
7.

The fiscal position improved in 2015. Revenue performance was strong across the board.

Domestic revenue was nearly 7 percent higher than budgeted, with all broad categories of revenue,
except Road User Charges, being higher than projected. Corporate and personal income tax
benefited from the resumption of economic activities (as well as one-off payments from Africa
Minerals Limited), and the National Revenue Administration (NRA) ramped up enforcement actions,
with several defaulting businesses sealed off. Revenue from customs exceeded the target by
6 percent, reflecting increased oversight of operations and enforcement of collections from
outstanding obligations. Additional gains were recorded in petroleum excise duties as oil prices
declined, reducing the implicit subsidy. The mining sector exceeded the revenue target by
10 percent, notwithstanding challenges in bauxite and diamond mining, as some overdue
obligations were paid in the latter part of the year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

SIERRA LEONE

8.

Total expenditures exceeded the program by 1 percent. Wages and salaries were lower

than programmed due to a freeze in recruitment of personnel in the public service, which came into
effect in mid-2015. Interest payments also declined by 8 percent, benefiting from lower yields on
government securities, as well as debt relief from the IMF Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust
Fund. However, goods and services exceeded the programmed level by 1 percent, while
development expenditure recorded an overrun of 4 percent. Most of the overrun in capital
expenditure is attributable to expenditure on projects related to road construction, energy and
water supply that were affected by exchange rate depreciation. The overall deficit is estimated at
4.4 percent of non-iron ore GDP, compared to a program target of 4.8 percent. External budget
support totaled Le 645 billion, a significant decline from 2014, reflecting the winding down of
Ebola-related support from development partners. Government borrowing from the securities
market was 0.2 percent of non-iron ore GDP lower than expected in the last quarter of the year due
to strong revenue performance in the latter part of the year.
9.

Notwithstanding a slow start in 2015, by end year, remarkable progress was made in

poverty-related spending. Most of the key sectors that account for the bulk of our pro-poor
expenditure were able to deliver services as expected. Schools reopened in early April; most
hospitals were operating at capacity; agricultural activities increased as a result of interventions; and
most of the infrastructure projects in roads, water supply and energy resumed by the second
quarter of the year.
10.

Monetary sector developments in 2015 were heavily influenced by the post-Ebola recovery

and the winding down of related transfers. Broad money (M3) grew by 11.3 percent in 2015, largely
reflecting strong growth in net domestic assets of the banking system as government borrowing
increased. During the same period, net foreign assets of the banking system expanded as banks
both held more foreign currency and placed more foreign currency deposits with overseas banks
(mainly their parent banks). Meanwhile, credit to the private sector rose by 3.2 percent, an
improvement over the contraction recorded in first half of the year. While credit growth is
consistent with the gradual resumption of economic activities, it is still low, reflecting challenges in
the banking system, such as credit risk and high nonperforming loans. On the liabilities side,
currency in circulation and transferable deposits recorded significant growth reflecting increased
demand as the economy began to recover, especially in the second half. Reserve money grew by
10.4 percent in 2015, well above the targeted rate of 7.1 percent. There was a marginal decline in
the interest rates of commercial banks and the Monetary Policy Rate has remained at 9.5 percent
since March 2015.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

11.

Pressures on the Leone continued in 2015. The average exchange rate to the US dollar

depreciated by [12] percent, compared to a depreciation of 4.4 percent in 2014. The depreciation
reflected pressures in the foreign exchange market due to the winding down of Ebola related
inflows, as well as declining inflows from mining. Total sales during auctions by the BSL in 2015
amounted to US$112 million, more than the US$83 million sold in 2014. Pressures on the exchange
rate continued in the first quarter of 2016, with the Leone depreciating by 5 percent in the quarter.
To further cope with reserves pressures, the BSL first reduced weekly sales to
$1–$2 million, and later withdrew from the market for three successive auctions in order to preserve
reserves.
12.

At end-2015, there were significant problems with respect to prudential norms. All banks,

but one, met the minimum paid-up capital of Le 30 billion at end December 2015. Pretax profit
increased by 35 percent, while liquidity stood at 17.24 percent. However, compared with 2014, the
number of banks that were non-compliant with the minimum liquidity, capital adequacy, and
non-performing loan (NPL) ratios increased. Partly caused by the twin shocks, the NPL ratio jumped
from 22 percent at end 2013 to 38 percent in mid-2015. Though the NPL ratio declined sharply to
around 32 percent at end 2015, the amounts of outstanding loans and provisions remain roughly
unchanged. Poor loan quality reflects continuing fragility in the private sector, as well as
governance and connected lending issues in the two majority state-owned banks. However, the ongoing resolution process in the banks is addressing these problems. Loan concentration remains
high with international trade, construction, and services accounting for about three quarters of total
loans.
13.

Total exports of goods collapsed by over 55 percent in 2015 due mostly to the cessation of

iron ore production and the continued decline in international prices for Sierra Leone’s key mineral
products. With the resumption of iron ore production in early 2016, exports are projected to rise by
13.7 percent, to $662 million. Total imports also declined by about 20.6 percent in 2015, as Ebolarelated goods and services imports decreased along with the imports of fuel products. As a result,
the trade deficit increased from US$339 million in 2014 to US$724 million in 2015. For 2016, the
trade deficit is projected to improve to US$670 million, helped by resumption of iron ore exports
and declining oil price.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
14.

The implementation of policies and reforms under the ECF-supported program continued

in 2015 and through the first quarter of 2016. At end-December 2015, all performance criteria (PC)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

SIERRA LEONE

were met. Net domestic bank credit at end December was Le 650.7 billion, lower than the adjusted
target by Le 62.95 billion. Net domestic assets of the central bank was Le 431 billion; which is
Le 49.81 billion less than the adjusted target. Gross foreign reserves of the central bank at
December 2015 increased by US$49.6 million, exceeding the program floor by US$20.59 million.
The continuous ceilings on new non-concessional external debt, on short-term external debt owed
or guaranteed by the public sector, and on external payment arrears of the public sector were all
observed. Spending on poverty-related expenditure reached Le 1,253 billion, exceeding the
indicative target by Le 125 billion. Targets on domestic government revenue and on the domestic
primary balance were also met by wide margins.
15.

Some program benchmarks have not been satisfactorily completed, thereby stalling the

structural reform agenda. A prior action for the third and fourth reviews that required three revenue
measures to be included in the Finance Bill for 2016 was met, but the bill was only passed toward
the end of the first quarter 2016, reducing the revenue impact of the measures. Furthermore, one of
the provisions, on removal of fuel subsidy, was expunged by Parliament with the recommendation
that it be implemented administratively. Another major setback for the reform agenda is the
delayed enactment of the Public Finance Management Bill, originally submitted to Parliament in
August 2015. As a result, the establishment of the Treasury Single Account and the Natural
Resource Fund (Structural Benchmarks) has been delayed. The contentious issues in the Bill have
been addressed, including through technical assistance from FAD, and passage occurred in early
June.
16.

The following structural benchmarks for end-March 2016 were also missed: adoption by

cabinet of a revised medium-term wage, establishment of a primary dealer system, finalization of
BSL’s rule governing the inter-bank foreign exchange market, and completion of an independent
diagnostic study for the two state-owned banks. However, progress was made in the
implementation of all other 2016 structural benchmarks. A draft revised medium term wage and
pay reform strategy has been prepared, and was submitted to Cabinet at end-May. The monthly
rolling Treasury cash flow table consistent with the annual budget, the semi-annual report on the
execution of the public investment program, the quarterly report on external debt commitments,
agreements and disbursements were prepared; and a three-year Public Investment Program
integrated with the budget process and the revised Medium-term Expenditure Framework for
2015–17 were also completed. BSL has finalized guidelines on a primary dealer system for the
government securities market, but the agreement is not yet operational as stakeholders have yet to
confirm their new roles and responsibilities. A liquidity forecasting framework has been established
and the spreadsheet is being populated daily. A draft regulation governing the operations of the

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

interbank foreign exchange market has been completed, and discussions with banks are planned.
Structural benchmarks on financial sector developments have reached advanced stages. The terms
of reference for a diagnostic study of the two state-owned banks have been completed, and five
companies have expressed interest in undertaking the study. A registry of movable collateral was
established and BSL is awaiting specifications from IFC for procurement of the hardware.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2016
Economic Outlook
17.

The outlook in 2016 and beyond is challenging, despite the resumption of iron ore

production. Real GDP growth is projected by 4.3 percent (revised from 0.1 in the last review) while
the non-iron ore economy is forecast to grow by 3.3 percent in 2016. However, iron ore production
may not be viable for long, as the company is producing at a loss. This uncertainty has implications
for not only real growth, but also government revenue.
18.

In the non-iron ore sectors, moderate recovery is expected in agriculture, while trade and

construction are likely to maintain the recovery that was already underway in 2015 following the
relaxation of Ebola-related restrictions. A small decline is projected for tourism related hotel
receipts given the decline in Ebola related medical arrivals. Transport and other services would
benefit from the resumption of iron ore mining. For 2017, agriculture, construction and trade are
expected to be key sectors contributing to growth, as agriculture productivity starts improving and
post-Ebola recovery interventions are ramped up. Inflation is projected to average 9.5 percent in
2016, and 9 percent in 2017. The trade balance is projected to improve in 2016, because of the
resumption of iron ore mining. However, the current account deficit is projected to deteriorate from
15.5 percent in 2015 to 16.6 percent in 2016, due mainly to declining current transfers and higher
iron-ore related imports of goods and services.
19.

The implementation of the Government’s post-Ebola Recovery Strategy (ERS) should boost

growth in the non-iron ore sectors. The delivery team has made substantial progress in aligning
donor commitments to planned programs and implementation. Development partners have
initiated or contributed to projects in health services; enhancement of social services to the most
vulnerable; improved water and sanitation services; and supporting private sector development
including agriculture. In addition, an energy sector program to increase power supply to Freetown
and the western region is now in the final stages of procurement.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

Fiscal Policy
20.

Though revenue has been roughly in line with the program thus far in 2016, the budget

was nonetheless under pressure in the first quarter. These pressures came from several sources.
First, there were some expenditure overruns, especially on wages and salaries, as discussed below.
Second, programmed budget support disbursements for the first quarter, amounting to
Le 60 billion (0.24 percent of GDP), were delayed. Third, some expenditure, such as rent allowances
for parliamentarians, was front loaded and paid in January. Finally, the situation was compounded
by tight liquidity in the banking sector, which has kept net domestic credit to the government
below budgeted levels, despite a sharp increase in interest rates on Government securities.
21.

This situation is made more complicated by the fact that we have not eliminated the

subsidy on retail fuel, despite our commitment to do so in the context of our last MEFP. The
delayed implementation of this measure is due to Government’s commitment to maintaining peace
and stability in the post Ebola period. Even with the subsidy in the current retail price, there is
strong agitation from pressure groups including civil society who are calling for a reduction in
pump prices. Therefore, in realization of the political cost of removing the subsidy at this time,
government decided to postpone that action. Government is committed to implementing this
measure in the context of a successor arrangement.
22.

As an initial response to this precarious situation, a comprehensive program of revenue

enhancement and expenditure rationalization was adopted by Cabinet in early March.
Implementation of the measures is expected to bring additional revenue of about Le 100 billion to
the budget with respect to program.


Increase in the withholding tax rate (for foreign company consultant/management fees)
from 10 to 15 percent;



0 .5 percent health care tax on all new government contracts;



Collection of about Le 16.7 billion owed by Sierra Rutile from 2015 PAYE taxes, and
Le 20.7 billion in iron ore royalties;



Closer scrutiny in the approval of duty exemptions, as a result of which, an additional
Le 10 billion will be saved;



Transfer of 60 percent of existing resources, including projected revenues of all financial
autonomous agencies into the Consolidated Revenue Fund;

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE



All business outfits to pay outstanding arrears of taxes within 30 days—failure would lead to
punitive measures. NRA estimates about Le 33 billion as arrears from GST and other taxes;



All commercial banks to transfer monies in transit accounts within 24 hours—strict penalties
would apply in event of failure to comply.

23.

The expenditure measures are aimed at curtailing expenditures across the board in the first

half of the year. However, all pro-poor expenditures in education, health, agriculture, social welfare
etc. will be fully protected. The main measures include the following:


Halt on all new domestically financed capital projects and supplier contracts, and focus on
completing existing projects;



50 percent of all payments to suppliers/contractors that have a foreign component to be
switched to domestic currency;



Elimination of payment for overtime;



Elimination of double payment of pensions and salaries across the board.

In addition to these, there are several identified reductions in various categories of goods and
services.
24.

Despite these efforts at fiscal restraint, we recognize that fiscal challenges will remain for

the rest of the year, and that the measures taken to date will not be sufficient. Thus, in April we
adopted three significant revenue-enhancing measures. First, from April 1 we have liberalized the
telecommunications gateway, in part based on advice from the World Bank. In addition to
increasing the competitiveness of the sector, this measure will allow us to capture as revenue, funds
which had previously gone to the monopoly controller of the gateway. Based on 2015 billings, we
expect to receive additional revenue in 2016 from this measure totaling Le 64 billion. Second, from
July 1 all electricity bills will be subject to GST; this should yield Le 30 billion annually, or
Le 15 billion for the remainder of 2016. Third, we have taken several steps to significantly reduce tax
exemptions: henceforth, all NGOs will have the burden of proof to demonstrate that the items they
are importing relate strictly to their operations; hotels will be granted exemptions only during the
construction stage; and no domestically-financed government contracts will include a tax
exemption. Combined, we expect these measures to reduce tax exemptions by 20 billion leones in
2016, and 25 billion leones annually. Finally, to aid our ongoing efforts to strengthen tax
administration, we have requested a Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

SIERRA LEONE

mission from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, in addition to NRA’s participation in the IMF’s
Revenue Administration Fiscal Tool (RA-FIT).
25.

On the expenditure front, our new measures are aimed at containing a wage bill that we

acknowledge is growing too rapidly. We have thus taken the following measures to reduce and
contain the wage bill:


Strengthen efforts to improve the integrity of the payroll, including payment of salaries to
teachers in urban area schools into their personal bank accounts;



Identified and removed from the payroll 2,966 workers who had passed the mandatory
retirement age but were nonetheless still on the payroll;



Of the above staff, government has been paying pensions contributions for 2,744 of them
despite the fact that they had exceeded the age at which such contributions should cease.
This has been remedied, and we have requested a refund from the pension fund;


26.

Frozen the payrolls of all subvented agencies at the July 2015 level.
Along with other measures, we expect the wage bill going forward to be reduced by

42 billion leones. Nonetheless, contrary to the original wage bill projection of Le 1,651 billion,
wages will now reach Le 1,795 billion by the end of 2016, an increase of about Le 144 billion. We
recognize that at 65 percent of domestic revenue, our wage bill is not sustainable. Therefore, we are
committed to cap the wage bill at 6.0 percent of GDP over the medium term and keep its claim on
domestic revenue under 50 percent per annum. One key step to achieve this will be to contain the
rapid increase in wages of subvented agencies. We have presented to Cabinet, for its approval, a
medium term wage policy consistent with those limits. The World Bank supported Pay and
Performance Program, the European Commission Civil Service Reform program; and the African
Development Bank biometric verification of teachers exercise are important steps in the reforms.
27.

While domestic borrowing in 2016 is expected to be less than programmed, the cost of

financing has significantly increased across all tenors. The interest rate on 364 day bills, which
account for about 90 percent of total securities, increased from around 9 percent in December 2015
to 24 percent by end April 2016. As a result, the interest burden is projected to double from around
Le 250 billion in 2016 to Le 520 billion in 2017. This poses a serious challenge to budget
implementation in 2017 and beyond. We are requesting the IMF for technical assistance to address
the issue of domestic debt management.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

28.

Government recognizes that the there is a large financing gap in fiscal year 2017. This is

partly due to declining trend in external budget support, including the non-availability of IMF
budget support and higher interest obligations. We are optimistic that the current rising trend in
iron ore prices will facilitate the reopening of the second mine, and hence increased production and
higher related revenues than envisaged in the program. In addition, we will continue to rein in wage
bill increases, and introduce additional tax measures. Together with our commitment to remove the
fuel subsidy in 2017, these, coupled with improved revenue collection and expenditure controls and
management, particularly on the wage bill, are expected to close the financing gap in 2017.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
29.

Monetary policy will continue to be geared toward price stability. In 2016, inflationary

pressures are projected to be driven by ongoing depreciation. While we cannot prevent shocks to
domestic prices, BSL will remain attentive to potential risks from second round price pressures, and
will tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve our inflation target.
30.

BSL will continue to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy operations, as well as

liquidity management, through more active participation in the secondary market and the use of
money market operations, via lending and standing deposit facilities. Together, these would allow
banks to better manage their liquidity. BSL will also strengthen its own capacity to forecast liquidity
on a daily basis, with close cooperation from the Treasury. To support these efforts the Accountant
General Department of MoFED will produce a daily cash flow table. In addition, BSL will implement
the recommendations of the recently concluded MCM technical assistance missions on monetary
policy framework and operations.
31.

BSL will consider the following reforms to enhance its monetary policy operations. First,

BSL will seek to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system, including by undertaking the
previously planned level of secondary market transactions for 2016. In this context, it will be
important to continue efforts to strengthen liquidity management, including by improving liquidity
forecasting. Second, the BSL will also consider introducing reserve requirements on foreign
currency deposits, in part to eliminate the bias in favor of foreign currency deposits. Third, the BSL
will gradually migrate from weekly sales of foreign exchange, reserving their interventions to efforts
to offset excessive volatility in the exchange rate. Overall, monetary policy should be geared to
keeping inflation broadly unchanged at around 9.5 percent.
32.

Vulnerabilities in our banking system have increased, in part due to the pressures created

by Ebola and the iron ore crisis. Since January 2015, we have taken steps to address the problems in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

SIERRA LEONE

two large banks, Rokel Commercial Bank (RCB) and Sierra Leone Commercial Bank (SLCB). These
banks also have high NPL ratios (75 and 48 percent, respectively at end 2015), due to problems in
credit review, connected and concentrated lending, and some delays in government payments to
contractors, which resulted in these contractors being late in payments on loans. As part of the
resolution, in December 2015, advertisements were placed for a diagnostic study of the two
institutions. Expressions of interests were received from five vendors, and the proposals are under
review. Our plan is to award the contract by end-June, with the aim of completing the studies by
end-September.
33.

To address the more general NPL problem in the banking system, BSL has taken several

remedial regulatory and supervisory actions. First, a Loan Write-Off Policy Directive has been issued
to banks, which would allow them to clean their balance sheets. The directive took effect in
December 2015. In addition, the introduction of the Borrowers and Lenders Act 2014 and the
planned Collateral Registry and Credit Administration Bills should improve the standards of credits.
Some supervisory actions have also been taken, such as putting a cap on lending or a temporary
moratorium on lending for some banks, and ensuring adequate provisions on non-performing
facilities. To further strengthen our supervisory abilities, we have requested that the IMF’s MCM
department provide us with a long-term resident expert in banking supervision.

Borrowing Policies and Financing of the Poverty Reduction Strategy
34.

Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the risk of debt distress remains moderate.

Compared to the last program review, vulnerabilities have now reduced helped by the resumption
of iron ore exports and ambitious fiscal revenue measures. However, given the uncertain outlook,
particularly in the iron ore sector, the government is committed to maintaining prudent borrowing
policies, and will give priority to grants and concessional borrowing to finance investment projects.
Moreover, the level of public debt and the associated debt service payments are crowding out key
priority expenditures necessary for supporting the post Ebola socio-economic recovery. In this
regard, Government will work with World Bank to seek additional debt relief from commercial
creditors. Finally, only the most critical projects, for which grants and concessional financing are not
available, will be undertaken with non-concessional financing, and then only after ensuring that the
resultant debt will not harm the country’s debt sustainability. We will ensure that the net present
value of proposed external borrowing is within the program limits and consult the IMF staff before
proceeding with any proposed external borrowing.

35.

Borrowing from the Government securities market will be guided by the medium-term

debt management strategy. The government will continue to signal its borrowing needs through
the publication of a quarterly borrowing calendar. Actual borrowing will not deviate from the
calendar by more than 10 percent plus or minus.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS
36.

Considering emerging fiscal pressures, the immediate focus of the structural reform

agenda is to implement new revenue and expenditure measures that would immediately moderate
the risks to the 2016 fiscal program. For the remainder of the ECF program, we will take advantage
of the resumption of TA support following the end of Ebola to accelerate the implementation of
measures originally programmed for 2014 and 2015. These are on public finance management;
monetary and financial sector policies; strengthening economic data collection and reporting; and
improving the business environment. In addition, attention will be placed on supporting economic
diversification through private sector development.
37.

During the rest of the program, we will continue the implementation of previously agreed

reforms aimed at reducing discretionary waivers and broadening of the tax base. Key measures are
as follows: (i) preparing a quarterly report on duty waivers granted with a view to enhancing the
scrutiny of duty waiver requests; and continue our policy of requiring parliamentary approval of any
new waivers; and (ii) review, by end-June 2016, the consolidated tax and non-tax obligations for
mining companies, and prepare a list of all expired mining agreements (structural benchmark).
Following resolution of the contentious issues in the PFM Bill and its passage, we will (iii) establish
the Treasury Single Account, by end-June 2016 (structural benchmark); (iv) establish the Natural
Resource Fund, by end-June 2016 (structural benchmark); and (v) submit a new Tax
Administration Bill to parliament, by end-June 2016 (structural benchmark). The Act would
improve compliance with tax obligations by harmonizing administrative provisions and updating
them to reflect current approaches in tax administration.
38.

The late passage of the Finance Act 2016 meant that some of the measures could not be

implemented in the first quarter of 2016. Following Presidential ascent to the bill, NRA will
commence the implementation of key provisions contained therein. These include: i) elimination of
exemptions and waivers that have not been approved by Parliament, including for MDAs;
ii) increase in PAYE rate for top earners (of Le 2.0 million per month) from 30 percent to 35 percent;
iv) increase in withholding tax on management and technical fees from 10 percent to 15 percent;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

SIERRA LEONE

and v) introduction of a national health insurance levy of 0.5 percent on the value of all government
contracts in support of the proposed National Health Insurance Scheme.
39.

In the second half of 2015, NRA implemented the Short Term Revenue Improvement

Project (STRIP) which improved GST compliance. In addition, procedures and processes at the
Customs Service Department were continuously monitored to reduce revenue leakages and correct
inefficiencies. Going forward, implementation of phase II of STRIP measures will focus on GST
compliance, compliance of large and medium taxpayers, reorganization of rental income tax
administration, special and provincial audits, and target top contractors. In particular, attention will
focus on:


Curbing fraud and tax evasion by building capacity for specialized revenue audits, especially
in the mining, financial and telecommunication sectors;



Implementing the Small Tax Payer Preparer Scheme to add flexibility in compliance
management of the hard–to-tax sector;



Developing and implementing a revenue accounting and reconciliation system for effective
reconciliation of transit accounts in the commercial banks and the Central Bank;



Improving the regulation and capacity of Clearing and Forwarding Agents;



Expanding on the existing automation drive to include online submission of domestic tax
returns and automate non-tax revenue payments especially for mining revenues;



Rolling out the enhanced DTIS software to transit banks to capture tax payments and issue
receipts on time; and enhance the ASYCUDA++ by implementing its remaining modules;



Improving GST compliance through the application of a penalty of Le 5.0 million on each
unauthorized receipt issued by a GST registered business other than that provided or
certified by the National Revenue Authority.

40.

Furthermore, the NRA will continue to strengthen implementation of administrative

measures during 2016–18. It will implement a new Revenue Administration Act with consistent and
simplified administrative provisions and rewrite the parent Acts to reflect consequential
amendments. Key initiatives planned include:

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE



Use of electronic cash registers for GST registered vendors which will interface with the
Online Tax System and allow real time capture of transactions to enhance GST compliance
as well as reduce under-declarations;



Expand on current automation drive of tax administration, including the introduction of an
integrated tax administration system; migration from ASYCUDA++ to advanced ASYCUDA
World; (Structural Benchmark);



Improve cargo clearance through construction of cargo inspection facility at the sea port;



Improve customs valuation by collaborating with the cargo tracking company through
access to their cargo update and pricing database;



Use mobile scanners for non-intrusive methods of import examination;



Improve tax collection through modern technology, including further digitization; and



Tackle transfer pricing advances through increased collaboration with international bodies
and partner with MOFED to develop a transfer pricing policy.

41.

Our expenditure reforms will focus on speedy response to the management of expenditure

overruns and containing risks to the 2016 budget, as enunciated in paragraph 24. The wage bill
remains a key risk, and the revised medium-term wage and pay reform strategy paper has already
been submitted to Cabinet. Given our inability to meet the end-March deadline for its adoption,
Cabinet will adopt the recommendations, by June 2016 (structural benchmark). We remain
committed to preparing the rolling Treasury Cash Flow Table consistent with the budget and the
semi-annual report on PIP execution on a continuous basis, and will now change the frequency
from monthly to bi-weekly, so as to improve traction (structural benchmark).
42.

Implementation of measures aimed at containing the risks in the financial sector will be

accelerated in 2016. Given the delay in finalizing guidelines with Discount Houses, the primary
dealer system for the government securities market will now be operational by end-June 2016
(structural benchmark). To improve the overall effectiveness of monetary operations, BSL has
commenced the operation of a daily liquidity forecasting framework which is linked to daily
monetary operations actions (structural benchmark). BSL has also completely moved to the
wholesale foreign exchange auction system since March 2015. BSL will finalize operational rules for
the interbank foreign exchange market (structural benchmark).

43.

In the area of banking supervision, reform measures will focus on addressing the

challenges in the State-owned banks. Even though the process for conducting the diagnostic audit
of Sierra Leone Commercial Bank and Rokel Commercial Bank was initiated, the study could not be
completed by end-March due to delays in securing World Bank approval of the Terms of reference.
As this issue has now been addressed, we are committed to contracting out the study by end-June
2016 (structural benchmark), with the aim of completing the study by end-September. In addition,
financial sector reform will focus on priority areas defined in the road map for the implementation
of risk-based supervision completed in June 2014. They include the preparation of an internal
contingent manual to guide identification and step-by-step supervisory actions in the event of
specific or systemic banking sector distress, by end-June 2016 (structural benchmark).
44.

The structural reforms aimed at supporting private sector development were implemented

as planned. The setting up of registry of moveable collateral was completed in the first quarter of
2016, though the registry did not take off because of delay in procurement of hardware. The
business process reengineering for customs single clearance window was completed by endDecember 2015, marking an important step towards the introduction of a one-stop window that
will contribute to improving the business environment.
45.

Following problems discovered in our balance of payments (BOP) data during the joint

3rd and 4th review mission, we have received technical assistance and we await the report so as to
implement the recommendations. We have also benefited from technical assistance to strengthen
our consumer price index. We will continue to welcome Fund’s assistance in significantly
strengthening our BOP and other economic and financial sector data.

PROGRAM MONITORING
46.

The program is monitored on a semi-annual basis, through quantitative targets (Tables 1, 2

and 3) and structural benchmarks (Tables 3 and 4). Quantitative targets for end-June 2016 are
performance criteria. Though the Sixth and final review under the ECF program was initially set to
be completed on or after September 10, 2016, the change in scheduled reviews as a result of Ebola
outbreak has made it difficult to keep to the time line. Therefore, we will request for a two-month
extension, to December 21, 2016, to give sufficient time to complete the review and the sixth review
is expected to be completed by this date.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Freetown, June 16, 2016
INTRODUCTION
1.

This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Sierra Leonean authorities and

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative performance
criteria (PCs) and structural benchmarks (SBs) for the program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. Unless otherwise specified,
all quantitative PCs and indicative targets (ITs) will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from
the beginning of the period.
2.

Program exchange rates.1 For the purpose of the program, foreign currency denominated

values for 2016 will be converted into Sierra Leonean currency (leone) using a program exchange
rate of Le 5639.10/US$ and cross rates as of end December 2015.2

SIERRA LEONE

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Bank of Sierra Leone
3.

Definition. Unless otherwise noted, gross foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of

Sierra Leone (BSL) are defined as reserve assets of the BSL. Reserve assets are defined in the IMF’s
Balance of Payments Manual (5th ed.) and elaborated in the reserve template of the Fund’s
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data Template. They exclude
foreign assets not readily available to, or controlled by, the monetary authorities.
4.

Adjustment clauses. The floor on the change in gross foreign exchange reserves will be

adjusted (a) downward (upward) by U.S. dollars equivalent cumulative shortfall (excess) in
programmed external budgetary assistance3; (b) downward (upward) for any cumulative shortfall
(excess) in the U.S. dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the ECF arrangement; and
(c) upward (downward) for any increase (decrease) in BSL short-term (one year or less in original
maturity) foreign currency-denominated liabilities (to residents and nonresidents).

B. Net Domestic Assets of the BSL
5.

Definition. Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BSL are defined as the end-period stock of the

reserve money less the end-period stock of net foreign assets calculated at the program exchange
rates. Reserve money includes currency issued (equal to currency outside banks plus cash in vaults),
deposits of commercial banks with the BSL and the BSL liabilities to other private sector. Net foreign
assets of the BSL are defined as gross foreign exchange reserves (defined above) minus foreign
liabilities. Foreign liabilities are defined as foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BSL to
nonresidents (excluding a foreign liability to China of Le 35 billion relating to a legacy clearing
account for a previous bilateral trading agreement) and the outstanding use of Fund credit. For
program purposes, foreign liabilities exclude SDR allocation, and debt relief from the Catastrophe
Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust granted in 2015.
6.

Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on changes in NDA of the BSL will be adjusted upward

(downward) by the leone value of the shortfall (excess) in the external budgetary assistance—the
upward adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of US$20 million.

3

External budgetary assistance is defined as program grants and program loans, excluding HIPC assistance.

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

C. Net Domestic Bank Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
7.

Definition. NCG refers to the net banking system’s claims on the central government as

calculated by the BSL. It is defined as follows:
a. the net position of the government with commercial banks, including: (a) treasury bills;
(b) treasury bearer bonds; and (c) loan and advances of commercial banks to the
government; less government deposits in commercial banks;
b. the net position of the government with the BSL, including: (a) treasury bills and bonds,
excluding holdings of special bonds provided by government to cover BSL losses
(Le 357.5 billion) and to increase its capital (Le 75 billion); (b) ways and means; and (c) any
other type of direct credit from the BSL to the government, including the special on-lending
arrangements relating to the augmentation of access under the ECF arrangement in 2014
2015 and 2016; less (a) central government deposits; and (b) any debt relief received,
notably HIPC, MDRI and relief deposits, as well as debt relief under the CCR Trust.
8.

Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on changes in NCG will be adjusted (a) upward by the

leone value of the shortfall in external budgetary assistance—the upward adjustment will be capped
at the equivalent of US$20 million; (b) downward (upward) by the excess (shortfall) in the leone

9.

Data source. The data source for the above will be the series “Claims on Government (net)”,

submitted to the IMF staff and reconciled with the monthly monetary survey prepared by the BSL.

Definition of Central Government. Central government is defined for the purposes of this

memorandum to comprise the central government and those special accounts that are classified as
central government in the BSL statement of accounts. The National Social Security and Insurance
Trust and public enterprises are excluded from this definition of central government.

D. External Payment Arrears of the Public Sector
11.

Definition. External payment arrears of the public sector are defined to include all

debt-service obligations (interest and principal) arising from loans contracted or guaranteed by the
public sector. For the purposes of this PC, the public sector comprises the central government,
regional government, all public enterprises and the BSL. The non-accumulation of external arrears is
a continuous performance criterion during the program period. For the purposes of this

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

performance criterion, external arrears are obligations that have not been paid on due dates (taking
into account the contractual grace periods, if any). Excluded from this PC are those debts subject to
rescheduling or restructuring, or are under litigation. This PC will apply on a continuous basis.

E. Present Value of New External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Public Sector with an Original Maturity of One Year or More
12.

Definition. The present value (PV) of public external debt is equal to the sum of all future

debt service payments (principal and interest), discounted to the present using a discount rate of
5 percent. The PV is calculated using the IMF concessionality calculator and will be based on the
loan amount contracted in a given year. Specifically, it will be assumed that all new loans contracted
are fully disbursed at the time when they are contracted. For loans with a grant element of zero or
below zero, the PV will be set equal to the nominal value of the loan. The ceiling on the PV of new
external debt will be applied on a continuous basis from July 1, 2015.
13.

New external debt is defined as all forms of new debt with original maturity of one year or

more contracted or guaranteed by the public sector (see paragraph 11 for definition of public
sector) based on the residency of the creditor. The external debt definition applies not only to debt
as defined in the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision
No. 12274 (00/85), August 24, 2000, Point 8, as revised on August 31, 2009, (Decision No. 14416(09/91)) but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
For the purposes of this PC, the “public sector” is defined as in paragraph 11 above.
14.

For program purposes, the debt is deemed to have been contracted when it is signed by the

government of Sierra Leone. Excluded from this PC are disbursements from the IMF and those debts
subject to rescheduling. The government will report any planned external borrowing and its terms to
Fund staff before external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government. The government’s
current borrowing plan is attached in Table 1.

Annex. Implementation of the Revised Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 8 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000, which reads as follows: “(a) For the
purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time;
these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.
Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of
money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from
the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until
sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases,
i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or
more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt
is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during
the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered
debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt”. (c) Excluded from
this performance criterion are normal import-related credits, disbursements from the IMF, and those
debts subject to rescheduling arrangements.”

Appendix II. Sierra Leone Macro-Financial Pilot

INTRODUCTION
1.

Sierra Leone’s financial sector operates in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

After a dozen years of strong growth due to booming commodity prices and good polices,
Sierra Leone was hit by two shocks since the second half of 2014: (i) the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
epidemic and (ii) sharply declining iron ore prices. Though Sierra Leone has been declared Ebolafree, the country continues to face difficult economic challenges, as the decline in iron ore prices has
led to a consequent collapse in GDP, exports, and fiscal revenues. Growth declined dramatically from
4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.1 percent in 2015. The fiscal deficit widened to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015
from 4.1 percent in 2014. The Leone depreciated 12 percent against the US dollar over 2015.
Banking sector vulnerabilities have also increased, in part caused by Ebola and the iron ore crisis.
2.

At the same time, weaknesses in the financial sector have become a major impediment

to Sierra Leone’s economic progress. These weaknesses come in two forms: concerns about the
financial soundness of the banking system and the exceedingly low levels of credit available. Seven
out of thirteen banks suffer from non-performing loans (NPLs) beyond 10 percent, excessive
exposure to large borrowers, and other challenges.
3.

Against this backdrop, the themes of this macro-financial analysis focus on

strengthening financial stability and unlocking the potential macro-financial synergies.
Specifically, staff and the authorities agreed that the focus of the macro-financial pilot should be on
the following areas: (i) Assessing and explaining the financial landscape and vulnerabilities in
Sierra Leone; and (ii) spelling out the linkages between the various components of the story: fiscal
dominance, fiscal arrears, NPLs, banking supervision, governance and management of state-owned
banks, and the extremely low credit to GDP ratio.

FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE AND VULNERABILITIES
4.

The financial sector in Sierra Leone is dominated by banks, with two state-owned

banks playing a significant role. At end-2015, assets of the commercial banks represented around
20 percent of GDP. The two state-owned banks account for about one-third of total banking system
assets, in a financial system dominated by 13 commercial banks. In addition to commercial banks,
there are 17 community banks, 12 microfinance institutions,2 two discount houses, one mortgage

finance company, and one leasing company. The other nonbank financial institutions include
insurance companies, security dealers, a stock exchange, 50 foreign exchange bureaus, and a
pension fund.
5.

Banks’ asset quality has deteriorated in recent years, partly reflecting the effects of the

Ebola outbreak and crisis in the mining sector.
At end-2015, there were significant problems with

mid-2015. Though the NPL ratio declined sharply

to around 32 percent at end 2015, the amounts of
outstanding loans and provisions have hardly
changed (Figure 1 and Table 1). This may indicate
that at least part of the decline in NPLs was
achieved through issuance of new loans to pay off
overdue loans. Poor loan quality reflects

The asset quality of Sierra Leone’s banking sector remains much poorer than

benchmarks. The NPL ratios of Sierra Leone’s banks have been much higher than benchmarks3
(Figure 3). The poor asset quality was mainly driven by the two state-owned banks. The NPL ratios of
the two state banks stood at 74 and 48 percent, respectively, at end-2015.

The peer countries include Liberia, Guinea, Togo, Benin, and Burkina Faso. The expected median is a statistical
benchmark, based on the country’s structural characteristics (Erik Feyen, Katie Kibuuka, and Diego Sourrouille (2015)).

the banking system. One arises with excess
exposure to large borrowers. The top five
borrowers account for 35 percent of total gross
loans (Figure 4). Deposits are also highly
concentrated. The financial sector also faces
problems in valuing and realizing collateral, as

fisheries. On the monetary side, there are
concerns regarding the pressures on the foreign exchange rate, as well as liquidity management and
monetary policy implementation, specifically the handling of inflationary pressures. Both in isolation
and in totality, the risks emanating from each of these sectors warrant a solid financial stability
monitoring framework.

MACRO-FINANCIAL LINKAGES
8.

Figure 5 shows the overview of the linkages between the financial sector and other

sectors. The financial sector includes the central bank, commercial banks, and non-bank financial
institutions. The commercial banks take deposits from households and the corporate sector. The
commercial banks lend to the central government almost twice as much as to the private sector.
Commercial banks even place more money abroad (external sector) than they lend to the private
sector. Commercial banks’ net claims on the government, NFA, and credit to the private sector
accounts for 38, 26, 20 percent of their assets, respectively.

The increasing shift to domestic financing at very high costs and increased fiscal dominance in the
banking sector could produce a self-reinforcing vicious circle.
10.

The system is significantly dollarized. Net foreign assets of commercial banks are more

than 25 percent larger than total credit to the private sector. Foreign currency deposits account for
32 percent of total deposits. Local currency deposits are subjected to a 12 percent reserve
requirement, while foreign currency deposits are not subject to a reserve requirement. This
contributes to a preference for holding foreign currency deposits.
11.

Banks are also failing to serve the key function of providing credit to the private

sector. As noted above, total banking system
credit to the private sector stands below
5 percent of GDP. This means that, for most
private sector businesses, credit is unlikely to
be attainable. Risk-weighted capital adequacy

CONCLUSIONS
12.

A comprehensive and sequenced reform roadmap is warranted to address the

financial sector vulnerabilities and unlock the macro-financial synergies in Sierra Leone. Based
on the urgency of the issues, the following sequence of reforms is advisable: The first priority is to
90

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

address the two problem banks. The second priority is to address the NPLs of other banks. The third
priority is to create an enabling environment for banking sector development. This first priority
should be carried out immediately, the second priority should be done in the short-term framework
(within one year), and the third priority should be done in the medium term.


Ensuring swift completion of the independent diagnostic studies of the two largest banks,
and then aggressively addressing the findings of those studies, will be important to
improving the health of the banking system.



Intensifying efforts to strengthen banking supervision to increase the health of the banking
system. For example, the BSL should review the situation of other banks with either high
NPLs, or violations of prudential regulations, and ensure that those banks take necessary
steps meet the prudential requirements.



Adopting reforms to improve the enabling environment for financial sector development. In
this regard, the introduction of a registry of movable collateral is welcome. The authorities
are encouraged to accelerate efforts aimed at making this registry operational. It will also be
important to introduce unique identification numbers, which are essential to enable the
credit reference bureau to be effective. Furthermore, it is important to promote private
sector development so that there will be more bankable projects. In addition, it is advisable
to introduce a reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits, while lowering the reserve
requirement on domestic currency deposits, so that the net impact is no change in required
reserves. Finally, the authorities should minimize fiscal arrears to eliminate one source of
NPLs of banks.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim.
5

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of 2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for debt relief.

Safeguards Assessment:
The 2015 safeguards assessment found that despite the Ebola epidemic, the Bank of Sierra Leone
(BSL) has maintained essential operations and related controls. Governance bodies were
reconstituted without delay, following the expiration of the previous terms, and the Audit
Committee continued its oversight of BSL operations. However, the modernization of the internal
audit function, recommended by an independent external quality assessment, has not been fully
completed. While financial statements continue to be prepared and audited in accordance with
international standards, audits are not completed within the statutory deadline.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
For customs valuation purposes and for official transactions, the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)
calculates an official exchange rate every Friday morning as the weighted average of the auction
rate, the commercial bank mid-rate, and the bureau mid-rate in the previous week. Commercial
banks may buy foreign exchange from and sell it to individual customers and may trade among
themselves or with the BSL on a freely negotiable basis. As of December 31, 2015, the BSL mid rate
was Le 5,639.1=US$1, which is also the new Program exchange rate. As of September 30, 2015, the
BSL mid rate was Le 5,292.6=US$1.
Sierra Leone’s de jure exchange rate regime is classified as floating, with the value of the leone
determined by the market. Furthermore, effective November 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified to ‘floating’ from a ‘stabilized arrangement’.
With effect December 14, 1995, Sierra Leone has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Sierra Leone maintains one multiple currency practice
subject to Fund jurisdiction arising from the applied multiple-price Dutch auction system, as there is
no formal mechanism in place to prevent spreads of effective rates between winning bids from
exceeding 2 percent.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 16, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in national
accounts, monetary, and external sector statistics. A major and sustained improvement in the coverage and
timeliness of economic data will require greater interagency coordination and restructuring of the institutional
framework.
National Accounts: Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) produces and disseminates GDP estimates by activity in value
and constant prices of 2006, according to the 1993 SNA. Under the DFID-funded project annual GDP estimates
have been improved, especially regarding the compilation of construction, estimation of informal sector
activity, measurement of government services, agricultural production, household final consumption, and
constant price gross domestic product (GDP). Remaining issues concern developing better data sources for
agricultural and mineral production, and generally continuing the improvement of informal sector
measurement. However, shortages of resources and staff continue to pose major constraints to the statistical
development undertaken by SSL.
Price Statistics: The SSL compiles the CPI monthly and publishes it with a lag of about three weeks. It has been
rebased to 2007 using the 2007 Sierra Leone integrated household survey and continues to cover the capital
city and three main districts. While a national CPI is being compiled, the authorities continue to publish the old
CPI (1992=100). They have requested technical assistance for the preparation and adoption of a single index.
Technical assistance mission last visited Freetown in May 2016 to improve the computation of the consumer
price index, CPI. The authorities are working to improve the calculation methods for the CPI and procedures to
aggregate regional CPIs to obtain the national index.
Regarding the new PPI, the Authorities have developed the index weights, selected a representative sample of
establishments, and selected representative products and transactions for price collection. A work plan, in the
form of Project Framework Summary, was drafted and agreed with the authorities for the preparation of this
new PPI.
Government Finance Statistics: The budget reporting system was established with assistance from the
Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. Monthly cash flow data on central government budgetary revenue,
current expenditure, and financing are provided. The transaction coverage of the central government
budgetary cash flow is incomplete. There is an urgent need for more timely and accurate data on foreignfinanced development projects. Reports on implementation of the development budget and its financing are
currently not produced in a format that is suitable for budget analysis because the necessary data are not
available.
The authorities are currently considering the introduction of a flash reporting system for government
expenditure in general and for foreign aid-financed projects, in particular. As part of the GDDS regional project
for Anglophone African countries, work has been undertaken to reconcile fiscal and monetary data and to
improve the coverage and classification of the two data sets. With the current drive towards decentralization
and the growing role of local government, there is an urgent need to compile and monitor the operations (and
financial balance sheet data) for the consolidated general government.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

Financial sector surveillance: Sierra Leone does not participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment
Survey (CDIS), Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs)
databases.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The main components of the central bank balance sheet are available daily
and weekly under the early warning system on key financial targets. The full monetary survey is compiled by
the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) with a lag of about six weeks; it has comprehensive coverage of commercial
banks.
Progress has been made by the BSL in the compilation of monetary data. The BSL, with assistance from STA,
has completed the migration to standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other depository
corporations (ODCs). However, there is a need to expand the coverage of monetary and financial statistics by
including data on other financial institutions.
External sector statistics: The BSL is responsible for compiling BOP and IIP statistics, which are currently
prepared on an annual basis. Primary data sources are administrative-based data (BSL own records, line
ministries, and Customs and Excise Department (Customs) records), partner-country and international
organizations data, and the annual survey of major companies for estimates on services, income, and financial
flows relating to direct, portfolio, and other investments.
Technical Assistance mission last visited Freetown in March 2016 to improve the compiling and computation of
balance of payments and external debt statistics. This mission was part of a United Kingdom Department for
International Development – Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative on improving balance of payments
statistics, conducted by an expert reporting to STA.
External transactions are characterized by a large volume of activities in the informal sector. Trade data include
some estimates for unrecorded diamond exports—by deducting official diamonds export figures from trading
partners’ official diamonds imports from Sierra Leone. Coverage issues also exist for services, primary and
secondary income, and capital and financial accounts.
Information on official grant and loan receipts is of generally good quality and is prepared by the IMF African
Department (AFR) staff on the basis of contacts with the authorities and donor agencies. Data on private
financial flows should be improved; Information on financial transactions of banks are obtained directly from
commercial bank records; entries are estimated as differences in amounts of outstanding foreign assets and
liabilities of commercial banks and may thus include valuation and other changes.
While the authorities are producing data on the IIP, the coverage as well as the consistency with BOP data
should be improved. There is a critical need to improve the quality and coverage of Balance of Payment. The
recent double counting of mineral resources exports, the revision of which generated large historical errors,
makes BOP da even less reliable. On this regard, the BSL has strongtly requested TA to strengthen the
capacity to undertake the independent survey to validate BOP data and to design a program to significantly
strengthen the BOP data collection and forecasting.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Sierra Leone is participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Data are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, with the most recent data
referring to 2012, but no sub-annual data are reported for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics.
The BSL started reporting monetary data in the SRF-format to the IMF in April 2010.

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank in collaboration with Sierra Leonese
authorities.

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) updates the analysis presented to the Board
in November 2015, and shows that Sierra Leone’s risk of debt distress remains
moderate. The resumption of iron ore production with related export receipts, as well
as the improved fiscal revenue profile somewhat reduced the previously identified
vulnerabilities. As in the last DSA update, none of the ratios breach their respective
thresholds on a protracted basis throughout the projection period (2016–36).1
Moreover, the implied borrowing room without breaching the thresholds has also
increased. However, the authorities should continue to remain vigilant in their
borrowing plans given the uncertainty regarding the viability of iron ore production.
The economy continues to remain vulnerable to adverse shocks to exports, FDI and
nominal depreciation.

Sierra Leone’s capacity to monitor debt is adequate. The average CPIA debt policy rating (3a/3b) is 3.5.

SIERRA LEONE

KEY ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO2
1.
Short term macroeconomic projections are considerably different from the November
2015 update, but the medium term forecast remains broadly unchanged for most
macroeconomic indicators (Text Table 1). In 2016, the economy is expected to grow by some
4½ percent, mostly driven by the non-iron ore sectors. The primary deficit will be significantly lower,
particularly in the short term, driven by improved revenue profile and iron ore related fiscal revenues
as well as by reduced primary spending. However, the external debt as a share of GDP will be higher
than the November update due to the more depreciated exchange rate. It is expected to peak in
2016 and gradually decline from then onwards helped by lower current account deficit and higher
FDI inflows.
2.

The baseline macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA update are:


Economic growth is expected to average 6 percent during 2017–21, mostly driven by the
non-iron ore sectors. Compared to the November 2015 update, iron production is forecast
to gradually recover. However, the net value added from the iron ore sector will be lower as
the cost of production continues to be higher than the current WEO projection of the iron
ore price. Over the long term, growth is expected to stabilize close to the historical rates for
the non-iron ore economy of around 5.4 percent.



Inflation is projected to gradually decline over the medium term and stabilize at 5.4 percent
in the long term.



The overall fiscal deficit is projected to be smaller than the November 2015 update in the
short term, due to the above-the-line improvements to cope with the new financing realities.
It will continue to improve over the medium to long term, with the primary deficit3
decreasing from around 3.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.5 percent by 2021. It is forecast to
ease further to 0.9 percent in the long term, as a result of revenue measures and efforts to
strengthen tax administration.



The current account deficit is forecast to rise slightly from 15½ percent of GDP in 2015 to
16 percent in 2016, and start declining over the medium to long term, consistent with the
projected production profile of iron ore and other exports. Compared to the previous DSA,
the deterioration in the dynamics of the projected deficit mostly reflects the base effect in
2015. The projected import dynamics broadly reflects the expected overall real GDP growth
in the non-iron ore sector. The current account deficit will be financed by rising foreign
direct investment (FDI).

All percent figures are with respect to overall GDP.

Including grants.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE



FDI is projected to significantly increase from 6 percent of GDP in 2015 to around
12.1 percent in 2016 as most FDI projects halted during Ebola are expected to restart and
loss-making production of iron ore is expected to be financed by the parent SISG to
maintain the subsidiary’s working capital. Most of the improvement is also driven by the
recent projects in the agriculture sector. FDI is projected to stabilize at 8 percent in the
medium term.



External debt is projected to increase from 31.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 34.2 percent in
2016, due to the combination of higher IMF borrowing and more depreciated exchange rate.
External debt will still stabilize at around 21 percent of GDP in the long run.



Domestic debt is projected to rise from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2015, to around 14.6 percent
by 2021, mainly reflecting increased domestic borrowing to finance public investment. It will
then decline to 8.7 percent of GDP in the long term.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
3.
The external DSA indicates that Sierra Leone's debt sustainability remains at moderate
risk of debt distress in the baseline scenario. The dynamics of external debt accumulation is in
line with the November 2015 update. The resumption of iron ore production in early 2016 and
associated export revenues have improved the PV of debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

ratios. Both of these indicators are lower than their respective policy-dependent indicative
thresholds throughout the projection period (2016–36). The previously identified vulnerability in the
November 2015 update, where the PV of debt-to-exports ratio was close to breaching the threshold
in 2016, has now eased. Based on these two ratios, the room to accommodate more borrowing
without breaching the respective thresholds has also increased.
4.
Ratios related to fiscal revenues have also improved. An increased profile of fiscal
revenues, due to the resumption of iron ore production and other revenue related measures to close
the emerging fiscal gap in 2016, contributed to the improvement of the PV of debt-to-revenue and
debt service-to-revenue ratios. This has occurred despite the opposite impact from the more
depreciated exchange rate. These two ratios now remain significantly below their respective
thresholds both in the short and long term, much better than the November 2015 update. As a
result, the vulnerability in Sierra Leone’s debt sustainability has improved while the risk of debt
distress still remains at the moderate level. Moreover, the implied external borrowing room has also
expanded due to more favorable DSA outlook.
5.
However, the current improvement in the debt dynamics remains fragile given,
particularly, the peculiar situation in the iron ore sector. Albeit still moderate, the current rating
of the risk of debt distress hinges heavily on the continuation of iron ore-related exports and the
realization of fiscal revenue measures agreed upon the completion of the fifth program review.
Given the huge uncertainty, particularly, regarding the long-term sustainability of iron ore
production in Sierra Leone, previously identified vulnerabilities with respect to export and revenue
ratios in the November 2015 update may well resurface in the future. This potential risk calls for
continued prudence in the authorities’ borrowing policies. The increased borrowing room should
not be exhausted but used wisely and sparingly to preserve debt sustainability. Finally, even with this
improvement in the debt dynamics, it will be impossible to pursue the expensive construction of
Mamamah Airport with nonconcessional external loans.
6.
The external DSA shows that the medium to long term debt outlook remains
vulnerable to adverse shocks to several macroeconomic variables. Shocks from lower exports,
decrease in FDI inflows, and nominal currency depreciation could lead to the significant breaches of
several thresholds in the short to medium run on a protracted basis. Compared to three ratios in the
November 2015 update, four ratios now breach their respective thresholds. Despite all ratios
eventually falling below the thresholds in the long run, the realization of an adverse shock may lead
to high risk of debt distress.

B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
7.
The public DSA improved from the November 2015 update. In the baseline scenario,
both PV ratios decline over the medium to long run from their peak in 2016. This is largely driven by
improved revenue and GDP profiles. Similar to the external DSA, debt service-to-revenue ratio rises
around 2022 as nearly all external debt is publicly-owned and large repayments come due during
this time. The PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the threshold in the baseline scenario.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

8.
In most of the alternative scenarios, most ratios are expected to continue to fall in the
long run. If all macroeconomics variables remain at their historic averages, the sustainability of
public debt will significantly improve by the end of the forecast horizon, rendering the best
outcome. However, if the primary fiscal balance as a share of GDP is kept constant at the 2015 level,
all three ratios will be higher than in the baseline by 2036. In the case of PV of debt-to GDP ratio,
constant fiscal balance deteriorates the long-term public debt dynamics, while the 30 percent
currency depreciation shock prevails in terms of the magnitude of the impact.
9.
Authorities broadly agreed with the DSA. They were satisfied with the fact that Sierra
Leone’s external debt was sustainable in the medium to long term period. Despite the improvement
in the debt dynamics, the authorities reiterated their commitment to maintain prudent debt
management policies. They also reassured that the borrowing activities would continue to be within
the program, aimed at ensuring debt sustainability.

CONCLUSIONS
10.
Despite the moderate risk of debt distress, the authorities should remain prudent in
their borrowing policies. As the DSA shows, the risk of debt distress continues to be moderate,
although the vulnerabilities have somewhat eased due to the resumption of iron ore exports and
revenue-enhancing fiscal policy measures. However, the viability of iron ore production remains
uncertain, the suspension of which is a major downside risk to the DSA. Furthermore, the economy
continues to be highly vulnerable to overall exports and exchange rate depreciation shocks.
Therefore, staff reiterates the need for prudent borrowing policies, continued revenue enhancement,
sustained fiscal consolidation efforts, continued implementation of growth-enhancing structural
reforms, and promotion of economic diversification.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Sierra Leone and
Mr. Tharcisse Yamuremye, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 1, 2016
The Sierra Leonean authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and policy dialogue with
staff during the 2016 Article IV consultation and Fifth Review Under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF). The authorities found the discussions to be appropriately focused on
macroeconomic and financial sector policies, as well as structural reforms, while striking the
right balance between supporting Sierra Leone’s post-Ebola recovery while maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability. Our authorities broadly agree with the staff’s assessment
of the Sierra Leone’s economic opportunities, challenges and risks. They place high value on the
accompanying policy recommendations while pursuing the implementation of the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) program. As such, the authorities request Executive Directors’ support in
concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation, and the completion of the fifth review under the
ECF. In addition, they request support for two-month extension of the ECF arrangement, as a
result of the change in scheduled reviews due to Ebola outbreak, to allow time to complete the
final review.
Performance Under the ECF Arrangement
The authorities have made steady progress in the implementation of the program under a
challenging environment. All end-December 2015 quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets were met. Despite the extremely difficult environment, the authorities
implemented key structural reforms including preparation of a monthly rolling Treasury Cash
Flow table consistent with the 2015 budget, preparation of a semi-annual report on Public
Investment Plan (PIP), and the Parliament recently adopted the PFM Act. The authorities remain
committed to accelerate structural reforms to achieve program’s goals.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
Since mid-2014, Sierra Leone’s economy experienced twin shocks related to the Ebola Epidemic
and lower iron ore prices. Consequently, growth declined sharply from 4.6 percent in 2014 to
-21 percent in 2015. Domestic currency depreciated 22 percent against the US dollar between
2014 and end-2015. A combination of 20 percent imports decline with strong current transfers
have resulted to improvement in the current account deficit from 20.1 percent of non-iron ore
GDP in 2014 to about 15.5 percent in 2015. Inflation increased on average from 8.3 percent in
2014 to 9 percent in 2015, due to the exchange rate depreciation, drop in agriculture production
and disruption in cross border trade with neighboring Liberia and Guinea.
The outlook for 2016 and beyond is still challenging despite the resumption of iron ore
production. Given lower international iron ore price and the uncertainty in mining production,
the economic recovery in the near term will be driven by non-iron ore and agriculture sectors.
Therefore, the implementation of the Government’s post-Ebola Recovery Strategy should boost

2
growth in non-iron ore sectors. Real GDP is projected to grow by 4.3 percent while the non-iron
ore economy is forecasted to grow by 3.3 percent in 2016. Given the uncertainty in the mining
sector, agriculture, construction, transport and trade are expected to be key sectors contributing
to growth in 2017. Inflation is projected to 9.5 percent in 2016 and 9 percent in 2017. The
current account deficit is projected to deteriorate from 15.5 percent in 2015 to 16.6 percent in
2016, due to declining current transfers and higher iron ore-related imports of goods and
services.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are implementing measures to ensure fiscal sustainability. The long-lasting
vulnerability in the iron ore sector, the decline in the budget support and the limited domestic
financing, require strong measures to increase domestic revenue mobilization and streamlining
public expenditure. In this regard, a comprehensive program of revenue enhancement and
expenditure rationalization was adopted by the Cabinet in early March 2016. On the revenue
front, the authorities are taking steps to broaden tax base, review tax exemptions including NGOs
and hotels. A committee was set up to review and recommend duty waiver applications and as a
result there has been significant reduction in waivers awarded from April 2016 to date, compared
to the same period in 2015. In addition, the authorities plan to strengthen tax administration. In
this regard, they have requested a Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT)
mission from IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, in addition the NRA is participating in the IMF’s
Revenue Administration Fiscal Tool (RA-FIT). To curtail expenditure, the medium term wage
policy to reduce wage bill at 6.0 percent of GDP was presented to the Cabinet.
The authorities are committed to strengthen public financial management to mitigate fiscal risks
and improve expenditure efficiency. The recent adoption of the new PFM Act allows the
establishment of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) to improve cash management. In this
regard, connectivity has been established with 12 commercial banks and work on the ICT link at
Bank of Sierra Leone is complete. The authorities are reviewing technical requirements to close
all dormant accounts. They are waiting technical assistance from AFRITAC West 2 and the
US Office of Technical Assistance to operationalize TSA. The PFM Act will also improve
control, planning and budget execution.
Debt Management
Strengthening debt management is critical to maintain fiscal sustainability. Although debt
sustainability analysis indicates that the risk of distress remains moderate, the authorities will
maintain prudent borrowing and give priority to grants and concessional loans to finance
investment projects. As the debt service payments are crowding out key priority expenditures to
support post Ebola socio-economic recovery, the authorities will work with the World Bank to
seek additional measures including debt relief to alleviate debt pressure. Given the increasing
interest burden from domestic debt, the authorities are also seeking IMF technical assistance to
strengthen domestic debt management.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability and flexible exchange rate, while
providing adequate liquidity to the banking system. To maintain inflation in single digits, the
Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) will continue to monitor inflationary pressures and implementing
appropriate policy actions. Monetary authorities will also continue to enhance the effectiveness
of monetary policy operations and liquidity management. The BSL aims to strengthen its
capacity to forecast liquidity while implementing the recommendations of the MCM technical
assistance mission on monetary policy framework and operations. To eliminate the bias in favor
of foreign currency, the BSL would consider introducing reserve requirement on foreign
currency deposits. Furthermore, BSL is committed to limit interventions in the foreign exchange
market to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility.
Strengthening Banking System
The Ebola and the iron ore-related shocks have elevated vulnerabilities in the banking system to
which strengthening commercial banks portfolio is very critical. In this regard, the BSL has
implemented remedial measures including Loan Write-Off Policy Directive which allows banks
to clean their balance sheets. To improve the credit quality, the BSL has established the
Borrowers and Lenders Act, and plans to introduce a Collateral Registry and Credit
Administration Bills. These measures are expected to contribute to maintaining NPL at a lower
level.
In addition, supervisory actions have been stepped up, including capping lending or a temporary
moratorium on lending for some banks and ensuring adequate provisions on non-performing
loans. The authorities have requested a long-term resident expert to support their effort to
strengthen the supervisory capacity. Moreover, the BSL plans to conduct a diagnostic study of
the two large banks, Rokel Commercial Bank (RCB) and Sierra Leone Commercial Bank
(SLCB) which also have high NPL ratios and use the recommendations to improve financial

Structural Reforms
Economic diversification remains key pillar to achieve a strong and sustainable growth and
reduce poverty. In this regard, the authorities will continue to implement reforms to strengthen
the fiscal framework to provide resources for infrastructure financing needs. The authorities will
also strengthen the monetary policy framework and financial sector development to support a
diversified private sector development. To improve business environment, the authorities are

Conclusion
The twin shocks related to Ebola and Commodity crisis has constrained the trend of strong
economic growth experienced by Sierra Leone during several years after civil war. To address
economic and social problems, the authorities launched the post-Ebola Economic Recovery
Strategy transitioning back to the Agenda for Prosperity Plan in the medium term. To achieve
these objectives, the authorities remain committed to implementing sound macroeconomic
policies embedded in the Current Extended Facility Arrangement. In this regard, the authorities
will accelerate the implementation of structural reforms to boost economic diversification and
lay a solid foundation for sustainable and inclusive growth.
Finally, the authorities are requesting the Board’s support for the conclusion of the 2016 Article
IV consultation, and the completion of the fifth review under the ECF, and further support for
two-month extension of the ECF arrangement to complete the final review.
