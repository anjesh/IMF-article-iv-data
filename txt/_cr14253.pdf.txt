STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 5, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Overview. Large revenues from fishing licenses, together with substantial foreign aid,
facilitated a sizable budget surplus in the past two years but also an expansionary
budget in 2014. The large increase in budget spending is set to cause some inflationary
pressure. More importantly, the likely difficulties in unwinding the budget expansion and
potential liabilities arising from weaknesses in state-owned banks and public enterprises
make fiscal sustainability a major concern over the medium to long run.
Outlook and risks. Growth prospects are generally positive owing to several large
infrastructure projects financed by development partners that are planned to be
implemented over the medium term. Inflation is expected to rise moderately, reflecting
rapidly growing government expenditure and substantial public sector wage increases.
Near-term risks mainly stem from elevated banking sector vulnerabilities, while, over the
medium to long run, growth prospects may be hampered by the dominance of
inefficient public enterprise in the economy, uncertainty in the fisheries sector, and weak
competitiveness.
Policies. Policy discussions focused on fiscal sustainability and resource revenue
management, financial stability, and structural reforms to engender sustained, inclusive
growth. Key recommendations include:


Unwind the large budget expansion in 2014, conduct fiscal consolidation, and, over
the medium term, introduce a fiscal framework that targets a structural fiscal surplus;



Establish a regulatory framework and conduct a complete diagnosis of the banking
system as soon as feasible;



Develop a reform plan for public enterprises, with a focus to clearly define and cost
social responsibilities and enhance transparency and accountability; and



Continue to implement reforms toward inclusive growth, including through an
improved business environment, enhanced vocational training, and greater efforts to
explore job opportunities both at home and abroad.

TUVALU

CONTEXT
1.
Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most isolated countries in the world. With a
population of some 11,000 people living on 26 square kilometers, Tuvalu is more than 3,000
kilometers away from its nearest major external market (New Zealand). The country faces
tremendous challenges stemming from its remoteness, lack of scale economies, weak institutional
capacity, and, above all, climate change and rising sea levels, which threaten the country’s very
existence. (Appendix III)
2.
Income is relatively high, but the economy is fragile. Fishing revenues and foreign aid, as
well as remittances, have significantly raised living standards—absolute poverty is rare, access to
primary education is effectively universal, and per capita income is among the highest in the group
of small Pacific island countries. Nevertheless, fishing revenues and foreign aid are highly volatile
and uncertain (Appendix IV), and could experience a secular decline over the medium to long run,
while remittances have not recovered to the level prevailing before the global financial crisis mainly
as a result of limited human capacity, pointing to weak competitiveness (Appendix V). The
authorities have limited policy space to maneuver—fiscal policy is the only macro policy lever given
the use of the Australian dollar as the legal currency; there is little scope for diversifying the small
economy that is dominated by inefficient public enterprises; and the lending capacity of banks is
constrained by severe asset quality problems. These factors make it all the more important to
develop a sound fiscal policy framework, address weaknesses in banks and public enterprises, and
foster a favorable business environment for the private sector.
3.
Tuvalu holds large assets abroad and also owes substantial debt. The Tuvalu Trust Fund
(TTF), originally capitalized by development partners in 1987, aims to provide additional funding for
budget support. Holdings are global, but Australian assets are weighted heavily. The TTF is not fully
sovereign and cannot be drawn down freely: when its market value exceeds a “maintained value”
indexed to Australian CPI, the TTF Board—representing both development partners and Tuvalu
government—can decide to transfer the excess to the budget. TTF’s market value dropped markedly
during the global financial crisis, but has since recovered steadily to more than $A 140 million (3.5
times of GDP). The Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) serves as a fiscal buffer and deposit account
for development partners’ grants, and can be drawn down freely at the authorities’ discretion.
Thanks to large fiscal surpluses achieved in the past two years, CIF has been built up to more than
$A 15 million (38 percent of GDP). Meanwhile, Tuvalu’s public debt has reached 41 percent of GDP
by end-2013, with external debt—including public enterprise debt on commercial terms—
accounting for 35 percent of GDP. The debt is projected to rise sharply to 56.9 percent in 2014 on
account of a new loan agreement taken on by a fishing joint venture to finance the expansion of its
fishing capacity—the loan could, as usual, be guaranteed by the government.
4.
The authorities are cognizant of the challenges and have developed a broad reform
agenda. A policy reform matrix (PRM), formulated in consultation with development partners, has
been fleshed out in an effort to enhance governance and social development, facilitate private
sector growth, and safeguard macroeconomic stability. (Appendix II) Significant progress has been

made in the first two phases of the PRM to enhance public financial management, while measures
undertaken to rationalize social spending and strengthen public enterprises have witnessed limited
success. The authorities are designing the third phase of PRM in close consultation with
development partners.
5.
Tuvalu has entered into an electoral cycle. The general elections are expected to be held
by March 2015.

BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments
6.
Growth has been weak while inflation picked up moderately. Real GDP growth has been
volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade. Activity has benefited from increased
competition in the retail sector and a recent boom in the fisheries sector, while banking weaknesses
constrain the financial support for the private sector, and the poorly managed public enterprises
strain government finances and worsen the country’s business climate. Inflation rose to 3 percent by
end-2013, largely reflecting a pickup in nonfood inflation. It benefited from lower global food and
commodity prices, as well as trade diversification and increased retail competition, but prices rose
on account of a weakening Australian dollar.
The balance of payments has been supported by large fishing-related receipts and
official aid. Owing to the introduction of the Vessel Day Scheme and the establishment of fishing
joint ventures with Asian companies, both fishing exports and fishing license fees have more than
doubled in just a few years, with each accounting for about half of GDP now.1 Foreign aid, including
both budget support and off-budget project financing, has also hovered at around half of GDP.
However, remittances, which used to be one of the most important sources of foreign exchange
inflows, have shrunk dramatically since the global financial crisis, to 10 percent of GDP compared to
the pre-crisis levels of nearly 20 percent. Imports, which closely correlate with fiscal spending, have
been generally stable.
7.

8.
The budget achieved a substantial surplus for the second consecutive year in 2013.
Fishing license fees reached a record high in 2013 because of improved negotiating power under
the Vessel Day Scheme and increased revenues under the bilateral treaty with the U.S. government.
Tax revenue outperformed the budget target largely as a result of improved compliance following a
tax audit of public enterprises and the favorable performance of a fishing joint venture as well as a
VAT rate increase. These developments were further reinforced by higher-than-expected foreign
grants. Current spending was generally restrained, and on-budget capital spending was small,
reflecting the government’s weak implementation capacity. As a whole, the fiscal surplus reached
26.3 percent of GDP.2

The Tuvaluan government holds around 50 percent of the joint venture’s shares.
Extrabudgetary spending supported by project financing from development partners have been around 25 percent of GDP.

9.
Vulnerabilities of banks and public enterprises have further aggravated structural
weaknesses. In the unsupervised state-owned dual-bank system, asset quality remains poor as half
of the loan portfolio is nonperforming, which is caused to a large extent by government-sponsored
programs implemented a few years ago and public enterprise borrowing. Although both banks, i.e.
the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) and Development Bank of Tuvalu (DBT), have restricted their
exposure to public enterprises and made substantial provisions, an accurate estimate of capital
adequacy is impeded by the lack of a regulatory framework. The DBT—accounting for
about10 percent of banking sector assets—has made substantial losses, with its net capital depleted
from $A 2.5 million (7.2 percent of GDP) to $A 0.7 million (1.7 percent of GDP) in the past three
years. The DBT further experienced a sharp drop in deposits in 2013 as depositors were concerned
with its capacity to service obligations. Meanwhile, non-bank public enterprises, with some being
insolvent already, accumulated losses of more than 3 percent of GDP in the past few years, leaving
this sector’s total capital below 0.5 percent of GDP. (Appendix VI) The immense losses incurred by
public enterprises represent deficiencies in governance and the cost of social responsibilities.
10.
There is no sign of significant exchange rate misalignment. The real effective exchange
rate depreciated over the past year and has returned to its 10-year average on the back of a
weakening Australian dollar. However, the economy’s competitiveness remains weak, with
remoteness causing high transportation cost and isolation, and the lack of scale increasing
transaction cost. The large budget expansion could exert inflationary pressure and cause real
exchange rates to appreciate, undermining competitiveness. (Box 1)

B. Outlook and Risks
11.
Near-term risks mainly stem from banking sector vulnerabilities, while fiscal
sustainability remains a major concern over the medium to long run. Several infrastructure
projects financed by grants from development partners (amounting to more than 40 percent of
GDP) are expected to come on stream in the next three years, and may boost growth to 2.5 percent,
while weak capacity and competitiveness will continue to impede growth over the long run.3
Macroeconomic and financial risks are elevated. In the near term, the impaired balance sheet of the
DBT could further weaken its lending capacity, constitute a drag on growth in the private sector,
and, more importantly, threaten macro-financial stability and undermine business confidence. Over
the medium to long run, maintaining fiscal sustainability remains the most important challenge—the
debt sustainability analysis suggests a high risk of debt distress under the baseline; fishing revenues
are highly uncertain and face downside risks; and contingent liabilities, mostly associated with stateowned banks and public enterprises, are substantial.
12.
The external account may deteriorate over time. The large inflows of foreign grants
would be offset by rising imports as a result of increased budget spending and public investment.
With the depletion of the CIF, foreign exchange reserves are projected to decline from 9 months of

3

The spending on these large projects would be extrabudgetary.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

imports to 5 months over the medium term. The balance of payments is subject to significant risks.
Fishing license fees will likely remain buoyant over the medium term, but may decline over the long
run because of climate change and overfishing. Remittances by seafarers and seasonal workers
might weaken if the risk of protracted slower growth in advanced and emerging economies
materializes or China’s economy further slows, affecting growth and job opportunities in the Pacific
region. The impact of U.S. tapering is uncertain—the tapering could cause the Australian dollar to
further depreciate and improve Tuvalu’s competitiveness, but a disorderly tapering may increase
volatility in Australia’s asset markets where the TTF is invested, generating fluctuations in the TTF’s
market value and likely transfers to Tuvalu’s budget.
Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities generally agreed with the staff’s views on the economic outlook. They
indicated that the weak growth may result from a lack of large projects, and expect growth to pick
up in the next few years as several large projects start to be implemented. They also anticipated
balance of payments pressure in light of the uncertainty in fishing-related receipts.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The key policy agenda is to develop a medium-term fiscal framework that anchors a sustainable fiscal
policy; address risks in the banking sector by establishing a regulatory framework; enhance the
efficiency of public enterprises, and foster inclusive growth and competitiveness via continued
structural reforms.

A. Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
14.
Despite sound fiscal performance in the past two years, a dramatic expansion of
budget spending in 2014 has substantially increased risks to fiscal sustainability. The 2014
budget continues to target a surplus, with a large temporary increase of foreign grants and TTF
transfers financing a more than 20 percent

Tuvalu Cooperative Society (TCS) is owned by Tuvaluan people and used to be the main wholesaler and retailer. With increasing
competition from private retailers, the TCS was forced to terminate most of its operations after incurring large losses. The TCS
currently holds arrears of $A 2.5 million against external suppliers and domestic banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

With on-budget foreign grants returning to historical average levels, the budget would move into a
deficit from 2015 onwards and fully deplete the fiscal buffers over the medium term unless the
spending increase is unwound.
15.
Medium-term fiscal risks arise from several sources. First, tax revenue might shrink as the
tariff rates that apply to regional trade are cut under the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement
(PICTA).5 Second, there is a risk that fishing revenue might decline after its recent rapid increase as
overfishing and climate change adversely impact fishing resources. Finally, vulnerabilities in banks
and public enterprises may pose substantial liabilities to the government—bringing the capital of
insolvent non-bank public enterprises to positive would cost at least 4 percent of GDP, while the
cost of addressing banking vulnerabilities needs to be assessed under a regulatory framework. The
government’ guarantee of public enterprise debt, notably including external loans borrowed by the
fishing joint ventures, also constitutes contingent liabilities.
16.
To enhance fiscal sustainability, consolidation efforts are needed. Tax administration
should be further strengthened, including through legal actions on non-compliance, and a tax policy
review would be necessary given the uneven cost-benefit among different taxes. However, given the
narrow economic base, the scope for further increases in tax revenue is limited, and most of the
fiscal consolidation would more likely be achieved via expenditure control in the near term. To put
the fiscal policy on a sustainable footing, the government expenditure should be scaled down from
the 2014 budget level at 93 percent of GDP to about 80 percent of GDP in the next three years when
the impact of budget spending cut on growth would be offset by the implementation of large
infrastructure projects financed by development partners. To achieve this target, spending should be
largely frozen—which would bring down its share in GDP to 84 percent within three years—while a
few rapidly growing expenditures should be cut back. For example, although rolling back civil
servants’ salary increase may be difficult, expenditures on goods and services as well as grants and
subsidies—all budgeted to grow by double digits—should be put under tight scrutiny on the back
of the newly introduced procurement mechanism and the PRM framework, and be reined in to the
extent feasible. Moreover, reviving TCS would require additional financial support, which could cost
10 percent of GDP to clear arrears and regain market share. The authorities should explore more
cost effective policies to supply necessities to the outer islands. Additionally, there is considerable
room to improve the cost effectiveness of social programs such as the scholarship program and
Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS), which finances overseas treatment of Tuvaluan patients.
Last but not least, the government should refrain from providing guarantees for public enterprise
borrowing given the already high risk of debt distress.
17.
Beyond fiscal consolidation, a new medium-term fiscal framework is needed to ensure
fiscal sustainability, address procyclicality and build buffers in view of the daunting
challenges facing Tuvalu. Under this framework, the transfers between the budget, the CIF, and the
TTF should follow a clear rule anchored by a structural balance target:
5

Under PICTA, tariff rates for the trade among Pacific island countries will be cut to zero by 2015, and this rate cut would be
deferred to 2017 for the least developed countries including Tuvalu.



Targeting a structural balance would reduce expenditure fluctuation as a result of revenue
volatility. Given the weak capacity, staff suggests a simple approach to estimate the structural
revenue, where fishing license fees are adjusted to reflect their moving average. As fishing
license fees have been increasing markedly, targeting a structural balance would imply saving a
portion of these fees for the time being. Staff estimates that, with the CIF already built up to a
comfortable level, a structural surplus of 0.5-1 percent of GDP is needed to maintain fiscal
buffers and bring down the risk of debt distress from high to moderate over the medium and
long run.



To help achieve the structural balance target, the CIF should be transformed into a fiscal
stabilization fund that follows a clear rule of accumulation and withdrawal—temporary windfalls
from fishing revenues should be saved in the CIF and it can be drawn down when there is a
revenue shortfall.



The TTF should serve as a rainy day fund, with the returns on investment saved in a reserve
account for use in the event of severe adverse shocks.

18.
Marked progress has been made in strengthening public financial management.
Notably, a central procurement unit has been established, and associated regulations adopted. The
authorities also published a budget manual outlining the budget process and policies, strengthened
the monitoring of outer island budget operations, and started releasing monthly reports of budget
execution, which significantly enhanced transparency and facilitated budget control.
19.
Nevertheless, there is scope to further strengthen public financial management to
improve transparency and safeguard fiscal resources. The budget process needs to be anchored
by a sustainable medium-term fiscal framework that incorporates development objectives. The
management of fishing license fees should be streamlined, with a focus to reconcile the treasury
receipts and the sale of licenses by the Fisheries Department. Introducing a commitment control
system would further improve budget management. Over the medium term, a wage-setting
mechanism is necessary to ensure that public sector wage increases are in line with productivity
gains in the economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities shared staff’s views on fiscal sustainability risks. They worry about the
lack of transparency in the TMTS and its potential overspending, and intend to contain its cost by
establishing a comprehensive database and closely following patients’ treatment schedules. They
also agreed to carefully estimate the cost of reviving the TCS and consider alternative options as
needed. On debt sustainability, they generally concur with staff assessment, but indicate that the
contingent liabilities from fishing joint ventures are not a key concern as the joint ventures have a
favorable outlook and the probability for the government to assume their debt obligation is small.
21.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s proposal on introducing a medium-term fiscal
framework. They share the concern about revenue volatility, and support the suggestion to have
the fiscal policy anchored by a structural balance and make the TTF a rainy day fund, with its
investment returns saved in a reserve account for large adverse shocks.
22.
The authorities are committed to further enhancing public financial management. They
are developing the IT system to better reconcile fishing license fees between the Treasury and
Fisheries Department. They will also aim to further improve public financial management when
implementing the third phase of PRM.

B. Financial Stability
23.
Given substantial vulnerabilities in the banking sector, there is an urgent need to
establish a framework of banking supervision and resolution. The NBT’s financial risk appears
under control given the sound profitability as indicated by a return on assets of around 3 percent
and comfortable capital equivalent to 24 percent of total assets, although these need to be verified
under a prudent regulatory framework. The rapid deterioration of the DBT’s financial position points
to a looming solvency issue. This would imply spillover risks across the banking system, which may
be limited by the DBT’s small market share and relatively simple financial linkages, and perhaps
more importantly, result in large government liabilities: the budget would need to allocate resources
to repay the bank’s borrowing guaranteed by the government (1.4 percent of GDP). Moreover, fresh
capital may eventually need to be injected into the banking system should an assessment based on
prudent standards suggest—given the underdeveloped private sector and its limited financial
capacity as well as the unsuccessful experience of privatizing public enterprises, introducing private
capital could be challenging, and resorting to budget resources would still be likely. Going forward,
the priority is to implement a banking supervisory and regulatory framework—in particular, a Bank
Commission needs to be established and supervisors employed as soon as feasible with due regard
to controlling administrative costs. Given Tuvalu’s limited capacity and the need for arm’s-length
supervision, development partners’ support for this initiative will be crucial.6 The financial condition
of the banking sector and its implications for the economy, e.g. the cost of a possible

technical assistance as soon as feasible.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

recapitalization, should be assessed urgently on the basis of prudential standards, and a banking
resolution framework needs to be set up.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to strengthen the banking sector. They are
considering establishing the Bank Commission as stipulated by the law, and agreed with staff’s views
on the need to strengthen the banking sector, albeit with more focus on expanding banking services.

C. Public Enterprise Reform
25.
Progress has been made in enhancing the governance of public enterprises, but they
remain broadly inefficient. Staff welcomes the improved financial reporting, enforcement of the
Public Enterprise Act, and progress made in merging and privatization efforts. Nonetheless, given
their responsibilities to implement social policies, the poorly managed public enterprises are far
from operating on a commercial basis and are mostly making losses despite receiving large
government subsidies. The situation of the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC) is particularly
worrisome as fuel grants by development partners are to be phased out by end-2014, which would
add to fiscal burdens in subsidizing this corporation and make Tuvalu increasingly susceptible to
fluctuating oil prices in the global market. A recent review conducted by a third party suggests that
tariff adjustments may be inevitable to make the TEC financially viable.
26.
A reform plan is needed to put public enterprises on a sustainable footing. The reform
package should aim to enhance the enterprises’ commercial orientation and financial soundness. In
particular, there is a need to clearly define and cost their social responsibilities, which, together with
strengthened accounting and auditing practices, would enhance their transparency and
accountability. With respect to the TEC, electricity tariff rates should be reviewed periodically and
allowed to adjust to appropriately reflect operational cost and fuel price movements, and
government social policies should be directed at protecting the most affected poor.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities are committed to advancing public enterprise reform with assistance by
development partners. They are working with the Asian Development Bank on public enterprise
reform through privatization and merging, and are seeking additional technical assistance in
reviewing the operation of the Telecommunication Corporation.

D. Promoting Inclusive Growth
28.
The reform momentum should continue with a focus on promoting macroeconomic
stability and growth. The completion of the PRM I and II is commendable. Continued reform via
the initiation of PRM III is important and should focus on strengthening the fiscal framework and
addressing structural weaknesses, notably in the banking and public enterprise sectors. Rebalancing
resources toward basic and vocational education, improving gender equality in accessing training
opportunities, and enhancing infrastructure would help deliver better development outcomes and
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

strengthen competitiveness. Greater efforts are also needed to foster domestic job market and
explore employment opportunities for the labor force abroad, including through the seasonal
worker scheme in other countries of the Pacific region.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities are committed to continued reforms. Building upon the achievements
made under the first two phases of PRM, the authorities are working closely with development
partners on the design of PRM III, which may be launched in a few months and will continue to
focus on fiscal sustainability and public financial management as well as structural issues to foster
private sector development.

E. Other Issues
30.
Article XIV/VIII. At the time of joining the Fund in 2010, Tuvalu availed itself of the
transitory provisions of Article XIV, Section 2. While the exchange control regulations are quite
restrictive and prescribe approval requirements from the NBT or the Finance Minister for most
payments or transfers, staff’s understanding is that in practice, no approval is required and
payments and transfers for current international transactions are administered liberally. Staff
continues to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange system to assess jurisdictional
implications. Staff has recommended that the regulations be updated in line with current practice so
that Tuvalu can accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, although the authorities
have indicated that they have no current plans to do so.
31.
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).
Tuvalu is currently strengthening its anti-money laundering framework, based on the 2006 AML/CFT
law and benefitting from technical assistance. Tuvalu became an observer to the Asia/Pacific Group
on Money Laundering (APG) in 2014.
32.
Capacity building in government statistics remains a daunting task. Progress is being
made in a few areas such as budget execution reporting and balance of payments statistics.
However, the statistical office is understaffed, and weaknesses in national accounts statistics impede
economic analysis. Going forward, there is an urgent need to increase resources allocated to
statistical work and to strengthen training and technical assistance provided by development
partners including PFTAC.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Tuvalu has made significant strides in implementing reform policies. Tax administration,
particularly the compliance of public enterprises, and public financial management have been
strengthened. Progress has also been made in enhancing the monitoring and auditing of public
enterprises and removing civil servants from Board positions. Nevertheless, important challenges
remain.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

TUVALU

34.
Now is the time to build on the favorable budget outcome of the last two years to
further enhance fiscal sustainability. With the buildup of fiscal buffers, the budget is in a strong
position to reinforce fiscal soundness. Fiscal consolidation, particularly unwinding the 2014 budget
expansion, is crucial to put the budget on a sustainable footing. Introducing a medium-term fiscal
framework that targets a structural surplus would profoundly strengthen Tuvalu’s capacity to
manage revenue volatility, and creating more savings in the TTF would build resilience against
adverse shocks.
35.
There is considerable room to rationalize social spending. It will be prudent to
institutionalize the referral committee and closely scrutinize the medical expenses under the TMTS.
Staff also encourages the authorities to explore alternative health plans with burden sharing by
individuals, for example negotiating health insurance for its citizens, which can be purchased using
citizens’ savings at the Tuvalu National Provident Fund. For the scholarship program, targeting the
total number of students studying abroad instead of new students would make the resource
allocation more predictable and facilitate budget management.
36.
There is an urgent need to address the heightened banking risks. The increasing losses
and liquidity pressure experienced by the DBT may lead to a solvency problem. The authorities need
to develop a contingency plan for the bank’s possible failure, most importantly a resolution
framework and an estimate of associated fiscal costs. Meanwhile, measures need to be undertaken
to contain losses incurred by the bank. A complete review of the banking system should be
conducted, and a regulatory framework should be established as soon as feasible.
37.
Given the dominance of public enterprises, their financial viability is crucial to the
health of banks and fiscal sustainability. The Public Enterprise Reform and Management Unit
(PERMU), which is supposed to play a critical role in developing a reform package, should be well
staffed. At the current conjuncture, priority should be given to clearly defining public enterprises’
social responsibilities and enhancing their transparency and accountability via strengthened
accounting and auditing practices.
38.
Prudent macroeconomic policies and continued structural reforms are essential to
enhancing competitiveness and building resilience. Although there is no sign of significant
overvaluation, Tuvalu’s competitiveness remains weak, as indicated by the falling remittances from
seafarers. In this context, government spending and wage increase should be restrained to reduce
inflationary pressure and real exchange rate appreciation. Over a longer horizon, providing sound
education and vocational training opportunities, for example, by upgrading training programs at the
Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute and allowing access by women, is key to improving employment
and competitiveness. The implementation of the PRM has begun to bear fruit, and reforms in the
next phase should continue to aim at containing fiscal risks, addressing structural weaknesses in
banks and public enterprises, and enhancing the business environment for the private sector.
39.
Data shortcomings, particularly in the national accounts, hamper surveillance.
Additional resources need to be allocated to the statistical work necessary for surveillance and
policymaking.

Box 1. Tuvalu: External Sector and Exchange Rate Assessment1
Tuvalu’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has returned to its historical level. The REER has
depreciated by about 8 percent since its recent peak in early 2013. The real depreciation was mainly
driven by the weakening of the Australia dollar, the
International Comparison: Real Effective
legal currency in Tuvalu. Historically, Tuvalu’s REER

has moved closely with that of Australia, but has been

There is no sign of significant exchange rate
misalignment, but loose policies could increase
the risk of overvaluation over the medium term.
Benefiting from lower global food and commodity
prices, as well as increased trade diversification and
retail competition, inflation in Tuvalu has been below

trading partners’ inflation. However, the expected sizable increase in public sector wages would boost
domestic demand, widen the trade deficit, and exert upward pressure on inflation and real exchange rate
appreciation.

Reserves appear sufficient, but would decline in the medium term. The significant increase in the
CIF as a result of fiscal surplus in 2012 and 2013 is estimated to push reserves up to around nine months
of imports. In the medium term, however, the fiscal
balance is expected to move into a widening deficit
on the back of stagnated fishing license fees and a
loose control on expenditure, which will cause the CIF
to be fully depleted by 2020 and a rise of imports. As

Tuvalu’s competitiveness remains weak. Remoteness causes high transportation costs and isolation,
and the lack of scale increases transaction cost. Moreover, insufficient human capital impedes Tuvaluans
to explore overseas job opportunities, with declining remittances pointing to structural weaknesses. In
this connection, improving the business climate and taking an innovative approach to exploring growth
opportunities, including strengthening education and training, are particularly important in the long run.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix III. Tuvalu—Climate Change—The Economic Impact on
Pacific Islands Economies1
Climate change poses substantial challenges to small island economies in the Pacific.2
Estimates suggest that sea levels in the Pacific could rise by as much as 1.2 meters to 1.7 meters
before 2100, which would lead to significant declines in land area. Moreover, El Niño and La Niña
events could also increase by over 40 percent in
the Pacific, leading to a rise in the frequency and

Estimates suggest climate change could inflict
losses to the Pacific region amounting to 2.2 to
3.5 percent of GDP per year. Given a 2-4 C° temperature increase, projected economic losses
amount to US$1 billion in damages to water resources.4 Agriculture could account for one-third to
one-half of total economic losses caused by climate change. These effects would be acutely felt in
Tuvalu where more than 60 percent of the total land area is devoted to agricultural production.
Fisheries will also be affected by more acidic oceans and degraded fish habitats, which will lower the
yields of some species and cause the location of
fish resources to shift.

Appendix IV. Tuvalu—Pacific Islands—Are Fishing Resources
Renewable?1
The Pacific islands region is the home to some of the last healthy tuna populations in the
world. The Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) contains the world’s largest stock of tuna
and accounts for more than half of the global tuna catch. The value of tuna catch in this region has
almost doubled since 2010, reaching around US$2.8 billion.
Overfishing constitutes a key challenge to tuna population. The stock of tuna is at a historical
low and may not be renewable under intense
pressure from international fishing fleets. Since

sustainability.
Climate change is expected to reduce the suitability of tuna spawning and forage habitats. In
the long run, rising ocean temperatures will reduce primary and secondary production in the sea,
which, together with weakening currents and nutrient transport, will reduce the population of tuna.
In the short run, concentration areas of tuna tend to move—countries in the central Pacific, such as
Kiribati and Tuvalu, experience higher catches during El Niño years, while countries in the western
Pacific, such as Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands enjoy higher catches during La Niña years.
These movements will cause year-to-year fluctuations in the tuna catch by individual countries.
Restricting overfishing is a challenging task. The Vessel Day Scheme has vastly boosted fishing
revenues in recent years, but its impact on fish resources has been unclear. Although the Pacific
island countries attempt to preserve tuna resources by setting limits on the number of vessel days,
the number of registered fishing vessels has continued to rise, and fishing technologies have
become increasingly efficient and perhaps potentially harmful—the most popular fishing method in
the region called purse seine fishing has caused a significant rise of juvenile catches.

Appendix V. Tuvalu—Seafarers’ Employment and Remittances in
Kiribati and Tuvalu1
Seafaring provides an important source of employment and remittances for Kiribati and
Tuvalu, but both employment and remittances associated with this traditional activity have
exhibited clear downward trends in recent years. While remaining sizable, employment fell
sharply during the global financial crisis. As of October 2013, there were about 1,008 Kiribati and
112 Tuvalu seafarers on board, compared to 1,452 and 361 respectively in 2006. Over the period,
seafarer remittances fell by about 4 percent of GDP for Kiribati and 9 percent of GDP for Tuvalu.
In 2012, remittances stood at 5.8 percent of GDP in Kiribati and 10 percent of GDP in Tuvalu. The
depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the past few years has also had a negative impact on the
Australian dollar value of seafarer remittances.
The recovery in world trade from the global financial crisis did not produce a corresponding
recovery in seafarer employment for a number of structural reasons. The shipping industry
serving global trade continues to suffer from low profitability and overcapacity, and increasing
automation of ship operations has reduced the demand for seafarers. At the same time, seafarers
from Kiribati and Tuvalu have become less competitive compared with those from South and
Southeast Asian countries as transportation costs for Kiribati and Tuvalu seafarers traveling to their
destinations have become relatively high.
Insufficient training in some cases impedes seafarer employment. While the Kiribati Marine
Training Center is considered one of the best

Appendix VI. Tuvalu—Public Enterprises in Tuvalu1
The financial performance of public enterprises remains weak. The audited accounts for 2012
show that most public enterprises reported financial losses and revealed significant vulnerabilities in
their financial position.2 The impediments to public enterprise operations remain the same as those
identified in the 2012 Article IV staff report, namely persistent inefficiencies in management
practices, weak tariff structures, arrears on payments by the government, and limited scope to gain
from economies of scale. As such, losses made by these enterprises—at more than 3 percent of
GDP in the past few years—entail substantial potential liabilities of the government.
An ambitious reform plan was enacted under the 2010 Public Enterprise Act (PEA), but
progress has been slow in most areas. While progress was made in removing civil servants from
Board positions, progress in other areas has been limited. Under the Act, the Public Enterprise
Reform Monitoring Unit (PERMU) was established to monitor enterprises’ compliance with the
legislation, but the unit is effectively not in operation as the Director and supporting positions are
presently vacant. Additionally, while the government compensates public enterprises’ social
services—for instance the provision of electricity and banking services to the outer islands—through
allocations of Community Service Obligations (CSOs), the amounts are determined on the basis of
negotiations between the recipients and the government rather than a clear defining and costing of
social responsibilities assumed by public enterprises.
Certain public enterprises will face additional financial pressures. The recent wage increase for
civil servants has induced public enterprises to raise salaries for their employees by a similar margin,
adding to operational costs. The Tuvalu Electricity Corporation faces substantial challenges as fuel
grants from Japan are to be phased out by end-2014—the corporation would make more losses and
be more susceptible to global oil price movements.3

Tuvalu’s legal tender is the Australian dollar. There is no central monetary institution. At the time of
joining the Fund, Tuvalu availed itself of the transitory provisions of Article XIV, Section 2. While the
exchange control regulations are quite restrictive and prescribe approval requirements from the NBT
or the Finance Minister for most payments or transfers, staff’s understanding is that in practice, no
approval is required and payments and transfers for current international transactions are
administered liberally. Staff continues to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange system to
assess jurisdictional implications. Staff has recommended that the regulations be updated in line
with current practice so that Tuvalu can accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,
although the authorities have indicated that they have no current plans to do so.
The NBT is the only bank in Tuvalu handling foreign exchange transactions. The NBT buys and sells
foreign exchange at rates determined daily by the NBT’s board on the basis of rates quoted in the
international markets plus specific spreads dependent on the specific foreign currency.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in Funafuti in June 2012. The staff report
(IMF Country Report No. 12/259) was discussed by the Executive Board on August 3, 2012.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The Bank and Fund country teams, currently led by Mr. Robert Utz (Lead Economist, EASPN)
and Mr. Jiangyan Yu (Fund mission chief for Tuvalu), have maintained a close working
relationship and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues. Since Tuvalu’s decision to
pursue membership of the Bretton Woods institutions in 2009, the Bank team has joined all IMF
missions to Tuvalu since the country’s membership mission, including Article IV missions.
The teams agree that Tuvalu’s main macroeconomic challenges are to ensure fiscal
sustainability, strengthen public service delivery, and create a more supportive environment
for development. Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural
reform areas, all of which are also addressed in the authorities’ Policy Reform Matrix (PRM), as
macro-critical:
i.
Strengthening public financial management. In the absence of its own currency and
monetary policy, a sustainable fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Rebuilding buffer assets which were nearly exhausted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis is
crucial to ensuring sustainability. Maintaining adequate buffer assets will require a sound fiscal
policy framework including saving of cyclical revenues. Moreover, budget reporting and monitoring
need to be improved and economic and policy analysis capacity should be strengthened to better
inform new spending initiatives.
ii.
Reforming public enterprises. The government, with ADB support, has begun a
comprehensive public enterprise reform program to improve current weak performance and
profitability. Ensuring public enterprises are independently and professionally run, and are
transparently subsidized for provision of essential but noneconomic activities will strengthen
Tuvalu’s business climate and lessen the drain on public resources.
iii.
Exploring opportunities for poverty reduction, job creation, and private sector development.
Tuvalu’s geographic isolation, small size, and poor land quality have made it challenging to generate
domestic private sector employment. Demand for Tuvaluan seafarers on the international maritime
employment market is declining, due to rising competition from other countries, and existing labor
migration schemes have not been well utilized. Adequate education and training need to be
provided for Tuvaluans to better utilize overseas job opportunities and to reduce rising poverty.
iv.
Strengthening public service delivery. The government of Tuvalu in the TKII and the medium
term reform agenda identified improving service delivery in the health and education sectors as key
objectives. Based on analysis from the Health and Education Medium Term Expenditure Framework
and other analytical work, the authorities have begun to consider reforms to ensure appropriate
allocation between primary and tertiary service delivery, and maximizing returns on scare resources.
v.
The teams expect to sustain the close cooperation going forward. Table 1 details the
specific activities implemented and planned by the two teams over the period July 2014–October
2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Partnerships
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has partnered with the Government of Tuvalu since 1993. As of
31 December 2013, three loans with a total value of US$7.82 million, two policy-based grants for
US$5.59 million, and over 20 technical assistance projects totaling US$6.51 million have been
approved, largely supporting education and public sector management.
ADB’s approach and operations in Tuvalu are aligned to the National Strategy for Sustainable
Development, Te Kakeega 2005–2015, objectives of good governance and macroeconomic growth
and stability.
ADB, together with development partners, remain committed to supporting government’s roadmap
for improving the management of public resources, exercising prudent public expenditure and fiscal
management, strengthening corporate governance, and delivering better public services to the
people of Tuvalu.
ADB participates as a team member of the International Monetary Fund Article IV Mission to Tuvalu,
and liaises closely with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre—particularly on
macroeconomic management and fiscal conditions.
ADB observes the biannual meetings of the Tuvalu Trust Fund Board and cooperates with civil
society organizations in Tuvalu to strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of its
services.
ADB is also committed to undertaking joint missions with development partners to improve
coordination and lessen demands on country capacity.
ADB Supported Projects and Programs
ADB’s strategic directions in Tuvalu remains focused on strengthening public financial management,
including public expenditure and fiscal management, corporate governance, and public enterprise
reforms.
From November 1999 to July 2001, ADB worked closely with the government to implement the
Island Development Program loan and technical assistance program. This focused on improving
governance and economic management, enhancing employment opportunities through skills
development, and improving services on the outer islands. The loan was closed in 2001 and rated
successful. ADB also completed the upgrade of the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute in 2010. Rated
partly successful, the new structures and training facilities enable the institute to remain accredited
with the International Maritime Organization, and will improve the education and skills of Tuvaluan
seafarers so that they can compete for jobs overseas.

Tuvalu has benefitted from a number of ADB regional projects in the areas of economic
management, governance, environment, renewable energy, private sector development, and
education. Ongoing support for economic analyses is available under the Pacific Economic
Management technical assistance with revenue and statistics technical support provided by the
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. Regional cooperation offers many benefits and the
collective efforts towards increased aviation safety and security requirements under the ADBfinanced Pacific Aviation Safety Office and the Pacific Regional Audit Initiative are good examples of
its potential.
Developing effective fiscal management to complement private sector development has been a
long-standing goal of ADB to Tuvalu. The Improved Financial Management Program grant for $3.24
million was approved in December 2008 and disbursed in 2009 and 2011. The second program
grant of $2.35 million, approved in November 2012 and disbursed in March 2013, achieved key
public financial management objectives outlined in government’s policy reform matrix.
ADB’s technical assistance helped build the government’s capacity to meet commitments under
both programs. Overall, the performance of public enterprises has improved, however developing
and implementing a more robust policy reform matrix and building on past successes is important
for sustainable economic growth and more efficient and effective public services for the people of
Tuvalu.
Future Directions
Tuvalu’s growth strategy is set out in the National Strategy for Sustainable Development, Te
Kakeega, 2005–2015. The strategy recognizes that strengthening public sector management and
improving the private sector are key drivers for change in Tuvalu. This is consistent with the focus of
ADB’s Pacific Approach 2010–2014, approved in November 2009, as well as ADB’s country
operations business plan (COBP) 2014–2016 for Tuvalu, approved in July 2013.
ADB’s operational strategy for 2014-2016 focuses on improving public financial management and
supporting the process of public enterprise reform, with specific objectives to improve their
governance, administration, and profitability.
A policy-based grant of US$2.2 million in 2015 and supporting technical assistance of $300,000 per
annum is planned to help Tuvalu build on previous programs and ensure that the reform
momentum created by earlier programs is sustained.1
Tuvalu will continue to benefit from regional projects in the areas of economic management and
governance, climate change, education, and support from the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center
in the energy and utilities sectors.

As a Category A country, Tuvalu is eligible for grant assistance from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The country allocation is
indicative and is subject to a revised estimate of ADF commitment authority, country performance assessment outcomes, and the
country’s risk of debt distress.

PFTAC COUNTRY STRATEGY 2012–2014
Background
Tuvalu has faced a difficult macroeconomic environment in recent times which has resulted in
pressures on fiscal sustainability. Growth has remained weak despite improved performance in
the fishing and private retail sectors. Large revenue from fishing licenses, together with substantial
donor financial support, facilitated a sizable budget surplus in 2013 but also an expansionary budget
in 2014. The short-term outlook appears stable on the back of large donor-financed investments
expected in the period ahead, but the balance of risk tilts towards the downside. Vulnerabilities in
the SOE and financial sectors continue to pose challenges to macro stability.
Development partner budget support has enabled operations to continue while the authorities work
with partners to develop a joint policy matrix to underpin future budget support. Tuvalu became an
IMF and World Bank member in 2009.
PFTAC TA has been moderate and concentrated in the revenue and statistics sectors. Recent
PFTAC TA has been focused on assisting the authorities achieve the gains planned from revenue
reforms through on-the-job assistance in revenue administration following the completion of an
ADB project that supported the PFTAC-designed reforms. There has also been significant assistance
in developing national accounts and balance of payments statistics, in part to allow Tuvalu to meet
the requirements of IMF membership. PFTAC provided TA in 2012 to develop a PFM Reform
Roadmap.
Strategy 2012–2014
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.1
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on improving fiscal sustainability.
PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader development partner group to ensure
coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions in the authorities’ shared policy matrix.
Development of a PFM Roadmap and enhancement of national accounts statistics are expected to
be the main focus.
In the Public Financial Management area, PFTAC provided support in 2012 to develop a PFM
roadmap to prioritize the strengthening of PFM weaknesses identified in the 2011 PEFA (1.2).
Support to implementation of specific elements will also be available, in coordination with other
development partners and in particular the AusAID-supported budget and treasury advisors.
Officials from Tuvalu have regularly attended PFTAC’s PFM workshops, including the annual 2 week
Strategic Development Workshop jointly sponsored by PFTAC and the Australian Department of
Finance at ANU in Canberra. PFTAC would look to assist the authorities implement a follow-up PEFA
assessment, probably in 2015 (1.1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

In the revenue area, the main focus will be continuing support in the enforcement of SOE tax
obligations through an enhanced compliance improvement program. It is anticipated that this
program will roll out to include large corporate and individual business enterprises during 2014/15.
The IT operating system was re-established in 2013/14 after data base issues were resolved and
maintenance and effective use of the system will be an important tool in improving compliance.
PFTAC plans a support Mission in May 2014 with a follow up support mission in early 2015.
In statistics, PFTAC will resume providing regular assistance on national accounts compilation (4.1),
taking over from SPC which has been doing this since 2010. Training will also be provided to
increase capacity in the statistics office so that ultimately broader measures of national income and
saving (4.3) can be regularly produced. PFTAC has been providing support on balance of payments
compilation (4.6, 4.9) but this has been taken over by the JSA Project on the Improvement of
External Sector Statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region.
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC will be available to provide strategic support should the
authorities begin implementing the financial institutions act passed in 2010. Given the lack of in
country capacity, establishing a basic on and off site supervision program (3.1 and 3.4) will require
TA resources well in excess of PFTAC’s availability. As in other sectors though, PFTAC would be able
to provide strategic oversight to the process if other partners were able to provide resources for on
the job support.
No direct macroeconomic support is currently envisaged, with the TTFAC and ADB’s PEM TA
currently taking the lead in these areas.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 1, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have shortcomings that hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most serious in the national
accounts and monetary statistics. The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) and the Statistics
Department (STA) have provided technical assistance (TA) to the Central Statistics Division (CSD) of the Ministry
of Finance to help compiling statistics for surveillance and the authorities’ own policy analysis and formulation.
The CSD will need to train additional staff to improve data provisioning.
National accounts: With PFTAC assistance, the compilation methodology for the national accounts is gradually
improving. Attention needs to be paid to improving source data for national accounts.
Price statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) is the only price index compiled in Tuvalu. The CSD produces a
quarterly CPI, which is timely and of reasonable quality. The CPI weights were revised in 2011, based on
the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Government finance statistics (GFS): The MOF compiles the central government data for budget analysis and
control. However, the classifications of some accounts, particularly on capital spending, need to be improved to
be in line with international standards. GFS data are not reported to STA. The authorities are participating in the
Japan Administered Account for Selected IMF Activities (JSA)-funded three-year regional GFS capacity building
project. It is anticipated that a total of three missions to Tuvalu will be conducted under this project, the first
two of which occurred in April 2012 and April 2013. Staff resource levels continue to be an impediment to an
efficient and effective GFS data compilation.
Monetary and financial statistics: Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as its legal tender and does not have a
central bank. Monetary and financial statistics are currently not produced in Tuvalu. The National Bank of
Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu provided the Article IV mission with their balance sheets, which
were used to produce the monetary data on the two banks.
Balance of payments and International Investment Position (IIP): The IMF has been providing TA to Tuvalu
under the JSA Project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific Region.
Three TA missions have been conducted since April 2013. Important progress has been made in improving
coverage and classification of the ESS. Moreover, capacity has been developed and the CSD compiler has taken
ownership of most of the compilation process. However, shortcomings remain in the coverage of FDI, exports,
and debt-related transactions and positions. There is also a high risk of sudden disruption of the compilation
process and deterioration of data quality as the CSD has only one ESS compiler, who also compiles other
macroeconomic statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Tuvalu began participating in the General Data

No data ROSC are available.

Dissemination System in 2013.
III. Reporting to STA
Annual balance of payments and IIP statements, both in BPM6 format, were submitted to STA in May 2014 for
the first time (data are currently under review). Other statistics are currently not being reported to STA.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Brian Aitken and Vikram
Haksar (IMF), and Satu
Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

This year’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) concludes that Tuvalu is at a high risk of
debt distress, the same risk rating assigned in the previous DSA conducted in 2012. While
a large fiscal surplus was recorded over the last two years, allowing the country to build
up needed fiscal buffers, the increase in expenditures envisaged in the 2014 budget—
financed by a temporary but large increase in foreign grants— implies a significant
increase in the risk to fiscal sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, where the increase
in the spending envelope is not scaled back in line with the unwinding of foreign grants in
a timely manner, the budget would slip into a deficit from 2015 onwards. Although the
PV of debt to GDP ratio would initially fall below the indicative policy threshold as fiscal
buffers are depleted, over the medium term debt would build up again as fiscal buffers are
exhausted, and reach above the indicative threshold in outer years of the projection. This
trajectory underscores why a modest fiscal surplus is needed to lower the risk of debt
distress to moderate levels. Also, placing growth on a higher trajectory by addressing
structural weaknesses should strengthen the country’s ability to service debt.

TUVALU

BACKGROUND
1.
Being one of the smallest and most isolated countries in the world, Tuvalu faces
tremendous challenges. With a population of some 11,000 people living on 26 square kilometers,
Tuvalu is more than 3,000 kilometers away from its nearest major external market. Despite
substantial, albeit volatile, foreign aid and a boom in the fisheries sector, growth prospects are
hampered by weak competitiveness and capacity, with remoteness causing high transportation cost
and isolation, and the lack of scale increasing transaction cost.
2.
The authorities are cognizant of the challenges and have developed a broad reform
agenda. A development strategy and reform package, which were formulated in consultation with
development partners, have been fleshed out in an effort to enhance governance and social
development, facilitate private sector growth, and safeguard macroeconomic stability.
3.
The budget achieved a substantial surplus for the second consecutive year in 2013, but
a dramatic increase of budget spending in 2014 has called into question its fiscal
sustainability. The fiscal surplus reached 26.3 percent of GDP, reflecting record high fishing license
fees and higher than expected tax revenue and foreign aid. Nevertheless, the 2014 budget targets a
more than 20 percent expansion of spending, which would be financed by a large temporary
increase of foreign grants and transfers. The substantial fiscal expansion would result eventually in a
depletion of fiscal buffers and accumulation of foreign debt.
4.
Meanwhile, the government’s external assets have risen markedly. The Consolidated
Investment Fund (CIF), which serves as a fiscal buffer and is fully controlled by the government of
Tuvalu, has been built up to more than $A 15 million (38 percent of GDP). The Tuvalu Trust Fund
(TTF), which was capitalized by development partners in 1987, has grown from $A130 million in 2012
to more than $A 140 million in 2013 (356 percent of GDP). The TTF is not fully sovereign and is
owned instead by Tuvalu, Australia, and New Zealand, amongst others countries. It cannot be drawn
down freely: when its market value exceeds a “maintained value” indexed to Australian CPI, the TTF
Board—representing both development partners and Tuvalu government—can decide to transfer
the funds in excess of the target income to the CIF. This DSA analyzes gross public debt because of
the limited conditional access to the TTF.
5.
Since the previous DSA conducted in 2012, public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
has continued to decline, but is expected to rise as a result of public enterprise borrowing in
the near term. As of end-2013, total PPG debt stood at US$ 14.6 million, equivalent to 41 percent
of GDP. External debt was US$ 12.5 million (35 percent of GDP), and domestic debt—owed to
domestic banks—stood at US$ 2.1 million (6 percent of GDP). Bilateral development partners
provide only grant assistance, while multilateral institutions, most notably the Asian Development
Bank, provided concessional loans to the government. Meanwhile, loans contracted at
nonconcessional terms by two fishing joint ventures established by the National Fishing Corporation

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

of Tuvalu (NAFICOT) and Asian companies account for a significant share of public debt. These loans
are largely guaranteed by the government, and constitute contingent government liabilities. 1
Recently, one joint venture has been working on a new loan agreement to finance the expansion of
its fishing capacity, which implies a large addition of public debt in the near term—most likely
in 2014 or 2015.

This DSA is built on a baseline macroeconomic framework that assumes an
accommodative and procyclical fiscal policy. Without a timely action to cut back the spending
envelope from the 2014 budget level, the fiscal balance would shift into a deficit from 2015
onwards, which would be financed initially by drawing down the CIF, and later, when the CIF is fully
depleted in 2021, by concessional borrowing. This would cause debt-to-GDP ratio to decline over
the medium term as the current debt is amortized, and build up again as new borrowing occurs.
Although weaknesses in the banks and public enterprises could pose large liabilities to the
government, these costs are not assumed in the baseline because of the lack of reliable data—the
cost of addressing banking fragilities needs to be assessed on the basis of a prudent regulation and
resolution framework, while the fiscal cost associated with public enterprise weaknesses should be
estimated in the context of a comprehensive public enterprise reform package.
7.
Compared to the previous DSA, the main features of the current macroeconomic
framework can be summarized as follows:


Growth. Real GDP is projected to grow by an average of 2.2 percent per annum over the
medium term and 2 percent over the long run, compared to a constant of 1.2 percent in the
previous DSA.



Inflation. Inflation is projected to reach about 3 percent in the near term and gradually
moderate to below 2 percent in the long run, which is similar to the previous DSA.

1

An effectively defunct and wholly government-owned public enterprise called the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu
(NAFICOT) is party to the two fishing joint ventures (JV). NAFICOT owns 50 percent of the JV that was established together with a
company of the Taiwan Province of China, and 40 percent of the Korean one.

TUVALU



Balance of payments. Exports of goods and services are projected to remain stable at
60 percent of GDP over the medium and long run compared to just above 10 percent in the
previous DSA, with the difference reflecting revision to the data to account for large exports by
fishing joint ventures following a recent technical assistance on external account statistics.
Imports of goods and services would peak at 168 percent of GDP in the medium term and
moderate to 115 percent of GDP over the long run; in the previous DSA, imports would peak at
151 percent of GDP over the medium term, and moderate to 112 percent of GDP over the long
run. The current account deficit would widen to 37 percent of GDP over the medium term, and
then narrow to 4.4 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period, a level close to the last
DSA.



Fiscal. Revenue is slightly higher than in the last DSA over the medium term, reflecting buoyant
fishing license fees. However, it is expected to fall to 45 percent of GDP towards the end of the
projection period, compared to 56 percent in the last DSA. Grants as a share of GDP will also fall
over time, reaching 13 percent of GDP by 2034 compared to 17 percent of GDP in the previous
DSA. Expenditures are projected to decline from 100 percent of GDP in 2014 to 62 percent
in 2034, while the last DSA

scenario are on the downside.
Vulnerabilities in state-owned banks and public enterprises imply large government liabilities.
Uncertainties within the fisheries sector could pose additional risks to revenue and fiscal soundness.
Moreover, a slowdown in advanced and emerging economies, including China, could undermine
activity and reduce job opportunities in the Pacific region, which would weaken the demand for
Tuvaluan seafarers and seasonal workers, adversely affecting Tuvalu’s growth prospects.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt
9.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt breaches the indicative threshold of debtto-GDP ratio for prolonged periods. The threshold for PV of Debt to GDP is determined by the
CPIA index, a measure of the country’s institutional capacity. While the trajectory shows a decline in
debt levels from 52 percent of GDP to just above 20 percent over the medium term, reflecting
amortization of existing loans and no new borrowing in the medium term, increased borrowing only

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

in the outer years, leading to the full depletion of CIF buffers by 2021. This implies that the debt
trajectory begins to rise again and breaches the threshold by 2029. (Figure 1) The PV of debt-toGDP ratio starts at a much higher level than the last DSA, but converges to the level as the last DSA
toward the end of the projection period. The negative contribution of residuals (table 1 and 2) to the
debt trajectory throughout the medium-term horizon is largely driven by withdrawing from external
assets under the CIF.
10.
Stress tests show the debt ratios are highly sensitive to exports and exchange rate
shocks. A one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2015 would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to
stay above the indicative threshold for most of the projection period. A standard shock to exports
also results in a breach of the debt-to-export threshold over the next few years. Also, the threshold
for the debt service-to-exports would be breached for four years over the medium term.

B. Public Debt
11.
The PV of public debt to GDP stays above the benchmark over the medium term. The
PV of debt to GDP stands at 58 percent of GDP in 2014, and while declining gradually below the
benchmark of 38 percent over the medium term, would rise again in outer years as new borrowing
occurs after the CIF is depleted, reaching 40 percent of GDP by 2034.2 (Figure 2). Although the
breaching of the benchmark is small, it needs to be interpreted with caution. Since domestic banks
are struggling with large amounts of nonperforming loans and can hardly extend additional
financing on a sustained basis, external borrowing will constitute the main source of public
financing, and debt sustainability analysis based on external debt ratios appears more informative at
this stage. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio would rise from 50 percent in 2014 to 69 percent
in 2034, while the PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio will fall from 8 percent to 3 percent.
12.
Paths of debt indicators are sensitive to alternative assumptions and bound tests. A
one-time 30 percent depreciation would push the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at 73 percent
in 2015. A standard shock to growth would cause the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio to rise from
50 percent in 2014 to 194 percent in 2034.

C. External and Public DSA under Alternative Scenario
13.
Under an alternative scenario where fiscal policy is anchored by an appropriate fiscal
balance target, the risk of debt distress is reduced considerably. Given the volatility of fishing
license fees, targeting a structural balance would help reduce procyclicality—the structural balance
is estimated on the basis of a moving average of fishing license fees over a period of seven years;
fishing license fees in excess of the structural level, i.e. their moving average, would be saved in the
CIF, while it can be drawn down in case fishing license fees fall short of the structural level. In the
case of Tuvalu, targeting a moderate structural surplus implies saving fishing revenues in the current
period given the dramatic increase in fishing license fees in the past few years. Under the alternative
scenario, the fiscal policy targets a structural surplus of 0.5-1 percent of GDP over the medium to

score.

TUVALU

long run. As a consequence, CIF buffers would be maintained at a comfortable level, and debt
indicators will improve significantly—the PV of external debt-to-GDP would fall from 53 percent
in 2014 to around 10 percent by 2034.

D. Authorities’ View
14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the overall assessment of the DebtSustainability Analysis, but made a couple of observations. First, the authorities, while
recognizing the volatility of fishing revenues, are more optimistic about the near-term outcome, and
expect revenues to be higher than staff projection in the next few years. Second, they indicated that
the fishing joint venture has a favorable outlook, and the probability for the government to assume
the company’s debt obligation is small.

E. Conclusions
15.
The results of Tuvalu’s DSA point to a high risk of debt distress, which is the same
conclusion that was drawn in the 2012 DSA. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is above the indicative
threshold over the long run. Furthermore, a significant portion of public debt was contracted on
nonconcessional terms, placing further strains on the country’s weak debt servicing capacity.
16.
Stress tests show that Tuvalu’s debt dynamics are susceptible to shocks. Standard
shocks in the DSA, particularly the one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation, as well as slower real
GDP growth rates and lower export growth, would cause external debt indicators to breach their
respective thresholds over the long run. Public debt indicators also worsen dramatically under
bound tests.
17.
The risk of debt distress is reduced to a moderate level under the alternative scenario
where a modest fiscal structural surplus is implemented. Assuming that the government
maintains a structural surplus of 0.5-1 percent of GDP over the medium and long term, all external
debt indicators would decline below their indicative thresholds.

TUVALU

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Under Baseline Scenario
Growth and Inflation


Growth is expected to be boosted to about 2.5 percent in the next few years thanks to the
implementation of a few large infrastructure projects financed by grants from development
partners.1/ Over the long term, the growth will moderate to about 2 percent as these projects
are completed. Meanwhile, the share of the public sector in the economy would gradually
decline, while the private sector would play a more important role over time on the back of
great potential in the fisheries sector, which is consistent with the Te Kakeega II development
strategy.



Inflation is projected to rise to about 3 percent in 2014 as a result of increased government
spending and civil servant wages as well as a weakening Australian dollar. Inflation would
moderate gradually to just below 2 percent in the outer years.

Balance of Payments


Current account deficit will peak over the medium term at 37 percent of GDP mainly because of
a spike in imports, and gradually narrow to about 4 percent of GDP over the long run. Reflecting
improved capacity to tap into the marine resources by both public and private enterprises,
fishing exports are expected to double in value over the next 20 years. Driven by large
infrastructure projects and the purchase of fishing ships, imports would rise substantially in the
next few years, and grow moderately thereafter. The trade balance will move into a deficit over
the medium term, and return to a moderate surplus in 2018 and onwards.



FDI inflows would be minimal and mostly include reinvestment of fishing joint venture earnings.
Despite efforts of the authorities to privatize certain public enterprises, there has been little
success in attracting foreign investors, and therefore no significant FDI inflows associated with
privatization are assumed.

Fiscal Policy and Financing


Fishing license fees are projected conservatively at around A$14 million in 2014-2019 and to
gradually decline to A$11 million over the long run reflecting the adverse impact of overfishing
and climate change.



Foreign grants to the budget are expected to decline gradually from 51 percent of GDP in 2014
to 13 percent of GDP by 2034. It is assumed that the government’s implementation of reforms
induces continued support from development partners.



Given the weakening fishing license fees and foreign grants, expenditures would be compressed
gradually from nearly 100 percent of GDP in 2014 to 62 percent of GDP by 2034. This decline
also reflects a reduced share of the public sector in the economy, which makes space for the
private sector to grow.



The overall fiscal deficit will hover around 5-7 percent of GDP over the medium term, and
decline gradually to just above 4 percent of GDP by 2034. The convergence of fiscal deficit
toward current account balance also points to the importance of maintaining a sound fiscal
policy to safeguard competitiveness and economic stability. Financing of fiscal deficits would be
mostly from external borrowing, while domestic banks suffer from severe asset quality problems
and are not capable of providing sustainable financing over the long term.

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 28, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Tuvalu
On August 25, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Tuvalu.
Growth is picking up modestly on a generally stable outlook, and inflation has been moderate.
Activity has benefited from increased competition in the retail sector and a recent boom in the
fisheries sector as well as development partners’ support, while banking weaknesses have
constrained financial support for the private sector, and the poorly managed public enterprises
have strained government finances and hampered the country’s business climate.
The balance of payments has been supported by large fishing-related receipts and official aid.
Fishing exports and receipts of fishing license fees have more than doubled in the past few years,
and official aid by development partners has also risen sharply. Remittances, however, have
shrunk markedly since the global financial crisis largely as a result of limited human capacity
and weak competitiveness. Meanwhile, imports have been generally stable on account of
restrained budget spending until recently. As a result, foreign exchange reserves have risen to 8
months of imports.
The fiscal policy achieved a substantial surplus in 2013. In addition to record high fishing license
fees, tax revenues also outperformed the budget mainly because of improved compliance by
public enterprises. The favorable revenue has been reinforced by higher-than-expected foreign
grants. As a result, fiscal buffers have been built up to comfortable levels. However, a large
budget expansion in 2014 has increased risks to fiscal sustainability. The 2014 budget envisages
a more than 20 percent increase in expenditures, mostly current spending, which is financed by a
temporary large increase in foreign grants and transfers—once it is unwound, the fiscal balance
would likely move into a significant deficit over the medium term.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Vulnerabilities in banks and public enterprises could compound fiscal risks. The unsupervised
state-owned banking system suffers from severe asset quality problems. Non-bank public
enterprises continue to make losses as a whole, reflecting weak governance and the cost of
assuming social responsibilities. These weaknesses could ultimately result in a large increase in
public liabilities.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ significant progress in implementing reforms on a
broad front, in particular as regards public financial management. They noted that, while
Tuvalu’s growth prospects over the medium term are generally positive, debt sustainability
remains a key concern, and vulnerabilities in banks and public enterprises pose large fiscal risks.
Challenges arising from climate change and Tuvalu’s remoteness and small size also need to be
addressed.
Directors called for urgent actions to strengthen the fiscal position. While buffers have been built
up in the past two years as revenues over-performed, the budget expansion in 2014 could
undermine debt sustainability. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to unwind this
expansion by cutting expenditures, keeping public sector wages aligned with productivity
growth, and rationalizing social spending. More broadly, the adoption of a medium-term fiscal
framework that targets a structural budget surplus and builds up savings will boost resilience
against adverse shocks.
Directors also underscored the importance of further reform of public enterprises that continue to
burden the budget. They encouraged the authorities to enhance the transparency and
accountability of these entities and better identify their social responsibilities. Stricter control of
public guarantees will also be needed, going forward.
Directors expressed concern about unaddressed fragilities in the banking system. They
encouraged the authorities to take actions to resolve nonperforming loans and develop
contingency plans. More broadly, they recommended the establishment of a sound regulatory
framework and a comprehensive review of bank balance sheets. In this context, Directors
welcomed the decision to set up a banking commission that will play a key role in ensuring
financial stability.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that Tuvalu’s real effective exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals. Nonetheless, they emphasized that continued reforms are essential to
enhance competitiveness. They encouraged the authorities to implement the next phase of the
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

institutional capacity of the public sector, including as regards the compilation of economic
statistics. Continued engagement with development partners will be key to mitigate the effects of
climate change.

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for Tuvalu
and Kyounghwan. Moon, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
August 25, 2014

On behalf of the Tuvaluan authorities, we would like to thank staff for their constructive
policy discussions and a well-written report. This is the third Article IV consultation between
staff and the authorities since Tuvalu joined the Fund in 2010. The authorities are broadly in
line with staff assessments, including policy actions for securing fiscal sustainability,
financial stability, and structural reforms. We would like to express the authorities’ deep
appreciation to the Fund and development partners for their assistance. The authorities look
forward to continued close engagement with the Fund and development partners.
Tuvalu is the smallest and the least populous member country in the Fund, with the
population of slightly above ten thousand and comprised of nine reef atoll islands. Its unique
features of smallness and remoteness, like other Pacific island countries, as well as the
absence of natural resources apart from tuna in the territorial waters impose severe
constraints on Tuvalu’s development. As part of the global community, its economy is not
immune to global economic shocks such as food and oil prices. Tuvalu is one of the most
vulnerable countries due to its lack of economies of scale and limited infrastructure and
capabilities. As low-lying islands at no more than 15 feet above sea level, Tuvalu is
particularly susceptible to climate change. Despite these challenges, the authorities will
continue their efforts to build adequate policy buffers for enhancing economic resilience to
achieve sustainable growth, along with continued assistance from the international
community.
Economic Outlook
The economic growth of Tuvalu has been showing moderate recovery. In 2013, GDP is
estimated to have increased by 1.3 percent, which is slightly higher than the growth in 2012,
mainly due to the increases of revenues in the fisheries sector1 and grants from development
partners. GDP is expected to further increase by over 2 percent with the implementation of
large infrastructure projects, including upgrading airport runaways, financed by development
partners over the medium term.
Inflation has stabilized below 2 percent over the last years benefiting from lower global
food and fuel prices but there are signs of slight upward pressures. The 2013 price inflation
was 2 percent, but it is expected to pick up with the increase of government expenditures and
weakening Australian dollar, which is Tuvalu’s legal tender.

In 2013, fishing license fees increased to AUS$ 18 million (45 percent of GDP) from AUS$ 8 million in 2012.
The authorities expect this high level of fishing license fees would be maintained over the next 3 or 4 years thanks to
El Niño.

Balance of payment has improved but is subject to large uncertainties. In 2013, the current
account surplus is estimated to be 25 percent of GDP and gross official reserves are expected to
reach around 8 months of imports. However, there remain uncertainties over current account
surplus, given Tuvalu’s heavy dependence on its uncertain sources of fishing exports, fishing
license fees and foreign aid.
Fiscal policy
Tuvalu achieved its second consecutive fiscal surplus of AUS$ 10.5 million, around
26 percent of GDP, in 2013. For the first time since 2002, total domestic revenue excluding
grants exceeded total expenditure. This positive fiscal performance has strengthened the
government’s financial position. The Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), which serves as a
fiscal buffer, increased to AUS$ 19.9 million, around 48 percent of GDP as of March 2014. At
this level, the CIF would be able to assist the authorities to finance unexpected budget financing
gaps for several years.
The authorities agree that ensuring fiscal sustainability is crucial. While the 2014 total
government expenditure has increased about 20 percent from the 2013 level, total revenue is
also expected to increase, targeting fiscal surplus in 2014. The authorities are aware of the fiscal
risks given the bumpy revenue streams and will continue their effort to rein in expenditure and
broaden tax base.
 Wages have increased by 25 percent in 2014, but this is the first increase since 2010 and
the increase is about AUS$ 720/year for 900 government employees, who make up about
two thirds of employees in the formal labor market. The authorities will make efforts to
establish the proper wage-setting mechanism to avoid a sharp increase of wages.
 Under the Tuvalu Scholarship Program, about 30 students receive scholarships each year.
Extending their studies has resulted in an increase of its cost, and the authorities will
enhance the monitoring of the performance so as to ensure the effectiveness of the
program.
 Because of the limited medical facilities in Tuvalu, the authorities have sent patients to
Fiji, India, and New Zealand under the Tuvalu Medical Treatment System. The
authorities are aware of the risk of its potential overspending and will continue to make
efforts to improve its cost effectiveness through establishing a comprehensive database in
addition to limiting referrals within available budget funds.
 The Tuvalu Cooperative Society (TCS) is the main wholesaler and retailer in Tuvalu and
the authorities are considering the re-starting of assistance to the TCS to provide basic
foods to the outer islands. The authorities would carefully seek the most cost effective
way to achieve the goal of ensuring food security.
 The authorities have strengthened their audit program for tax collection since the arrival
of a tax advisor in 2012. Implementation of audit on public enterprises contributed to the
increase of tax compliance in 2013. The authorities plan to start audit on the private sector
in 2014 and enhance their enforcement capacity.

The authorities welcome staff’s proposal of introducing a medium term fiscal framework
targeting a structural fiscal surplus. The main purpose of establishing the Tuvalu Trust Fund
(TTF) in 1987 is to have a rainy day fund for Tuvalu. The authorities believe that the current
TTF and CIF scheme has served Tuvalu well, but they also consider that combining the
operation of the TTF with a medium term fiscal framework could help build fiscal buffers and
ensure fiscal sustainability. The authorities would be open to further discussion with staff.
Strengthening public financial management will continue to be one of the main policy
priorities in Tuvalu. A Central Procurement Unit has been established to oversee the
purchases of goods and services. The new procurement rules would ensure the efficient use of
budget and promote transparency of the procurement process.
Banking Sector
The authorities agree with staff that supervisory and regulatory framework in the
banking sector needs to be strengthened. The authorities are in the process of setting up the
Banking Commission, which will play a role of ensuring financial stability. The authorities will
also make efforts to improve the prudence of the banking system. Given the limited
infrastructure in the banking sector, financial services are restricted to a small number of people
and access of outer islanders is constrained. The authorities are mindful of capacity constraints
and would be grateful of technical or financial assistance from the Fund and development
partners to strengthen the financial system.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are committed to further strengthening public enterprise reform. All of
civil servants have resigned from Board positions in public enterprises (PEs). Recruiting
process is under way for staffing the Public Enterprise Reform and Management Unit. The
authorities are also working with the Asian Development Bank on public enterprise reform to
improve governance, administration and profitability of PEs. Given the lack of economies of
scale in Tuvalu, it is to some extent inevitable for PEs to bear a part of burden in providing
their services. Moreover, it is hard to distinguish between commercial activities and social
responsibilities. The authorities will continue to explore ways to improve efficiency of PEs.
The Tuvaluan authorities will continue their well-known reform efforts. Tuvalu’s National
Strategy for Sustainable Development for 2005 to 2015, Te Kakeega II, was set focusing on the
eight strategic areas including good governance, macroeconomic growth and stability and
social development. The second phase of Policy Reform Matrix has been complete and the third
phase is scheduled to start in the second half of this year, integrated with the government’s 2013
reform roadmap. Tuvalu’s development achievement has been acknowledged in the areas of
strengthened budgetary management and improved school attendance. The authorities will put
renewed focus on increased government investment in primary education and health services in
addition to gender equality.
