INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ECUADOR
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Ecuador
Approved by Charles Collyns and Adnan Mazarei
January 4, 2006
Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Quito and Guayaquil during November 7–16, 2005.
The team met with Mr. Alfredo Palacio (President of the Republic); Mr. Wilfrido Lucero (President
of Congress); Ms. Magdalena Barreiro (former Minister of Finance), Mr. Alejandro Maldonado
(former Superintendent of Banks); other senior government officials; and representatives of the
industrial, banking, and export sectors, political leaders, leading economic analysts, and NGOs.
Team. The staff team comprised Trevor Alleyne (Head), Lisandro Abrego, Enrique Flores (both
WHD); Bjoern Rother (PDR), and Alexander Pivovarsky (FAD), and was assisted by Jorge Guzman
(Resident Representative).
The authorities’ response to recent Fund policy advice. In the 2004 Article IV consultation,
Directors noted the important role of the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRL) and
stressed the importance of controlling government spending, in particular on pensions and wages.
However, the authorities have had great difficulty in restraining spending growth, which far exceeded
the FRL targets in both 2004 and 2005. Moreover, changes to the FRL and the pension system
in 2005 have weakened the overall macroeconomic framework. Directors also urged the authorities to
advance on key structural reforms, in particular phasing out revenue earmarking and subsidies, taking
measures to improve the soundness of the pension system, strengthening the performance of public
enterprises, and implementing the recommendations of the 2004 FSAP. Only in the last case was any
progress made.
Exchange Regime and Relations with the Fund. The U.S. dollar is the legal tender in Ecuador.
Outstanding Fund credit is SDR 58.52 million (19.4 percent of quota). Ecuador has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a) in the form of a freeze on demand and savings deposits
held in closed banks managed by the Deposit Guarantee Agency. Staff is monitoring the authorities’
economic program at their request, including via quarterly quantitative targets.
Data. Ecuador has subscribed to the SDDS. While data provision for surveillance purposes is
adequate overall, the statistical base remains uneven, with shortcomings in the balance of payments
(e.g., oil imports, non-oil foreign direct investment, and private capital flows); public finances (e.g.,
lack of coverage of key public enterprises); and labor market (e.g., unreliability of employment data).
Selected Issues Papers. The companion Selected Issues paper comprises four chapters: (i) economic
performance under dollarization, (ii) an assessment of competitiveness, (iii) performance and
sustainability of fiscal policy, and (iv) developments in banking sector intermediation.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Aided by high international oil prices, macroeconomic performance in 2005 was
generally positive. Output growth is expected to exceed 3 percent and external sector
performance has been strong. Inflation remains low but has picked up in recent months
and is now expected to end the year at 4 percent, driven by a strong growth in bank credit
and public spending.

•

Financial market conditions have been favorable. Robust deposit growth signaled
continued improvement in confidence in the banking system. Ecuador’s successful
international bond issue—its first voluntary placement in 8 years—reflected improved
investor sentiment, even though Ecuador’s EMBI spread remains the widest among Latin
American countries.

•

The public sector primary surplus narrowed in 2005, notwithstanding rising oil
revenues. Spending on wages, pensions, and fuel subsidies has risen rapidly.
Nevertheless, public debt has continued to decline relative to GDP.

•

With the political environment highly unsettled, there was no progress on most of
the critical issues discussed in the 2004 Article IV consultation. The elimination of the
oil stabilization fund and changes to the fiscal responsibility law and pension system have
weakened the macroeconomic policy framework.

Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
Ecuador should be doing more to take advantage of the favorable external conditions to
strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework and advance structural reform. Stronger longrun growth and the sustainability of dollarization depend crucially on improved fiscal policies
and advancing with structural reforms to strengthen the public finances and the financial system
and improve the investment climate.
•

Fiscal policy in 2006. In light of recent inflationary pressures and the need to save a
higher share of the oil windfall, the authorities should aim for a higher primary surplus
than currently programmed and firmly resist spending pressures from powerful interest
groups.

•

Fiscal reforms. The authorities need to strengthen the institutional framework for fiscal
policy to (i) strengthen the budget’s resilience to shocks, including through further
improvements in debt sustainability; (ii) increase budget flexibility by reducing
earmarking and subsidies; and (iii) ensure appropriate use of the country’s limited oil
wealth.

•

Banking system. The authorities should strengthen efforts to implement the 2004 FSAP
recommendations. Staff strongly supports the authorities’ stand against the dangerous
banking system law currently being discussed in Congress.

•

The investment climate. Staff emphasizes the need to address many deficiencies in the
environment for doing business, including the labor market and regulatory issues in key
sectors such as oil, energy, and telecommunications.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Political Context
1.
Political conditions have been turbulent in 2005. Congress dismissed President
Gutierrez in April. His successor, President Palacio, became Ecuador’s sixth president in the
last 8 years.
•

For much of his time in office, President Palacio has been locked in a dispute with
Congress over his desire to set up a constituent assembly that would have powers to
design and implement wide-ranging political reforms.

•

After initially encouraging expectations for a broad expansion in government
spending, the new government has shown a greater concern for fiscal discipline and
for advancing much needed structural reforms, while continuing its strong emphasis
on addressing the country’s social needs.

•

However, because of the government’s weak political base―it has no party affiliation
or representation in Congress―and the population’s increasing focus on the
October 2006 presidential and congressional elections, it has had difficulties in
withstanding pressures for more public spending and in resisting inappropriate policy
initiatives from powerful interest groups and local governments.
B. Recent Economic Developments

2.
The economy has been largely resilient to the difficult political environment and,
aided by high international oil prices, macroeconomic performance in 2005 was
generally positive.
•

Overall GDP growth is estimated to have exceeded 3 percent, with the non-oil sector
expanding by 3½ percent (Figure 1). The strong growth in the oil sector that followed
the completion of a new oil pipeline in 2003 has tapered off, but high oil prices have
helped bolster confidence and underpin domestic demand.

•

Employment growth has remained sluggish, however, and the unemployment rate,
which averaged 10.7 percent, was little changed from 2004.

•

Driven mainly by strong growth in bank credit and public spending, 12-month CPI
inflation rose from less than 2 percent in June 2005 to 4 percent at the end of the year
despite frozen domestic fuel prices (Figure 2).

•

The external current account deficit is estimated to have remained unchanged at about
1 percent of GDP, reflecting rapid import growth which offset strong increases in oil
and non-oil exports led by shrimp and metal products (Figure 3). While oil sector FDI
inflows increased, non-oil FDI remained low, at less than 1 percent of GDP.

-6-

3.

Investor confidence has improved.

•

Banking system credit and deposits grew strongly in 2005, while liquidity remained
at comfortable levels and other stability indicators continued to improve (Figure 4).
Moreover, there was no evidence of spillover effects on deposits or on interest rates
from the political turbulence. However, bank intermediation is still well below precrisis levels and deposits are overwhelmingly at short maturities.

•

The authorities successfully regained access to international capital markets with a
US$650 million bond issue in December 2005. The 10-year bullet bond, with a yield
of 10.75 percent (95 basis points below that of the existing 2012 global bond) was
greatly oversubscribed. Nevertheless, the EMBI spread, although having declined
substantially in the past year, remains the widest among Latin American countries.

consistently above

reflecting mainly high oil
revenues, which have helped reduce public debt from over 90 percent of GDP in 2000 to
43 percent of GDP in 2005. However, the non-oil deficit is projected to have increased to
5 percent of GDP in 2005, driven by the growing cost of fuel subsidies (owing to fixed
domestic prices) and the continued rapid expansion of recurrent spending, especially in
wages and pensions.

5.
The authorities aim to restrain recurrent spending in their 2006 fiscal program
to make room for larger capital and social spending while maintaining an overall
primary surplus above 4¾ percent of GDP. Their budget proposal envisages growth in
wages and pensions of 4 percent, compared with 15 percent a year during 2002–05.
However, capital spending is projected to rise by some 40 percent, in line with the
authorities’ priority of addressing the country’s outstanding social and infrastructure needs.
Under current WEO oil price projections, the authorities’ program would be consistent with
an increase in the NFPS surplus to 4.8 percent of GDP from 4.2 percent in 2005 and a decline

in public debt to 40 percent of GDP. However, the non–oil deficit would remain unchanged,
reflecting a further substantial increase in the cost of fuel subsidies. The fiscal program for
2006, which also includes significant resources earmarked for liability management
operations, appears to be adequately funded, reflecting the recent bond issue and approved
disbursements in January 2006 from the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR). The
authorities also expect to receive US$400 million in budget support financing from the
multilaterals, half of which appears to be well in train.
6.
There has been little progress in implementing structural reforms to enhance the
prospects for long-run growth or address key economic vulnerabilities as discussed in
the 2004 Article IV consultation. Rather, many of the measures that have been
implemented in the last year weakened the macroeconomic policy framework.
•

Reforms stalled in Congress. The Gutierrez government made three unsuccessful
attempts to pass oil sector reforms in Congress, and had two electricity reform
proposals rejected. Congress also rejected (without debating) an omnibus bill
containing proposals for reforms in the oil and electricity sectors, fiscal area, pension
system, labor market, and financial system, many of which were in line with
recommendations of the 2004 Article IV consultation. In December 2005, Congress
again rejected an electricity reform bill that aimed to settle intra-sector debts and
introduce incentives for greater private participation in electricity generation.

•

The overall framework for fiscal policy has weakened. In June, Congress approved
a reform to the fiscal responsibility law (FRL)―sponsored by the new
government―that eliminated the FEIREP oil fund, removing capital spending from
the ceiling on primary expenditure growth, and increasing the earmarking of oil
revenues (Box 1).

•

The actuarial deficit of the pension system has increased. Congress approved a bill
which returns the accumulated assets of the Social Security Institute’s (IESS) reserve
fund to employees every three years.1 In addition to the impact on the actuarial
deficit, the reform potentially complicates liquidity management for the central
government since about half of the IESS’s portfolio is invested in government paper.

1

This supplementary fund, with assets of US$780 million (2¼ percent of GDP), was set up to
finance severance and pension benefits for employees. This reduction in pension system
assets is not matched by a corresponding reduction in pension system obligations to future
retirees.

- 13 -

Box 1. Modifications to the Fiscal Responsibility Law
The authorities’ decision to change the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) was based on a desire to
increase resources for capital and social spending. Even though compliance with the original law was
far from perfect, the June 2005 reform of the FRL weakened the overall framework for promoting
fiscal discipline.
•

•

•

The reform removed capital spending from
the 3.5 percent cap on annual real increases
in central government primary expenditure.
It retains the requirement that the non-oil
fiscal deficit decline by 0.2 percent of GDP
per year, but this provision was violated in
both 2004 and 2005.
It eliminated the FEIREP oil fund,
bringing heavy crude oil revenues into the
budget, and reallocating resources
formerly earmarked for debt buybacks
toward social spending and credits aimed
at reactivating the economy.

Primary Expenditures Real Growth

With more resources being made available
to the budget, the reform has given rise to
new pressures to increase spending.

•

The earmarking of revenues for a host of expenditure categories has increased budget
rigidities—a long concern in Ecuador—relative to the original law.

•

The likelihood of any heavy crude oil revenues being used for external debt buybacks, as
originally intended, was further reduced.

- 14 •

The tax base has been eroded. A government-supported law granting generous tax
incentives to foster investment in various sectors was approved by Congress.2 The
law’s effectiveness to encourage investment is doubtful, but it would weaken the tax
base and complicate tax administration.

•

Some headway was achieved in financial sector reforms. The Superintendency of
Banks tightened up regulations governing capital and liquidity in line with the 2004
FSAP recommendations. Congress approved new anti-money laundering legislation
and passed a law to strengthen the operation of credit bureaus. However, a new
banking law recently sent to Congress by opposition parties raises serious concerns
(Box 2).

Box 2. The Draft Banking Sector Law
The largest party in Congress has sponsored a draft bill that aims to channel more credit
to productive activities and reduce the cost of financial intermediation. In particular, the
draft legislation seeks to:
•

Cap intermediation spreads. The central bank would be required to set a ceiling on
lending rates at 300 basis points above the central bank’s reference rate—the 3-month
prime rate for the corporate sector—and a floor on deposit rates at 70 percent of the
reference rate. All fees and commissions on loans would be abolished.

•

Direct lending to productive activities. Banks would be required to lend at least
75 percent of their deposits to productive sectors and would have to place remaining
deposits in the central bank. The central bank would determine the allocation of credit
among productive sectors based on their share of GDP according to the national
accounts. Banks would be subject to stiff fines for non-compliance.

The authorities concur with the staff that the current draft legislation, if approved, could
result in a sharp reduction in financial intermediation. Moreover, the credit allocation
guidelines would likely undermine prudent credit management, thus threatening the soundness
and stability of the banking system.
Congress is considering modifications to the draft bill. Amidst opposition from the financial
community and warnings from the Superintendency of Banks and the central bank, Congress is
reportedly considering eliminating directed lending from the bill and relaxing intermediation
caps by setting them according to credit type—commercial, mortgage, consumer, and microcredit.

2

The law would provide a 10–12 year tax holiday (on income taxes, custom duties, and
municipal taxes) for new companies undertaking a minimum investment of US$2–7 million
in strategic sectors, including hydroelectricity generation, oil refining, and production of high
technology instruments.

projects real GDP to grow at
2¾ percent, with non-oil GDP
expanding at a similar pace. CPI inflation would fall to 3 percent in 2006, reflecting a
deceleration in credit and government spending growth, while the external current account
deficit would remain at about 1 percent of GDP. The NFPS surplus would rise to 4.9 percent
of GDP, slightly higher than in the authorities’ program, reflecting lower capital spending
which would more than offset somewhat higher current spending.
8.

However, the economic outlook is subject to substantial risks.

•

Spending pressures. The authorities will be challenged to keep recurrent spending
and capital transfers to subnational governments within tight program limits, given
the strong demands for increases from powerful interest groups, and the presence of
large cash holdings from recent credit disbursements. However, such spending
overruns could be partially offset by a lack of institutional capacity to execute the
large capital budget.

•

Oil prices. Given the strong dependence of the budget on oil revenues, a fall in the
price would substantially reduce the financing cushion for the fiscal program: every
US$1 decline in the price of oil would reduce the central government overall balance
by about 0.1 percent of GDP.

•

Inappropriate policy initiatives. The recent legislative changes to the FRL, pension
system and tax incentives, and the banking reform bill now in Congress demonstrate
that the tendency for damaging legislation is high. A continuation of this pattern
could lead to a sudden sharp deterioration in confidence, with possibly serious
spillover effects on the banking system.

9.
In the absence of policies to address underlying vulnerabilities and advance key
growth-enhancing reforms, the medium–term outlook would be characterized by low
growth and an increased susceptibility to shocks that could undermine the
sustainability of the dollarization system (Table 8 and Figure 6).

- 16 •

Low growth. Based on current economic trends, annual real GDP growth would
average about 2¼ percent over the next five years, with oil production trending
downward on account of continued low investment by PetroEcuador and a failure to
establish an attractive regime for new private investment. Limited progress on
structural reforms would likely prevent the non-oil sector from sustaining growth
above its long-run average rate of 2.6 percent, resulting in continued high poverty and
unemployment rates and possibly increased social pressures.

•

Deteriorating fiscal outlook. In the public sector, the NFPS surplus is projected to
decline by 2½ percentage points of GDP over the medium term, large financing gaps
would emerge, and public investment would be crowded out, reflecting gradually
declining oil revenues, continued recurrent spending pressures, and limited access to
credit. Potentially severe cash flow problems would increase the risk of default or a
possible disorderly forced exit from dollarization.

•

Banking system fragility. The reluctance of depositors to lengthen the maturity of
their deposits indicates that the recent improvement in confidence is not yet deeprooted. This increases the likelihood that any worsening in the overall
macroeconomic environment could produce negative spillover effects in the banking
system, which could quickly turn into systemic banking problems because of the
effective absence of deposit insurance or any lender of last resort.

•

Increased susceptibility to shocks. Though the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to
decline gradually, the debt sustainability analysis (Appendix I) shows that in the
event of below-average overall economic performance or lower (but still high)
international oil prices, fiscal and external sustainability problems would likely
resurface.

10.
The staff has prepared an active policy scenario based on a strong effort at fiscal
consolidation and the implementation of key pro-growth structural reforms (Table 9
and Figure 6).
•

In the fiscal area, the non-oil primary deficit would be reduced by between 2–
3 percent of GDP with measures to widen the tax base, lower fuel and pension
subsidies, contain the wage bill in part through civil service reform, and reduce
revenue earmarking. This would allow for a reallocation of spending toward public
investment and social spending while sustaining large primary surpluses which would
be boosted by higher oil revenue from increased production. As a result, public debt
would fall to about 20 percent of GDP by 2010.

•

Real GDP growth would reach 4½ percent in 2010, reflecting efficiency gains from
reforms to public enterprises, better management of the country’s oil resources,
strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework of the banking system, trade
liberalization, and other measures to improve the investment climate.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
While recognizing some positive aspects of recent performance, staff emphasized
that Ecuador should be doing more to take advantage of the favorable external
conditions to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework and advance structural
reforms. The authorities agreed with the need to tighten fiscal discipline in 2006, and to
advance reforms that would underpin improved fiscal management and enhance
competitiveness and the business environment, while stressing the importance of trying to
address Ecuador’s large social needs. Staff recognized the difficult political situation faced
by the authorities and urged them to work to build the necessary consensus to facilitate the
implementation of these reforms.
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
While the recent large decline in public debt is an important step toward
reducing fiscal vulnerabilities, fiscal management remains subject to fundamental
weaknesses that could jeopardize macroeconomic stability and the achievement of
growth and poverty reduction goals. Discussions focused on (i) achieving a strong fiscal
policy outcome in 2006; (ii) improving the fiscal policy framework; and (iii) reducing
vulnerabilities associated with oil dependence and budget inflexibility, while improving
expenditure quality.

authorities’ intention to increase the primary surplus relative to 2005, the mission urged them
to aim for additional savings in order to reduce the non-oil deficit. In particular, the mission
emphasized the need to reduce fuel subsidies and to carefully prioritize projects in the capital
budget.

Global 2012 bonds, which begin amortizing in 2006. These operations would generate
cashflow savings, smooth out the debt amortization profile, and reduce rollover risk.

Improving the fiscal policy framework
15.
The mission recommended that the authorities begin work on a new draft fiscal
responsibility law for the next government. Despite the frequent non-compliance with the
spirit of the original fiscal rules, the mission argued that a strong FRL could serve as an
important institutional tool in support of a strong policy commitment to fiscal discipline and
sustainability. An enhanced FRL should incorporate greater transparency in the fiscal rules
(including in the definitions of target variables such as capital spending or the non-oil
balance) and stronger accountability of the Minister of Finance. A new law should also target
a debt-to-GDP ratio substantially lower than 40 percent in order to lessen vulnerabilities to
oil prices and financing difficulties, and develop a fiscal rule for the non-oil balance that not
only reduced dependence on finite oil wealth but is also consistent with utilizing that wealth
in an intertemporally efficient and equitable manner. Staff estimations suggest that a central
government non-oil primary deficit in the range of 1½–3 percent of GDP (consistent with the
staff’s active scenario) would be consistent with keeping the oil wealth constant in real terms
and reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to safe levels.4 The authorities indicated that they are
preparing proposals to remove inconsistencies among various rules (apart from the FRL) that
affected the budget and agreed to include a review of the FRL in their technical work agenda.

This calculation is highly sensitive to assumptions about key parameters, e.g., the long run
price of oil, and about the rate of return on public investment in human and fixed capital. See
the Selected Issues chapter on fiscal sustainability.

- 20 -

Policies to improve fiscal management
16.
A growing dependence on oil revenues in recent years has made the budget
increasingly vulnerable to a fall in international oil prices. The mission highlighted the
importance of boosting tax revenue through reforms that would simplify and broaden the
base of the tax system, and also enhance economic efficiency. In this context, the mission
regretted the passage of the recent tax incentives legislation but welcomed the authorities’
plans to push ahead with various reforms in 2006, including some that remained incomplete
from the 2003–04 Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund such as (i) strengthening the rules
related to transfer pricing; (ii) introducing a simplified turnover tax for small businesses; and
(iii) eliminating low-yield, administratively cumbersome, taxes. The authorities indicated that
the tax incentives law seeks to increase investment in key, specific sectors, and that their
overall tax reform strategy was geared toward broadening the base and simplifying the
system.
17.
The high degree of budget rigidity in Ecuador has contributed to liquidity
problems, made fiscal policy procyclical, and reduced expenditure quality. To reduce
budget rigidities, it would be crucial to control the growth of the wage bill, including through
a renewed effort at civil service reform.5 A new reform would need to have a more
comprehensive coverage of civil servants and outline specific policies to control the growth
of the wage bill, including through rationalizing public sector employment. It would also be
essential to substantially reduce revenue earmarking, the large subsidies for fuel and
electricity, and government contributions to pensions, all of which are highly distortionary
and very poorly targeted.

The authorities agreed on the need to tackle these problems but want to proceed

investment. Also, the authorities have announced an increase in electricity tariffs beginning
in April 2006, the first such increase since 2003. The mission emphasized that even though
the current government’s ability to advance politically sensitive reforms is likely to be
limited, it was important to begin the groundwork, both in terms of technical work and
consensus building, for broader reforms by the government that will take office in 2007.
19.
Following the changes made by Congress to the pension system in 2005, and a
ruling earlier in the year that portions of the 2001 social security reform were
unconstitutional, the authorities have begun preparations for a comprehensive pension
reform. They agreed that any pension reform should substantially reduce the pension
system’s actuarial deficit and lower the government’s pension contribution, which, at a
required 40 percent of the total pension bill, imposes a heavy burden on the budget and
benefits mostly middle and upper classes. The mission welcomed the fact that the authorities
were in discussions with the Social Security Institute to resolve the government’s outstanding
debt to that agency. The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to design the
pension reform.
B. Long-Run Growth and Competitiveness Issues
20.
Structural reforms that sustain competitiveness and improve the investment
climate are needed to increase long-run economic growth and employment. The
authorities agreed with the mission that policies need to be targeted at enhancing the
petroleum sector, diversifying the export base, reducing vulnerabilities in the fiscal area and
the financial system, increasing the efficiency of public enterprises, trade liberalization, and
containing domestic wage and price pressures.
Enhancing the oil sector
21.
A coherent policy for the development of the oil sector, including a reform of
PetroEcuador, is needed to fulfill the sector’s potential as catalyst for stronger overall
long-term growth (Box 3). Management problems and declining crude production by
PetroEcuador, inadequate refining capacity, frozen domestic prices, and rising imports of oil
products have prevented Ecuador from fully benefiting from the current high international oil
prices. Sizable investment is needed to reverse the output decline of PetroEcuador’s fields
and improve refining capacity. The authorities indicated that they were planning a
comprehensive administrative reform of PetroEcuador (with possible technical assistance
from the World Bank), including an external audit as a key first step. The mission
encouraged the authorities to define a concrete timetable for the implementation of this
reform. The authorities agreed that additional private investment was needed in both
extraction and refining and hoped to soon auction new fields for exploration and exploitation
in coming months. To attract private investment, the mission highlighted the need to
eliminate legal uncertainties and depoliticize the setting of oil derivative prices.

Box 3. Policy Reforms for More Efficient Oil Resource Management
Issues
•

Total production has increased slowly (except for the large increase in 2004) as rising private output has offset a
40 percent decline at PetroEcuador since 1994, which reflects underinvestment, and administrative and
governance problems.

•

Private crude oil production uses only 70 percent of the capacity of the new pipeline but is unlikely to increase
significantly because of relatively low investment (compared to what is needed to substantially boost output),
reflecting (i) uncertainty about the legal framework, especially given outstanding disputes with government on
VAT reimbursement, a charge of contract violation against the largest producer, and the government’s recent
announcement that it wants to renegotiate all contracts; and (ii) lack of new exploration licenses since 1998.

•

Total refining capacity has not increased since the late 1980s because of the problems at PetroEcuador and the
reluctance of the private sector to invest given the
politicized price-setting framework for oil derivatives.

•

Domestic oil derivative prices have been frozen since
early 2003. With unchanged refining capacity and
increased consumption, in part due to cross-border
smuggling to Peru and Colombia (where the retail price
is more than four times higher), import volumes of oil
derivatives have almost doubled in the last 4 years. The
total value of the subsidy1 reached 5¼ percent of GDP
this year, severely reducing Ecuador’s net oil windfall
gain.

Develop a coherent oil sector policy, specifying the
role of PetroEcuador, a strategy for restoring production in PetroEcuador’s light crude oil fields,2 and a plan to
auction new exploration and production licenses for undeveloped Amazon fields.

•

Implement a comprehensive reform of PetroEcuador to improve administrative efficiency, governance, and
transparency. As a first step, undertake a financial audit of the company. Liberalize the domestic fuel market,
involving mainly the deregulation of prices, and the curtailment of PetroEcuador’s monopoly in wholesale
distribution and storage. This would improve the climate for private sector investment in downstream activities
(refining and retail sales).

•

In the planned renegotiation of contracts with oil companies, it will be important to establish clear and
transparent rules for private sector participation in the sector, avoiding ad hoc decisions that may lead to
governance problems.

Competitiveness issues
22.
So far, there is no clear evidence that the dollarization system has been
associated with cost-competitiveness problems, but this should be no reason for
complacency.6 While non-oil export volumes are estimated to have grown strongly in 2005,
and the real exchange rate has declined recently, there are a number of risk factors that could
undermine Ecuador’s competitiveness: (i) further strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to
Ecuador’s main trading partner currencies; (ii) the threat of rising inflationary pressures,
especially if public spending continues to rise fast; and (iii) with low investment, real wages
could rise faster than productivity. Furthermore, Ecuador ranks very low in cross-country

efforts in this area and that discussions were well-advanced.8 They expected the FTA to lockin favorable access to Ecuador’s key export market already provided under a series of
preferential arrangements that could otherwise expire, and also act as a catalyst for important
institutional reforms (e.g., customs reform and investor rights protection), which would
improve the investment climate. The mission agreed that an FTA could bring benefits, but
also encouraged the authorities to continue trade liberalization efforts at the multilateral
level. The mission emphasized the importance of reducing labor market rigidities, including
by eliminating the 15 percent mandatory profit-sharing required from private firms, as crucial
for improving economic efficiency and the investment climate, as well, as promoting
employment growth.

February 2006.

Electricity and telecommunications
24.
Inefficiencies in public enterprises in electricity and telecommunications are a
drain on fiscal resources and an obstacle to growth. In the electricity sector, tariff setting
is highly politicized and distribution companies are poorly managed and generate losses,
putting pressure on the budget and leading to a large accumulation of intra-sector debts.
These problems have deterred private investment in electricity generation, resulting in the
highest generation costs in South America, which hurts competitiveness. The authorities said
that they are taking measures to address these problems, including by putting the
telecommunications and electricity distribution companies under private sector management,
and raising electricity tariffs to substantially reduce the electricity-consumption subsidy from
April 2006. The mission welcomed these initiatives while emphasizing that depoliticizing
tariff-setting decisions was key to attract private management and investment into the sector.
The authorities also indicated that they were continuing to work with Congress to resolve
their differences on the electricity reform bill. While supporting this reform, the mission
urged caution in the design and scope of payment guarantees to private generators to
minimize the risk of the government accumulating sizable liabilities.

The 2004 FSAP noted that
the financial system had become
more resilient since the 1998–99
financial crisis but stressed the need
to reduce remaining vulnerabilities.
The FSAP focused on the need to
improve supervision and regulation;
increase minimum capital
requirements; establish a wellfinanced liquidity fund (to provide
lender-of-last-resort protection) and a
limited-coverage deposit insurance
system; strengthen creditor rights; and
improve bankruptcy procedures to
facilitate and speed up the recovery of
assets by banks. These reforms are
crucial to further improve confidence
in the system to help reduce interest
rates and increase financial
intermediation, which is low by
international standards.

26.
The authorities have developed a detailed work plan to address some of
the FSAP recommendations. Apart from the reforms implemented over the past year
mentioned in paragraph 6, the work plan includes plans to (i) submit to Congress a
bankruptcy and creditors’ rights bill in the first quarter of 2006; (ii) finalize draft legislation
to strengthen the payments system; (iii) continue to implement regulations tightening the

- 25 definition of liquidity and capital; and (iv) develop better risk management practices.
Officials explained that their lack of progress thus far on the FSAP recommendations to set
up an adequately-financed liquidity fund, strengthen the deposit guarantee system, resolve
the issue of frozen deposits, or liquidate the remaining closed banks was mainly the result of
legal obstacles and a difficult political environment.
27.
The mission strongly cautioned against the banking system bill currently in
Congress. The mission emphasized that instead of administrative regulations to determine
interest rates and credit allocation as envisaged in the bill, a durable reduction in interest rates
and expansion of banking sector intermediation would depend on the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability, the reduction of economic vulnerabilities, and progress on the
reform priorities recommended in the FSAP. The authorities also expressed concern about
the bill, and indicated that they were working to correct its shortcomings.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Aided by high international oil prices, Ecuador’s macroeconomic performance
in 2005 was generally positive, exhibiting resilience in the face of a difficult political
environment. The strong growth in the oil sector that followed the completion of the new
pipeline in 2003 has tapered off, but high oil prices have helped bolster sentiment and
underpin growth in the non-oil sector. At the same time, confidence in the financial system
continued to improve, with strong expansion in both deposits and credit and further declines
in interest rates, and public debt has continued to fall. These factors helped Ecuador regain
international market access with the successful placement of a US$650 million bond in
December 2005, the first voluntary international issue since 1997.
29.
Although the short-run outlook remains positive, significant concerns remain
about Ecuador’s policy framework and medium-term outlook. The non-oil deficit has
risen, reflecting difficulties in controlling spending and the rising cost of fuel subsidies.
Moreover, recent structural reforms―most notably the changes to the fiscal responsibility
law, the pension system, and the tax incentives law―have weakened the economic policy
framework. The recent increase in inflation is worrisome.
30.
Given current favorable external conditions, policymakers should be doing more
to address serious underlying vulnerabilities, especially in the fiscal area and the
financial system, and to advance on pro-growth structural reforms. Reforms that reduce
vulnerabilities, sustain competitiveness, and improve the investment climate would also
allow the economy to fully reap the benefits from dollarization, especially low interest rates
and a stable investment and trade environment.
31.
The staff supports the authorities’ goal to strengthen the fiscal policy stance
in 2006 to address recent inflationary pressures and to put the public finances on a
more sustainable track. In particular, it would be important to sustain the restraint on
recurrent spending envisaged in the draft budget, and moderate the planned growth in capital
expenditures. The authorities would need to firmly resist pressures for more spending,
including finding offsets to Congress’s changes to the draft budget, which are likely to
intensify in the lead up to the October 2006 elections. In this context, it will be key for the

- 26 authorities to adhere to their commendable plans to use proceeds from the recent bond issue
strictly for debt management purposes.
32.
To enhance fiscal sustainability over the medium term, it will be important to
strengthen the institutional framework for promoting fiscal discipline, reduce
dependence on oil revenue, increase budget flexibility, and improve the quality of
government spending. The authorities should consider redesigning the FRL to target a debtto-GDP ratio substantially lower than 40 percent; increase transparency in the fiscal rules;
improve accountability; and strengthen compatibility of the fiscal rules with the efficient use
of the country’s oil wealth. The staff welcomes the authorities’ plans in the area of tax reform
to eliminate exemptions, broaden the tax base, and simplify the tax system. To reduce budget
rigidity and improve spending quality, significant reductions in revenue earmarking and in
poorly-targeted subsidies are crucial. In this context, the authorities are urged to move
quickly to reduce the cooking gas subsidy and prepare for a substantial reduction of all other
fuel subsidies while strengthening the social-safety net to protect vulnerable groups. It will
also be important to develop a coherent civil service reform to control wage costs, and to
move ahead with plans to reform the pension system. As resources are freed up for capital
and social spending, it will be necessary to improve procedures for evaluating, prioritizing,
and monitoring projects so as to ensure high standards of efficiency.
33.
A coherent policy for the development of the oil sector, including a
comprehensive reform of PetroEcuador, is long overdue, and will be key to ensure that
the oil sector fulfills its potential as a catalyst for stronger overall long-term growth. A
first step will be to define a timetable for the administrative reforms at PetroEcuador,
including the external financial audit of the company, and the auctioning of oil fields to
private investors. The authorities also need to develop and implement an investment plan to
reverse the decline in PetroEcuador’s crude production and strengthen refining capacity. To
attract greater private investment to the sector, it will be important to eliminate legal
uncertainties and strengthen the regulatory framework. In the case of refining, plans to attract
private investment would also require liberalization of the domestic oil derivatives market,
including depoliticizing price setting, and phasing out PetroEcuador’s monopoly in the
wholesale market.
34.
The authorities are urged to follow through on the 2004 FSAP recommendations
to address banking system vulnerabilities while improving the efficiency of the system
and achieving a durable reduction in interest rates. Ongoing efforts to improve
supervision and regulation are to be commended, and the staff also welcomes plans to
strengthen the payments system and bankruptcy procedures for the quick recovery of assets
by banks. However, reforms to create an effective deposit insurance system and to enable the
central bank to provide an adequate lender-of-last-resort facility are vital to enhance the
stability of the financial system. At the same time, the government should strongly oppose
the banking reform bill to introduce administrative controls on interest-rate spreads and credit
allocation currently being debated in Congress, including through presidential veto, if
necessary.
35.
Competitiveness remains a concern in the context of the dollarized economy.
While there is no clear evidence that dollarization has been associated with costcompetitiveness problems to date, it is crucial that macroeconomic policy focuses on

- 27 reducing recent inflationary pressures. Ecuador’s narrow commodity-heavy export base, and
low rankings in international competitiveness assessments highlight the need for reforms to
raise economic efficiency and improve the investment climate. In this context, the staff
endorsed plans to contract private management for public enterprises in electricity
distribution and telecommunications, reduce electricity subsidies, and settle electricity intrasector debts. While these measures will also help attract private investment in lower-cost
electricity generation, it will be crucial to depoliticize the setting of electricity tariffs,
allowing them to reflect costs. The staff viewed positively the authorities’ efforts to finalize
an FTA with the United States, which apart from improving market access could catalyze
reforms in governance and legal security, where Ecuador scores very low in business-climate
surveys. The staff also stressed the importance of increasing labor market flexibility and
improving customs to further raise economic efficiency and improve the investment climate.
36.
The lagging reform agenda has become ever more urgent as time has gone by
without its implementation. Many of these reforms imply confronting powerful vested
interests and changing long-established relations between the government and the private
sector, and between the private sector and the rest of the world. These obstacles have been
compounded by the lack of a strong political base or congressional representation by
successive governments. It will therefore be crucial for the authorities to devise an effective
strategy to build the necessary consensus in favor of this reform agenda, and in this context,
they should endeavor to place these issues at the forefront of next year’s election campaign
discussions.
37.
Data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall but the statistical
base remains uneven. In particular, there are shortcomings in certain areas of the balance of
payments statistics, the fiscal accounts, and labor market data. The authorities have requested
technical assistance from STA in the area of balance of payments and have expressed interest
in having an update of the ROSC in FY2007. Ecuador has subscribed to the SDDS.
38.
Ecuador maintains an exchange restriction in the form of blocked deposits in
closed banks. Since there exists no formal timetable to resolve the problem, staff does not
recommend Board approval of this restriction.
39.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Ecuador will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in
the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also
shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary

3/ A permanent decline of the oil prices (WTI) to US$40 and 10 percent of GDP shock to
contingent liabilities occur in 2006. The standard scenario assuming 30 percent real depreciation is
excluded because Ecuador uses dollar as its legal tender.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On February 12, 1999 the central bank abandoned the exchange rate band and floated the
sucre. On March 9, 2000 the economy was dollarized at 25,000 sucres per U.S. dollar.
Ecuador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. However,
Ecuador maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII,
Section 2(a) in the form of a freeze on demand and savings deposits in closed banks. This
exchange restriction was approved by the Executive Board on March 21, 2003 until
December 31, 2003.
X. Last Article IV Consultation and Recent Contacts:
On July 26, 2004, the Executive Board concluded the 2004 Article IV Consultation. The
authorities requested to continue with an intensified surveillance of their policies, and in
this context missions visited Quito in December 2004, and May and August 2005.

The Bank engagement in Ecuador remains in the Base Case scenario (US$250 million per
year: US$100 million for adjustment and $150 million for investment). In the last two FYs,
the Bank has approved three projects, all of which are not yet signed: PRODEPINE II
(US$36 million in FY04—and is now cancelled); Institutional Reform (US$30 million in
FY04—being redesigned by increasing component by approximately $30 million); and the
Fiscal Consolidation Programmatic (US$100 million in FY05—currently on hold due to

policy reversals on the program supported by the loan). There are three investment operations
and one adjustment operation planned for FY06: Rural Roads (US$20 million—has been in
the pipeline for the last three FYs), Education (US$35 million), Bono de Desarrollo Humano
(currently being defined), and Human Development Programmatic (US$100 million—
slipped from last year).

The Bank’s pipeline for 2005–06 provides for a lending program of eleven operations
totaling U$320 million, and a non-reimbursable technical cooperation program of
approximately US$8 million. The IDB supports the Government of Ecuador’s efforts to
increase productivity, to improve social programs for the most vulnerable groups and to
enhance the quality of public sector administration. The Bank is completing the
preparation of a fast-disbursing programmatic loan for US$100 million to improve
competitiveness as well as investment loans in areas such as tourism, potable water, the
environment, rehabilitation of urban infrastructure, and natural-disaster prevention.

APPENDIX VI

ECUADOR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
In spite of shortcomings, macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Ecuador subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in March 1998, and
meets the specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data categories. An
advance release calendar and the metadata for Ecuador are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. A data ROSC module was completed in
March 2003.
Real sector
Two series of national accounts (NA) are being compiled using 1975 and 1993 as base years
and following the methodology of the 1968 SNA and 1993 SNA, respectively. Following a
data ROSC mission in April 2002, the authorities published, at the end of that year, GDP
series for the period 1993–2001 in current and constant 2000 dollars. The authorities have
been planning to extend this series to 1965, but this has not been completed. Preliminary
quarterly NA is being reported with about a three-month lag. The authorities think that
deficiencies remain in the NA, and have asked for technical assistance. Publication of a
monthly producer price index (PPI) started in 1998. Labor market data have become more
available—monthly surveys are done by a private university while the national statistics
bureau does a more comprehensive annual survey. Published survey results include
employment, unemployment, participation rates, and some private sector wage data. Reliable
data on public sector employment are still unavailable.
Government finance
The compilation and reporting of central government data deteriorated following problems
with the introduction of a new information system (SIGEF). Above-the-line data for some
nonfinancial public sector entities continue to suffer from long reporting lags and unreliable
information. When ownership of public companies was transferred to the Solidarity Fund
in 1999, financial information on these companies was no longer recorded. In addition, data
on the operations of local governments are only available on an annual basis.
The resumption of reporting annual data on the budgetary central government for publication
in the GFS Yearbook is highly recommended. The most recently reported annual GFS data
were for 1994.
Monetary accounts
A major effort was undertaken in 2000 by the central bank, with Fund support, to adapt the
presentation of its balance sheet to the requirements of official dollarization. Remaining
issues were resolved during a monetary and financial statistics mission in March 2004.
The 2004 mission concluded that with the introduction of a sectorization matrix
(supplementary information to the one obtained through commercial banks’ balance sheets),

- 50 -

APPENDIX VI

the quality of the sectorization of financial instruments and the distinction between residents
and nonresident accounts is adequate. Furthermore, public sector deposits are properly
identified in the sectoral balance sheet of depository corporations, as compiled by the mission
in collaboration with the authorities. Finally, data on offshore banks are currently being
compiled following the same high quality standards as the onshore banks, but have yet to
become available.
External sector
Balance of payment and international investment position (IIP) statistics are compiled and
disseminated by the CBE. Ecuador, a SDDS subscriber since March 1998, also reports
according to the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity,
and began disseminating quarterly data on the SDDS prescribed external debt data category
(with a one-quarter lag) in June 2003. In August 2001, a STA mission assisted the authorities
in resolving a number of technical issues regarding the international reserves template.
Currently, Ecuador reports to STA quarterly balance of payments statistics as well as annual
IIP data for publication in IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. In
October 2002, the authorities reported quarterly balance of payments statistics for the
period 1993–2001 as well as annual IIP data for the period 1993–2001. The data are mainly
compiled according to the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5).
The IIP data were prepared with the assistance of a STA mission that visited Quito in
July 2002. The mission recommended improvement in the estimates of travel services,
introducing surveys of direct investment and portfolio investment, improvement in the
recording of external debt transactions, and recording of reserve assets. The mission also
made recommendations for further improvements in the compilation of the IIP. While the
recording of balance of payments transactions has improved, some deficiencies remain,
particularly in the estimation of profit remittances, non-oil direct investment, and private
capital flows. The authorities have requested technical assistance to address these issues.
STA, with the support of WHD, is considering sending a TA mission on balance of payments
statistics in early FY 2007.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Ecuador
January 25, 2006
Since the issuance of the staff report, Mr. Diego Borja has replaced Ms. Magdalena Barreiro
as finance minister in the Palacio government. A staff team visited Quito on January 17–18,
2006 to meet with Mr. Borja to discuss his policy approach. Additional information has also
become available on inflation. The information in this statement does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
1.
Inflation ended the year higher than anticipated. The 12-month CPI inflation rate
increased to 4.4 percent (projected inflation was 4.0 percent) in December 2005, largely
reflecting surging housing rent inflation and education costs.
2.
The new minister of finance, Mr. Diego Borja, is committed to an economic
program that broadly maintains the same lines as that of his predecessor described in
the staff report.
•

In discussion with staff, the Minister emphasized the authorities’ firm commitment to
fiscal discipline and to orient fiscal policy toward reducing recent inflation pressures.
He noted that the President had signed a decree to cut spending by 1 percent of GDP
from the budget approved by Congress (with cuts in recurrent spending across
ministries and the cancellation of low-priority capital projects), to bring overall
central government spending back in line with the government’s original budget
proposal. The authorities’ new fiscal target for 2006 is consistent with the staff
report’s recommended nonfinancial primary surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP. The
minister also reiterated the authorities’ intention to use excess financial resources to
repurchase high-interest external debt and short-term domestic debt.

•

The minister outlined plans to strengthen fiscal transparency and expenditure
management. In particular, he stated that the government would establish
mechanisms to improve the governance, transparency, and public accountability for
funds earmarked in the Fiscal Responsibility Law, so as to ensure that they would be
used to finance only projects of the highest quality. The staff endorsed efforts to
strengthen the oversight of these funds but expressed concern over the important role
planned for the public banks in this process, especially given their poor past record in
areas of governance and administration.

•

No significant changes have been made to existing reform proposals in the oil,
electricity, and telecommunications sectors, the financial system, or in trade policy.
The authorities plan to continue their preparatory work in the area of tax reform and
the reduction of fuel subsidies, although the minister felt that it was unlikely, given
the delicate political situation, that the government would launch any initiatives
before the October elections.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Ecuador
On January 25, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Ecuador.1
Background
Despite a difficult political environment, economic growth is estimated to have exceeded
3 percent in 2005, with the non-oil sector expanding by 3½ percent. The strong growth in the
oil sector that followed the completion of the new oil pipeline in 2003 has tapered off, but high
oil prices have helped bolster confidence and underpin domestic demand.
However, employment growth remains sluggish, with little change in unemployment from 2004.
After declining in early 2005, inflation picked up in the second half of the year. The 12-month
headline inflation rose from 2 percent in June 2005 to 4.4 percent at the end of the year, in a
context of strong growth in bank credit and public spending.
In recent years, non-financial public sector (NFPS) primary surpluses have been maintained
consistently above 4 percent of GDP, reflecting mainly high oil revenues, which have helped to
reduce public debt from over 90 percent of GDP at end-2000 to 43 percent of GDP at end2005. However, the underlying fiscal stance weakened in 2005. While the primary surplus of
the NFPS is projected at 4.2 percent of GDP, the non-oil deficit is projected to have increased
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2to 5 percent of GDP in 2005, driven by the growing cost of fuel subsidies and the continued
rapid expansion of recurrent spending, especially on wages and pensions.
The external current account deficit is estimated to have remained unchanged at about
1 percent of GDP, reflecting rapid import growth which offset strong increases in oil and non-oil
exports led by shrimp and metal products. While oil sector FDI inflows increased, non-oil FDI
remained low in 2005, at less than 1 percent of GDP.
Banking system credit and deposits grew strongly in 2005, while liquidity remained at
comfortable levels and other stability indicators continued to improve. Moreover, there was no
evidence of spillover effects on deposits or on interest rates from political developments.
However, banking intermediation is still well below pre-crisis levels and deposits are
overwhelmingly at short maturities.
The authorities successfully regained access to international capital markets with a
US$650 million bond issue in December 2005. The EMBI spread declined in the past year,
but remains the widest among Latin American countries.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the Ecuadoran authorities for lowering inflation to
international levels and reducing substantially the ratio of public debt to GDP.
These achievements, together with high international prices for Ecuador’s oil exports,
have contributed to a generally positive macroeconomic performance and increasing
confidence in 2005, which was reflected in the successful placement by Ecuador of an
international bond in December 2005. Directors acknowledged the resilience of the economy
in the face of the difficult political environment.
Directors expressed concern, however, about the broader orientation of policies. In particular,
the non-oil fiscal deficit has increased significantly, reflecting mainly the rising cost of fuel
subsidies and difficulties in controlling recurrent spending. Recent changes in the fiscal
responsibility law, the pension system, and the new tax incentives legislation risk weakening
the macroeconomic policy framework. Directors urged the authorities to take advantage of the
current favorable external environment to address underlying vulnerabilities, especially in the
fiscal area and the financial system, to ensure long-run macroeconomic stability, strong and
sustained growth, and increasing job opportunities.
Directors commended the authorities for their plan to strengthen the fiscal policy stance
in 2006 to address the recent increase in inflationary pressures and to put the public finances
on a more sustainable track. They supported the authorities’ intention to restrain recurrent
spending, strictly prioritize capital and social spending, and take steps to ensure that projects
are evaluated, prioritized, and monitored effectively. Directors urged the authorities to resist
pressures for more spending in the pre-election period, and welcomed their plans to use
proceeds from the recent international bond issue only for debt management purposes.

-3Directors stressed the need to strengthen the institutional framework for promoting fiscal
discipline, reduce dependence on oil revenue, increase budget flexibility, and improve the
quality of government spending. Most called for a redesign of the fiscal responsibility law to
target a lower debt-to-GDP ratio, improve transparency in the fiscal rules, increase
accountability, and encourage the efficient use of the country’s oil wealth. The authorities
should follow through on plans for tax reform, in particular to eliminate exemptions, broaden
the tax base, and simplify the tax system. Directors emphasized the importance of developing
a coherent civil service reform to control wage costs, and of moving ahead with plans to reform
the pension system and set it on a sound actuarial foundation. They supported the authorities’
request for Fund technical assistance on the pension reform. Directors recommended that
highly distortional fuel subsidies be reduced substantially and that the social safety net to
protect the most vulnerable groups be strengthened to help them cope with the subsidy cuts.
Directors welcomed the ongoing efforts to improve financial sector supervision and regulation,
including the progress already made in implementing some of the 2004 Financial Sector
Assessment Program recommendations. They urged the authorities to move ahead with other
FSAP recommendations to strengthen the banking system, which will help to improve
efficiency and achieve a durable reduction in interest rates. Directors welcomed the recent
passage of anti-money laundering legislation and a law to strengthen credit bureaus, and the
plans to strengthen the payment system and bankruptcy procedures. At the same time, they
stressed the need to develop an effective deposit insurance system and a mechanism to
provide an adequate lender-of-last-resort function. Also, outstanding issues from the 1998–99
banking crisis need to be resolved, in particular the liquidation of the remaining closed banks,
and the return of deposits frozen in these banks. While agreeing that the high costs of
intermediation and constraints on access to credit need to be addressed, Directors expressed
grave concerns about the provisions in the banking reform bill that would introduce
administrative controls on interest-rate spreads and the allocation of credit, as these could
stifle the needed expansion of financial intermediation and jeopardize banking system stability.
Directors observed that a significant intensification of structural reforms will be needed to
sustain competitiveness, improve the investment climate, and strengthen the economy’s
resilience to adverse shocks. Slow progress on key structural reforms is preventing the
economy from reaping the full benefits of dollarization—in particular, low interest rates and a
stable investment and trade environment—and could threaten the sustainability of the
dollarization regime in the future.
Directors agreed that a high priority should be given to developing the petroleum sector,
including through a comprehensive reform of PetroEcuador. They urged the authorities to
define a timetable for administrative reforms at PetroEcuador, including the external financial
audit of the company, and the auctioning of new fields for exploration and extraction. It will also
be important to eliminate legal uncertainties and strengthen the regulatory framework in the
petroleum sector, and to ensure market-based price setting for oil refining and retailing, in
order to attract the needed increase in private investment to the sector.
Directors observed that the formal dollarization of Ecuador’s economy poses a challenge to
maintaining competitiveness, and highlights the importance of raising economic efficiency,

-4increasing labor market flexibility, and improving the investment climate. In that context,
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to contract with the private sector for the
management of the public enterprises in the electricity distribution and telecommunications
areas. They noted that, to attract more private investment for the essential expansion of
electricity generating capacity, electricity subsidies will need to be reduced and intra-sector
debts resolved as planned, and electricity tariffs will have to be set to reflect real generation
and distribution costs.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to finalize a free trade agreement with the United
States, which, apart from promoting increased trade and competition, could improve the
investment climate. Directors urged the authorities to continue to support multilateral trade
liberalization initiatives as well.
Directors noted that data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance, but encouraged
the authorities to continue to address remaining shortcomings, including in certain areas of the
balance of payments statistics, fiscal accounts, and labor market data. They welcomed
Ecuador’s participation in the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with Ecuador may be made available at a
later stage if the authorities consent.

Statement by Eduardo Loyo, Executive Director for Ecuador
January 25, 2006

1.
I would like thank staff for a well-balanced set of papers, which my Ecuadorian
authorities have agreed to publish in accordance with the Fund’s policy on corrections and
deletions. My authorities have also expressed their intention to maintain the current practice
of quarterly consultations with the Fund staff.
Recent macroeconomic developments
2.
Since the last Article IV consultation in July 2004, most economic indicators have
evolved in a favorable manner, a reflection of enhanced confidence and a supportive external
environment. Real GDP growth surpassed 3 percent in 2005, following a very strong
performance in 2004, when it reached 6.9 percent. Notably, while 2004 growth had been
mainly driven by the oil sector, non-oil GDP is expected to have grown faster than the
aggregate in 2005, by 3.5 percent.
3.
Inflation remains low, in spite of some acceleration over the last few months – CPI
inflation closed 2005 at 4.4 percent, compared to 2 percent in 2004. It must be borne in mind
that this acceleration has taken place against a background of convergence to inflation rates
observed in the US – a critical element in a dollarized economy – which had actually ended
with Ecuadorian inflation running for several months below US rates. As staff rightly
observes, the recent pick-up in inflation has not implied a perceptible loss of competitiveness
vis-à-vis the US. In fact, there has been a boost to Ecuador’s competitive position with respect
to regional trading partners experiencing important nominal appreciations against the dollar.
Since 2003, the real effective exchange rate has depreciated by nearly 10 percent. The
December 2005 Inflation Report by the Central Bank of Ecuador indicates that “imported”
inflation – resulting from nominal effective depreciation together with the inflation of trading
partners – has had a noticeable influence on the recent price dynamics of tradeable goods in
Ecuador.
4.
It should also be noted that residential rents have been a key driver of the recent
acceleration of inflation. Rents responded single-handedly for no less than 60 percent of the
yearly inflation observed in 2005. Rental increases were not only unmatched by other
nontradeable items in the consumption basket but were also very unevenly distributed across
different areas of the country and types of residence. The causes of such a localized
phenomenon are not entirely clear, but they would presumably involve elements of a
microeconomic nature.
5.
To reach a thorough understanding of the recent inflationary phenomenon in Ecuador,
one ought to examine these localized and imported pressures alongside other possible
suspects, including growth in credit and fiscal spending. Such examination would shed
important light on what could have reasonably been achieved in 2005 with a counterfactual
stance towards aggregate demand. Anyway, my authorities are fully cognizant of the

-2importance of controlling fiscal spending in 2006 in order to avoid a build-up of demand
pressures on inflation and to rein in the propagation of any exogenous inflationary shocks.
6.
Enormous efforts to maintain a prudent fiscal policy have been a critical element in
the authorities’ strategy to consolidate macroeconomic stability and enhance private sector
confidence. Staff indicates that the non-oil primary balance has deteriorated between 2003
and 2005, with the deficit of the central government increasing from 1 percent to 3 percent of
GDP. It must be noted, however, that the net contribution of domestic sales of petroleum
derivatives (which are classified as non-oil revenues) alone, during that period, fell by a total
of 2.2 percentage points of GDP. This deteriorating component reflects the fact that domestic
prices of petroleum derivatives have not been kept in alignment with international prices, a
policy followed by several countries besides Ecuador when their social safety nets are unable
to provide the poor with targeted relief from soaring energy costs. This component of the
government’s net spending would be automatically scaled back in tandem with a drop in
international oil prices, a crucial consideration for any assessment of the budget’s overall
vulnerability to oil revenue fluctuations.
7.
My authorities, however, recognize as imperative to keep in check the increase in the
non-oil deficit, as witnessed most recently by the President’s Executive Decree of January 13
reducing the projected 2006 budget deficit by US$316 million. They are also aware of the
inherently distortionary character of the subsidies to oil derivatives. Regarding the latter, they
consider a bottom-up approach to raising public awareness about the inefficiency and inequity
of the subsidies to be a critical first step that could, under more propitious political conditions,
eventually lead to their reduction. Accordingly, they will encourage and support civil society
initiatives to put the theme in the public domain and help disseminate the necessary
information.
8.
The non-financial public sector (NFPS) has been consistently posting primary
surpluses between 4 and 5 percent of GDP, and its overall surplus has hovered around 2
percent of GDP. As a result, the public debt burden has been declining and is set to continue
to do so. The net debt of the NFPS is projected to have closed 2005 at 34 percent of GDP,
down 4 percentage points from 2004, 11 percentage points from 2003, and a staggering 30
percentage points since 2001. Evidently, the fiscal position could have been even better if the
recent upsurge in oil prices had been allowed to reflect itself in an improved overall primary
surplus. My authorities are well aware of the policy options they have been facing in the fiscal
front in the recent past. On the one hand, there is the option favored by staff of devoting most
of if not all the oil windfall to increase the overall primary surplus and to further accelerate
the process of fiscal consolidation and debt reduction. The technical merits of such an option
are evident. However, it is a course of action that seldom passes the test of political reality,
and understandably so in countries like Ecuador, where the fiscal indicators are reckoned by
staff to be “generally superior” among Latin American and emerging market economies
(Selected Issues, chapter I, paragraph 29), debt reduction is already making considerable
progress, and dire social needs renders it very challenging to maintain expenditure constant in
face of buoyant oil prices.

-39.
Foreign financial conditions have been favorable, and Ecuador has made good use of
them. In late 2005, and for the first time in eight years, the government successfully placed a
10-year global bond for $595 million. The proceeds of this issuance are to be entirely devoted
to repaying or buying back other debt obligations. Notwithstanding the rapid rate of growth of
imports, the external current account deficit has remained stable, at only around 1 percent of
GDP, comfortably financed by both oil and non-oil FDI.
10.
In the domestic financial front, the most salient feature has been the robust increase in
bank deposits, a clear sign of confidence in the financial system in general, and in the
sustainability of dollarization in particular. As a result, credit to the private sector continues in
a salutary process of recovery from the contraction caused by the 1999 banking crisis, in a
context of declining non-performing loans and continuous increase in the capital-to-assets
ratio. Credit has not yet rebounded completely from the losses associated with the crisis, and
the recovery of financial intermediation, if anything, had been deemed too slow. It is in that
light that one should assess the acceleration in credit growth observed in 2005, bearing in
mind also that the Ecuadorian economy displays one of the lowest ratios of credit to GDP
among comparable economies in the region – regional standards being themselves far from
stellar – and that enhancing financial intermediation remains a key policy objective.
Structural reforms
11.
While the extremely complicated political situation has not derailed the government’s
efforts at consolidating macroeconomic stability, it has certainly played a decisive role in
delaying the reform agenda. The limited action that has taken place in that front is the direct
result of the difficulties faced by a government that does not hold a majority in Congress – it
is actually not affiliated with any political party – when most structural reforms require
congressional approval and the political climate is hotly contested. In all candor, my
authorities admit that the electoral calendar – with general elections scheduled for October –
is unlikely to make the political situation any easier over the coming months.
12.
The reform agenda is long and I shall not delve into the many items on the merits of
which staff and my authorities broadly agree, and which were endorsed by the Executive
Board during the last Article IV consultation. As staff reports, the authorities are ready to
advance preparatory technical work on a number of items, relying in some cases on technical
assistance from the Fund and from other multilateral institutions. Broader overtures in the
attempt to build social consensus, however, would need to be managed with care in order not
to jam the political radar screen and to prevent negative partisan positions towards specific
reforms from becoming overly crystallized if caught into the heat of the electoral debate.
13.
My authorities feel, however, that important clarifications are in order regarding the
changes made to the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) and to the Social Security Institute’s
(IESS) reserve fund, both of which, staff contends, amounted to a serious weakening of the
overall fiscal framework. First of all, with respect to the decision to return assets in the IESS
reserve fund to employees after three years, it is important to clarify that this was by no means
a government initiative. On the contrary, given the decision of Congress, the government did

-4all it could to mitigate the adverse fiscal implications by setting up a manageable schedule for
the mandated transfers.
14.
With regard to the FRL, it is imperative to bear in mind that prior to the changes
introduced in 2005, the law established (i) a declining ceiling on public debt; (ii) a path for the
non-oil fiscal deficit; (iii) a ceiling on the rate of growth of primary expenditure. Only the
latter restriction was partially modified, with the cap now applying to the rate of growth of
current expenditure. With the interlocking checks on debt, deficits and expenditures that
remain in force, my authorities are confident that further satisfactory progress in fiscal
consolidation will not be jeopardized by the extra degree of freedom targeted at investment
spending.
15.
On the elimination of the FEIREP oil fund, also part of the FRL amendment, a few
clarifications are also in order. Originally, the purpose of FEIREP was to devote 70 percent of
its resources to retire debt, 20 percent for stabilization, and the rest for social expenditure.
This administration opted for a different arrangement that calls for resources to be
incorporated into the budget, to finance debt buybacks, investment projects and social
spending. It should be noted that, when FEIREP was eliminated, there were no accumulated
resources in the stabilization account, and the debt retirement account had been repeatedly
used to finance spending, through operations in which debt was formally retired with FEIREP
funds but an equivalent amount returned right away to the government’s coffers in exchange
for newly issued debt. Multiple reasons lie behind the decision to eliminate FEIREP, but first
and foremost the need to address critical expenditure needs both in the social sectors and with
regard to public infrastructure. To this effect, the government has been faithful to its
commitment not to use any of the funds to finance wages and pensions.
16.
My authorities consider the modifications in the FRL – including the elimination of
FEIREP – instrumental to make budgetary management viable under strict compliance with
these legal provisions, to which they are fully committed. Ensuring that the additional
revenues brought on-budget will be put to the most efficient use – including debt retirement –
is certainly a challenge of which they are aware. Meeting that challenge has been placed at the
very top of their priority list, and the authorities are on record stating so much in no uncertain
terms. To that effect, the Ministry of the Economy is currently designing procedures to ensure
that ex-FEIREP resources are allocated on a competitive basis and in accordance with
economic merit rather than political pressure. The intention is to put in place safeguards that
will effectively protect these funds from the imperfections in the preexisting system of
resource allocation, including those pointed out by staff with respect to the operations of the
public development banks – their improvement being itself another top priority of the
economic team. The government has declared that these resources will not be allocated until
adequate safeguards are in place.
17.
Regarding the financial sector, my authorities are in the process of addressing many of
the issues highlighted in the 2004 FSAP. Recently, the banking superintendency has tightened
regulations regarding capital and liquidity, and Congress approved legislation strengthening
credit bureaus and incorporating a new AML framework. The authorities also agree with staff
on the deleterious effects of the financial sector reform recently proposed in Congress, a

-5reform that caps intermediation spreads and directs lending to specific productive activities.
While it is certainly the case that intermediation spreads remain high and that some sectors
rightly complain about difficulties in accessing credit, the government fully understands that
the remedies proposed by Congress will likely make matters worse, not better. The Ministry
of the Economy, the Central Bank of Ecuador and the Internal Revenue Service are joining
forces to design policies capable of addressing legitimate concerns about high bank spreads
and service fees without negatively impacting the solidity and efficiency of the financial
sector.
Medium-term outlook
18.
My authorities take note of the medium-term scenarios presented by staff, and agree
with their broad qualitative features despite the huge uncertainty necessarily surrounding any
attempt to turn such scenarios into quantitative forecasts. In particular, they acknowledge that
growth would be considerably enhanced by progress in key reforms, and that faster growth
would translate into higher fiscal revenue and a faster decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. They
are heartened, though, by the conclusion that the debt burden would continue declining even
in the no-reform scenario, reaching just over 30 percent of GDP in 2010. While important to
consolidate confidence in the resilience of fiscal consolidation, that conclusion is obviously
no grounds for complacency since any rate of growth similar to that forecasted in the passive
scenario would fall way short of what Ecuador requires to make a serious dent on poverty and
unemployment. That being the case, my authorities reiterate their commitment to
macroeconomic stability and to make every effort to advance the reform agenda –albeit in an
adverse political context that should not be conducive to great progress in the short run.
