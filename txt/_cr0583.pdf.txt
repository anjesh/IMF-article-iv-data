SOCIALIST PEOPLE’S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with the
Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
Approved by Lorenzo L. Perez and Anthony R. Boote
January 4, 2005
•

Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation were held in Tripoli during October 9–21, 2004.
The staff team comprised Messrs. Elhage (head), Abdoun, Bailen, and Ms. Farhan (all MCD);
and Mr. El Qorchi (MFD).

•

The mission met with Prime Minister Ghanem, Secretary of Finance El-Huwej, Secretary of
Planning Jehaimi, Central Bank Governor Menesi, Deputy Governor Ekdara, Mr. Saif Al-Islam
Qadhafi, son of the Libyan Leader, and other senior officials.

•

At the conclusion of the last consultation on August 18, 2003, Executive Directors commended
the Libyan authorities for the reforms taken since the freezing of the UN sanctions in 1999 and
emphasized the need to implement key reforms as part of a medium-term policy framework.
They noted that, in the short run, the reform agenda should aim at improving macroeconomic
management, removing remaining trade restrictions, bringing domestic prices in line with world
prices, and addressing explicitly in the budget the impact of price realignments on vulnerable
groups and public enterprises. In a second stage, structural reforms that require longer technical
preparations would need to be implemented. Directors also acknowledged the close collaboration
with staff during the 2003 Article IV consultation mission and supported Libya’s requests for
technical assistance from the Fund.

•

In June 2003, Libya formally notified the Fund of its decision to accept its obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The standard review,
by MFD and LEG, of Libya’s exchange system is currently underway. The Libyan dinar is
pegged to the SDR.

•

Libya’s statistical base suffers from important shortcomings in the quality, coverage, timeliness,
and consistency of data that need to be addressed. All of these have hampered the staff’s ability
to conduct the relevant economic analysis and effective surveillance.

•

Libya’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank are summarized in Appendices I and II,
respectively. Data issues are covered in Appendix III, and Appendix IV summarizes the main
staff recommendations in the monetary area.

•

The authorities intend to publish the staff report and issue a PIN following the conclusion of the
consultation process.

Executive Summary
Developments in 2003–04
In 2003–04, reflecting the favorable developments in the world oil market, Libya’s fiscal and current
account balances registered large surpluses. While oil production increased markedly, the nonhydrocarbon
sector grew only modestly, and CPI inflation remained negative. Limited progress was made on structural
reform, but the government did adopt laws to encourage private investment. Banking supervision was
strengthened and a new draft law aiming at enhancing the role of the central bank is under consideration.

Views of the authorities
The authorities agreed with the staff that higher growth rates and diversification of the Libyan economy
could only be achieved through deregulation, a significant scaling down of the dominant role of the public
sector, and the development of the private sector. However, they indicated that, given Libya’s political
structure, their preferred approach to reform was a one-sector-at-a-time piecemeal approach. They
expressed strong interest in having the Fund and the World Bank take the leading roles in assisting them
in formulating strategies to reform the economy.

Staff appraisal
Libya’s macroeconomic position is projected to remain strong over the medium term. However, projected
growth rates under the current policy stance would not be sufficient to generate employment opportunities
for the new entrants to the labor force. Given the complementarity of structural reforms, staff
recommended the development of a comprehensive and well-sequenced economic reform program. The
latter could focus in the short run on strengthening budgetary management, developing market-based
monetary instruments, and restructuring the banking system. More profound structural measures that
require significant technical preparation and consensus building could be gradually implemented at a later
stage. Given its weak institutions and the serious human capacity constraints, Libya will need substantial
technical assistance to undertake and implement such a reform program.
Staff stressed that a prudent fiscal policy will remain key to maintaining macroeconomic and financial
stability. Although the fiscal position is projected to remain comfortable, the structure of the budget will
need to be rationalized through streamlining of expenditures and improving the efficiency of the tax
system. In this context, it is important to amend the new tax law as recommended by FAD, avoid extrabudgetary spending, strengthen expenditure management and control, reform the subsidy system, and
increase transparency in government operations.
The central bank of Libya is urged to increase its reliance on indirect monetary management and
implement MFD’s recommendations on banking supervision and monetary policy operations. The
appropriateness of the exchange rate level and regime will need to be monitored as structural and
macroeconomic reforms progress. Also, greater efforts to address statistical deficiencies and improve the
timeliness and quality of data are required.
Staff expressed its regrets that Libya will not be participating in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative. It stressed that the success of the HIPC Initiative will require the participation of all
creditors, including Libya.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Background
1.
Libya is generously endowed with energy resources, but has one of the less
diversified economies in the Maghreb region and even among the oil producing
countries. In the early 1970s, Libya opted for a socialist state and a command economy.
Investment was essentially state-driven and trade and price controls, along with subsidies,
were widespread. Economic performance was severely constrained by stifling government
interference in the economy and an unfavorable business climate. Economic conditions
started to deteriorate in the mid-1980s with the fall in world oil prices, and worsened in
the 1990s as a result of the UN economic sanctions, following the Lockerbie bombing. The
authorities were reluctant to initiate any economic reforms when the country was subject to
sanctions.
2.
Since the freezing of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been gradually
implementing measures to reform and open its economy. But, it is only since the lifting of
the UN sanctions and all U.S. Libya-specific trade sanctions in September 2003 and
September 2004, respectively, that the pace of reform has picked up somewhat, with the
implementation of measures aimed at enhancing the role of the private sector in the
economy. These reforms continue, however, to be implemented in an ad hoc and
nontransparent manner, and their pace and effectiveness are affected by serious human
capacity constraints.
3.
In recent years, Fund surveillance has focused on policies to overhaul the
incentive and regulatory regimes, exchange rate and trade reforms, fiscal reform,
monetary reform, as well as on improving the reliability of economic data. The
authorities unified the exchange rate in 2002, and in 2003 eliminated exchange rationing and
import licensing requirements. Progress in other areas, however, has generally been limited,
mainly as a result of weak institutions.
4.
The Libyan economy still remains largely state controlled and heavily dependent
on the oil sector. Three quarters of employment is still in the public sector and private
investment is low (2 percent of GDP). Private sector activities are hindered by a complex
regulatory regime, restrictive labor market practices, and a legacy of policy reversals.
In 1999–2003, the oil sector contributed about 50 percent of GDP, 97 percent of the
country’s exports of goods, and 75 percent of government revenue. Libya’s social indicators
are favorable by Middle East and North Africa (MENA) standards (Table 1).
B. Political Developments
5.
A settlement related to the Lockerbie bombing was reached in August 2003, and
in December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs

-6-

to develop weapons of mass destruction. Libya’s relations with the U.S. have begun to
normalize and ties with Europe and Asia continue to be strengthened.1
6.
The authorities have renewed their commitment to open up and liberalize
Libya’s economy. They have expressed strong interest in having the Fund and the
World Bank take the leading roles in assisting them in formulating plans to reform the
economy and they have requested technical assistance from both institutions in their areas of
expertise. The appointment of reformist figures at key ministerial posts since 2002 indicates
support for economic reform by senior decision makers.

remained modest (2–
3 percent), and manufacturing declined (-5 percent) mainly as a result of increased
competition from private sector imports. Public works and construction decreased by
7 percent, consistent with the drop in public investment spending. Deflation, as measured by
the official Consumer Price Index (CPI), decelerated to 2.1 percent from 9.9 percent in 2002,
mainly as a result of the disappearance in 2003 of the effects of the appreciation of the
special exchange rate on the price of private sector imports.2 Persistence of deflation in
official statistics reflects in staff’s view the fact that the current CPI, which according to the
authorities is outdated and suffers from major shortcomings, covers essentially goods
supplied by public enterprises whose prices have continuously declined in recent years as a
result of increased competition from private sector imports.

A Euro 7 billion gas pipeline connecting Libya to Sicily (540kms) was inaugurated in October 2004. Staff has
not received detailed information on this project, which started in August 2003.

The fiscal stance
(In percent of GDP)
continued to be expansionary,
with the non-oil fiscal deficit
widening to 36 percent of GDP3
(Table 3, Figure 2). However,
reflecting higher hydrocarbon
revenues, which reached
47 percent of GDP, the overall
surplus remained stable at about
10.5 percent of GDP. Non-oil
revenue declined by 3 percentage
points of GDP as a result of
widespread tax evasion and low efficiency in tax collection. Capital expenditures were
compressed to make room for the payment of one installment ($1.1 billion) of the Lockerbie
settlement.4 However, current expenditure, excluding the Lockerbie payment, remained high
(30 percent of GDP).

Broad money increased
by 9.4 percent (Table 4,

improved fiscal situation, net
banks’ claims on the government
declined sharply, whereas credit
to nongovernment sectors
increased by about 13 percent of
end-2002 money stock, reflecting
mainly credit extended to public
enterprises.

This deficit is relatively high when compared to deficits in other oil producing countries. In 2003, the non-oil
fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP was 22.5 percent, 21 percent, and 16.5 percent for the Gulf Cooperation
Council countries, Algeria, and Iran, respectively.

The total settlement amount is $2.7 billion; the remaining payment of $1.6 billion was expected to be made
in 2004.

mainly petrochemicals, also grew
markedly. Imports declined by
about 3 percent, consistent with
lower capital expenditure and
weak private sector demand growth (Table 5, Figure 4). Gross international reserves
increased to about US$19 billion, equivalent to 22 months of 2004 imports.

B. Policy Developments in 2003–04
11.
Some progress was made on structural reforms in the last two years. Measures
taken include trade liberalization, allowing foreign investment in some sectors, the removal
of customs duty exemptions enjoyed by public enterprises, and the reduction in import tariff
rates. In addition, a privatization plan was initiated in January 2004, which involves the sale
of 360 economic units, but excludes the utilities, the oil and gas sector, and the air and
maritime transportation sectors. Thus far, 42 small units have been privatized and sold to
domestic investors.
12.
In the money and banking area, banking supervision was strengthened. A new
draft Law on Bank Reorganization, Currency, and Credit has been submitted for discussion
to the Basic People’s Congress (BPC, Libya’s local councils).5 The draft law gives the
Central Bank of Libya (CBL) greater responsibility in the conduct of monetary policy,
including issuing its own securities. Also, the authorities have lowered interest rates across
the board in an effort to encourage private sector demand for credit and developed a strategy
to modernize the payment system.
13.
An Anti-Money Laundering (AML) draft law is still being considered by the
General People’s Congress (GPC, Libya’s Parliament). Meanwhile, the CBL issued
guidelines on implementing AML measures including requiring banks to designate
controllers to report suspicious transactions. A Financial Intelligence Unit was established at
the CBL to ensure that commercial and regional banks comply with the requirement to file
suspicious transactions reports and create internal AML units, which will disseminate
information and delineate the procedures to be followed in this area.
5

90

MFD’s and the Legal Department’s (LEG) comments on the draft law have been sent to the authorities.

-9-

14.
The authorities passed a new tax law in March 2004. The new law reforms the
general income tax, reduces the top marginal tax rate on wages and salaries, and increases
exemptions. The corporate tax remains progressive, with rates varying from 15 to 40 percent,
compared with 20 to 60 percent under the previous law.
15.
Libya has taken steps toward regularizing its relations with external creditors,
settling disputed claims with Italy’s export agency6 and creditors in Germany and the United
Kingdom. Also, discussions are ongoing with other foreign creditors. These claims, on which
no information has been made available to staff, pertain to disputed payments resulting from
the imposition of UN sanctions on Libya. A new debt department has been recently
established at the Ministry of Finance, with a view to developing an external debt database
and strengthening external debt management procedures.
16.
On September 2, 2004, the authorities informed staff that Libya’s participation
in the HIPC Initiative failed to get the necessary political support for ratification. They
also indicated that Libya is preparing its own debt relief plan, which they intend to discuss
directly with HIPC.7
C. Economic Developments in 2004
17.
Based on the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) oil price assumptions,8
large fiscal and current account surpluses are estimated to have occurred in 2004. Real
GDP growth is estimated at about 4.5 percent, reflecting a deceleration in growth of oil
production to 7.5 percent, and a real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth rate of about 2.5 percent.
For the year as a whole, the authorities expected a deflation rate of about 1 percent.9
18.
The overall fiscal surplus is estimated to have reached about 19 percent of GDP.
Oil revenue is estimated at 52.4 percent of GDP, reflecting significantly higher oil prices and
production than in 2003. However, non-oil revenue is estimated to have declined by about
1 percentage point of GDP to 7 percent, partly owing to reduced tax revenue in connection
with the new tax law provisions. Despite large increases in the wage bill (21 percent) and in
capital expenditure (73 percent), total expenditure is estimated to have declined by 4 percent
of GDP, mainly on account of a 7 percent of GDP drop in current extra-budgetary
6

According to the Italian authorities, Libya still owes about Euro 600 million to Italian firms.

7

The authorities’ intention is to approach their debtors on a bilateral basis, and discuss with them terms—that
could be specific to each country—for the reimbursement of their debt to Libya.
8

Under the December 2004 WEO assumptions, the average oil price for Libya in 2004 was estimated by staff
to be $36.4 per barrel.

9

The continued decline in the CPI in 2004, when there was only a modest growth in the supply of goods and a
marked increase in wage payments, is an indication that the current index does not adequately measure actual
inflation. The authorities have undertaken a new household survey in 2003, which is being used to prepare a
new CPI.

- 10 -

expenditure.10 The increase in the wage bill reflected mainly the new hiring of doctors and
teachers.
19.
Broad money is estimated to have increased by about 8.5 percent. Given the
sustained improvement in the fiscal accounts, the government continued to be a net lender to
the banking sector. Net claims on nonfinancial public enterprises and credit to the private
sector are estimated to have increased only modestly. In May 2004, the government decided
to use the foreign assets revaluation account at the CBL to buyback its outstanding domestic
debt and part of the public enterprises debt to commercial banks.11
20.
The estimated strong external current account—a surplus of about 26 percent of
GDP—reflects a 10 percent increase in oil export volume and a 29 percent increase in
oil export price. Nonhydrocarbon export growth is estimated to have remained robust,
owing mainly to strong petrochemical exports. Imports are estimated to have grown by
about 19 percent, consistent with import liberalization, a significant increase in capital
expenditure, and high import prices.12 Official reserves are estimated to have reached
$24.6 billion, equivalent to about 27 months of projected 2005 imports.

10

The drop reflected mainly lower transfers to local governments.

11

So far, the government has bought back LD 6.3 billion and LD 1.7 billion of its debt owed to the CBL and
the commercial banks, respectively, and another LD 0.8 billion of the public enterprises’ debt to the
commercial banks. The government intends to buy back an additional LD 1 billion of public enterprises’ debt to
commercial banks in 2005. While the debt buyback from the CBL did not affect reserve money, the increase in
liquidity resulting from the buyback from the commercial banks has been sterilized at the CBL. In view of the
absence of the sale of foreign exchange, staff expressed reservations regarding these operations, stressing that
the revaluation gains at the CBL were unrealized profits. Staff also recommended that the authorities do not
follow up on their intention to buy back additional public enterprises’ debt from the banks using the revaluation
account, stressing that this operation should be part of a comprehensive public enterprises reform plan.
12

About 60 percent of Libya’s imports are from the euro zone area and Japan.

the exchange rate in 2002. Since the devaluation of the exchange rate in June 2003,13 the Real
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has remained broadly stable and there has been no pressure
on the exchange rate (Figure 5).

D. Medium-Term Outlook
22.
Libya’s medium-term outlook remains favorable and does not raise any
sustainability concerns, on the expectation that world oil prices will decline only
gradually and oil production will increase steadily to about 2.15 million barrels per day
by 2009 (Tables 6 and 7, and Figure 6). During 2005–09, both the fiscal and external current
account balances are projected to continue to register large surpluses averaging about
18 percent and 30 percent of GDP, respectively. However, without corrective measures, the
non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to remain relatively large over the period, averaging about
33 percent of GDP, and real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is projected to range between 3–
3.7 percent. Projected growth rates would not be sufficient to generate employment
opportunities for the new entrants to the labor force, which are expected to grow by about
3.5–4 percent per year over the medium term, as the current pace of government reforms will
fall short of generating a sustained increase in investment and output.14

13

14

The devaluation of the exchange rate was in line with staff’s recommendations.

Studies on countries in the MENA area show that, on average, for each 1 percent growth in the non-oil
economy, employment increases by about 0.7 percent.

projection period—on average 12 and 25 percent of GDP, respectively (Figure 7).15 The
build up of these surpluses reflects the limited absorptive capacity of the economy,
particularly the projected low investment and growth levels resulting from the slow pace of
reforms.
III. POLICY ISSUES AND DISCUSSIONS
24.
Discussions took place at a time of an intense internal debate on how to reform
the Libyan economy. The authorities agreed with the staff that higher growth rates and
diversification of the Libyan economy could only be achieved through deregulation, a
significant scaling down of the dominant role of the public sector, and the development of
the private sector. They indicated, however, that given Libya’s political structure, their
preferred approach to reform is a one-sector-at-a-time piecemeal one. They expressed strong
interest in having the Fund and the World Bank take the leading roles in assisting them in
reforming the economy. In this connection, they requested technical assistance from both
institutions, including Fund’s long-term resident advisors to assist them in developing and
implementing reform agendas in the fiscal, monetary, and banking areas.16 They are
establishing an inter-ministerial economic team to coordinate policy design and reform
implementation, and to follow up on Libya’s technical assistance needs.

15

Even a higher decline in the oil price ($12 below the WEO spot price trajectory) would still result in fiscal
and external current surpluses averaging 2.2 and 14.1 percent of GDP, respectively.
16

In December 2004, two Libyan advisors visited the Fund and the World Bank and discussed Libya’s
technical assistance needs in the financial and banking sector and statistics area.

25.
Staff indicated that Libya could benefit from the experience of other countries
that succeeded in their transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. These
experiences stress that proper planning, coordination, and sequencing of policies are essential
for the success of the reform efforts. In addition, the sustainability of reforms requires public
support, which could only be achieved through a constructive dialogue with the civil society.
26.
Given the complementarity of structural reforms, staff recommended putting in
place a comprehensive and well-sequenced macroeconomic and structural reform
program that could serve as a blueprint to reforming the Libyan economy. Staff
suggested that in the short term, the authorities could focus on developing market-based
monetary instruments, restructuring the banking system, liberalizing prices, strengthening
budgetary management and procedures, and moving from price subsidies to a cash subsidy
system. Preparatory work for these measures is at an advanced stage and the Fund has
already provided technical assistance in the monetary reform area. More profound structural
measures that require significant technical preparation and consensus building could be
gradually implemented at a later stage (Box 1).
A. Fiscal Policy
27.
Fiscal policy continues to be shaped by the availability of oil revenues and the
need to support employment and finance the subsidy system. Several factors have
markedly reduced the capacity of the authorities to conduct an effective fiscal policy. These
include a lack of transparency of the budget process, considerable netting out of expenditure
items, extra-budgetary revenues and expenditures, rigid rules, and the absence of mediumterm planning. In addition, widespread tax exemptions continue to weaken the non-oil tax
base.
28.
Staff stressed that a prudent fiscal policy will remain key to maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability. It urged the authorities to avoid extra-budgetary
spending and strengthen expenditure management and control in the period ahead. Staff
recommended that the significant projected increases in oil revenues over the medium term
be largely saved or allocated to finance structural measures to reform the economy, such as
public enterprise and civil service reforms, and reform of the subsidy system.
29.
While staff has not had the opportunity to comment on the 2005 draft budget,17
it recommended that the authorities avoid extra-budgetary spending and that any budgeted
increase in spending be directed to improve human capital and infrastructure, which have
deteriorated significantly under the sanctions. Also, increased spending on health and
education should be accompanied by reforms in these sectors. The authorities were advised
to seek technical assistance from the World Bank in this regard.

17

As of December 30, 2004, staff has not received any information on the 2005 budget.

- 15 -

Box 1. Libya: Required Economic Reforms
Phase 1 (1–12 months): Objective: Maintain macroeconomic stability, implement monetary reforms,
finalize the plan to restructure public banks, establish appropriate relative prices, and improve overall
transparency in economic management:
•

Anchor the transition on macroeconomic stability by adopting a medium-term budget
framework underpinned by sound management of the Oil Reserve Fund (ORF). Also, there is a
need to develop an official law or decree, which clearly states the rules, purpose, and objectives
of the ORF.

•

Lift sectoral credit restrictions and allow interest rates to determine credit allocation. Gradually
liberalize interest rates. Implement IMF’s recommendations on improving the conduct of
monetary operations and banking supervision.

•

Finalize the plan to restructure public banks.

•

Reassess the privatization strategy.

•

Replace price subsidies by cash payments.

•

Improve the economic database.

Phase 2 (12–36 months): Objective: Establish the institutional foundations for the efficient
functioning of a modern economy:
•

Accelerate the process of building up a sound investment climate, with strong institutions to
support open markets and a level playing field for all investors. Measures include simplifying
business entry, opening protected services to domestic and foreign investors, reducing
regulatory ambiguity, strengthening the rule of law, and land reform.

•

Restructure public enterprises and implement the privatization program.

•

Restructure public banks and start to modernize prudential regulations and banking supervision
in line with international best practices. Privatize public banks.

•

Strengthen the social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups most affected by structural
reforms.

•

Consolidate and harmonize import duties and other taxes levied on imports. The number of
tariff rates should be reduced from the current 20 to no more than five.

•

Implement a comprehensive civil service reform.

•

Develop an active money market with reliance on indirect monetary instruments

30.
Although the fiscal position is projected to remain comfortable over the medium
term, the structure of the budget needs to be rationalized through streamlining of
expenditures and improving the efficiency of the tax system. On the revenue side, staff
recommended that the authorities amend the new tax law approved by the GPC in
March 2004, in line with FAD’s recommendations (Box 2).

- 16 -

Box 2. Libya: Recommended Tax Reforms
FAD recommended a strategy aimed at simplifying the tax system, in order to improve its efficiency and make
it more stable, transparent, and equitable. The strategy, which should be supported by tariff reforms and a
reform of the tax and customs’ administration, aims to:
•

reform the general income tax; reduce the individual exemptions; and limit the rate schedule for individuals
to three brackets: 15, 25, and 35 percent;

•

simplify the corporate tax with a 35 percent flat rate, base corporations' payments on last year’s income,
and allow corporations to exclude domestic dividends from income;

•

abolish the social solidarity tax, the Jihad tax, and the investment contribution tax;

•

allow banks a tax deduction equivalent to the additional loan loss provision required by the central bank.

•

ensure that tax incentives are not subject to administrative discretion, and that incentives for investment are
not used as tax holiday;

•

introduce the VAT by 2007; and

•

facilitate privatization, by introducing appropriate rules for tax neutral corporate restructuring.

31.
On the expenditure side, the authorities were encouraged to reassess the 70/30
rule, and strengthen expenditure management and control.18 Staff recommended
alternative approaches that could target specific sectors such as education or health without
distorting the overall budget allocation. It stressed that further rationalization of spending,
including within the context of reforming the civil service and the subsidy system, are
needed to improve the efficiency of government spending. The authorities agreed with the
staff that the 70/30 rule introduces a measure of rigidity into the budget process, particularly
in view of the country's limited absorptive capacity.
32.
The authorities also agreed with the staff that the operations of the ORF should
be reviewed to increase its transparency and accountability (Box 1).19 Also, there should
be regular and frequent disclosure and reporting on its inflows, outflows, and the investment
of its assets, and the fund’s accounts should be audited by an independent agency. The
authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations and stressed that the ORF should have both
saving and stabilization functions.

18

Budgetary oil revenues are allocated to capital and current expenditures according to a 70/30 fiscal rule. For
more details on the structure of Libya’s budget, see Country Report No. 03/327, Appendix V.
19

The ORF is a government account managed by the CBL. It accumulates oil revenue in excess of the level
determined by a budgetary oil price ($20 per barrel in 2004). Withdrawals from the ORF, mostly for current
expenditures, take place on a discretionary basis. The ORF is not integrated into the budget and its operations
are not transparent. There is a need for the CBL and the Ministry of Finance to agree on the nature and exact
amount of the ORF holdings at the CBL.

- 17 -

33.
The authorities were in general agreement with staff’s assessment of and
recommendations on fiscal policy. To that effect, they requested a Fund resident advisor at
the Ministry of Finance that would help them develop an agenda for fiscal reform. FAD is of
the view that a first step in this process would be to send a fact-finding mission to Libya to
assess this request.
B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Developments
34.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement monetary and banking
sector reform. It stressed that current policies of direct controls on credit and interest rates
are inefficient and make monetary policy increasingly ineffective in influencing
macroeconomic goals. Even though progress is not yet tangible, the authorities are keen to
develop a market-oriented monetary policy. While interest rates were reduced across the
board in February 2004, the first change since 1994, rates are still controlled by the CBL.
Furthermore, the current interest rate structure with a range of unchanged and low ceilings on
lending rates reduces banks’ ability to price in risk and discourages their lending activity.
The authorities are concerned that, if they liberalize lending rates, interest rates would
increase and adversely affect economic activity.
35.
Staff stressed the importance of further easing interest rate controls, with the
aim of full liberalization. It emphasized that the current weak demand for loans and the
abundant bank liquidity offer a window of opportunity for initiating gradual interest rate
liberalization without leading to higher lending rates. At the same time, directed credit
allocation should be phased out. Without these reforms, financial markets will not be able to
deliver efficient allocation of credit, which is needed to jump-start private sector activities
and increase the overall efficiency of the economy.
36.
Staff urged the authorities to continue implementing the recommendations of
the 2001 and 2004 MFD technical assistance missions on banking supervision and
monetary policy operations (Appendix IV). With the intended move toward indirect
monetary management, it recommended the establishment at the CBL of a monetary policy
committee responsible for key policy decisions, and the strengthening of daily monetary
policy management.
37.
The authorities agreed with staff on the urgent need to reform the
predominantly state-owned banking system. They indicated that they have stepped-up
efforts to improve banking supervision and arrange workouts of nonperforming loans, which
stood at 26 percent of total loans at end-August 2004. They are aware that a more efficient
and market oriented banking system is needed if Libya is to succeed in reforming its
economy. They intend to restructure and privatize public banks, and allow foreign banks to
operate in Libya, and have asked the Fund and the World Bank to assist them in this
endeavor.
38.
Staff discussed with the authorities the main features of the draft law on bank
reorganization, currency, and credit, currently under preparation. The draft law, which is

- 18 -

intended to give the CBL greater responsibility in the conduct of monetary policy, raises
issues that are a source of concern, mainly the composition of the proposed Board of the
CBL, which would comprise representatives of three ministries with voting rights. Moreover,
the draft law does not remove existing interest rate ceilings. Staff stressed that these
provisions are not consistent with the principle of central bank autonomy. The authorities are
reviewing the comments sent to them by MFD and LEG.
39.
Staff recommended that the authorities proceed with the planned reforms in the
area of AML/CFT and encouraged the implementation of AML/CFT measures in line with
international practice in order to address vulnerabilities to money laundering and terrorist
financing. The authorities were urged to seek staff’s comments on the draft AML/CFT law
before its adoption by the government.
C. Exchange Rate and Article VIII Issues
40.
Staff discussed with the authorities the importance of continued assessment of
the level of the exchange rate. It stressed that adjustments to the peg should occur as needed
to absorb shocks and avoid a sustained real appreciation that would be harmful to
competitiveness. Given the current features of the Libyan economy, in particular, the absence
of well-developed financial markets, including a formal exchange market and the lack of
adequate monetary instruments to manage liquidity, staff believes that the current exchange
regime is appropriate. However, the exchange rate level and regime will need to be
monitored as structural and macroeconomic reforms progress.
41.
With regard to Libya’s acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, the standard review, by MFD
and LEG, of Libya’s exchange system is currently underway. Staff stressed that, should the
review identify any exchange restrictions, the authorities will need to eliminate them.
D. Trade Reform
42.
Staff welcomed the recent simplifications in Libya’s trade regime, including
abolishment of licenses, lowering of tariff protection, and elimination of import duty
exemptions granted to public enterprises. However, despite these measures, effective trade
protection remains relatively high (Box 3).
43.
WTO accession negotiations will place a high demand on administrative
resources. In this connection, the authorities have formed a working group to undertake a
thorough review of all laws, regulations, and policies that affect international trade and
investment, and to prepare the Memorandum of the Foreign Trade Regime before the start of
the negotiations for full membership in 2005. Staff recommended that, in order to speed-up
the process, Libya could seek technical assistance from the World Bank, whose experts have
prepared similar documents in other countries.

- 19 -

Box 3: Libya’s Trade Regime
Libya’s trade regime remains among the most restrictive in the world. In 2003, the simple average tariff rate
was 21.8 percent, with tariff rates ranging between zero and 425 percent, and there is a substantial dispersion of
tariffs within product categories. Besides import tariffs, the trade protection system includes a discriminatory
consumption tax (between 10 and 50 percent) on goods that are consumed but not produced in Libya (while a
production tax on local production ranges between 2 and 5 percent); and a regional and social solidarity tax of
15 percent of the import tariff. In addition, there are import bans on 31 items.
Some progress was made in 2004 to liberalize Libya’s trade regime. Tariff rates were reduced—the maximum
rate to 100 percent—resulting in a decline in the simple average tariff to 17.8 percent, and some state import
monopolies were eliminated. The authorities intend to keep the import bans only for religious, health and
ecological reasons, which would involve less than ten products, and replace the remaining bans by tariffs.
Further action is needed to improve Libya’s trade regime. The consumption tax and regional and social
solidarity tax should be integrated into the tariff rate structure, tariff protection should be limited to few items
and reduced gradually overtime, and the number of tariff bands should be reduced from the current 20 to no
more than five. Also, the remaining state import monopolies should be phased out and customs procedures
should be simplified and made consistent with international standards.

E. Pricing and Subsidy Policies
44.
The authorities described their plans to reform the subsidy system, the cost of
which has increased by about 85 percent in 2004 to about 3.5 percent of GDP.20 Staff
recommended that the authorities’ plan to replace the current price subsidy system with cash
subsidies be accelerated, and that the latter be well targeted and limited to the vulnerable
segments of the population. While agreeing with staff’s recommendation, the authorities
indicated that, for political reasons, the subsidy amount would be distributed equally among
all Libyans.
45.
Staff noted that implicit subsidies would also need to be addressed. They are
sizable and are channeled to the economy mainly through fixed low consumer prices, in
particular for petroleum products and electricity. In this connection, staff welcomed the
increase in electricity prices in July 2004, and encouraged the authorities to increase
gradually domestic petroleum product prices. Staff recommended that all implicit subsidies
be budgeted and gradually reduced over time.
F. Deregulation and Privatization
46.
The pace of reforms has progressed recently. Obstacles to private sector activity
that were in effect for a long time are gradually being lifted. Staff welcomed the
liberalization of foreign investment in some sectors and the creation of the Libyan Foreign
Investment Board, acting as a one-stop-shop for foreign investors. However, while the state
20

This excludes all implicit subsidies, but includes extrabudgetary spending on food subsidies.

- 20 -

has begun to withdraw from economic activity, the regulatory and institutional framework
that supports the transition to a market economy suffers from major deficiencies.
47.
Staff welcomed the reduction in the number of state import monopolies. Stateowned companies now face competition from the private sector, which can freely import or
produce goods that were previously under public monopoly. While price and profit margin
controls still remain in a number of markets, the authorities stressed that enforcement of
these controls is almost non-existent; accordingly, they were urged to abolish them. A
limited number of goods, which the authorities feel are not sufficiently exposed to
competition, could remain under a temporary pricing formula; however, the number of these
goods should be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated.
48.
The authorities are committed to privatizing most state-owned public
enterprises. However, their strategy remains constrained by two main objectives:
(i) protecting employment; and (ii) broadening the ownership base to avoid concentrated
ownership. In this connection, staff encouraged the authorities to reassess their strategy and
implement measures along the lines recommended by the World Bank. The latter include,
among other things, (a) enacting a privatization law that would give the privatization agency
an independent legal existence and an explicit mandate, and allow investors to acquire a
significant share of capital and have corporate control over the privatized companies; and
(b) basing the sale process on competitive bidding.
G. Other Issues
49.
Staff expressed its regrets that Libya will not be participating in the HIPC
Initiative under a multilateral framework which is providing considerable debt relief to
HIPC, and urged the authorities to reconsider their decision. The authorities are aware that
the comparability of treatment clause in Paris Club debt relief agreements requires the debtor
country to seek from all other official bilateral and commercial creditors debt relief terms
comparable to those obtained under the Paris Club. However, they indicated that the
legislative structure in Libya requires approval from the BPC before Libya’s participation in
the HIPC Initiative could be considered for ratification. The authorities informed staff that
the BPC did not support Libya’s participation in the Initiative and, for that reason, decided to
withdraw from it and are preparing their own debt relief plan instead.
50.
The authorities agreed with the staff that a concerted effort is needed to address
data deficiencies in Libya (Appendix III). Staff discussed with the authorities how the
fundamental flaws of the Libyan data system can be addressed, and recommended that Libya
participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and appoint a national
coordinator to that effect. The authorities reiterated their request (made during the annual

- 21 -

meetings in October 2004) for a multi-sector technical assistance mission from the Fund’s
Statistics Department.21
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Since the freezing of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been implementing
measures to reform and open its economy, but progress in developing a market
economy has been slow. In 2003–04, Libya’s macroeconomic performance was strong, with
large fiscal and external surpluses reflecting the favorable developments in the world oil
market. While staff welcomes the adoption of measures aimed at encouraging foreign
investment and enhancing the role of the private sector in the economy, the pace and
effectiveness of these reforms remain limited in part because their implementation is done in
an ad hoc and nontransparent manner. Staff encourages the authorities to speed up the
transition to a market economy, by easing government control on the economy and shifting
progressively the economic decision-making to the private sector, while allowing free
competition on a level playing field.
52.
Staff believes that the authorities’ one-sector-at-a-time piecemeal approach to
reform would limit the pace and efficiency of the envisaged reforms. Libya needs strong
and sustained economic growth to meet the demands of its rapidly growing labor force,
which requires high investment in both physical and human capital, as well as an efficient
use of available resources. This can only be achieved through the implementation of a
comprehensive and well-sequenced reform program.
53.
Priority structural reforms that could be launched in the short run could focus
on monetary and financial reforms, price liberalization, budgetary management and
procedures, and subsidy system reform. Further reform steps to create a conducive
environment for economic activity, including a vigorous privatization program and the
building-up of a sound business climate, that require significant technical preparation and
consensus building could be implemented at a later stage. In this context, the authorities are
urged to reassess their privatization strategy and implement measures along the lines
recommended by the World Bank.
54.
Improving budgetary management and control and implementing a prudent
fiscal policy are key to maintaining macroeconomic stability. There is a need to
strengthen the budget system and integrate extra-budgetary operations in a consolidated
budget under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. In view of the large non-oil fiscal
deficit, it is important to broaden the non-oil tax base and streamline spending. To achieve
this objective, the authorities need to strengthen tax policy as recommended by staff and
reassess the 70/30 rule to better take into account the country’s absorptive capacity and avoid
procyclical expenditure. Given the human capacity constraints at the Ministry of Finance,
Libya will need substantial technical assistance to undertake these reforms.
21

The multi-sector mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department is currently scheduled for June 2005.

- 22 -

55.
The authorities’ plan to replace the current price subsidy system with a cash
subsidy should be accelerated. Staff recommends that the new subsidy be well targeted and
limited to the vulnerable segments of the population. It is also important that the authorities
tackle the issue of the implicit subsidies. Staff welcomes the recent increase in electricity
prices and encourages the authorities to increase gradually domestic petroleum product
prices.
56.
Staff strongly urges the authorities to increase transparency and accountability
in the operations of the ORF. This should be done through the enactment of a law that
clearly states the ORF’s rules, objectives, and the agency that controls it. Also, the ORF’s
accounts should be regularly reported and audited by an independent agency.
57.
It is crucial that the authorities carry through their stated intention to reform
the monetary and banking sector. For that purpose, the authorities are urged to incorporate
in the new law on bank reorganization, currency, and credit MFD and LEG comments. In
particular, the new law should clearly give the CBL full autonomy in the conduct of
monetary policy. In this regard, urgent steps are needed to develop indirect monetary policy
instruments, including the gradual liberalization of interest rate and the elimination of
directed credits. It is also important to strengthen bank supervision and to ensure adequate
asset classification and provisioning, in line with international best practices. Staff strongly
supports the intention of the authorities to restructure and privatize public banks, allow
foreign banks to operate in Libya, and their request for technical assistance from the Fund to
reform Libya’s financial and banking sector.
58.
Determining the proper exchange rate for the Libyan dinar is difficult in the
current economic conditions. However, the relatively modest increase in the demand for
foreign exchange and the absence of pressures on the exchange rate following the
implementation of current account convertibility and the increased liberalization of the
external trade are indications that the current rate of the Libyan dinar is broadly appropriate.
Nevertheless, the authorities should be prepared to revalue the peg as necessary in response
to market forces, while taking into consideration the need to preserve the economy’s
competitiveness. Also, exchange rate policy will need to be kept under review as structural
and macroeconomic reforms progress.
59.
Despite the recent simplifications in Libya’s trade regime, effective trade
protection remains high. The required reforms include the integration in the tariff rates of the
taxes levied on imports, the streamlining of the tariff structure, gradual reduction in tariff
rates, and the abolishment of the remaining state import monopolies.
60.
Staff urges the authorities to reassess their decision to withdraw from the HIPC
Initiative. It stresses that the success of the HIPC Initiative will require the participation of
all creditors, including Libya.
61.
The authorities need to increase their efforts to improve Libya’s statistical
database, whose shortcomings seriously affect the capacity of the government to assess

- 23 -

economic and financial conditions and the ability of staff to conduct effective surveillance.
Staff encourages the authorities to look to the GDDS as a framework for statistical
development and appoint a national coordinator to that effect.
62.
In the period ahead, staff intends to intensify policy dialogue with the authorities
with a view to assisting them in the development and implementation of an economic reform
program. In this regard, staff will develop a technical assistance program in support of
Libya’s economic reforms.
63.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

From February 14, 1999 to December 31, 2001, a dual exchange rate system was in place,
with an “official” exchange rate pegged to the SDR, and a “special” exchange rate pegged to
the U.S. dollar. Following the gradual appreciation of the special exchange rate while
simultaneously depreciating the official exchange rate, on January 1, 2002, the authorities
unified the exchange rate and pegged it to the SDR at a rate of LD 1 = SDR 0.608. In
June 2003, the exchange rate was devalued by 15 percent to LD 1 = SDR 0.5175.
VIII. Exchange System
In June 2003, the authorities eliminated the restrictions that gave rise to multiple currency
practices. Libya accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement in June 2003.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Libya is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV staff report (SM/03/258) was
discussed by the Executive Board in August 2003. The 2004 Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Tripoli in October 2004.

APPENDIX II

LIBYA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Prepared by the World Bank Staff
(As of November 16, 2004)
1.
Libya has been a member of the World Bank Group since 1958, joining the
International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance
Corporation (IFC) in September 1958, International Development Association (IDA) in
August 1961, and Multilateral International Guarantee Association (MIGA) in April 1993.
There have been no World Bank Group loans made to Libya to date as the development of
the country’s petroleum assets from 1960 placed Libya among capital-surplus oil-producing
countries, and provided resources to build extensive infrastructure and provide social
services. A World Bank economic report on Libya was issued in October 2004.
2.
In 2000, the Libyan authorities invited the Bank Group to the "International
Conference on Development and Investments in Libya," held in Tripoli. A mission visited
Libya in February 2001 and presented a study on Regional Capital Markets at the Summit for
African Heads of State.
3.
An annual Framework for Technical Cooperation was signed on January 28, 2002,
for Bank technical assistance in the area of Payment Systems. A World Bank mission visited
Tripoli in April 2002 and presented a document on a “Vision of the Future National Payment
Systems” to key Libyan stakeholders.
4.
A Bank mission, led by the Director of the Maghreb Department, visited Libya in
April 2004. The purpose of this mission was to re-establish the dialogue with the Libyan
authorities, assess their demand for Bank services in the context of the reform process that
was launched recently, and renew the general framework for a two-year cooperation
agreement. It was agreed that the Bank would prepare a Country Economic Report, with the
aim of providing the necessary background for the cooperation program with the Bank, while
assisting the authorities in the design of an economic program for transition to a market-led
economy integrated with the rest of the world.
5.
The main economic mission for the Country Economic Report visited Libya from
June 26 to July 8 2004. The mission consulted with various ministries and administrative
departments. The work of the mission mainly focused on the following areas:
macroeconomic performance, public finance management, investment climate, public
enterprise reform, trade policy and customs administration, financial sector reform, and
social protection. The preliminary Country Economic Report was sent to the government for
consideration.
6.
As a result of the April 2004 mission, several Bank missions took place in
June/July 2004: a mission on Small and Medium Enterprise development; a Social Security
mission that resulted in a Concept Note and a draft agreement; and a transport mission
whereby an Aide Memoire was sent to the Government for comments. A follow up is
expected from the Libyan officials on these activities.

APPENDIX III

LIBYA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Libya’s database suffers from shortcomings that seriously affect the capacity of staff
to conduct effective surveillance. Among these are: (i) weaknesses in the conceptual and
compilation procedures underpinning the collection of statistics in the various sectors;
(ii) deficiencies in data quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; (iii) lack of consistency
of data across sectors; and (iv) with the exception of monetary and balance of payments data,
lack of a data reporting system to the Fund in order to update MCD’s operational data base
between missions. The above issues are compounded by specific institutional weaknesses
affecting data quality and timeliness, in particular the lack of interagency cooperation, the
proliferation of agencies with unclear and often overlapping responsibilities, and the
continuous reshuffling of responsibilities among agencies. Participation in the Fund’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) would help to address these problems. Libya
will be invited to attend the regional GDDS Metadata Development Workshop in Abu Dhabi,
scheduled for February 27–March 9, 2005 organized by the IMF’s Statistics Department.
2.
The February 1998 multisector STA mission examined the conceptual and
compilation procedures for national accounts, price indices, foreign trade, money and
banking, and government finance. The mission prepared a short-term action plan including
recommendations to enhance the quality of the data.
3.
The following sections outline the current status of data compilation and reporting by
sector:
•

In the area of national accounts statistics, some progress has been achieved with
the compilation of GDP estimates by economic activity through 2003, based on
the 1968 System of National Accounts (1968 SNA). However, the compilation
process is hampered by the poor quality of data, the lack of staff resources, high staff
turnover, and significant delays in the receipt of basic data from various sources,
including from government agencies. The main weaknesses identified by the 2004
Article IV mission are as follows:
¾

There is a need to develop a plan for a gradual implementation of the 1993
System of National Accounts (1993 SNA);

¾

In view of the world oil prices of recent years and the projected oil prices over
the medium term, the 1997 base year for the compilation of the GDP at
constant prices has become obsolete, underestimating the oil sector’s
contribution to GDP growth and overestimating the non-oil sector’s growth

APPENDIX III

¾

At end-October 2004, there are no data on economic developments in 2004,
and data on agricultural output for 2003 are not yet available.22 This
emphasizes the need to improve data collection and develop a system of
quarterly national accounts.

¾

The growth of the oil sector is derived from National Oil Company (NOC)
exports that are recorded in the BOP and do not include the partners’ share.
The value added of the oil and gas sector should be based on total crude oil
output, including the partners’ share, the sales to the local refineries, and total
sales of natural gas (both domestic sales and exports).

¾

The value added related to the production of refined products should be
derived directly from the consolidated accounts of the refineries and should
not be included in the non-oil GDP.

¾

The growth of the value-added of government services is determined using as
a proxy the increase in the size of the civil service. This estimation could be
improved by using the increase in the average base salary, which captures the
changes in qualification, experience, and number of employees, the three main
determinants of the value-added of government services in real terms; since
there has been no salary increase in Libya since 1981, the base salary index is
a volume index.

¾

The nonexistence of a producer price index (PPI) and volume indices makes
the estimation of sectoral growth rates very uncertain. There are no volume
indices for agriculture, industry and construction, and no instruments to
measure real growth in the other sectors (transportation, commerce, and
nongovernment services). Also, the CPI is not an appropriate deflator to
derive value added at constant prices.

In the area of prices: The current CPI is based on weights derived from the 1992–93
household budget survey. It has a 1999 base year and is compiled for 2000 onwards.
The authorities provided the mission with monthly CPI data covering the period
through June 2004. The 2004 Article IV mission stressed the need to:
¾

accelerate the production of the new CPI, based on the 2003 household
survey, as the current CPI does not seem to measure adequately actual
consumption inflation.

¾

compile a producer price index (PPI)—a recommendation of the 1998 STA
mission.

The agricultural sector’s growth in 2003 and its projected growth for 2004 are both based on the long-term
trend performance (1990–2001).

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

•

In money and banking statistics, while the timeliness and quality of monetary data
reported to the IFS have improved, some deficiencies remain, mainly related to the
persistently high level of unclassified liabilities. The CBL implemented most of the
recommendations of the 1998 STA mission, including (i) the review of the analytical
presentation of accounts to separately identify nonresident accounts according to the
residency rather than nationality criterion; (ii) the collection of data from the newly
created banks, and accounts for the various institutions (deposit money banks, other
banking institutions, offshore banks, and nonbank financial institutions), and the
separate identification of the government’s Social Security Fund; and (iii) the design
of new call report forms. The CBL has also consolidated the balance sheets of the
regional banks with the commercial banks. The Article IV mission recommended
including the remaining private banks in the consolidated balance sheet of
commercial banks that is reported to the Fund.

•

Regarding fiscal data, the Libyan fiscal information system remains fragmented and
inconsistent with international standards, since it has been designed for administrative
reporting under the government finance law, rather than for purposes of providing
timely statistical information for economic planning and analysis. None of the
recommendations of the 1998 STA mission has been implemented and no fiscal data
is reported to the Fund between missions. The following are the main weaknesses
identified by the Article IV mission:
¾

The existence of three budgets (central government administrative budget, the
subsidies’ budget, and the development budget) that are not consolidated in
one presentation complicates economic analysis and management.

¾

There are weaknesses in the conceptual and compilation procedures
underpinning the collection of statistics (such as misclassification of
expenditure items). A coherent methodological framework for data
compilation is needed.

¾

There are no data on the breakdown of line items in the presentation of the
budget (be it the budget law or its execution). For example, revenue from the
tax administration is lumped in one line item, rather than having a breakdown
for income tax, corporate tax, stamp duty, etc.

¾

There are substantial inconsistencies between sectors, in particular, between
data on budget execution and monetary data on net bank claims on
government.

¾

As for balance of payments data, the authorities reported to STA in 2000,
and recently in 2004, annual data for publication. However, the authorities do
not use STA’s standardized reporting form, and the reported data suffer from
deficiencies, mainly on account of (i) generally unclear methodology;
(ii) outdated surveys as sources for primary data; (iii) lack of component

- 39 -

APPENDIX III

detail; (iv) lack of comprehensive coverage for trade data; and
(v) methodological flaws in the compilation of the financial account. The
following are the main weaknesses identified by the Article IV mission:
¾

Total hydrocarbon export receipts should include foreign partners’ exports.

¾

Investment income should include both total investment income obtained by
the foreign partners of the National Oil Company and the investment income
of the nonhydrocarbon sector.

¾

The capital account should register as a capital inflow/outflow the net
transactions of commercial banks with non-residents. This information,—
which should be consistent with the monetary survey—would reduce the
errors and omissions in the capital account.

The CBL should use the information available in customs and the Ministry of Finance, as
well as the information on changes in international reserve assets and liabilities of the CBL
and commercial banks, available in the monetary survey, to develop preliminary quarterly
estimates of the balance of payments.

APPENDIX IV

STAFF’S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AREA OF THE MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR
•
Develop a liquidity forecast to prepare the ground for a more pro-active use of
monetary operations.
•
Phase out any remaining directed credits imposed on commercial banks, and create
an environment that would facilitate market-based decisions and enhance competition.
•
Liberalize interest rates gradually. First, liberalize interbank rates completely.
Subsequently, apply a single, maximum deposit rate, rather than a large number of rates
depending on size and maturity; and give banks full freedom to operate up to that limit.
Likewise, impose only one, maximum lending rate. After some months of operating in this
way, consideration could be given to full liberalization, perhaps removing the maximum
deposit rate before that on lending rate.
•
Start the preparatory work for the issuance of CBL bills, including planning
infrastructure changes (auction mechanism, a registry, an issuance program, secondary
market), ahead of the change in the law, so that issuance could begin very soon after the
legal change.
•
Pursue efforts for privatization, which should aim at attracting qualified and strategic
categories of investors with proven track record in banking activity.
•
While awaiting privatization, state-owned banks should be allowed to operate
independently from the CBL or any other authority. Their management should benefit from
a normal incentive structure and be accountable for their banks’ performance. This requires
a clear strategy, effective governance, and new managerial structure.
•
Establish a Monetary Policy Committee, which could assess the appropriate level
and structure of banking sector liquidity and take key policy decisions. This committee
should be supported by a Monetary Policy Executive Unit to undertake day-to-day
operations on the basis of policy decisions taken by the Committee.
•
Ensure that the central bank has effective autonomy in conducting its operations,
both de facto and de jure. The composition of the Board of the central bank should reflect
the independence of the central bank from the government.
•
The national payment system project must be given full priority and support from the
CBL’s Executive management. Training of staff from all concerned parties is key for the
reform’s success.
•
In addition to rules-based supervision, the CBL should develop risk-based
supervision.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 28, 2005
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Libya that has
become available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on
January 5, 2005. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Oil price. After the issuance of the staff report, the WEO oil price projections were
revised upward. The upward revisions are particularly significant for 2005 and 2006; the
increases are $3.5 and $2 per barrel, respectively. As a result, both the fiscal and external
current account balances are projected to register, on average, surpluses that are larger than
reported in the staff report, by about 2.5 percent of GDP per year during 2005–06.
3.
Lockerbie settlement. In 2004, only $1.1 billion was paid and not $1.6 billion as
indicated in Tables 3 and 5 and Footnote 4 of the staff report. The authorities informed the
staff that the remaining $540 million will be paid after the U.S. has removed Libya from the
list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
4.
Policy developments. The General People’s Congress (GPC) held its annual meeting
during January 8–12, 2005. The issues that were debated included, among others: (i) the
privatization of state-owned economic units; (ii) the 2005 budget; (iii) the new draft Banking
Law; and (iv) the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law. Only partial information has been
communicated to the staff on the outcome of the GPC meeting, but the staff was told that the
2005 budget law, and the banking and the AML laws were approved by GPC. The staff has
not received copies of the approved banking and AML laws.
5.
Fiscal issues. Only limited information on the 2005 budget was made available to the
staff. The information provided by the authorities includes: (i) a new budget oil price of $26
per barrel, compared to $22 in staff’s projections for 2005; (ii) total non-oil budgetary
revenues of 7 percent of GDP, compared with staff projections of 5½ percent of GDP; and
(iii) total budgetary expenditure of 38 percent of GDP, compared with staff projections of
27 percent of GDP. However, data on projected oil budgetary revenues and extrabudgetary
spending are missing, which complicates the analysis of the authorities’ budget. A
preliminary assessment of the available information regarding the 2005 budget, combined
with staff’s projected oil revenue and extrabudgetary expenditure would result in a
consolidated budget surplus of about 13 percent of GDP, compared to 22 percent of GDP in
the revised staff projections based on the January 2005 WEO oil prices. While the staff has
not had the opportunity to discuss the 2005 budget with the authorities, it has strong
reservations on the authorities’ budgeted increases for nonoil budgetary revenues and
nonwage budgetary expenditures. Indeed, in the staff’s view, the projected 30 percent
increase in non-oil revenue is unrealistic in the absence of any revenue enhancing measures;
and the limited absorptive capacity of the Libyan economy renders the 85 percent increase in
the development budget optimistic. A staff team is scheduled to visit Libya in February and
will clarify all these issues with the authorities.

-2-

6.
Monetary issues. The staff has also been informed that many of its recommendations
have been incorporated in the new banking law. Under the new law: (i) the composition of
the seven member Central Bank of Libya (CBL) board includes only one representative from
government ministries; (ii) the CBL has been given the authority to issue regulations related
to monetary and banking issues; (iii) foreign banks are allowed to open branches in Libya;
and (iv) more emphasis is put on improving banking supervision. Also, the Governor of the
CBL has now the authority to establish a monetary policy committee responsible for key
policy decisions; commercial banks have been given permission to lend to foreign companies
investing in Libya; and interest rates on commercial banks’ deposits held at the CBL have
been unified at 2.5 percent and only paid on deposits held for more than three months.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with The
Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
On January 28, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.1
Background
The Libyan economy remains largely state controlled and heavily dependent on the oil sector.
Since the lifting of the UN and U.S. Libya-specific trade sanctions in September 2003 and
September 2004, respectively, the pace of economic and structural reforms has picked up
somewhat, with the implementation of measures aimed at enhancing the role of the private
sector in the economy. However, these reforms continue to be implemented in an ad hoc and
non-transparent manner.
In 2003, real GDP grew by an estimated 9 percent, reflecting a 28 percent rise in oil production
and a modest 2.2 percent increase in nonhydrocarbon activities. Deflation, as measured by the
official Consumer Price Index, decelerated to 2.1 percent from 9.9 percent in 2002.
The avorable developments in the oil market contributed to a significant improvement in the
external current account surplus, which reached 15.4 percent of GDP. Gross international
reserves increased to about US$19 billion, equivalent to 22 months of 2004 imports.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The fiscal stance continued to be expansionary, with a non-oil fiscal deficit widening to
36 percent of GDP. However, reflecting higher hydrocarbon revenues, the overall consolidated
surplus remained stable at about 10.5 percent of GDP. Non-oil revenue declined by
3 percentage points of GDP as a result of widespread tax evasion and low efficiency in tax
collection. While capital expenditures were compressed to make room for the payment of one
installment (US$1.1 billion) of the Lockerbie settlement, current expenditure, excluding the
Lockerbie payment, remained high at 30 percent of GDP.
Broad money increased by 9.4 percent. As a result of the improved fiscal situation, net banks’
claims on the government declined sharply, whereas credit to the economy increased by about
13 percent of beginning-of-the-year money stock, reflecting mainly credit to public enterprises.
Reform measures in the money and banking area included a further strengthening of banking
supervision. Also, the authorities have lowered interest rates across the board in an effort to
encourage private sector demand for credit, and developed a strategy to modernize the
payment system.
In 2004, economic and financial conditions continued to be favorable. Real GDP growth is
estimated at about 4.5 percent, reflecting a deceleration in growth of oil production to
7.5 percent, and a real non-oil GDP growth rate of about 3 percent. For the year as a whole, the
authorities expected a deflation rate of about 1 percent.
The overall fiscal surplus is estimated to have reached about 19 percent of GDP, with oil
revenue estimated at 52.4 percent of GDP. However, non-oil revenue is estimated to have
declined by about 1 percentage point to 7 percent of GDP, partly owing to reduced tax revenue
in connection with the new tax law provisions.
Broad money is estimated to have increased by about 8.5 percent in 2004. Given the sustained
improvement in the fiscal accounts, the government continued to be a net lender to the banking
sector. On the external front, the current account surplus is estimated to have reached about
26 percent of GDP, while official reserves are estimated at $25 billion, equivalent to about
27 months of projected 2005 imports.
Some progress was made on the reform front. Measures taken include the adoption of laws to
encourage domestic and foreign private investment, the adoption of a new tax law, the removal
of customs duty exemptions enjoyed by public enterprises, the reduction in tariff rates, and the
preparation of a new banking law that gives the Central Bank of Libya greater independence in
the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, a privatization plan (not including the utilities, the oil
and gas sector, and the air and maritime transportation sectors) was initiated in January 2004,
which involves the sale of 360 economic units. Thus far, 42 small units have been privatized.
In September 2004, the authorities withdrew their participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative on grounds of lacking political support for ratification. They indicated
that Libya is preparing its own debt relief plan, which they intend to discuss directly with the
HIPC.

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Libya’s good
macroeconomic performance in 2003–04, reflecting the favorable developments in the world oil
market. The fiscal and external current account balances registered large surpluses, and
international reserves rose sharply. Directors commended the authorities’ increased efforts,
since the lifting of the international sanctions, to reform the economy, including through
measures to encourage foreign investment, enhance the role of the private sector, and liberalize
the exchange system and external trade.
Directors observed, however, that much remains to be done to transform Libya’s economy into
one that is market-based. They emphasized that Libya’s large surpluses present a good
opportunity to speed up economic reforms while maintaining macroeconomic stability, and they
looked forward to the early establishment of the inter-ministerial economic team to coordinate
policy design and reform implementation.
Directors stressed that proper planning, coordination, and sequencing of policies in the context
of a comprehensive reform program will be essential for the success of the reform efforts.
Such an approach will help support the high levels of investment in physical and human capital,
and the efficient use of available resources required to achieve economic diversification, strong
and sustained growth, and to meet the demands of the rapidly growing labor force. In this
connection, Directors encouraged the authorities to reassess their one-sector-at-a-time
approach to reform, although it was recognized that the pace of reform will need to carefully
take into account institutional and capacity constraints. They suggested that Libya could benefit
from the experience of countries that have succeeded in the transition from a centrally planned
to a market economy.
Directors supported the view that the reform process should focus in the short term on
developing market-based monetary instruments, restructuring the banking system, liberalizing
prices, strengthening budgetary management and procedures, and reforming the subsidy
system. Other reforms to create a conducive environment for more efficient economic activity,
including a vigorous privatization program and the building-up of a sound business climate,
require significant technical preparation and consensus building to ensure their successful
implementation over a longer period.
Directors considered that improving budgetary management and expenditure control in the
context of a prudent medium-term fiscal framework is key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. To control the large non-oil deficit, they highlighted the importance of strengthening the
non-oil tax base, including by reducing tax exemptions, and of streamlining spending.
In addition, the authorities should integrate all extra-budgetary operations into a consolidated
budget under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, and move toward greater budget
transparency.

-4Regarding oil revenues, Directors recommended that the substantial oil windfall projected over
the medium term be largely saved, or partly used to finance human capital investment and
structural reform measures, including restructuring public enterprises and the civil service.
They also emphasized the need to address the rigidities arising from the mechanical distribution
of oil revenues between capital and current expenditures. Directors called for the clarification of
the status of the Oil Reserve Fund, and increased transparency and accountability in its
operations, including through regular reporting on its accounts and their audit by an
independent agency.
Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite their plan to replace the current price subsidy
system with a cash subsidy, to be limited to the most vulnerable segments of the population.
It will also be important to tackle the issue of implicit subsidies, and in this context, Directors
welcomed the recent increase in electricity prices and recommended that the authorities
gradually raise domestic petroleum product prices to international levels. The introduction of
targeted social assistance would help cushion the effects of these reforms on the poor.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reform the monetary and banking sector.
Key priorities will be to give the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) greater operational independence
in the conduct of monetary policy, and for the CBL to increase its reliance on market-based
monetary instruments, gradually liberalize interest rates, and eliminate directed credits.
Directors also stressed the importance of strengthening bank supervision and ensuring
adequate asset classification and provisioning, in line with international best practices.
They commended the authorities’ intention to privatize public banks and allow foreign banks to
operate in Libya. Directors noted that there appeared to be no indication of pressure on the
exchange rate. Going forward, the authorities should be prepared to adjust the peg as
necessary in response to market developments and keep exchange rate policy under review as
reforms progress, to help ensure the competitiveness of the non-oil sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to privatize most state-owned enterprises, and
urged them to enact a privatization law that would give the privatization agency an independent
legal status and an explicit mandate. They encouraged the authorities to seek assistance from
the World Bank in this area. Directors also pointed to the need to start the preparatory work to
reform the regulatory and institutional framework to support the transition to a market economy.
Directors welcomed Libya’s efforts to re-integrate itself into the global economy. In this
connection, they urged the authorities to reassess their decision to withdraw from the HIPC
Initiative.
Directors called on the authorities to increase their efforts to address the weaknesses of Libya’s
statistical system and to improve the timeliness and quality of economic, financial, and budget
data. They encouraged the authorities to consider participation in the Fund’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), as a useful framework for statistical development.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ close collaboration with the Fund staff. In view of Libya’s
severe human resource constraints and weak institutions, they supported the authorities’

-5request for technical assistance from the Fund in support of the country’s economic and
financial reforms, with due regard given to their absorptive capacity. They noted the importance
of strengthened efforts to ensure the effective implementation of technical assistance
recommendations.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with the The Socialist People’s
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is also available.
