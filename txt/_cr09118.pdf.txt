Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Output grew at nearly 7 percent in 2006, the highest in a decade, and is expected to
remain close to that in 2007. Despite a recent debt write-off public debt remains high at 68 percent of
GDP at end-2007, limiting the room for needed poverty-alleviating and social sector spending.
Although external competitiveness remains a challenge, the real effective exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. Current account deficits are projected to remain elevated, reflecting expanding
tourism capacity and new infrastructure projects, but are expected to taper off as these activities
decline.
Discussions focused on the key policy issues:
•

Raising growth prospects: The central challenge is to develop and diversify the tourist industry,
by overcoming impediments including limited air transportation links, without jeopardizing debt
sustainability. The planned construction of a new airport should be financed as much as possible
from concessional sources; the authorities explained that any commercial borrowing for the project
would only be of a bridge financing nature while the sale of state-owned land takes place. Other
requirements for growth include sustained structural reforms to broaden the economic base, and
steps to improve the investment climate.

•

Ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability: The rebound in growth and the debt write-off provide an
opportunity to continue with fiscal consolidation and put debt on a solid downward path. Key to
this end will be maintaining the integrity of the value-added tax (VAT), better prioritizing capital
expenditure, adjusting domestic fuel prices, and reforming the National Insurance Service (NIS)
and public service pensions. Success in these areas should also provide scope to meet priority
needs for education, health and infrastructure spending.

•

Reducing vulnerabilities: The authorities have taken steps to strengthen disaster preparedness,
strengthen financial sector supervision and respond to the economic and social impact of continued
erosion of European Union trade preferences. Establishing a single regulatory unit for supervising
nonbank financial institutions is a priority.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK1
1.
•

The economy is enjoying its second year of vigorous economic growth.
Output grew at close to
7 percent in 2006, the highest
in the last decade and well
above potential (estimated at
4¼ percent). Economic activity
was sustained by construction
and government services. In
2007 growth is expected to
remain strong, despite
disappointing tourism arrivals,
due largely to tourism-related
investments and government
capital expenditure.2

•

Inflation has risen, mainly due to higher international oil and food prices, and is expected
to reach 8.2 percent by end-2007. The introduction of the VAT in May 2007 had a oneoff effect on inflation.

•

The current account deficit is expected to remain high in 2007–08 on account of higher
imports for various tourism-related projects and capital spending by the government.

•

Credit to the private sector expanded by 14¼ percent in 2006, attributable to the
Cricket World Cup (CWC) and tourism-related activities. In 2007–08 private credit
growth is expected to remain strong given the tourism-related activities and the
construction boom in the private sector.

•

Financial sector indicators have strengthened, but balance sheet vulnerabilities remain.
While asset quality and capital adequacy have improved, provisioning by foreign banks
continues to decline. Unsatisfactory assets (NPLs) have declined to 3 percent of total

A staff team comprising Ms. Pattillo (Head), Mr. Pineda, Ms. Tsounta (all WHD), and Ms. Basu (FIN) visited
Kingstown during October 25–November 9, 2007. The mission met with the Prime Minister and Minister of
Finance, Dr. Ralph Gonsalves, the Director General of the Ministry of Finance, other senior government
officials, opposition parliamentarians and political leaders, representatives of the financial and business sectors,
and farmers, trade unions and civil society. Staff of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) also participated. Messrs. Cashin (WHD) and Charleton (OED) joined the mission
for the final discussions, which overlapped with the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) Regional
Discussions.

Tourism arrivals fell by 14 percent in the first seven months of 2007, driven by a sharp decline in intraCaribbean arrivals (probably related to the increase in airfares following the merger of two regional airlines).

loans, well below the ECCB’s target of 5 percent. Increasing competition from nonbank
financial institutions and recent rapid credit growth could result in weaknesses in loan
classification and problem loans down the road, especially in the event of a large adverse
shock. An update of a 2004 AML/CFT assessment will take place in early 2009, at the
request of the authorities.
•

The outlook remains favorable. In 2008 growth is expected to remain strong with the
construction of the international airport, while inflation is expected to moderate due to the
projected stabilization of international oil and food prices. There are risks, however, as
the turbulence in global financial markets may dampen tourism demand and FDI flows.

2.
The fiscal position has strengthened. The primary deficit has narrowed by around
2 percent of GDP during 2005–07 reflecting both higher revenues and current spending
restraint. Revenues benefited from the growth dividend (higher stamp taxes related to land
sales), more frequent pass-through of oil prices, as well as the introduction of a VAT in May
2007 (Box 1). Wage restraint helped contain spending despite an increase in capital
expenditure.
3.
An agreement with Italy to write-off the Ottley Hall debt obligation has reduced
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ public debt stock by about 10 percent of GDP. The loan
had been serviced by the Italian export agency, due to perceived malfeasance by the private
builder-operator. The write-off, formalized in October 2007, will lower the debt to-GDP ratio
to around 68 percent by end-2007 (Box 2).
4.
Although external competitiveness remains a challenge, the exchange rate does
not appear to be overvalued. At end-September 2007 the real effective exchange rate
(REER) was at its lowest level in

enhance debt sustainability.
3

A time series model linking the REER to measures of the ECCU region’s fundamentals (productivity
differentials, terms of trade, government consumption and net foreign assets) indicates that there is little
evidence of overvaluation of the EC dollar. See Pineda and Cashin (2007), “Assessing Exchange Rate
Competitiveness in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,” 2007 ECCU Selected Issues Paper.

5
However, even under a current-policies scenario, the projected debt profile would not seem
to endanger the stability of the region’s currency board arrangement.
5.
Current account deficits are projected to remain elevated, as St. Vincent and the
Grenadines continues to adjust from an agricultural to a tourism-based economy. The
recent increase in current account deficits reflects, in large part, preparations for the CWC
and expanding tourism capacity as the country develops its tourism sector. The size of future
current account imbalances is expected to taper off in line with the decline in the construction
of new infrastructure projects and new resort facilities, though to remain elevated in the
projection period. This implies that despite their high levels, current account deficits,
financed largely by FDI, appear sustainable. An abrupt shift in investor sentiment that
reduces private investment in the tourist sector would be associated with a corresponding
decline in imports, with only limited disruption in the domestic economy.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS4
6.
The discussions focused on policies to enhance the economy’s growth potential
and reduce poverty, strengthen debt sustainability and address vulnerabilities.
A. Growth
7.
Enhancing growth prospects will be a challenge. Further developing and
diversifying the tourist industry will require overcoming impediments, including limited
international air transportation links. Structural reforms should aim at broadening the
economic base and creating an environment where the private sector is the engine of growth.
This could involve rethinking the need for state ownership in particular sectors, and working
with the World Bank and other donors to implement a private sector development program.

short of requirements by around EC$150 million (around 10 percent GDP).5 While the
government initially expected to finance most of this gap through land sales, this may not
be feasible within the next five years because most of the land still needs to be developed.
If the gap were to be filled by commercial borrowing, debt would increase to around
72 percent of GDP by 2012, and possibly higher if in-kind grants do not materialize. Staff
recommended an updated study of financing options for the project. The authorities
should also make sure that all infrastructure spending, operational costs, and borrowing
related to the project are carefully planned and transparently budgeted and accounted for,
possibly in the context of a medium-term expenditure framework. The authorities
underscored that the airport would not have an impact on the medium-term debt position,
since any borrowing would be of a bridge financing nature until the sale of state-owned
land takes place.
•

The investment climate. Private domestic investment has stagnated in recent years,
mainly as a result of high real interest rates, the lack of equity finance, and an
unfavorable tax regime.6 The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators suggest
improvements are needed in areas such as registering property, contract enforcement,
closing a business, availability of credit information, and cost of importing. Staff also
recommended a more transparent framework for providing tax incentives that more
effectively favors new investment, possibly involving accelerated depreciation and loss
carry-forward provisions. This could support further lowering of the corporate income tax
rate, as planned by the authorities.

•

Leveraging remittances. More than a quarter of the labor force of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines emigrated to OECD countries in the period 1970–2000, producing a steady
flow of remittances. Staff supported the authorities’ plans to boost the growth impact of
remittances, for example, through financial literacy programs geared toward more
efficient and productive use of remittances.

•

International trade. St. Vincent and the Grenadines still has licensing requirements for
some items (mainly agricultural and manufactured products). Staff encouraged
tarification of all items in line with WTO requirements. A draft National Export Strategy
will set out priority export areas, including tourism and agribusiness.

The construction of the international airport at Argyle is expected to cost around EC$480 million (around
32 percent of GDP) and be completed by 2012.

B. Debt Sustainability and Fiscal Policy
8.
Public debt needs to be reduced further. While the Ottley Hall debt write-off will
help the debt dynamics, it will not improve cashflow as the debt had been serviced by the
Italian export guarantee agency. Debt service already consumes 22½ percent of revenues,
more than spending on health and education.7

social spending. Staff

•

Property tax. The real estate sector is performing well, but with little improvement in
property tax collections. The authorities plan to move to a market valuation-based
property tax system as soon as technically feasible.

•

Tax concessions. The Custom and Revenue Department estimates that customsrelated exemptions cost about 9 percent of GDP in 2006 alone. Staff encouraged the

In December 2007 Moody’s Investors Service assigned a B1 long-term foreign and local-issuer rating with a
stable outlook to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, noting that further reductions in the debt-to-GDP ratio would
be necessary for the rating to improve.

8
authorities to phase out discretionary import and corporate tax concessions, replace
the latter with accelerated depreciation and loss carry forward provision, and
gradually lower the top corporate tax rate from 37.5 percent to 30 percent. The annual
budget should clearly specify revenue losses from exemptions and concessions.
•

Taxation of petroleum products. Although retail prices have been adjusted more
frequently in 2006 and 2007, staff recommended an automatic adjustment mechanism
to minimize revenue losses due to delays in adjustment, increase transparency and
reduce the political costs associated with announcing price hikes.

•

International airport. The authorities expect to borrow domestically EC$40 million
in 2008 (following borrowing of EC$50 million in 2006–07) as bridge-financing until
land sales materialize. Staff urged the authorities to review carefully the financing of
the project, seek additional grant and concessional financing, and make sure land
sales are realized as planned.

•

Capital budget. Better prioritization of capital expenditures would enhance their
efficiency and contribution to growth. Staff recommended that the government use
World Bank expertise to evaluate all public sector investment program (PSIP)
projects above a certain threshold (e.g., EC$5 million). Upgrading the PSIP with
technical assistance from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and CARTAC is
also recommended.

•

Public sector wages. The government’s wage bill, which accounts for about half of
all current expenditures, is among the highest in the ECCU despite its recent
reduction. Prudent management of wage increases and payrolls is needed. The recent
job reclassification exercise of civil servants should be used as a first step to wider
public service reform aimed at reducing employment levels, providing greater
differentiation in the pay scale and improving the overall delivery of public services.

10.
Staff commended the authorities on the successful introduction of the VAT and
urged them to hold firm against pressures to change rates and the exemption structure.
The number of taxpayers registering for the VAT has exceeded the authorities’ original
expectation by about half, with most taxpayers filing returns on time. The main challenge
now is to strengthen audit efforts, and to maintain the integrity of the VAT against pressures
to change the rate structure and increase the list of exempted and zero-rated items.

rationalize the public pension
system by integrating it with the NIS (Box 3).

•

Social programs. A series of social programs has evolved in a piecemeal fashion,
which is both expensive and inefficient in targeting the needs of vulnerable groups.
An ongoing household survey and poverty assessment, due by end-2008, should be
used to construct a well-targeted system with clear criteria. This could yield
substantial savings and help strengthen the impact of social programs, including
universal secondary education and newly announced health initiatives.
C.

Reducing Vulnerabilities

12.
The medium-term growth outlook appears favorable, but is subject to risks
because of the economy’s high vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
•

Financial sector soundness. The mission welcomes the 2006 passage of amendments
to the uniform Banking Act—bolstering ECCB regulatory powers and requiring
banks to provision for nonperforming government loans—and other improvements to
prudential regulations. Priorities going forward include further strengthening of onsite
and offsite examinations, establishing a single regulatory unit for nonbanks, and
enhancing supervisory capacity for all offshore financial entities. The latter is
important as the authorities view the offshore sector as a critical growth area and plan
to enhance their capacity to market and support the industry. Establishment of a credit
bureau would also support the continued expansion of sound credit flows.

•

International financial turbulence. While past international financial crises had little
impact on ECCU domestic credit markets, the ongoing repricing of risk could
potentially increase rollover risks should there be a continuous tightening of global

10
liquidity conditions.8 Moreover, lower growth and consumption in North America and
Europe could slow tourism demand and FDI.
•

Natural disasters. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is one of the world’s most
disaster-prone countries, and its participation in the World Bank’s Catastrophic Risk
Insurance Facility is welcome. Staff commends passage of the Disaster Management
Act and the Building Code, and encourages further insurance of public and private
assets.

•

The banana sector. The EU has committed funds to ameliorate the social impact of
the sector’s decline, but disbursements have been minimal.9 The authorities pointed to
their efforts to speed disbursements of EU commitments through contracting a Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) group as the implementing agency, and their
request to transform all EU commitments into budgetary support. Staff supported a
variety of targeted transition measures such as income transfers and noncontributory
pensions, noting the need for a transparent mechanism to fund these programs.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

13.
Growth has strengthened in recent years, providing an opportunity for
deepening the reform effort. Activity is being driven by expansion in construction and
tourism capacity, which should also support favorable prospects going forward. However,
sustaining high growth will be a challenge requiring continued structural reforms to broaden
the economic base, and enhance the investment climate.
14.
Developing the tourist industry will require enhancing air transport links, but
the potential impact of the international airport project on the country’s debt position
needs to be considered carefully. As a significant portion of the airport project may need to
be financed with commercial borrowing, staff urged the authorities to undertake an up-todate study of the financing structure, and make continued efforts to secure grant and
concessional loans to meet the projected financing needs in future years of the project.
15.
Fiscal consolidation needs to continue. The Ottley Hall debt write-off is welcome.
However, debt levels are still high and debt service consumes a considerable part of
revenues—more than spending on health and education. Continuing efforts toward fiscal
consolidation are needed to improve debt dynamics, increase the fiscal room to address
poverty alleviation and social needs and to cope with adverse shocks.
16.
The steps taken to improve tax policy and administration, including adoption of
the VAT, are welcome. It is crucial, however, that the authorities hold firm against emerging
8

The gross external financing needs of the government in 2008–09 are estimated at around 5 percent of GDP.

9

Banana exports as a share of GDP are expected to decline from 2.6 percent in 2006 to 1.6 percent in 2012.

11
pressures to change the VAT rate and exemption structure. Removing discretionary tax
concessions would allow space for phased reductions in the corporate income tax, and
introduction of a market-based property tax would boost revenues. On the expenditure front
priorities include better prioritization and phasing of infrastructure projects, and continued
containment in the growth of the wage bill. Together with the additional tax yield expected
from the VAT, these measures should allow an improvement in the primary balance of
around 2½ percent of GDP in 2008.
17.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to reform the NIS and civil service
pensions. Proposed reforms to ensure NIS’s financial viability include gradual increases in
the contribution rate and in the retirement age, and a reduction in the average replacement
rate. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to introduce some combination of these parametric
reforms. Staff also encourages the authorities to rationalize the public pension system by
transforming it into a complement to the NIS.
18.
Although external competitiveness remains a challenge, the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Going forward, fiscal consolidation
along with growth enhancing reforms will be needed to support competitiveness and ensure
the continued stability of the currency board arrangement. Recent increases in the current
account deficit reflect expanding tourism capacity and new infrastructure projects and are
expected to taper off as these activities decline. However, even under a current policies
scenario, debt accumulation would not seem to endanger stability of the region’s currency
board arrangement.
19.
Further strengthening of financial sector supervision is a priority. Staff welcomes
the passage of amendments to the uniform Banking Act and other improvements to
prudential regulations. Financial sector supervision should continue to be strengthened,
including through effective onsite and offsite examinations and by establishing a single
regulatory unit for nonbank financial institutions.
20.
Despite significant progress in recent years, St. Vincent and the Grenadines’
economy remains vulnerable. Key risks include: the high public debt and potential reversal
of debt reduction, the occurrence of natural disasters, lower growth in North America and
Europe, rising oil prices, and more rapid erosion of trade preferences for banana exports. The
authorities will need to respond rapidly to any changes in the country’s economic
environment.
21.
Despite efforts to enhance statistics, data remains weak in terms of coverage and

Box 1. The New VAT
A new VAT was introduced successfully on May 1, 2007. The introduction was well managed by the
authorities and supported by CARTAC assistance. Additional staff were appointed in the Inland Revenue
Department (IRD), allowing it and businesses to prepare adequately. The VAT has a rate of 15 percent for
goods and services, with a number of basic items zero-rated (such as bulk rice, flour and sugar) or exempted
(publicly-supplied water and prescription drugs). Tourist accommodations have a rate of 10 percent.
Preparing the public was key to the success of the launching. Activities included intensified efforts to
educate the public, increase the number of taxpayers registered, and assist taxpayers to file. About 73 percent of
registered taxpayers initially filed the VAT return on time; with the authorities’ follow-up activities, the filing
rate for September has risen to about 80 percent.
The main challenges going forward will be to strengthen compliance measures and to maintain the
integrity of the VAT. IRD has continued to increase the number of audits conducted, including the first audits
in the Grenadines, and has focused on detecting taxpayers preparing VAT invoices and sales receipts that do not
meet the minimum requirements. However, no penalties have been assessed and further enforcement steps are
necessary to deal with the identified violations. CARTAC short-term experts are providing technical assistance
to strengthen audit efforts. Pressures for exemptions and discretionary waivers have increased, particularly in
the tourism sector. It is crucial that the authorities withstand those pressures.
Preliminary numbers indicate that the VAT is likely to yield additional revenues of around 0.5 percent of
GDP for 2007. Consumption tax revenues through September 2007 grew by around 40 percent compared to a
similar period in 2006, consistent with the expected yield for the entire year.

Box 2. Ottley Hall Debt Write-Off
In 1999 the government assumed a large private external debt of EC$156 million (17½ percent of 1999
GDP) for the construction of the Ottley Hall shipyard (a yacht repair facility). The shipyard was operated by
a joint-venture company between the government (49 percent) and a private company (51 percent). The
government had guaranteed the debt. Due to perceived malfeasance by the private partner, the project ended up
being a large loss-maker. The government estimates that the value of the assets amount to only about
EC$14 million. In 2001 the government obtained a moratorium on interest payments pending a settlement with
creditors (foreign commercial banks), and the Italian export guarantee agency, SACE, which had insured the
external creditors, began servicing the loan.
In October 2007 the governments of Italy and St. Vincent and the Grenadines formalized the write-off of
the Ottley Hall debt obligation, reducing St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ public debt by EC$150 million, to
around 68 percent of GDP.

Box 3. Challenges Facing the National Insurance Services (NIS) and Public Service
Pension System1
The fragile financial position of St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NIS, and the growing demands placed
on the budget by the public service (PS) pension system present serious challenges. Although the NIS
currently runs a significant cash surplus, population aging, the maturing of the scheme, and its current
structure―with a low contribution rate of only 6 percent, a young retirement age of 60 years and replacement
rates of up to 60 percent of wages―will require steep increases in contributions in the future. A recent Fiscal
Affairs Department (FAD) technical assistance mission found that, without reforms, the trust fund could be
exhausted by 2025 and the cumulated deficits grow to 165 percent of GDP by 2050. The growth in benefits for
retired civil servants presents an immediate challenge, with the PS pension bill now accounting for 1.3 percent
of GDP―double its 2000 value―and growing at almost twice the rate of the wage bill.
To avoid the need for abrupt and disruptive future adjustments, reform of the NIS should start
immediately. Proposals to ensure its financial sustainability, some of which are currently being considered by
the authorities, include a gradual increase in the contribution rate and retirement age; and a gradual decline in
the replacement rates. Other efficiency and equity-enhancing reforms could include the indexation of pensions
to the consumer price index; changing the calculation of survivor benefits to better protect the families of
young workers; and placing NIS’s investment into an internationally well-diversified portfolio.
Immediate action is also needed to contain the PS pension bill. The system is noncontributory, with
pensions more generous than the NIS ones, allowing for retirement at 55 with a maximum replacement rate of
66⅔ percent of the employees’ three best years. Since civil servants also participate in the NIS scheme,
replacement rates could potentially approach 127 percent if employees reach the maximum under both schemes.
The two pension schemes should be integrated. Proposed reforms include capping the PS pension benefits to
limit the combined NIS and PS replacement rate below 100 percent; aligning the NIS and PS retirement ages;
and instituting a contribution for pensionable workers in the PS system to make full compensation of public
servants transparent. To increase social consensus for reforms and enhance equity and efficiency, additional
measures could include the provision of survivor benefits and some compensation for those who leave before
being eligible for a pension; and closing the PS pension system to new workers while substituting an Individual
Retirement Account, with matching employer contributions.

Annex I. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative
Fiscal Scenarios
The risk of current fiscal policies leading to an unsustainable level of public debt
remains, given the increasing pressure for capital and social spending. In the absence of
prioritization of expenditures, notably in capital spending, and a determined increase in
revenues, current debt dynamics are quite unfavorable.
Two fiscal scenarios are considered—baseline and active. Under the baseline, the debt
stock and debt servicing costs continue to rise; under the active scenario discussed in the text,
the stock of debt declines gradually over the medium term. Under both scenarios, the staff
assumes that the airport would be completed by 2012.
Baseline Scenario. The authorities continue current expansionary policies with overall
deficits that are financed with commercial borrowing and some grants from nontraditional
donors, such as Venezuela, Cuba, and Taiwan Province of China. Financing is assumed to
continue to be available. The current financing gap for the international airport—estimated at
around EC$150 million net of expected land sales—is assumed to be borrowed by the central
government. In the medium term, growth remains driven by the public sector mainly through
large-scale construction, but is lower (by about ½ of 1 percent) than under the active
scenario. On the revenue side, the VAT yields additional revenues of around 1½ percent of
GDP by 2008, the maximum corporate income tax rate is reduced to 30 percent by 2009
reducing corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP by 1 percentage point, and regular passthrough of international oil prices continues. On the expenditure side, after 2008 the wage
bill as a share of GDP remains constant, while capital expenditures remain at around 8
percent of GDP. Under this scenario, the primary balance would remain in deficit (peaking at
3½ percent of GDP in 2010), and public debt would reach about 72 percent of GDP by 2012.
Active Scenario. The government would not incur any additional borrowing related to the
international airport after 2008. Over the medium term, revenue measures would focus on:
(i) the introduction of market valuation-based property taxes in 2009 with an expected
additional yield of ½ of 1 percent of GDP; (ii) efficiency gains in customs collections, and
(iii) the gradual reduction by 2012 of the corporate income tax from 37.5 to 30 percent along
with the gradual reduction of tax concessions (revenue neutral). Additional grants are
expected from Taiwan Province of China and the European Union. On the expenditure side,
in order to create room for planned additional social spending, growth in the real wage bill
would be minimal (by holding real wages and the number of civil servants constant).
Reforms to the public service pension system are adopted yielding estimated savings of
0.2 percent of GDP, while capital expenditure would be reduced by the elimination or
postponement of low-priority projects, although it would still remain above its long-run
average of 6.6 percent of GDP.
With the impetus from public sector capital projects and greater activity in the private sector,
the underlying growth rate is expected to accelerate to about 4¾ percent over the medium
term. Under this scenario, public debt would decline to about 53 percent of GDP by 2012.

Annex II. Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
St. Vincent and the Grenadines does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary
policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean
dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
January 17, 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 07/367). Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) have visited
St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities.
Relations with the World Bank Group
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
FY 2006–09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. There are four active World Bank projects in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines with a net commitment of approximately US$14.44 million.

Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has continued to receive financing from the Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) mostly for infrastructure and human resource development. As of November 30, 2007,
CDB has approved loans totalling US$157.6 million, of which US$30.4 million are undisbursed.
Statistical Issues
St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). While in areas central to surveillance—notably central government accounts, indicators of
the financial sector and external sector accounts—the data are adequate for surveillance purposes,
information on the rest of the public sector and nonbank financial intermediaries is limited. Major
improvements are needed to facilitate effective surveillance, particularly in the coverage of national
accounts (especially the tourism sector and related services), and on data used to monitor labor
markets.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank (the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S.
dollar. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Vincent and the Grenadines maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfer for current international transactions.
VIII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a participating
government, is subject to a full safeguards assessment under a four-year cycle. The most
recent assessment was completed in July 2007, and concluded that the ECCB continues to
have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which have strengthened since the first
safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management places emphasis on good
governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank’s transparency and accountability
since the last assessment, including the publications of financial statements that comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made some recommendations to
sustain the ECCB’s safeguards framework going forward.
IX. Last Article IV Consultation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is currently on the
12–month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
January 17, 2006; the relevant documents are IMF Country Report No. 07/367 and IMF
Country Report No. 07/368.

X. Technical Assistance (January 2006– ): Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) have visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since
the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities.
In the area of public finance, CARTAC assisted with the introduction of the VAT and excise
taxes at all different stages. CARTAC has also provided technical assistance in statistics to
develop export-import prices, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. On the
financial front CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and upgrade the
International Insurance Act, and to develop regulations for Credit Unions.

Appendix II. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Relations with the World Bank Group
(November 30, 2007)

The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS) countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities
will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of
the recently completed growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA
support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for interventions to
support the two main pillars. An indicative Base Case lending scenario consists of about
US$51.3 million in IDA resources for the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada,
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). This amount includes the estimated IDA
country allocations for each of the four countries during FY 2006–09, and an IDA Regional
allocation of US$15.2 million for two regional projects: US$12 million for Catastrophe Risk
Insurance and US$3.2 million for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform.
IV. PROJECTS
There are four active World Bank projects in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net
commitment of approximately US$14.44 million.
The OECS Catastrophe Insurance Project was approved in March, 2007 for
US$0.7 million. The objective of the project is to reduce the participating OECS
governments' financial vulnerability to natural disasters through insurance coverage against
earthquakes and hurricanes. This will be achieved through the establishment of the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing of catastrophe insurance
coverage from the Facility. The project will include the following two components:
(a) payment of entrance fee; and (b) payment of annual insurance premium for the first three
years. The objective of the first component is to assist the participating OECS countries to
join the CCRIF through the financing of the entrance fee. This fee is equal to the first year’s
insurance premium. The aim of the second component is to assist the participating OECS
countries to purchase the catastrophe insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the
first three years.

5
The Telecommunications & ICT Development Project, approved in September 2005, aims
at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve
socioeconomic development in the OECS. The project has the following four components:
Component (1) will strengthen the national and regional regulatory frameworks and promote
additional competition in the telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity
building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistances
to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection
regime. Component (2) will review current universal access policy, create related guidelines,
and provide financial support to establish a Universal Service Fund (USF). Component (3)
will improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of
broadband infrastructure. Component (4) will finance management and administration of the
overall project. The project will finance related technical assistance by providing
complementary resources.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Education Reform Project was approved in
June 2004 for US$6.2 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital
which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable
growth. This objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary
education; (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct
interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and
(iii) strengthening management of the sector and governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in July 2002, is
funded under the Multi-Country Adaptable Program Loan for the Caribbean Region, with the
following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational
and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term. The
Bank’s support to St. Vincent and the Grenadines under this project is for US$7.0 million.
V. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to: public sector capacity in the
OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, the OECS
Procurement Assessment Review, the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment, and an
Infrastructure Services Studies. In conjunction with the IMF, a Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) was completed in early 2004. The Bank also recently completed an OECS
study on Growth and Competitiveness, a Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization report, and
a Caribbean Crime and Violence study. Work is ongoing on an OECS Private Sector
Financing Study. For St. Vincent and the Grenadines specifically, the Bank recently
completed an Analysis of Fiscal Issues, which examines the management and allocation of
public expenditure.

Appendix IV. St. Vincent and the Grenadines—Statistical Issues
(As of November 30, 2007)
St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since September 2000, and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board. Statistical databases remains weak in terms of coverage, consistency,
periodicity, and timeliness. While in areas central to surveillance—notably central
government accounts, indicators of the financial sector and external sector accounts—the
data are adequate for surveillance purposes, information on the rest of the public sector and
nonbank financial intermediaries is limited. Major improvements are needed to facilitate
effective surveillance, particularly in the coverage of national accounts (especially the
tourism sector and related services), and on data used to monitor labor markets. Efforts to
address the weaknesses in the statistical base have been hampered by low response rates to
surveys (less than 50 percent), and high turnover of staff.
National accounts
GDP by industry is provided with a one-year lag, with inadequate coverage of economic
activity in the informal sector. There is a need to upgrade national accounting methodology
from the 1968 System of National Accounts to the 1993 System of National Accounts. In
addition, data on GDP broken down by type of expenditure are not available at constant
prices, while data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross
capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. CARTAC
is now finalizing a project for improving the national accounts though the development of
Supply and Use tables. Data generated will be used to revise and rebase the GDP series. In
October 2007 CARTAC also launched a project for strengthening tourism statistics in the
OECS, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project covers the core tourism
datasets relating to visitor arrivals, visitor expenditure, tourist accommodation and statistics
for other key tourism-related enterprises. The project will also seek to standardize and
harmonize tourism concepts, definitions and classification schemes across these countries.
Prices
Data on the consumer price index (CPI) are reported regularly with a one-month lag.
CARTAC, as part of the Fund-assisted program on Constructing Weights for the Harmonized
Consumer Price Index in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), has assisted in
linking the 1981-based to the 2001-based CPI series. The Statistical Office (SO) is currently
undertaking a combined Country Poverty Assessment and Household Budgetary Survey.
Labor
The SO has not published official data on unit labor costs and employment. Results of the
2001 population census have been analyzed and published.

10
Public finance
Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some ministries, quarterly revenue and
expenditure data for the central government are provided to the Fund with some lag.
Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and monetary accounts, between above and below the
line for budget data, and between financing and debt data. Although domestic debt figures
are now available following implementation of the Commonwealth Secretariat—Debt
Recording and Management System, the domestic debt amortization figures are incomplete.
The financial reports of public enterprises are not timely, with about a two-year lag.
The IMF publishes annual data for the consolidated general government in the GFS
Yearbook, with the 2007 edition showing annual data to 2004. No new data have been
received for more recent years. Only cash data are shown, with a detailed classification of
revenue and a functional, but not economic, classification of expenditure. No financing
information is provided. The 2007 GFS Yearbook shows no balance sheet data but the 2004
edition published domestic and foreign liabilities for 2001.
Monetary statistics
Monetary data are compiled by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) on a monthly
basis. The data are reported regularly to the Fund, although the timeliness of data could be
improved. There is also a need to improve the institutional coverage that currently only
comprises the ECCB and commercial banks. Full implementation of recommendations made
by the monetary and financial statistics missions conducted in August 2003 and December
2005 should ensure consistency with international best practice.
While noting some recent improvements, the April 2007 data ROSC mission identified some
shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics, which have a potential for detracting from
the accurate and timely analysis of monetary and financial developments and formulation of
appropriate policies. In particular, (i) the methodological soundness of monetary statistics
can be improved by adopting internationally accepted concepts and definitions, expanding
their institutional coverage, and revising the classifications of financial instruments and the
basis for recording; (ii) the transparency of monetary statistics can be improved, for example,
by releasing monetary data to all users at the same time and strengthening the validation of
the disseminated data; (iii) the timeliness of the dissemination of the data on broad money
and credit aggregates can be improved to meet best international practices; and (iv) the
access to officially disseminated monetary data and metadata can be improved.
Balance of payments
Estimates are currently provided on an annual basis by the ECCB, using a format that is not
fully consistent with BPM5. There is a need to improve the compilation of capital and
financial account transactions in the balance of payments. In addition, the recording of the
stock of private and public debt should be improved.

INTERNATIONAL MONTETARY FUND
ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
January 7, 2008
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that a key
challenge will be achieving sound public finances to ensure debt sustainability, particularly
given the uncertainties relating to the new international airport financing. Staff estimates
show that if sizable government borrowing is needed to finance the construction of the new
international airport, public debt would be on a rising and potentially unsustainable path.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt distress rating is moderate.
VII. BACKGROUND
23.
Macroeconomic outcomes have strengthened significantly in recent years. Real GDP
growth averaged 5½ percent during 2004–06, and reached close to 7 percent in 2006.
Activity was sustained by construction, tourism and government services; partly related to
preparations for the Cricket World Cup (CWC). Fiscal imbalances also improved in 2006,
but remain high. Total tax revenues were strong, buoyed by higher stamp taxes and more
frequent pass-through of oil prices. Current spending was lower, reflecting some reduction on
wages and salaries. As a result, the overall deficit fell to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2006, but the
NPV of the public sector debt remained high at around 69 percent (78 percent in nominal
terms).
VIII. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
24.
The baseline scenario assumes continued current expansionary policies with overall
deficits that are financed commercially and with some grants from nontraditional donors,
such as Venezuela, Cuba, and Taiwan Province of China. Medium-term growth is projected
at around 4¼ percent, driven mostly by large-scale public sector construction and tourism,
given the ongoing construction of the new international airport. Under this scenario, the
central government primary balance improves only modestly, with a deficit of around
⅝ percent of GDP by 2012. While the growth projections are similar to those in the 2006
Article IV consultation DSA, the fiscal projections are more conservative, partly reflecting
the uncertainties surrounding the financing of the international airport.

2

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2007–27)
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average about 4¼ percent, which is close to the
historical average (1996–2006, at around 3¾ percent). Inflation is projected to
remain low, consistent with historical averages and the currency board arrangement.

•

The primary balance of the central government is projected to improve moderately,
but less than envisaged in the 2006 Article IV consultation. On the revenue side, the
VAT yields additional revenues of around 1½ percent of GDP by 2008, and frequent
pass-through of international oil prices continues. On the expenditure side, the wage
bill as a share of GDP remains at its current level, while capital expenditures remain
at around 8 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, the public sector primary deficit
would remain sizable (peaking at 3½ percent of GDP by 2010), and the NPV of
public debt would reach about 69 percent of GDP (72 percent in nominal terms) by
2012.

•

Annual disbursements of external capital grants are expected to be around
1½ percent of GDP, consistent with the historical average.

•

Given the ongoing repricing of risk and tightening global liquidity conditions, it is
assumed that average nominal interest rates on foreign debt increase to around
7 percent.

•

The current account deficit is assumed to remain high during the period when the
airport is constructed and then return to a more sustainable level, due to a pickup in
tourist receipts. The expansion of tourist arrivals is underpinned by an expansion of
the hotel capacity of 40 percent over the medium term and the construction of the
new international airport.

•

FDI is assumed to return to its historical average of around 14 percent of GDP.
IX. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

25.
At end-2006 the NPV of public debt was high at about 69 percent of GDP
(78 percent in nominal terms), albeit still among the lowest in the ECCU. Expansionary
budgets in 2002–05 sharply raised the fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio. Fiscal
imbalances remained high in 2006–07, owing to increased CWC-related capital
expenditures.

3
26.
The NPV of external debt stood at 39 percent of GDP, and domestic debt at
30 percent of GDP. The largest share of the external debt stock is owed to multilateral and
bilateral creditors (around 55 percent of total external debt), followed by commercial
creditors (around 45 percent of total external debt). In the future, most new external
requirements are expected to be financed through the ECCU Regional Government
Securities Market (RGSM). On the domestic front, commercial banks are the most
important lenders to the government.
27.
An agreement with Italy to write-off the Ottley Hall debt obligation reduced
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NPV of public debt by about 3¼ percent of GDP
(10 percent in nominal terms). This loan had been serviced by the Italian export agency, due
to perceived malfeasance by the private builder-operator. The debt write-off, formalized in
October 2007, will lower the NPV of debt to-GDP ratio to around 66 percent by end-2007
(68 percent in nominal terms).
Baseline Scenario
28.
Under the baseline scenario St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NPV of public debt to
GDP ratio would rise to about 69 percent by 2012 (72 percent in nominal terms), and
increase further in the long term to around 82 percent of GDP by 2027 (82½ percent in
nominal terms). Similarly, the NPV of debt-to revenue ratio increases from 181 percent in
2007 to around 211 percent by 2012.
Alternative Scenarios
Active scenario
29.
Under this scenario a fiscal adjustment would raise the primary surplus of the central
government to 4 percent of GDP over the medium term. The adjustment would be
supported by revenue measures, including: (i) the introduction of market valuation-based
property taxes in 2009 with an expected additional yield of ½ of 1 percent of GDP;
(ii) efficiency gains in customs collections, and (iii) the gradual reduction by 2012 of the
corporate income tax from 37.5 to 30 percent along with the gradual reduction of tax
concessions (revenue neutral). It is assumed that donors would support the reform strategy,
and additional grants would be provided by the European Union and Taiwan Province of
China. On the expenditure side, in order to create room for planned additional social
spending, growth in the real wage bill would be minimal (by holding real wages and the
number of civil servants constant). This scenario also assumes that the government sells
enough land to meet any additional financial needs related to the international airport after
2008. Reforms to the public service pension system are adopted yielding estimated savings
of 0.2 percent of GDP, while capital expenditure would be reduced by the elimination or
postponement of low-priority projects, although it would still remain above its long-run
average of 6.6 percent of GDP.

4
30.
Under this adjustment scenario St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ NPV of public debt
to GDP would decline to about 55 percent by 2012 (53 percent in nominal terms)—below
the 60 percent benchmark of the ECCB (Table 2, Active Scenario). The NPV of debt to
GDP ratio would decline throughout the period reaching around 41 percent of GDP by
2027. All other indicators of debt sustainability would register continual improvements;
particularly debt service as a share of current revenue, which would fall to around
14 percent by 2027.
Lower growth and natural disasters
31.
The sensitivity analysis shows that lower economic growth and natural disasters are
the two key vulnerabilities for St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt dynamics. Assuming
that growth remains at one standard deviation below the level in the baseline scenario, the
NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 115 percent of GDP by 2027 (Table 2, Scenario A3).
Similarly, the impact of a natural disaster on St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ debt dynamics
is very significant (Table 2, Scenario A4). Under this scenario the government incurs a
fiscal cost of 9 percent of GDP in 2008–10, reverting to the baseline levels thereafter.10 This
shock accelerates the deterioration of the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio which reaches
85 percent of GDP by 2012.
Borrowing for the Airport
32.
Sensitivity analysis also shows the importance of containing borrowing for the
construction of the new international airport. If the in-kind grants do not materialize, land
sales are lower than expected, and the government needs to borrow around 50 percent of the
airport cost, then by 2012 the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 88 percent (Table 2,
Scenario A5).
X. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
33.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt sustainability analysis covers only
public sector debt, since data on private sector external borrowing is not available. As a
result, debt dynamics in the external DSA follow a similar pattern to those of the public
sector DSA.
34.
Under the baseline scenario the NPV of external debt gradually increases, reaching
41½ percent of GDP by 2027 (42 percent in nominal terms), but remains within the

10

The actual impact of this shock could be lower given the recent participation of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility—a regional insurance pool organized by the
World Bank.

prudential threshold of 50 percent. 11 The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio remains below
100 percent throughout the period, comfortably below the indicative threshold of
200 percent.
35.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the level of external debt is most sensitive to a
negative shock to output growth and a decline on FDI. If FDI were to fall to one standard
deviation below its historical average in 2008–09, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase to 71 percent by 2012 (Table 4, Scenario B4) or 75 percent in nominal
terms. Similarly, with output growth at one standard deviation below its historical average
for 2008–09, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 58 percent by 2012
(Table 4, Scenario B1) or 62 in nominal terms.
XI. CONCLUSION
36.
Public sector imbalances would remain high without continuous fiscal adjustment,
and by 2017 the NPV of public debt-to-GDP would return to a similar level as before the
Ottley Hall write-off. Staff analysis shows that with a fiscal adjustment that achieves a
central government primary surplus (including grants) of around 4 percent of GDP by 2012,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines would reach a nominal public debt-to-GDP ratio below
60 percent—the ECCB benchmark—by 2011.
37.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines faces a moderate risk of external debt distress. The
debt trajectory under the baseline scenario does not breach the NPV of debt-to-GDP
indicative threshold; however, various stress tests underline the country’s vulnerabilities to
natural disasters, lower FDI, and lower output growth. These alternative scenarios show a
substantial rise in the debt-service ratio over the projection period, and a breach of some of
the debt stock thresholds.

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt-burden thresholds. Policy performance is measured by the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by the World Bank. The CPIA
divides countries into three performance categories (strong, medium, and poor) based on the overall quality of
macroeconomic policies, with strong performers having higher prudential thresholds than poor performers.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is classified by the CPIA as a strong performer, implying prudential thresholds
on NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios of 50 and 200 percent, respectively.

1/ Assumes that real GDP growth is at baseline minus one standard deviation divided by the square root of 20 (i.e., the length of the projection period).
2/ Assumes a fiscal cost for the government of 9 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2010.
3/ Assumes in-kind grants do not materialize and the government needs to borrow 50 percent of the airport cost.
4/ Revenues are defined inclusive of grants.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 4, 2008
1.
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The 2008 Budget announced some changes to the VAT rate and exemption
structure. The VAT rate for some tourism-related services was reduced from 15 to
10 percent, yachting was exempted, and a number of additional food and personal items were
zero-rated. The authorities estimate that these changes will cost around 0.4 percent of GDP
annually; an upcoming FAD technical assistance mission will refine the estimates.
3.
The 2008 Budget is likely to yield some fiscal consolidation, assuming capital
spending implementation and grant receipts are at historical rates. Total revenue
(including grants) is expected to increase by 1½ percent of GDP relative to the 2007
projected outturn, driven by a sharp rise in external grants. Current revenues remain constant
(as a share of GDP) as an increase in fuel prices largely offsets a reduction in the corporate
income tax rate from 37½ to 35 percent. Expenditure comes down marginally, as a reduction
in capital spending more than offsets an increase in current spending. Staff estimates that the
central government overall deficit for 2008 will narrow to around 2½ percent of GDP; close
to the staff’s active scenario, albeit driven more by the increase in grants than by expenditure
reduction and current revenue increases. A sustained deficit reduction would require
continued expenditure restraint as grants are likely to revert to their long-run average.
4.
Increases in the contribution rates for the National Insurance Services (NIS)
were announced in the budget. The government signaled its commitment to further social
security reforms, including gradual increases in the retirement age; options for reforming the
public service pension system are also under consideration. These steps are in line with
recent FAD technical assistance recommendations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 13, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On February 4, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.1
Background
The economy is enjoying its second year of vigorous economic growth. Output grew at close to
7 percent in 2006, the highest in the last decade and well above potential (estimated at
4¼ percent). Economic activity was sustained by construction and government services. In
2007 growth remained strong, despite disappointing tourism arrivals, due largely to tourismrelated investments and government capital expenditure. Inflation has risen, mostly reflecting
the higher international oil and food prices, and is expected to reach 8.2 percent by end-2007.
The current account deficit is expected to remain high in 2007–08 on account of higher imports
for various tourism-related projects, and capital spending by the government. Credit to the
private sector expanded by 14¼ percent in 2006, attributable to the Cricket World Cup (CWC)
and tourism-related activities.
Financial sector indicators have strengthened, but balance sheet vulnerabilities remain. Asset
quality and capital adequacy have improved, with unsatisfactory assets (non-performing loans)
down to 3 percent of total loans, well below the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s target of 5
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

percent. Increasing competition from nonbank financial institutions and recent rapid credit
growth could result in weaknesses in loan classification and problem loans down the road,
especially in the event of a large adverse shock. An update of a 2004 Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) assessment will take place in
early 2009, at the request of the authorities.
The fiscal position has strengthened. The primary deficit has narrowed by around 2 percent of
GDP during 2005–07 reflecting both higher revenues and current spending restraint. Revenues
benefited from the growth dividend (higher stamp taxes related to land sales), more frequent
pass-through of oil prices, as well as the introduction of a VAT in May 2007. Wage restraint
helped contain spending despite an increase in capital expenditure.
An agreement with Italy to write-off a debt obligation has reduced St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ public debt stock by about 10 percent of GDP. The loan had been serviced by the
Italian export agency, due to perceived malfeasance by the private builder-operator. The writeoff, formalized in October 2007, will lower the debt to-GDP ratio to around 68 percent by end2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ recent strong macroeconomic
performance, marked by robust economic growth, fiscal consolidation, and declining debt levels.
Directors noted that the potential upside risks to inflation, the high current account deficit, and
the still-high public debt require continued efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to diversifying the economy, further developing the
tourist industry, lowering the cost of doing business, and reducing the vulnerability to economic
shocks to address these medium-term challenges.
Directors stressed that continued fiscal consolidation is needed to lower the public debt-to-GDP
ratio, and create room to raise social spending. They welcomed the recent introduction of a
value-added tax (VAT) and encouraged the authorities to resist pressures to change the VAT
rates and the exemption structure. They supported the early introduction of market valuationbased property taxes, the reduction of tax concessions, and the timely pass-through of
international oil price changes. Spending restraint will also be important, particularly through
control of the wage bill and prioritization of capital expenditure.
Directors noted the authorities’ plan to accelerate investment in tourism-related infrastructure, in
particular the ongoing construction of a new international airport. While the higher investment is
expected to raise the economy’s growth potential and planned land sales could help to fill the
financing gap, Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake an updated study of the
financing structure, and to seek additional grant and concessional financing to contain the
potential impact on the country’s debt position.
While the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, Directors considered
that maintaining St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external competitiveness will require continued

3
fiscal consolidation along with growth-enhancing reforms. They expected the current account
deficit, which is mainly financed by grants and foreign direct investment, to decline over the
medium term in line with the fall in infrastructure and tourism investment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to reform the National Insurance Services,
including through increases in the contribution rate, and encouraged the authorities to integrate
the civil service pension system with the National Insurance Services. Directors also welcomed
the amendments to the Banking Act and encouraged the establishment of a single regulatory
unit to supervise non-bank financial institutions.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the quality of statistics, and encouraged
the authorities’ further efforts to improve the coverage and timeliness of data.

Statement by Jonathan Fried, Executive Director for St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and Peter Charleton, Alernate Executive Director
February 4, 2008
The authorities of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) express their thanks to the staff for
a very productive dialogue and a fair and well-balanced report. They also wish to
acknowledge the valuable technical assistance provided in the context of introducing VAT.
This discussion is being held in the context of the overall ECCU regional surveillance
discussion and the issues raised in the ECCU Buff are pertinent to SVG. Within the ECCU,
St. Vincent is one of the lower income, less developed economies. It has a large poor rural
population, suffers from difficult and expensive access and has been disproportionately
impacted by the decline of the banana industry. Although the Grenadines enjoy a high-end
tourism niche, the fragile environment effectively precludes large-scale tourism. St. Vincent,
with the vast bulk of the population, has been an agriculturally-based economy and is only
now moving towards a tourism and services-based economy. As is the case with the other
East Caribbean islands, SVG is particularly vulnerable to the global economic developments
and unpredictable weather-related shocks. It is against this background that the authorities
are seeking to re-orient the economy.
Economic Performance
Economic performance over the past few years has been quite good, with growth of around 7
percent in both 2006 and 2007 and prospects for the future are encouraging. The decline of
the banana industry has been offset by strong growth in construction, both in relation to the
2007 Cricket World Cup and to some major hotel projects. Major challenges remain,
however, in tackling of rural poverty and enhancing the skills of the younger generation.
The spike of inflation is of particular concern to the authorities and they have few
instruments to combat it. The strong peg to the US dollar has always provided monetary
stability, but the combination of the pass-through of high oil prices, the introduction of VAT,
rising global food prices (which have a large weight in the CPI), and the weak US dollar
combined to push inflation to above 8 percent at the end of 2007. The authorities have
refrained from taking exceptional measures that would have entailed fiscal costs and have
remained firm on public sector pay. Inflation is expected to ease in 2008 but living standards
are being impacted.
While the current external deficit, at 27 percent of GDP, appears extremely large, it reflects
imports for large tourism developments and are financed by FDI. The deficit does not reflect
exchange rate misalignment or overvaluation of the currency and it does not represent a
threat to the currency peg.
Fiscal Policy
SVG’s fiscal record has been relatively good over time. The cost of providing infrastructure
and public services across a multi-island country with a small population remains a major

2
challenge. The progressive loss of traditional donor support and weather-related disasters has
added to fiscal pressures. At 68 percent of GDP, the debt ratio is not inordinately high and
the ECCB benchmark of 60 percent is clearly achievable. But the more immediate goal of the
authorities is to reduce debt-service costs which tend to crowd-out much needed social
expenditure.
Over the past few years, the authorities have tightened fiscal policy with action on both the
revenue and expenditure sides. The introduction of VAT in May 2007 was effected very
smoothly and the revenue results have been positive. While the 2008 budget contained some
adjustments to the VAT regime, its integrity has been maintained and the authorities are
determined and confident that they will not be forced into unwarranted concessions. While
the authorities have not adopted a fully automatic pricing mechanism for fuel products, oil
price increases are passed through on a regular basis and the fiscal burden has been
eliminated. Going forward, the authorities are working on a market valuation-based property
tax, which should further enhance revenue. On the expenditure side the authorities have
successfully reined-in public sector pay and will continue to exercise restraint. They are also
bringing forward parametric changes to the pension regime. National Insurance Service
(NIS) contribution rates were increased in the 2008 budget and the pension age is being
gradually increased. Overall, the 2008 budget entails significant fiscal consolidation broadly
consistent with the staff’s active scenario.
The Airport
The dominant issue in the discussion with the staff affecting fiscal and growth prospects is
the construction of an international airport. The simple reality is that the two least developed
ECCU countries – SVG and Dominica – are those with airports not capable of taking jet
aircraft or night landings. Access to SVG is thus more difficult and expensive than the
neighboring islands and is a huge impediment to development of the tourist industry. On the
other hand, the cost of construction of even a modest airport is as high as 40 percent of GDP,
given the very difficult topography of the island and the small size of the population. The
authorities are executing the development of the new airport with help from non-traditional
donors in a manner which should not lead to an increase in the public debt. Initially, the
authorities have to incur debt to buy the land for the airport, but they own significant other
lands which, after infrastructural investment to enhance its value, will be sold to repay debt.
Debt financing will thus be of a bridging nature and will not add to the debt ratio over time.
The authorities do acknowledge however that the project is not without risks; understand the
staff’s emphasis on the need to maintain tight fiscal discipline, and appreciate the various
scenarios postulated in the debt sustainability paper. The baseline scenario is for little change
in the debt ratio and the debt would remain sustainable. The staff also postulates an active
scenario of a 4 percent of GDP primary surplus. While such a target is probably overly
ambitious, the authorities acknowledge that it provides useful policy guidance.
Financial Sector Issues
The financial sector in SVG remains sound and prudential indicators have generally
strengthened. Asset quality and capital ratios have improved and NPLs declined. The

3
authorities note the staff’s caution on a potential deterioration of credit quality in the recent
period of rapid credit growth but, a priori, there is no reason to expect significant problems.
Supervision has progressively improved. The regulatory powers of the ECCB were
strengthened in 2006 and the authorities are working toward establishment of a Single
Regulatory Unit (SRU) for non-banks. Interestingly, the financial sector turbulence that has
affected much larger and more sophisticated jurisdictions has had no discernable impact on
the Caribbean financial sector to date.
