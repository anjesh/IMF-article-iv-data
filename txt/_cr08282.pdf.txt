Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and Request for Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Robert Sharer and Mark Plant
June 24, 2008

Discussions: A mission comprising Messrs. Akitoby (head), Manoel, Gaertner,
and Koehler (all AFR) held negotiations with the authorities in Addis Ababa
(April 30–May 14, 2008). Mr. Akitoby finalized program discussions in Bujumbura
(May 25–31, 2008). Mr. de la Piedra (Resident Representative) assisted both missions.
Mr. Nintunze (OED) and World Bank and European Union staffs participated in the
discussions. The staff met with President Nkurunziza, First Vice-President Sahinguvu,
Minister of Economy, Finance, and Development Cooperation Nizigama, Central
Bank Governor Sindayigaya, other senior officials, and representatives of labor
unions, the private sector, NGOs, the donor community, and the media.
PRGF arrangement. The authorities are requesting a successor PRGF arrangement
with access of SDR 46.20 million (60 percent of quota), which takes account of the
financial impact of rising world food and oil prices in 2008. The new arrangement will
support implementation of the PRSP, consolidate macroeconomic stability, and further
reduce poverty.
Exchange regime: Burundi maintains, de jure and de facto, a managed float. It has
one multiple currency practice inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 3. Burundi also
maintains certain foreign exchange restrictions for security reasons and has notified
the Fund of those restrictions.
Publication. The authorities consent to the publication of this report, the letter of
intent, and the MEFP.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments. Economic growth decelerated to 3.6 percent in 2007, mainly
because the coffee harvest was poor, and inflation increased, mostly driven by rising food
and energy prices. Higher grants disbursement helped improve the fiscal position and
build international reserves. The economic outlook is generally positive but subject to
risks arising from the security situation and the external environment.
Article IV consultation. The consultation dealt with four main challenges: (i) ensuring
fiscal sustainability; (ii) bringing inflation down to single digits in the medium term;
(iii) building institutional capacity and governance; and (iv) moving toward regional
integration. The authorities generally agreed with staff recommendations:
•

Fiscal issues. To avoid unsustainable debt dynamics, the authorities intend to
maintain a prudent fiscal stance and rely mainly on grants and highly concessional
loans. A major challenge is to improve the composition of spending while
keeping the government wage bill sustainable.

•

Monetary policy and financial sector issues. The authorities intend to conduct a
prudent monetary policy to help anchor inflation expectations. They also intend to
strengthen banking supervision; address weaknesses in the banking system; and
enhance central bank internal controls and risk management systems.

•

Exchange rate policy and external stability. The exchange rate seems in line
with its equilibrium rate, but there are still significant risks to external stability,
notably high debt and rising international food and oil prices.

•

Structural reforms. The authorities’ priorities are to strengthen governance
through effective public financial management systems; ensure food security;
reform the coffee sector; and improve the business environment.

A successor PRGF arrangement. The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF
arrangement to address these challenges and support implementation of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper.
Program risks. As a post-conflict country, risks to the program remain significant.
Primarily, a worsening political, social, and security situation could result in a major
setback. The cease-fire agreement recently signed by the government and the last rebel
group could help manage this risk. Other risks include limited implementation capacity,
governance slippage, and exogenous shocks.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Burundi is one of the least developed countries in the world. GDP per capita is
about US$139, and only 18 percent of the population has food security. 1 HIV/AIDS is
prevalent. While Burundi is making progress toward the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), it is unlikely that any will be achieved by 2015 (Table 1).
2.
Burundi is emerging from more than a decade of civil conflict. The Arusha
Accord of August 2000 initiated a peace process that was concluded with the installation of a
democratically elected government in August 2005. However, the security situation
deteriorated after the last rebel group (FNL) moved to abandon peace negotiations in July
2007. On April 17 and 22, 2008, the FNL attacked the capital, Bujumbura. A cease-fire
agreement was signed on May 26, 2008, leading to a cessation of hostilities.
3.
In a difficult post-conflict environment, Burundi made steady though uneven
progress in the first PRGF arrangement (2004–08). At the conclusion of the sixth and
final review, Executive Directors urged the authorities to strengthen public financial
management (PFM) and move forward with structural reforms to improve the investment
climate and spur growth.
4.
The World Bank is currently drawing up a new country assistance strategy focusing
on structural reforms to further growth and reduce poverty. The Joint World Bank-IMF Work
Program is described in Supplement 1.
5.
The HIPC decision point was reached in August 2005 and the completion point could
be reached by January 2009. Burundi’s PRSP was published in September 2006. The annual
progress report is expected to be finalized in the coming months.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Real sector
6.
Economic growth decelerated and inflation increased in 2006–07 (Table 2 and
Figure 1). After an upturn in 2006, real GDP growth decelerated from 5 percent to
3.6 percent in 2007, mainly because of a poor coffee harvest. By the end of 2007, inflation
had increased to 14.7 percent (year-on-year), from 1 percent in 2005, owing to higher
international commodity prices. In the first four months of 2008, domestic prices of fuel and
basic staples rose on average by 23 percent, pushing the consumer price index up by

According to the World Food Program, 82 percent of households survives on between 1400 and 1900 kilocalories per day, against the World Health Organization’s recommended 2100 kilo-calories required to live a
normal and healthy life.

11.7 percentage points between January and April 2008. Excluding food and oil, the increase
in the consumer price index was about 3.5 percent.
Fiscal policy
7.
The fiscal position improved in 2006–07 (Text Table 1 and Table 3). The overall
fiscal balance (on a commitment basis and after grants) shifted to a surplus of 0.5 percent of
GDP, from a deficit of 6.3 percent in 2005, mainly because grants disbursement increased.
Total revenue in 2007 was held at about the 2006 level, even though the petroleum tax was
reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent. Current spending rose by about 1.5 percent of GDP,
owing to the wage bill, which increased from 8.4 percent in 2005 to 10.8 percent in 2007. 2
Supported by project grants, capital spending rose by 3 percent of GDP in 2006–07.

PFM has been reinforced. The authorities have implemented measures to ensure
fiscal discipline and improve transparency (Box 1).

The wage bill appears to be driven by high levels of government employment; the average public sector wage
is very low (US$2.5 per day).

Box 1. Reforms in Public Financial Management
The legal framework for public finances has been tightened. New procurement and
customs codes have been adopted. Both pieces of legislation will increase transparency
and accountability while making budget execution more efficient. Moreover, the
Council of Ministers has approved a new draft organic budget law and submitted it to
the Parliament.
Debt management capacity has been enhanced. The Ministry of Finance now has
the exclusive right to negotiate and sign external loans. A computerized foreign debt
management system has been installed and can produce monthly debt reports.
Budget and fiscal reporting systems have been revamped, introducing economic,
functional, and administrative classifications. The new system has improved fiscal
monitoring and expenditure tracking. Moreover, a double-entry accounting system is
being introduced gradually with the presentation of closing balances for 2006 and 2007
accounts.
Budget control is better. Specialized departments have been established to improve
control of budget execution, among them (i) an internal inspection and control unit in
the Ministry of Finance; (ii) an Inspectorate General of State department; and (iii) a
general accounting office. The National Audit Office completed the audit of the 2006
accounts in 2007, and an independent audit of the use of HIPC funds in 2005–07 has
just ended.
Treasury functions have been streamlined. The authorities are moving toward a
single treasury account by tightening control over cash flows and minimizing idle cash
balances in ministry bank accounts. They have (i) merged the recurrent budget and
capital budget accounts; (ii) eliminated seven HIPC subaccounts in line ministries; and
(iii) closed 80 ministry accounts. A cash flow plan was set up in late 2007 to improve
cash management.
Customs and tax administration has been reinforced. A new customs code was
promulgated in 2007 to make customs procedures more efficient. Computerization of
customs operations through the roll-out of the ASYCUDA+ + system has helped
reduce clearance times. To improve tax enforcement and combat tax evasion, a reliable
computerized tax identification number system has been introduced.

9
Monetary policy and the financial sector
9.
Reserve money surged in 2007, after a deceleration in 2006 (Table 4). Reserve
money growth accelerated to 17.4 percent, from about 6 percent in 2006, because part of
increased aid was spent on domestic goods. Growth in net credit to government decelerated
to 11.5 percent, against 16.6 percent in 2006, mainly reflecting an improved fiscal position.
The first sales of treasury bills in 2007 shifted the composition of bank credit to the
government toward commercial banks, somewhat crowding out loans to the private sector.
Interest rates have not risen in line with inflation in 2006–07.
10.
The financial sector faces vulnerabilities. Although nonperforming loans as a
percent of total gross loans have been reduced substantially since 2005 as domestic
government arrears are cleared, at the end of 2007 they were still at 18.8 percent. The
minimum bank capital requirement was increased from FBu 1 billion to FBu 2.5 billion as of
January 1, 2008, as recommended by the Fund’s MCM technical assistance (TA) mission.
All banks except one small one appear to be in compliance with capital adequacy
requirements. Three smaller banks in difficulties are being restructured. To help strengthen
central bank financial safeguards, the safeguards assessment was updated in January 2008.
External sector
11.
External developments in 2006–07 were dominated by a decline in exports and a
surge in grants. After growing slowly in 2006, total exports declined by 14.3 percent
because of the poor coffee harvest. Total program and project grants are estimated to have
risen by about 64 percent, to US$163 million, fuelling higher imports. Overall, the current
account (including official transfers) widened to 16 percent. Because the surge in aid was not
fully absorbed, gross international reserves rose to 3.9 months of imports, from 3.3 months in
2006. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 8.6 percent in 2007.
12.
Burundi made progress on trade arrangements. On January 1, 2007, Burundi
became a member of the East African Community (EAC) and signed the protocol for a
customs union. Also, as an EAC member Burundi is moving toward an economic partnership
agreement with the European Union (EU-EPA), with the signing in November 2007 of a plan
for negotiating a full-fledged EPA.

10
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The discussions dealt with four challenges: (i) ensuring fiscal sustainability in the
face of heavy debt; (ii) bringing inflation down to single digits in the medium term;
(iii) building institutional capacity and governance; and (iv) moving toward regional
integration.
Box 2. Main Article IV Consultation Recommendations
Advice

Status

Improve PFM.

While progress has been made (Box 1), more remains
to be done.

Improve the composition of spending.

Social spending has increased. However, the wage bill
remains high. Security spending is also still high,
reflecting the uncertain security situation. All social
initiatives have yet to be fully costed in the budget.

Reform monetary and exchange operations.

Monetary policy has become more market-based in the
context of managed exchange rate regime, but the
central bank needs to make more active use of available
policy instruments. A system of foreign exchange
auction has been created; and negotiable treasury
securities have been introduced.

Maintain prudent debt management.

Debt management has been enhanced, with no recourse
to non-concessional loans

Implement structural reforms to stimulate
private sector.

Progress has been slow, especially in the coffee sector.

A. Economic Outlook
14.
Provided that the security situation improves further, Burundi’s medium-term
economic outlook is generally positive (Text Table 2): (1) GDP growth is expected to
average about 5 percent in the medium term, up from the 3.6 percent average for 2004–07;
(2) inflation would decelerate to about 6 percent by 2011; and (3) gross official reserves
would stabilize at about 3 months of imports (Table 2).
15.
The projected growth pattern, which resembles those observed in other postconflict countries, is predicated on three factors: (1) continued removal of major
economic distortions, especially in the coffee sector, which will boost total factor
productivity; (2) a substantial increase in investment, driven by international aid and largely

11
consisting of infrastructure renovation, which will help relieve major supply bottlenecks; and
(3) further advances in trade liberalization with accession to the EAC, which will help
diversify the economy, stimulate competition, and attract more investment.

16.
There are significant downside risks to this scenario. Besides the risk of further
deterioration in the political and security situation, they include (1) delays in macrocritical
structural reforms that underpin the growth objectives; (2) an uncertain external environment,
with possible further increases in international oil and food prices; and (3) mishandling of
integration into the EAC, which could undermine domestic tax collection. Poor institutional
capacity and further changes in senior government could also endanger policy
implementation.
B. Fiscal Policy and Institutions
17.
Staff and authorities agreed that achieving debt sustainability should anchor
medium-term fiscal policy. Burundi is likely to remain in debt distress even after enhanced
HIPC and MDRI assistance. 3 It will be important, therefore, for Burundi to keep the fiscal

12
stance prudent and rely mainly on grants and highly concessional loans to avoid
unsustainable debt.
18.
Mobilizing adequate domestic revenue is critical, staff stressed, for fiscal
sustainability and increased poverty-reducing expenditure. The authorities stated that
their objective is to raise government revenue to more than 19 percent of GDP by 2011. To
this end, they plan to broaden the revenue base by reducing exemptions and improving
revenue administration. Landmark tax reforms will be the introduction of a value-added tax
(VAT) and adoption of the EAC common external tariff (CET) in July 2009. 4
19.
Staff underscored the importance of improving the composition of spending. At
10.8 percent of GDP in 2007, the government wage bill is below the average of 12.1 percent
for small sub-Saharan African countries. However, to avoid additional fiscal risks, the
authorities need to keep the wage bill sustainable. While recognizing staff concerns, the
authorities pointed out that the need to integrate former belligerent groups often adds to
pressure on the wage bill in postconflict countries. Nonetheless, they agreed to implement
measures to control wages, including natural attrition, a selective hiring freeze, a census of
government employment, and wage moderation 5 (MEFP, ¶ 20). They also pointed out that, if
the peace process takes hold, demobilization and reduced military expenditure will also
create fiscal space for increasing propoor spending without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability.
20.
More effective PFM reforms are necessary to enhance governance and
accountability for the use of public resources. The authorities concurred with staff that
progress in this area is critical to secure continued donor disbursements and reiterated their
commitment to prudent fiscal governance.
21.
Lumpy external budgetary support has undermined the efficiency of both
budget execution and monetary policy. The authorities will continue to impress on donors
the need to provide support throughout the year. 6 The government, with the active support of
the UN Peace Building Commission and the donor community, is enhancing the framework
for coordinating donor aid.

4

The CET will lower average tariffs from 15 percent to 11.7 percent. Very preliminary estimates suggest that
the VAT and the CET would be broadly revenue-neutral.
5

These measures were recommended by the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review (PEMFAR) prepared jointly by the World Bank and the government.

6

The EU has already decided to provide its 2008 budget support in two tranches.

13
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
22.
To help anchor inflation expectations, monetary policy must be prudent. The
objective of monetary policy should be to bring down overall inflation while accommodating
the first-round effects of the food and fuel shock. Staff emphasized the need to use all
available monetary and exchange rate instruments to mop up liquidity.
23.
More proactive management of foreign exchange reserves will also make the
inflation objective more accessible. In collaboration with MCM, the central bank will seek
to heighten bank interest in foreign exchange sales for mopping up liquidity and encourage
banks to propose a fair price, allowing the nominal exchange rate to appreciate as
appropriate. The authorities have requested MCM TA to review the current system of foreign
exchange auctions.
24.
Banking supervision must be tightened. To this end staff urged the authorities to
speed implementation of the action plan drafted by the MCM TA mission in October 2006.
The authorities noted that the rules governing banking supervision are being revamped and
reiterated their commitment to restructuring the banking system. Staff stressed the
importance of dealing with the high rate of nonperforming loans. While acknowledging the
problem, the authorities observed that part of the problem is that during the conflict collateral
assets were destroyed or were difficult to foreclose on. Staff and authorities agreed that the
upcoming joint Bank-Fund FSAP mission should provide valuable guidance for financial
sector reform.
D. External Stability and Exchange Rate Policy
25.
Staff agreed with the authorities that the current exchange rate system is
appropriate. The managed float has served Burundi well, giving it the flexibility it needs to
adjust to exogenous shocks. Nonetheless, the authorities believe that a smooth transition from
the current foreign exchange auction system to an interbank-based market will strengthen the
managed float. Advised to work closely with MCM to ensure a seamless transition, the
authorities agreed to request TA for this purpose.
26.
The exchange rate seems to be in line with its equilibrium rate. 7 The authorities
agreed with the staff analysis and noted that structural factors continue to be an obstacle to
competitiveness (Box 3).

The Article IV Selected Issues Papers will provide further analytical evidence about Burundi’s real and
equilibrium exchange rates.

14
Box 3. Assessing the Real Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
As is typically the case with post-conflict countries, assessment of Burundi’s real exchange rate
(RER) is complicated by such factors as limitations of national accounts and balance of payments data;
structural breaks due to the civil war (1993–2000); and trade and exchange restrictions in place before
2003. Nevertheless, the assessment suggests that the RER appears to be in line with economic
fundamentals and points to nonprice factors as the main constraint to competitiveness.
The RER has been relatively stable since the end of 2002. The nominal exchange rate is in line with
price developments, resulting in a generally stable RER.

Burundi's REER was broadly in line with its estimated equilibrium level at the end of 2007.

A number of initiatives are expected to improve the business environment. In collaboration with the
World Bank, the government undertook an Investment Climate Assessment and will follow up with an
action plan for improving the business climate. A new investment code will soon be adopted that
incorporates international best practices. Burundi’s accession to the EAC is also expected to spur
structural reforms.

E. Structural Reforms and Capacity Building
27.
Slow progress on structural reforms has hampered growth and development.
The authorities insisted that structural reforms have lagged in large measure due to delays in
technical assistance and disbursement of foreign aid. Staff identified relevant domestic
factors, including political instability and frequent changes in key technical positions in the
government. The authorities observed that the country needs to take ownership of the design
of structural reforms. To enhance ownership, they stressed the need for stakeholders to
discuss key reforms and for better communication among government agencies.
28.
Staff and authorities agreed that food security deserves priority. Burundi is
among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are most vulnerable to the effects of the
recent increase in international food and fuel price increases. Structurally it is in food deficit,
and the recent bad rainy season heralded drought soon. Donor funding is therefore needed to
provide targeted social safety nets, school meals, and seeds and fertilizers for smallholders.
To boost agricultural supply, the authorities are working with donors (e.g., the World Bank
and the Food and Agriculture Organization) to expand rural infrastructure, diversify
agricultural production, and improve yields through research and use of small irrigation
systems. The mission met with donors in Bujumbura and stressed that emergency relief is
urgently needed.
29.
Staff underscored the need to boost growth by accelerating reforms in the coffee
sector. New private investment in the sector is emerging since investment in the state
marketing structure was liberalized, but the legacy of public ownership is a drag on further
progress. The authorities explained that, with World Bank cooperation, they plan to establish
a comprehensive strategy for the coffee sector by year-end that they believe will boost
investment and increase coffee farmer incomes.
30.
Burundi needs to step up preparations for regional integration. Though its recent
accession to the EAC opens up opportunities, it must do significant work to derive the
expected benefits. Staff and authorities agreed that it will be critical to set up an
interministerial committee to coordinate government efforts and draw up a plan for
implementing the required reforms. The donors (in particular, the World Bank, DfID, and the
European Union) have started to provide technical and financial assistance to foster regional
integration.
31.
Staff encouraged the authorities to move to automatic price adjustment for
petroleum products to promote economic efficiency. 8 The authorities have started to
adjust domestic fuel prices based on a formula agreed upon with the principal stakeholders.
8

There are no direct subsidies for petroleum products. However, differentiated tax rates on petroleum products
were introduced recently, with lower rates on petroleum products consumed by the poor.

16
They also intend to gradually reinstate the 20 percent petroleum tax rate, taking into account
the social impact of high international oil and food prices. They began the process by
increasing the tax rate from 10 percent to 16 percent on petroleum products consumed
primarily by high-income households. The World Bank will soon launch a study to prepare
the groundwork for reform of the petroleum sector.
32.
Despite substantial TA, institutional capacity is still inadequate. The Fund and
other development partners have provided extensive TA, but implementation of TA
recommendations has been slow. The authorities drew a number of lessons to speed adoption
of TA recommendations (MEFP, ¶9), among them better identification and consideration of
the country’s needs; full participation of the government in TA evaluation; and effective
transfer of knowledge to Burundi’s institutions.
33.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly complicate
surveillance. While some improvements in the fiscal area have been achieved, there are
acute shortcomings in national accounts and balance of payments statistics (Supplement 1)
that introduce uncertainty into estimates and projections. A new statistics law was
promulgated in September 2007 and the texts of regulations approved in December 2007.
With TA from donors (in particular, the Fund and the World Bank), the authorities continue
their efforts to strengthen economic and financial data.
IV. THE SUCCESSOR PRGF ARRANGEMENT: ADDRESSING MEDIUM-TERM
CHALLENGES 2008–11
A. Objectives
34.
The proposed PRGF arrangement will seek to consolidate economic stability and
make further progress in reducing poverty. It will help the authorities implement the PRSP
while supporting their efforts to secure enhanced HIPC and MDRI debt relief.
35.
The proposed PRGF-supported program will thus aim to achieve the following
objectives over three years: (i) bring inflation down to single digits; (ii) preserve fiscal
sustainability while improving the composition of spending; (iii) firm up PFM to make
spending more efficient and enhance governance and accountability; and (iv) strengthen
central bank internal controls.
B. Macroeconomic Policies
36.
The program provides a coherent strategy of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate
policies to address the main macroeconomic challenges of reducing inflation to single digits,
supporting debt sustainability, increasing aid absorption, and crowding in the private sector.

17
Fiscal policy
37.
Fiscal policy will support the use of aid. To allow scaled-up aid to be spent, the
program will focus on the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis and including grants),
which is programmed to decline from 2.5 percent of GDP for 2005–07 to 1.3 percent of GDP
for 2008–11. 9 As scaled-up aid would result in higher domestic spending on PRSP priority
areas, 10 current spending would remain at about the 2007 level (25 percent of GDP)
throughout the three-year program, despite the projected decline in interest payments and the
wage bill. The wage bill projections take into account the need to accommodate hiring in
priority sectors. To avoid spending volatility and reductions in critical spending areas, aid
volatility is accommodated through target adjusters (see TMU).
38.
Acknowledging the need for significant investment in public infrastructure and in
agriculture, the program envisages an increase in capital spending, supported by project
grants. Such spending is expected to crowd in private investment and can potentially enhance
economic growth.
39.
Fiscal policy is also geared toward addressing debt sustainability concerns. The
projected decline in the overall fiscal deficit should reduce government borrowing
requirements. As a result, yearly bank financing is programmed to remain zero or negative,
which would also help crowd in the private sector. A zero ceiling is imposed on new
nonconcessional borrowing and the minimum grant element for defining concessional loans
is increased to 50 percent. These quantitative measures to reduce the risks of debt distress are
complemented by better project prioritization (MEFP, ¶23). Prudent debt management would
also be supported by the exclusive right given to the Ministry of Finance to negotiate and
sign all external loans.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
40.
The overriding objective of the monetary framework is to achieve price stability,
while allowing sufficient scope for improved economic growth. This monetary framework
will be implemented in the context of a managed float regime.
41.
The program envisages to stabilize the gross internal reserves at about 3 months of
imports. Once the target on net international reserves and the objective for gross international
reserves are reached, the central bank should seek to avoid excessive additional reserves
build-up that may undermine the inflation objective.

9

It excludes the windfall related to reaching the HIPC completion point in 2009.

10

The medium-term current spending projections are mostly driven by health, education, food security, and
agriculture expenditures.

18
42.
The program calls for close coordination between monetary and fiscal
authorities to ensure that aid-based expenditures are met with adequate absorption through
sales of foreign exchange. The authorities intend to improve coordination between the cash
flow plans of the central bank and the government. Such improved coordination would
facilitate effective implementation of the program policies.
C. Structural Reforms
43.
In line with the strategic axes of the PRSP, the government’s structural reform agenda
is geared toward promoting sustainable and equitable economic growth and improving
governance.
44.
Improving PFM is at the heart of the structural reform agenda. The program will
aim to stabilize the current PFM system through two initiatives: (i) adoption and gradual
implementation of the new budget organic law; and (ii) establishment of a single treasury
account to help refine cash management.
45.
In close collaboration with its development partners, the government is determined to
pursue a number of structural reforms: promotion of transparency and good governance,
financial sector reform, regional integration, coffee sector reform, and petroleum sector
reform (MEFP, Section D).
D. Key Elements of the 2008 Program
46.
Consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic framework, the program for
2008 aims to (1) accelerate economic growth to 4.5 percent; (2) bring inflation down to
14 percent; and (3) stabilize gross international reserves at about 3 months of imports, given
the higher import bill for food and oil. Real GDP growth should benefit from higher coffee
production and more construction activities. Inflation would remain high because of world
food and oil prices.
47.
While mitigating the impact of higher food and oil prices on the poor, the 2008
program will move decisively to rein in inflation:
•

Money growth would be restricted: Broad money growth in 2008 (about
14½ percent) is programmed to rise much slower than nominal GDP growth (about
24 percent). Staff envisages reserve money growth in 2008 to be about 9 percent.

•

The fiscal deficit will be lower: The overall fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis
and after grants) is programmed at about 0.5 percent of GDP—compared with a

19
deficit of 0.7 percent in the initial budget—despite the direct impact of higher food
and fuel prices of about 1.5 percent of GDP. 11
•

Bank credit to the government would be zero, against 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007.

•

Wage policy would be restrictive. The wage bill relative to GDP will be held to the
2007 level (10.8 percent of GDP). Despite continued demands for wage increases in
light of soaring food and oil prices, the government recognized that it would not be
prudent to increase public sector wages beyond the level envisaged in the initial
budget law (including retroactive payment of allowances).

48.
The program accommodates additional spending of about 0.7 percent of GDP to
boost agricultural production and alleviate the impact of higher food prices on the most
vulnerable groups. Another US$9 million (about 0.8 percent of GDP) could be spent on
social safety nets if additional budget support becomes available. The authorities are seeking
additional external grants for that purpose.
49.
The revenue target of the initial budget (about 19 percent) will be maintained. It
will be supported by tax increases on soft drinks and reinstatement of the petroleum tax from
10 to 16 percent on certain petroleum products. Other revenue measures include more
vigorous tax arrears collection; elimination of exemptions from indirect taxes; and collection
of taxes on the earnings of local personnel of international agencies.
E. Program Monitoring and Access
50.
Semiannual quantitative performance criteria focus on net foreign assets and net
domestic assets of the central bank and net domestic financing of the government, with
adjusters to deal with aid volatility. There are three continuous performance criteria, with a
zero ceiling on (i) new nonconcessional debt contracted or guaranteed; (ii) short-term
external debt; and (iii) nonaccumulation of external arrears. Indicative targets have been
established for the government wage bill and net accumulation of domestic arrears (MEFP,
Table 3).
51.
The indicative target on the wage bill would protect nonwage priority spending. To
tackle the root causes of wage-related fiscal problems, the program also envisages structural
conditionality on the census of the civil service and on payroll management. Staff will assess
implementation of these measures during program reviews and remove the wage-bill ceiling
if appropriate.

11

This estimate is based on the cost of fuel and food provided by the government through the budget to
secondary boarding schools, university, prisons, and security forces.

20
52.
The proposed structural conditionality—including prior actions—is linked to the first
strategic axis of the PRSP, namely strengthening economic governance (especially
transparent management of government finance). Governance issues will be addressed
through conditionality on PFM and central bank internal controls. Table 2 of the MEFP
shows prior actions—which are all completed— and Table 4 describes structural
conditionality. Structural conditionality for the medium term will draw on the measures
specified in the MEFP.
53.
The authorities are requesting program access of 60 percent of quota. 12 Staff
supports this request, given the impact of soaring food and energy prices on the balance of
payments, the strength of the program proposed, and Burundi’s capacity to repay the Fund.
Disbursements would be distributed evenly over the three-year arrangement. The impact of
higher food and oil prices on the balance of payments is about - 4.3 percent of GDP
(US$50 million, or approximately twice the annual access). So far, the AfDB has provided
additional support of US$5.9 million to deal with this shock. In support of the authorities’
efforts, external nonproject financial assistance will reach about US$105 million (see details
in MEFP, Table 3).
F. Program Risks and Mitigation
54.
The authorities up to the highest level have reiterated their staunch commitment to the
program and to good governance, but Burundi faces significant political and economic risks.
In particular, a worsening political, social, and security situation would be a major
setback. The recent cease-fire agreement between the government and the last rebel group,
FNL, laid the foundation for peace. The current difficult economic environment, with soaring
food and oil prices, could intensify generalized wage demands and strikes. To mitigate these,
staff discussed the program with a large number of stakeholders, including representatives of
local civil society organizations, the private sector, and labor unions.
55.
Inadequate institutional capacity constrains the authorities’ ability to implement
reforms. The authorities are working closely with bilateral and development partners to
build administrative capacity.
56.
Any further governance incidents may lead to disruptions in donor budget
support. The program is therefore emphasizing careful management of public finances and
firmer internal controls at the central bank.
57.
Exogenous shocks could also endanger achievement of program objectives.
Among them are: (i) higher than programmed international food and oil prices; (ii) the

12

The norm for third-time users of PRGF resources is 55 percent of quota.

21
likelihood of drought; and (iii) faster than expected return of an estimated 120,000 Burundian
refugees, mainly from Tanzania, over the next 30 months.
V. MOVING TOWARD THE HIPC COMPLETION POINT
58.
Burundi is expected to reach the HIPC completion point by January 2009, given
delays in drawing up a strategy for reforming the coffee sector and demobilizing. The current
PRGF arrangement will allow the authorities to meet the completion point requirement of six
months of good performance in a PRGF-supported program.
59.
The World Bank is reassessing the structural HIPC completion point trigger on
the coffee sector (“tendering for sale the holdings in a majority of coffee washing stations”).
The government has asked that this trigger be redefined to allow them to put in place a
comprehensive strategy through a participatory process. The government also noted that the
insistence on privatizing coffee washing stations, without an institutional set up for
privatization, would not serve the sector well. With World Bank advice, the government
plans to establish a strategy for the coffee sector by year-end.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
60.
In a difficult post-conflict environment, Burundi has made steady, though
uneven, progress. Most monetary and fiscal reforms have progressed well. However,
structural reform has generally been slow, because of both limited institutional capacity and
resistance from vested interests.
61.
Burundi’s medium-term economic outlook is positive as long as the security
situation continues to improve. Near-term growth is projected to rise, supported by a good
coffee harvest, though inflation would remain high, driven by soaring world food and energy
prices. Economic growth in the medium term would be markedly higher, propelled by
improved economic conditions, a revival of private investment, and increased donor
assistance.
62.
Given the debt burden, the budget should be financed only by grants and highly
concessional external financing. Improvements in governance will be critical for donor
support. To achieve this, the authorities should further strengthen PFM and manage public
expectations of a peace dividend, especially for public employees.
63.
The recent acceleration of inflation is very worrisome. The monetary authorities
should act with determination to contain second-round effects and anchor inflation
expectations. Allowing the exchange rate to appreciate with higher aid inflows would also
help rein in inflation.

22
64.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue their efforts to build the financial
sector by improving banking supervision; addressing weaknesses in the banking system; and
enhancing central bank internal controls and risk management systems.
65.
The managed float exchange rate has served Burundi well. The exchange rate
seems to be in line with its equilibrium rate, but external stability could be undermined by
high debt and rising food and oil prices.
66.
The priority given to food security is welcome. Burundi is unlikely to become selfsufficient in food production soon, so a concerted emergency response strategy is needed to
ensure that the poor do not suffer from the expected drought as food and oil prices soar.
67.
Sustained growth depends on accelerating structural reforms, especially in the
coffee sector, and further improving governance. Staff urges the authorities to expedite
adoption of the new investment code. EAC membership should also spur structural reforms
that would improve the business environment.
68.
Burundi maintains one multiple currency practice inconsistent with Article VIII,
Section 3. The authorities have not sought, and staff does not recommend, approval.
69.
The data provided to the Fund are generally inadequate for effective
surveillance, especially national accounts and balance of payments data. Priority should
be given to improving national accounts statistics, where the weaknesses are extensive.
70.
Staff recommends approval of Burundi’s request for a three-year PRGF
arrangement. Risks to the program are manageable: The risks of limited institutional
capacity, exogenous shocks, and governance slippages can be mitigated by sound policies
and reforms, in coordination with Burundi’s development partners.
71.
The authorities’ intention to make public the staff report, the letter of intent,
and the MEFP is welcome. Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with
Burundi be held on the 24-month consultation cycle in accordance with Decision No. 12794(02/76) of July 2002, as amended by Decision No. 12854-(02/96) of September 12, 2002 and
Decision No. 13562-(05/85), October 5, 2005.

Table 10. Burundi: Progress Toward HIPC Completion Point Triggers
Trigger

Progress

1. PRSP: Preparation of a full PRSP through a
participatory process and its satisfactory
implementation for one year, as evidenced by an
Annual Progress Report that has been the subject of
analysis in a Joint Staff Advisory Note.

A full PRSP drafted in a participatory process was published in
September 2006 and discussed by the IMF and World Bank
Boards in March 2007. The annual progress report is being
prepared by the monitoring PRSP permanent secretariat and a
first draft will be available in mid-2008.

2. Macroeconomic stability: Maintenance of
macroeconomic stability as evidenced by satisfactory
performance under the PRGF-supported program.

Macroeconomic developments in the past two years have been
broadly in line with the program, which has remained on track
except briefly in mid-2007. The sixth and last review of the
PRGF was concluded on January 22, 2008.

3. Use of budget savings resulting from HIPCrelated debt-service relief during the interim
period: Use of budgetary savings from debt relief in
accordance with the priorities identified at the
decision point and in the PRSP duly documented
and discussed by a national Independent Oversight
Committee on a semiannual basis.

Budgetary allocations for priority spending targeting pro poor
activities and projects have increased markedly. Since 2006
more than 70 percent of HIPC resources are being allocated to
social sectors (education, health). The HIPC Independent
Oversight Committee was reactivated in mid-2007 and now
meets regularly. A draft report of the recent audit of spending
undertaken was shared for comments from donors in FebruaryMarch 2008 and a revision circulated in May 2008. The final
report will be finalized in July 2008.

4. Public expenditure management: Establishment
of an integrated public expenditure computerized
system that provides a budget monitoring and control
system, in particular for poverty-related spending,
and the production of at least two quarterly budget
execution reports based on the new unified budget
nomenclature.

An integrated computerized expenditure management system
(SIGEFI) was put in place in January 2006 using the new budget
nomenclature. Quarterly budget execution reports have been
produced since mid-2006. The government is working to
improve the SIGEFI system and the coverage and reliability of
the reports.

5. Governance measures and the delivery of
services in key sectors: Completion for the
education, health, and justice sectors of (i) a budget
tracking exercise (budget monitoring) of public
spending on the delivery of pro-poor services; (ii) an
evaluation by users of the quality of services
provided; (iii) an evaluation by providers of
constraints to effective delivery of pro-poor services;
and (iv) preparation of an action plan to address
problems identified.

The surveys were completed by December 2007 and the
preliminary analyses by end-February 2008. An action plan is
being prepared and will be available in July 2008.

6. Demobilization: Execution of the National DDR
Program in line with the pace and final objectives set
forth in the Letter of Demobilization Policy to the
World Bank, dated 19 February, 2004.

The demobilization program made progress in 2004–05 but has
experienced delays since then. By November 2007 24,105
persons had been demobilized. The objective, after integrating
all forces, is to reduce the army to 25,000 men. However, about
17,300 persons were absorbed into a new national police force
instead of being demobilized. Plans are being finalized for a new
round of demobilization in 2008 (FNL excluded), covering about
3,500 from the army (FDN) and 4,500 from the national police.
This would reduce the FDN to about 25,000 and the police to
about 15,000. Following the May mission by the Bank DDR
team, the Bank is evaluating the request of the authorities to
modify the completion criteria of this trigger in light of the slow
implementation of the DDR program, exacerbated by the April
2008 security situation.

34

Progress

7. Structural measures: Tendering for sale the state
holdings in a majority of coffee washing stations.

In November 2006 the government approved a detailed action
plan for reform of the coffee sector, elaborated with the support
of the World Bank. The action plan included: (1) a study of the
competitiveness of the sector (done in 2007); (2) identification
and implementation of a strategy for the sale of main assets; and
(3) drafting of a liberalized legal, regulatory, and institutional
framework for the sector. Actions (2) and (3) were delayed but
are being reprogrammed. The authorities have recently
requested that this trigger be redefined. The Bank and the Fund
agreed. The Bank is finalizing a proposal to redefine this trigger
in coordination with the authorities and the Fund.

8. Social sectors
Education: Increase in the gross national enrollment
rate in primary schools from 74 percent in 2003/04 to
77 percent in 2006; and from 16 percent in 2003/04
to 18 percent in 2006 in secondary schools, subject
to the provision that the average increase in
provinces with lower than average enrollment rates
in 2004 must be higher than the increase in the
national rate over the same time period.

The elimination of primary school fees in September 2005
resulted in a large increase in first grade enrollment. Primary
school enrollment rose from an estimated 80 percent in 2003–04
to 85 percent in 2004–05, about 101 percent in 2005–06, and
118 percent in 2006–07. The enrollment in secondary school
has reached 19 percent in 2006–07. Preliminary analysis of
regional enrollment rates (administrative) data provided by the
government indicates an improvement.

Health: Increase in the national immunization rate for
children of less than one year of age from 75 percent
in 2004 to 85 percent in 2006, subject to the
provision that the average increase in provinces with
lower-than-average immunization rates in 2004 must
be higher than the increase in the national rate over
the same time period.

In June 2006 the Burundian Ministry of Health organized a
national campaign for vaccination against measles with the
support of UNICEF and WHO. At end-October 2007 preliminary
data suggest BCG coverage at 71 percent; polio 3 at 74 percent;
DPT3 equivalent at 69 percent; and measles at 30 percent. Data
for 2006 are poor and not yet available for regional rates.
According to the government, preliminary analysis of regional
immunization rates (administrative) data indicates an
improvement.

9. Debt management: Production of monthly
external debt reports, including projections for the
upcoming three months, for at least six months
before the completion point.

All the reports through February 2008 were provided. Reports
still have reliability and coverage problems.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
Bujumbura, June 24, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
We are pleased to send you the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), on which we agreed
within the framework of the new program concluded between Burundi and the International
Monetary Fund under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
2.
The government of Burundi successfully implemented a PRGF-supported program
from 2004 to 2007. During that period, considerable progress was made toward achieving
stabilization, economic reforms, and poverty reduction.
3.
In the political area, the government of Burundi continues to consolidate the peace
process by pursuing implementation of the agreements signed between Burundi and all the
belligerent parties.
4.
To take up the major challenges facing the country, the government of Burundi
hereby requests assistance from the IMF under a three-year PRGF arrangement, in amount of
SDR 46.20 million, equal to 60 percent of Burundi’s quota, for implementation of the
government’s program of macroeconomic reforms covering the period April 1, 2008, to
March 31, 2011. Such assistance from the IMF will also open the way for Burundi to move
toward the HIPC Initiative completion point, which we expect to reach by January 2009.
5.
The attached MEFP indicates the objectives and policies that the government of
Burundi plans to adopt within the framework of a medium-term program (covering
April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2011) so as to pursue the process of macroeconomic
stabilization, reduce poverty, promote the structural reforms, and strengthen governance. The
TMU, which is also attached, specifies the procedures to be followed for the monitoring of
program implementation and the information required for such monitoring, as well as the
quantitative and structural criteria and benchmarks for implementation of the program.
6.
The government believes that the policies described in the MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of the program and undertakes to adopt any further measures that may
prove necessary for that purpose. During the period of implementation of the three-year
arrangement, the authorities of Burundi will consult with the Managing Director of the IMF,
either at their own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such
consultation, on the adoption of any additional measures that may be appropriate.

36
7.
The government of Burundi will provide the IMF with such information as it may
request in connection with monitoring the progress made in economic and financial policy
implementation. Moreover, Burundi will carry out reviews with the IMF every six months.
We expect the first such review with IMF staff to be completed by January 2009, and the
second review to be completed by July 2009.
8.
The Burundi authorities wish to make this letter available to the public, along with the
attached MEFP and TMU as well as the IMF staff report on the request for a further PRGF
arrangement. We therefore authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website
subsequent to Executive Board approval. These documents will also be posted on the official
websites of the Burundi government.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum draws on the lessons of the previous Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, reviews the medium-term macroeconomic framework,
and presents the economic and financial policy that will be conducted in the context of the
government’s program covering the period from April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2011. The
measures and objectives of the program are consistent with the Poverty Reduction and
Strategy Paper (PRSP) published in September 2006 and with the findings of the preliminary
report that will be available in late May 2008.
2.
Macroeconomic developments remained broadly in line with the program through
end-2007, even though inflation was higher than expected. Growth slowed to 3.6 percent
in 2007, as anticipated, because the coffee harvest was deficient, mainly as a result of natural
cyclical changes that were exacerbated by a lack of investment in the sector. The adjustment
of administered prices late in 2007, the recent hikes in food prices, and the disorganization in
the supply of imports attributable to Kenya’s post-election problems compounded the
increase in consumer prices, which reached 14.7 percent, year-on-year, at end-2007,
compared with a single-digit inflation target. The average inflation rate at end-December
2007 was 8.3 percent.
3.
Despite lengthy delays in the disbursement of budgetary assistance by donors, fiscal
management in 2007 was generally satisfactory. The bulk of the assistance from donors and
lenders was disbursed at year-end as a result of the delay, caused by governance issues, in
completing the sixth review of the PRGF arrangement. Bridging finance provided by the
central bank (BRB) in the fourth quarter of 2007, combined with strict budgetary discipline
and efficient government cash flow management, prevented fiscal deterioration.
4.
Burundi’s external position remained consistent with the program objectives in 2007.
Although exports declined because of the poor coffee harvest and imports climbed—mainly
attributable to the increased demand for intermediate and capital goods—, inflows of foreign
assistance helped maintain the external balance in the expected range.
II. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS PRGF ARRANGEMENT AND
CHALLENGES TO BE MET
A. Lessons Learned From the Previous PRGF Arrangement
5.
In a difficult post-conflict environment, the implementation of the previous PRGF
arrangement (2004–08) was generally satisfactory. Good progress was achieved in most of

38
the monetary and budgetary reforms launched under that arrangement, and the government
was therefore able to implement policies that kept the economy relatively stable. Burundi
also abolished certain trade and foreign exchange restrictions and joined the East African
Community (EAC).
6.
The government took action to consolidate macroeconomic stability by improving
economic management, even though inflation has recently worsened. The package of
prudent, flexible measures adopted by the authorities over the past three years enabled
Burundi to make great progress toward macroeconomic stability.
7.
Budgetary support from development partners played a key role in favor of the
government’s objectives, but the nonstaggering of disbursements created severe cash flow
management problems. These problems were exacerbated in 2006 and 2007 by program
implementation difficulties that led to a delay in the disbursement of budgetary support. The
government will do everything possible to prevent economic policy and governance
slippages likely to delay the disbursement of budgetary support by donors, while at the same
time negotiating with the latter about the possibility of staggering their assistance more
broadly over the entire year.
8.
Structural reforms were implemented more slowly than expected over the past three
years. Therefore, Burundi could not benefit fully from the reforms with respect to growth and
development. Important lessons are to be learned in this regard. First, the inadequacy of the
country’s institutional capacity—which needs to be strengthened—and the resistance of
special-interest groups (in particular in the coffee sector) to some of the proposed measures
contributed to the delay in implementing reforms. Second, the delay in implementing
structural reforms can be explained partly by the delay in the provision of technical
assistance and in the disbursement of external support from donors and lenders. Third, the
country needs to assume ownership of the design of the structural reforms, which should be
tailored to the political, social, and institutional circumstances of the country. The authorities
are aware that Burundi needs to show more resolve about having these reforms implemented
successfully.
9.
Burundi has received considerable technical assistance, but its institutional capacity
needs to be built up. The donors, particularly the IMF, have provided it with intensive
technical assistance in numerous areas over the past few years. That support has played a key
role in a post-conflict situation where Burundi very much needs to strengthen its institutional
capacity. The country also draws a number of lessons for improving technical assistance.
First, it is important to match the supply of technical assistance to the real needs of the
country. It is, therefore, necessary to identify technical assistance needs correctly and to
establish an action plan for capacity building in each sector. That will also help Burundi to
take ownership of the technical assistance it receives and to coordinate it better. Second, for
greater effectiveness, the government should participate fully in the evaluation of the

39
assistance it receives. Third, technical assistance should lead to a transfer of know-how, so as
to reduce in the medium term dependence on foreign technical assistance. Hence, emphasis
needs to be placed on training and the integration of local capacity.
B. Challenges to be Met
10.
Burundi is facing major political, social, and economic challenges. In the political
area, it has to consolidate the peace process and stability. To eradicate definitively the
consequences of a conflict that lasted for about 15 years and to lay a sound groundwork for
sustainable, harmonious development, the government has created frameworks for dialogue
and cooperation involving all sociopolitical partners. This approach enabled the country to
return to a serene environment conducive to the restoration of confidence among political
stakeholders, in particular through the establishment of a government of national unity in
November 2007. This step forward in the political area was somewhat disrupted by the
reappearance of a few cases of insecurity following the sudden withdrawal of the
PALIPEHUTU-FNL from the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (MCVS).
11.
Since April 2008, however, the Regional Initiative and the Political Directorate,
whose main task was to strengthen mediation between the government and the one remaining
rebel movement, PALIPEHUTU-FNL, have succeeded in persuading the latter to resume and
continue honoring the cease-fire agreement. The government is convinced that as the process
of definitive cessation of hostilities has begun, security can be restored throughout the
country, and economic activity and measures to reduce poverty can now be effectively
resumed.
12.
With regard to economic and social matters, the objective is to achieve strong,
sustainable growth with a view to reducing poverty and making progress toward achieving
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Burundi is one of the least developed countries
in the world, and poverty remains widespread. The incidence of HIV/AIDS is high, and the
social infrastructure is embryonic. The government will have to make every effort to
•

Ensure budget sustainability so as to reduce the heavy debt burden;

•

Return to single-digit inflation. Considerable progress has been made with regard to
macroeconomic stabilization, but much remains to be done to control inflation,
especially in an international context characterized by high food and oil prices;

•

Build institutional capacity and improve governance. Structural reforms remain key
to increasing growth and reducing poverty. Institutional capacity building and
improved governance will be essential in this regard; and

•

Make progress in moving toward regional integration. Membership in the EAC will
open up to Burundi the benefits of a larger economic market. However, much remains

40
to be done for the country to develop an overall strategy, implement essential
institutional reforms, and negotiate with the EAC Secretariat on procedures for
complying with the conditions set by the Community. For this purpose, technical and
financial assistance from donors is indispensable and urgent.
•

Improve infrastructure to promote productive investment. A top priority should be
given to food production to first ensure food security and then export any food
surplus. The government will seek financial resources from donors to build
infrastructure for greater access to water, in particular extension of the irrigation
system in the plain of Imbo.
III. POLICY FRAMEWORK AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
A. Objectives of the New PRGF-supported Program

13.
The purpose of the new PRGF arrangement will be to consolidate macroeconomic
stability, further reduce the heavy debt burden, and help the government of Burundi pursue
implementation of the PRSP. It will also support the government’s efforts to obtain debt
relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
14.

The objectives of the new three-year PRGF-supported program will therefore be to

•

Return to single-digit inflation. An independent central bank with price stability as its
principal mission will be essential for this purpose. Better budget and monetary
policy coordination will also be essential, especially during this period of increasing
inflationary pressures;

•

Improve the composition of public spending to the benefit of the priority sectors,
while preserving budget sustainability. To that end, the wage bill must be controlled.
The authorities will also have to avoid contracting loans on nonconcessional terms,
the requirement under the new PRGF arrangement being conformity with the
concessionality threshold of a grant component of at least 50 percent;

•

Strengthen public financial management (PFM). No further major PFM initiatives are
envisaged under the new arrangement, as the commitments undertaken within the
framework of the previous PRGF arrangement still have to be fully implemented. The
program will therefore seek to stabilize the existing PFM system, with particular
attention to two ongoing initiatives: (1) the passing and gradual implementation of the
new organic budget law; and (2) consolidation of a single Treasury account and an
effective cash flow management plan; and

•

Strengthen the internal control systems of the central bank. Emphasis will be placed
on parliamentary passing of the draft central bank law, as recommended by the IMF,

41
and on implementation of a number of financial safeguard measures identified by the
recently completed safeguards report as necessary for strengthening internal controls
and risk management systems.
15.
Provided that the public security situation continues to improve, the macroeconomic
objectives are as follows for the period of the PRGF-supported program: (1) GDP
growth should average 5 percent over the medium term, up from the average of 3.6 percent in
2004–07; (2) inflation would slow to about 6 percent in 2011; and (3) gross official reserves
would stabilize at about 3 months of imports.
16.
The projected growth rates are similar to those observed in other post-conflict
countries and are based on three major factors: (1) continued elimination of large economic
distortions, especially in agriculture, which will stimulate total factor productivity; (2) a
substantial increase in investment, supported largely by international assistance and geared
primarily toward renewal of the country’s infrastructure, which will help ease the supply
bottlenecks; and (3) further progress in trade liberalization and integration, which will help
diversify the economy, stimulate competition, and finally increase investment.
B. Budget Policy
17.
Budget sustainability will be the essential anchor for medium-term fiscal
consolidation. It will therefore be important to maintain prudent budget policy, especially
using grants and highly concessional loans in order to avoid unsustainable external and
domestic debt dynamics. At the same time, the government will continue to mobilize
domestic resources with the objective of gradually increasing revenue to about 19.2 percent
of GDP by 2011, based on reform of revenue administration and of tax policy.
18.
Budget policy will be supported by the rigorous establishment of monthly cash flow
plans. In this context, all budget spending will be dependent on the prior authorization of the
Minister of Finance and executed strictly on the basis of revenue availability. Firm
instructions will have to be given to commercial banks to deposit receipts taken on behalf of
the government to the Treasury’s account at the central bank within 48–72 hours, or face
penalties. A monthly budget allocation for each ministry should be defined as of June 2008,
with strict expenditure prioritization. To protect priority spending, the government will in
advance identify nonpriority expenditures that will be cut in the event of a decline in revenue
or financing.
19.
A key budget policy objective is to improve the composition of expenditure to the
benefit of the social sectors and economic growth. At 10.8 percent of GDP in 2007, the
government wage bill is below the average of 12.1 percent for small sub-Saharan African
countries. This high level of the overall wage bill is strongly influenced by the share of wage
bills for the priority sectors—education, health, agriculture, and justice—which is about
50 percent. Given the importance of these sectors for poverty reduction, further cuts in the

42
wages of workers in these sectors would be inadvisable. Currently, the average monthly per
capita wage in the civil service is less than US$75. Considering the decline in wages in real
terms over the past few years, the government will seek agreement with social partners for a
gradual return to appropriate wage levels that would be sustainable in the budgetary context.
The government will make every effort to avoid unbudgeted wage increases such as those
that recently disrupted the conduct of budget policy.
20.
To control wages, the government will draw on the findings of the Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR—prepared jointly by the
World Bank and the government of Burundi) to take the following measures: (1) freeze
recruitment of civil servants, except in the sectors of health, education, agriculture, and
justice; (2) establish a coherent wage increase framework that takes account of the budgetary
resources of the government; (3) only partially replace retirees with new wage earners;
(4) centralize recruitment by strengthening the powers of the recruitment commission;
(5) complete the census of all government civil employees (end-September 2008 structural
performance criterion); and (6) start the census of the police and army (end-October 2008
structural benchmark) and complete it. The census will: (1) facilitate payroll
computerization, (2) eliminate fictional employees; and (3) improve wage bill management.
In addition, the Ministry of Finance should assume responsibility for payroll management for
government employees by taking charge of the payroll database by end-March 2009 (endMarch 2009 structural performance criterion). Strict enforcement of these measures,
combined with sustained economic growth, is expected to help reduce the ratio of wages to
GDP to well below 10 percent toward the end of the program.
21.
Spiraling food and oil prices have derailed the 2008 budget forecasts. The immediate
annual fiscal impact of these two shocks is estimated at about 1.5 percent of GDP. The
current bad rainy season heralded a drought in the near feature that will negatively affect
food security. The government is also expecting the return of a large number of Burundian
refugees, following the cease-fire agreement and the cessation of hostilities.
22.
To facilitate adjustment to these shocks and mitigate their impact on the poor, the
government is seeking budgetary support over and above the funds initially budgeted.
Identified emergency spending on targeted social safety nets of US$9 million (about 0.8 of
GDP) could be executed quickly if additional budget support becomes available. The monies
will be used to establish social safety nets and assistance targeting the most vulnerable
segments of the population and farmers. Donor funding is also needed to provide school
meals in the most vulnerable areas, and seeds and fertilizers to smallholders. To boost
agricultural supply, the authorities will work with donors (e.g., World Bank and FAO) to
expand rural infrastructure, diversify agricultural production, and improve yields through
research programs and irrigation systems.

43
23.
To improve expenditure forecasting, the government will implement one of the
PEMFAR recommendations on assessing the budgetary impact of providing free health care
for children under 5 years old and for women during childbirth and free schooling at the
primary level. Technical assistance should be considered for this assessment. The
government will also review capital expenditure to ensure that priority projects with
a positive impact on poverty reduction and growth are indeed covered in the budget. In the
program context, capital expenditure should be based on the list of identified priority
projects.
24.
Well-designed demobilization and reinsertion policies are essential to achieving the
objective of increased pro-poor spending. Taking into account recent security developments
and the experiences of other countries, the demobilization policy should be implemented
flexibly to ensure that demobilization helps improve security for the people of Burundi
(especially the poor and the most vulnerable). The government will continue to cooperate
closely with the World Bank and other donors and lenders to ensure that this policy is
implemented efficiently and in a manner conducive to the effective social reinsertion of
former combatants and the improvement of security conditions. With a return to peace, the
reduction in military and security spending will leave a little more room for budget
flexibility, as needed to increase poverty reduction expenditure without endangering budget
sustainability.
C. Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policy
25.
The government plans to pursue prudent monetary policy, which is necessary to
anchor inflationary expectations, in light of the international context marked by soaring food
and oil prices worldwide. Until the objective of a single-digit inflation rate is attained, the
central bank will set the broad money growth rate below the nominal GDP growth rate. Such
prudent monetary policy will help prevent the second-round price effect of higher commodity
prices and other supply shocks.
26.
The central bank reforms aimed at strengthening its independence should help it to
focus on its primary mission of ensuring price stability. Burundi is not yet ready to
implement a formal inflation-targeting policy, but the central bank can benefit from the
announcement of an inflation target and use existing monetary and foreign exchange
instruments effectively to absorb domestic and foreign currency liquidity. A proper mix of
foreign exchange sales and liquidity sterilization could help achieve the inflation target while
preserving external competitiveness and preventing the crowding out of private sector
investment. The central bank will carry out a study to define the most appropriate
instruments to be used to achieve its inflation target in the current international context. It
will propose this as a topic for discussion by the financial sector study mission planned for
the second half of 2008.

44
27.
Proactive management of foreign exchange reserves and the sterilization of foreign
exchange operations will continue within a managed floating exchange rate regime, with
a view to achieving the inflation target. The central bank should also seek to smooth the
monetary impact of the bunching of external financing disbursements while allowing the
exchange rate to appreciate if the net foreign assets target is attainable. Given the worldwide
rise in food and oil prices, the central bank recognizes that an appreciation of the exchange
rate could help it to contain inflation. In collaboration with IMF experts, the central bank will
decide as soon as possible about the means to heighten the banks’ interest in foreign
exchange auctions and encourage them to propose fair prices within the framework of the
new foreign exchange regulations and the current system of foreign exchange auctions.
D. Structural Reforms
28.
Lessons learned from the previous PRGF arrangement should inform the design of
the structural component of the new PRGF arrangement. First, it is necessary to be very
selective and to streamline structural reforms, given the weakness of institutional capacity.
Second, the strengthening of fiscal management and of internal controls at the central bank
will contribute significantly to the improvement of governance.
29.
In close collaboration with its development partners, the government is determined to
pursue a number of structural reforms: promotion of transparency and good governance,
financial sector reform, regional integration; coffee sector reform, and oil sector reform.
Promotion of transparency and of good governance
Fiscal management
30.
During the previous PRGF arrangement, the government implemented important
measures that considerably improved fiscal management (Table 1). The government is aware
that much remains to be done and is determined to improve fiscal management further. On
the basis of various technical assistance reports (including the PEMFAR), the government
will implement a strategy and an action plan of fiscal management reforms. The principal
measures envisaged hinge upon gradual implementation of the new budget organic law,
consolidation of the single Treasury account, and proper functioning of the government cash
flow plan. As a prior action, the government will submit the draft budget organic law to the
National Assembly. Actions taken in the area of fiscal management will be guided by a vast
repository of recommendations for technical assistance actions already received by Burundi
and will be centered on consolidation of the current fiscal management system. The sending
of a resident fiscal management expert to Burundi, financed by donors and lenders and
supervised by the IMF, will help make further progress in this area.

45
Tax policy
31.
The landmark tax reform under the new PRGF arrangement will be the introduction
of the VAT and adoption of the EAC’s common external tariff (CET) on July 1, 2009. In this
regard, the government will accelerate implementation of the action plan agreed with the
IMF, the World Bank, and other donors and lenders. The study on the impact of this tax
reform has been completed, and the VAT law will be finalized soon, after account has been
taken of the IMF’s comments. Tax department computerization, which is a prerequisite to the
introduction of VAT, will be completed in early 2009.
Revenue administration
32.
To generate more domestic resources for allocation to poverty reduction expenditure,
the government will continue to reform the customs and tax administrations. In the customs
administration, the following measures have been adopted: (1) revision of the customs code
to include all the standards of the revised Kyoto Protocol; (2) strengthening of the
coordination between customs and taxes, through the sharing of taxpayer data;
(3) establishment of a computer link with those filing returns; (4) introduction of
a mechanism for ex ante control; and (5) customs department computerization.
33.
At the tax administration level, two major initiatives have been taken to broaden the
tax base: a census of all taxpayers, including those in the informal sector; and tax collection
on the remuneration of the local personnel of international agencies.
34.
The creation in January 2009 of the Revenue Office is a major reform that will help
improve government revenue in the medium term. Drawing on the experience of other
countries in the subregion, this office will reduce corruption and improve incentives for tax
and customs officers. To this end, the government is requesting technical and financial
assistance from its development partners.
The promotion of governance
35.
The government is aware that the improvement of governance is essential to attract
private investment and support from donors and lenders. The above-mentioned fiscal
management and central bank reforms will be defining in that regard. In addition, it is crucial
to resolve pending matters of embezzlement of public funds to restore public policy
credibility with donors and lenders and with investors. The legal and regulatory economic
environment will be improved by the adoption of the new investment code, which is in line
with international practices. The government has requested the World Bank Institute to
conduct a survey on corruption in Burundi that will help it formulate an anticorruption
strategy.

46
36.
The government has made progress toward resolving the governance issues related to
Interpetrol. The government has directly initiated legal proceedings to recover the amounts
alleged to have been improperly paid. FBu 6 billion has been taken as security. Similarly, the
deeds for 25 properties belonging to Interpetrol have been placed under seal. The authorities
are committed to pursuing legal proceedings in this affair. FBu 6 billion taken as security and
the deeds for 25 properties belonging to Interpetrol placed under seal, as required under the
Burundi law, will remain in place in compliance with such law until a court makes a ruling
on the interpetrol legal proceedings (continuous performance criterion). The government has
also speeded up the strengthening of fiscal management and initiated an independent external
audit of the cross-debts of the oil sector and the government. This audit was conducted with
World Bank support. The audit findings reveal that the oil sector owes the Burundi
government US$38 million (3.8 percent of GDP), with Interpetrol accounting for
US$30 million (3.0 percent of GDP) of that sum. The findings in the audit report will be
published in June 2008 (prior action), and the government will arrange for the proposal of
repayment agreements with all the companies involved. Following the audit report on the use
of HIPC-related funds, the government will soon prepare an action plan to address the
weaknesses identified.
The financial sector
37.
The main objectives of the central bank reform will be to strengthen the bank’s
independence and improve its governance. The government is working with Parliament
toward passage of a new law establishing the Central Bank Charter that will give force to
these objectives. Also, the central bank has started implementing measures to strengthen its
system of internal controls and risk management, following the recommendations of the
recently completed safeguards report. Last, to strengthen the financial sector the central bank
will continue, as needed, to take measures to restructure certain banks and develop further the
money and foreign exchange markets. Steps will also be taken to implement the technical
assistance recommendations on banking supervision.
Regional and commercial integration
38.
Progress in the area of commercial integration is key for achieving medium-term
growth objectives, and Burundi stands to benefit considerably from joining the EAC. The
challenge is, however, to guide the policies being implemented by Burundi while taking
account of its commitments to the EAC and especially of their impact on government
revenue. In this context, an interministerial committee will be formed to coordinate the
government’s efforts and ease the decision-making process. It will also be responsible for
updating the national strategy and facilitating the decision-making process to enable Burundi
to achieve the expected gains while keeping transition costs to a minimum. The government
is pleased to note that its development partners, in particular the World Bank and the

47
European Union, are willing to provide financial and technical assistance to Burundi to foster
its regional integration.
Coffee sector reform
39.
The reforms of the coffee sector are of great macroeconomic importance. This sector
is the principal source of income for nearly 800,000 Burundi households, and coffee accounts
for about half of all the country’s exports. The government plans to establish a strategy for
the coffee sector by end-2008, in collaboration with the World Bank.
Oil sector reform
40.
It is essential for the Burundi market to have adequate supplies of oil products and for
an automatic mechanism to be put in place for setting oil prices, given their significant
budgetary, macroeconomic, and social impact. To avoid frequent breaks in supply and
sudden upsurges in oil product prices on the domestic market, the government has now
started to apply price adjustments based on a formula agreed upon with the principal
stakeholders. As a prerequisite to this policy, however, a sound social safety net must be in
place by the time the automatic price adjustment mechanism is introduced. The World Bank
is willing to finance a study in this regard. The final report on that study will be discussed by
the government, its development partners, and all other players in the oil sector.
E. External Financing
41.
The government will ensure that all its external obligations are settled when due. The
Minister of Finance has begun to draw up monthly public debt position reports that give
a detailed survey of obligations falling due. These reports, which will continue to be
published each month (a completion point trigger under the HIPC Initiative), will thus be
a factor for strengthening Burundi’s debt management.
42.
Burundi will seek only concessional external financing. The government will not
contract nonconcessional foreign debt and will ensure that all loans contracted comprise
a grant element of at least 50 percent. The government will make further efforts to obtain
debt relief as soon as possible under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI, and will pursue
negotiations with its non-Paris Club bilateral creditors to obtain debt relief from them on
terms similar to those granted by Paris Club bilateral creditors.
43.
A high-level ad hoc committee chaired by the second Vice-President meets regularly
to review progress made toward the various triggers and to propose appropriate measures for
reaching them. At this time, most HIPC completion point triggers have been met, and the
government is taking steps to ensure that the remaining ones are activated as soon as
possible. In close collaboration with the World Bank and the IMF, the government is already
working on redefining the coffee sector and demobilization triggers.

48

F. Improving Economic Statistics
44.
Burundi’s statistical system needs to be strengthened considerably if it is to become
a reliable development tool. The government is drafting a national statistics development
strategy that is expected to become effective in 2009. Burundi has joined the GDDS, and an
action plan will be adopted in concert with the IMF Statistics Department for production of
the necessary metadata. Good coordination of these initiatives with the World Bank-financed
PAGE project’s efforts will be crucial. A new national accounts framework is under study,
and the comprehensive series of data for the new reference year, 2005, is already available.
Work continues on improving the consumer price index—especially extending its coverage
to include the provinces—and will be completed by end-2008.
G. Technical Assistance and Coordination of Development Partners
45.
Burundi has vast technical assistance needs. The authorities plan to remain in close
collaboration with bilateral and multilateral partners to build up the administrative capacity
of the country’s institutions. The maintenance of IMF technical assistance, in particular
through the AFRITAC, remains key in the areas of tax policy and administration, public
expenditure management, monetary and foreign exchange policy, banking supervision, and
economic statistics.
46.
It is essential to coordinate relations with the development partners (DPs),
considering that they finance a major portion of budget expenditure. The government has
intensified its efforts to set up an institutional framework for the coordination of assistance,
in the form of the National Assistance Coordination Committee (CNCA). This initiative is
supported financially by the DPs. The CNCA can help:
•

Organize the work between the government and the DPs at the sectoral level, relying
on a market leader for each sector among the DPs. A major priority should be the
creation of sectoral groups, as described in the CNCA organizational chart.

•

Centralize the coordination of assistance within a single agency, which would
facilitate coordination and decision making by the government.

•

Monitor assistance disbursement and project implementation, in close collaboration
with the Minister of Finance, to ensure that all assistance from DPs is included in the
budget.
H. Program Monitoring

47.
The government will implement the measures shown in Table 2 before the IMF
Executive Board examines Burundi’s request for a three-year PRGF arrangement.

49
48.
Program implementation during the first year of the PRGF arrangement will be
monitored on the basis of semiannual reviews; quantitative performance criteria (endSeptember 2008 and end-March 2009); indicative targets (end-June and end-December
2008), as shown in Table 3; and structural performance criteria and benchmarks, as shown in
Table 4. The information to be reported to the IMF and the definitions of the pertinent
variables can be found in the attached TMU. Program implementation, achievement of the
related objectives, and compliance with the performance criteria will be the subject of two
half-yearly reviews. The authorities also stand ready to adopt, in consultation with IMF staff,
any further financial or structural measures that may prove necessary for the success of the
program.
49.
To strengthen program monitoring, the government is seeking to reactivate the
interministerial committee, which will be assisted by the Economic and Social Reforms
Permanent Secretariat (S/P-REFES).

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding covers the agreements on monitoring
implementation of the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement. It sets out the definitions of program variables to monitor
implementation of the program and the reporting requirements for the Government of
Burundi and the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB). It defines quantitative performance
criteria, indicative targets, and applicable adjusters.
A. Quantitative Program Targets
Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
2.

The quantitative performance criteria under the program as shown in Table 3 of the
MEFP are as follows:

•

net foreign assets of the BRB (floor);

•

net domestic assets of the BRB (ceiling);

•

net domestic financing of the government (ceiling);

•

external payments arrears of the government (ceiling; continuous);

•

stock of short-term external debt (maturity of less than one year) of the government
and the BRB (ceiling; continuous); and

•

new nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government or the BRB (ceiling; continuous).

The quarterly targets on the above variables for June and December 2008 are indicative.
3.
The quantitative indicative targets under the program, shown in Tables 3 of the
MEFP, are as follows:
•

the Government’s wage bill (ceiling).

•

net accumulation of domestic arrears (ceiling).

Definitions and measurement
4.
The net foreign assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) gross
official reserves (valued at market prices) and other claims; and (ii) foreign exchange
liabilities to nonresident entities (including the use of Fund resources, but excluding the

56
counterpart of SDR allocations). The gross official reserves of the BRB are defined as those
foreign assets that are liquid and freely available to the central bank.
5.
The net domestic assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) reserve
money, comprising currency in circulation, reserves of commercial banks, and other deposits
held at the BRB, and (ii) net foreign assets of the BRB.
Adjuster for changes in the compulsory reserves coefficients
6.
The ceiling on net domestic assets of the BRB will be adjusted symmetrically for any
change in the compulsory reserves coefficient applied to deposits in the commercial banks,
by the amount of the new coefficient minus that stipulated in the program, multiplied by bank
deposits subject to compulsory reserves. The rate stipulated in the program is currently
3 percent.
7.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the change in
(i) outstanding loans, advances, and other credit to the government from the BRB and all of
Burundi’s commercial banks; (ii) the stock of all government securities held by the non-bank
public denominated in Burundi francs, including that held by nonresidents; (iii) less
government deposits held in the BRB or in Burundi’s commercial banks. The coverage of
government is defined as central government and any other special funds or operations that
are part of the budgetary process or have a direct impact on the government’s financial
position.
8.
The stock of external payments arrears for program monitoring purposes is defined
as the end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid, including contractual
and late interest, for which a clearance agreement is not in place or for which arrears are not
reschedulable. Arrears for which a clearance framework has been agreed with the creditor or
which are subject to rescheduling or restructuring are not considered arrears for program
monitoring purposes. Program arrears would include any debt service due under such
agreements that have not been paid.
9.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debts contracted
or guaranteed by the government and the BRB. This performance criterion applies to the
contracting or guaranteeing by the central government, local governments, or the BRB of
new nonconcessional external debt (as specified below) with an original maturity of one year
or more, including commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received. The term “debt” shall be understood as defined in the Executive Board Decision
No. 12274-(00/85) adopted August 24, 2000. Debt rescheduling and restructuring are
excluded from the criterion. Included are financial leases and other instruments giving rise to
external liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on nonconcessional terms. In determining the
level of concessionality of these obligations, the definition of concessional borrowing shall
apply. Concessional debt is defined as having a grant element of 50 percent or more.
Management fees would also be taken into account when determining a loan’s grant element.

57
For loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the 10-year average commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD should be used as the discount rate for
assessing the level of concessionality, while the 6-month average CIRRs should be used for
loans with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and the 6-month average CIRRs, the
following margins should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years;
1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or
more. The performance criterion is defined to exclude the use of Fund resources and any
Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents.
10.
The stock of short-term external debt with a maturity of less than one year, owed
by the central government is to remain at zero under the program. Normal import credits are
excluded from this ceiling. Loans with an initial maturity, as recorded in the original loan
agreement, of one year or more are considered medium-term or long-term loans. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt, as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received (including
leasing). Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, borrowing
from the Fund, and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents.
As of end-September 2007, the stock of short-term debt outstanding was nil.
11.
The government's wage bill is defined as total labor remunerations on a
commitments basis for civil servants, contractual employees, police, and military personnel
of the government, including all allowances and bonuses.
12.
The net accumulation of domestic arrears is measured by the accumulation of nonexecuted payment orders older than 60 days.
External financial assistance adjustor
13.
The program provides for adjusters to allow higher than expected external assistance
to be spent (with a cap) and shortfall of external assistance to be financed domestically (with
a cap).
14.
Any financing excess up to US$60 million will be spent on expenditure priorities
defined in the PRSP. The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the central bank will be
adjusted upward, and the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the central bank and on the net
domestic financing to the government will be adjusted downward to accommodate
100 percent of any financing excess above US$60 million.
15.
The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the central bank will be adjusted
downward, and the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the central bank and on the net
domestic financing to the government will be adjusted upward to accommodate a financing
shortfall up a maximum of US$60 million. External financial assistance will be converted to
Burundi francs using the program-specified FBu/US$ exchange rate.

58
16.
External financial assistance (measured in US$) is defined to include the following:
(i) nonproject loans and grants to the budget (including payments made through the multidonor trust fund managed by the World Bank for current debt service to multilaterals);
(ii) debt relief on current maturities; minus (iii) any cash payments for external arrears
clearance operations. Donor disbursements into blocked accounts for the purpose of clearing
arrears will not be included as foreign assistance for program monitoring purposes.
B. Provision of Information to IMF Staff
17.
To facilitate the monitoring of program implementation, the authorities will prepare
and forward to the IMF African Department a monthly progress report on the program,
within six weeks of the end of each month, containing:
18.

The following weekly data:

•

foreign exchange auction market (MED) transactions;

•

the balance sheet of the BRB (weekly statement) (BRB Research Department).

19.

The following monthly data, with a maximum lag of six weeks:

•

a monitoring table (tableau de bord) containing the most recent weekly and monthly
data on the main financial indicators (REFES);

•

a table on the foreign exchange cash flow (BRB Foreign Banking Operations
Department);

•

the monetary survey, including the breakdown of the central bank and of commercial
banks (BRB Research Department);

•

monthly exchange-rate data (official and parallel markets, end-of-month and monthly
average) (BRB Research Department);

•

a detailed breakdown of government revenue (Ministry of Finance);

•

a detailed breakdown of government expenditure on a commitment basis, including
pro-poor spending (Ministry of Finance);

•

a detailed breakdown of the servicing of domestic and external public debt, including
amounts due and paid, in interest and principal, as well as the breakdown by creditor
and any accumulation of arrears on domestic or external debt (Ministry of Finance);

•

a detailed breakdown of the stock of domestic payments arrears for the current fiscal
year (Ministry of Finance);

•

the amount of new debts contracted or guaranteed by the government, including
detailed information on the terms (such as currency denomination, interest rate, grace
period, maturity) (Ministry of Finance);

59
•

actual disbursements of non-project financial assistance, including new loans and
debt relief granted by Burundi's external creditors (Ministry of Finance); and

•

an update on the implementation of structural measures planned under the program
(REFES).

20.

The following quarterly data, with a maximum lag of six weeks:
•

Progress reports on the BRB’s internal reforms, including each unit’s action plans for
the coming month (Reform Monitoring Committee, BRB).

21.
SP/REFES/Ministry of Finance and BRB will also provide the African Department of
the IMF with any information that is deemed necessary to ensure effective monitoring of the
program.

VII. Safeguards Assessments
In conjunction with the upcoming Board discussion of a successor PRGF arrangement
scheduled on July 7, 2008, an update assessment of the Banque de la République du Burundi
(BRB) was completed. A few safeguards areas have been strengthened since the previous
2006 assessment, external audits have been completed on a more timely basis, and audited
financial statements are fully published. However, the 2008 assessment identified several
areas of the safeguards controls that required prompt strengthening, including the areas of
governance and signatory authority over disbursements and transfers. Priority measures are
being introduced as part of program conditionality to address these vulnerabilities.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements
Burundi maintains a managed float exchange regime. The U.S. dollar is the intervention
currency. On June 18, 2008, the exchange rate was Fbu 1,186.75 to the US$. In 2003, the
central bank eliminated most remaining exchange restrictions on current international
transactions and delegated authority to the commercial banks to approve standard
transactions. In early 2004, the surrender requirement was lowered to 50 percent and
eliminated in early 2005. The central bank admitted foreign exchange bureaus to the weekly
auctions. Most external payments arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors were cleared
by end-2005. In December 2006, the government published a new foreign exchange
regulation, which liberalized foreign exchange for current transactions and removed one
multiple currency practice.
Burundi availed itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV when it joined the Fund
in 1962, but no longer maintains exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices under
Article XIV. Burundi maintains one multiple currency practice inconsistent with Article VIII,
Section 2(a): the exchange rate used for government transactions takes place at a rate that
may differ by more than 2 percent from market exchange rates. Burundi maintains certain
foreign exchange restrictions for security reasons, and has notified those restrictions to the
Fund pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51). The authorities have not requested, and staff does not
propose, approval of the multiple currency practice.
IX. Article IV Consultation
In accordance with decision No 12794-(02/76), as amended by Decision No 12854-(02/96),
Burundi is on the 24-month Article IV cycle. The 2006 Article IV consultation was
completed by the Executive Board on July 14, 2006 (Country Report 06/311), along with the
consideration of the third and fourth reviews under the PRGF arrangement.
In concluding the 2006 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed the
commendable progress that Burundi made in 2005 in implementing its PRGF-supported
program in a difficult post-conflict environment. They welcomed the progress made on the
enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point triggers but emphasized the need for the
authorities to pay particular attention to reinforcing government’s capacity to deliver social
services. They noted the need to reinforce good governance and transparency practices,
including public financial management and through the progressive withdrawal of state
intervention in the economy.

III. RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of January 31, 2008)
Burundi has been a member of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group since its
foundation in 1964. The AfDB’s grant and loan operations with the country were interrupted
by the outbreak of civil strife in 1993. On July 19, 2004, the AfDB Boards approved general
policy guidelines to assist post-conflict countries to clear their arrears and created a facility,
the PCCF, initially funded with about SDR 100 million in AfDB funds, to provide financial
assistance to qualifying post-conflict countries. The policy guidelines call for a three-way
burden-sharing formula among the country, donors, and the PCCF. On October 27, 2004, the
AfDB Boards endorsed a specific arrears clearance proposal for Burundi whereby the
balance of arrears was settled with the help of donors and the PCCF before the Decision
Point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
On November 24, 2005, the Boards of Directors of the AfDB and the African Development
Fund (ADF) agreed that Burundi had effectively met the conditions and reached the decision
point under the enhanced framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative. The Bank Group’s share of debt relief will amount to US$149.35 million in present
value terms (US$226.01 million in nominal terms), which is equivalent to about 21 percent
of the multilateral creditors’ assistance, and about 18 percent of total assistance from all
creditors. This amount will save up to 90 percent of Burundi’s debt-service obligations
annually until February 2043.
Under its FAD 9 allocation, following the lifting of sanctions in October 2004, on July 7,
2004, the Bank Group approved a grant of SDR 2.13 million to finance training of civil
servants and procurement of equipment for institutions in charge of economic management
and the civil society. A structural adjustment credit totally SDR 6.72 million, in one tranche,
accompanied by a further grant of SDR 1.5 million for institutional support, was approved by
the Board on December 2004. A multi-sector project, totaling SDR 9.8 million, was also
approved on December 2004. Under its FAD 10 allocation, the Bank Group approved in
December 2005 a grant of SDR 12 million to finance rural water infrastructure rehabilitation
and, in March 2006, a SDR 9 million to finance the watershed management project.
In November 2006, the Bank Group approved one more grant: SDR 7.3 million, in one
tranche, to finance economic reforms and governance support program.

IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The most
acute shortcomings affect the national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics. STA missions have found that staffing shortages, insufficient funding,
and lack of equipment hamper the production and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics.
There has been poor coordination among institutions responsible for the compilation of
statistics.
Following the authorities’ interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), in March 2006, a mission assisted the authorities in preparing metadata and, in
collaboration with the World Bank and donors, helped develop a remedial plan. The
authorities referred to this action plan in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which was
approved in September 2007 and a national statistical development strategy is being prepared
with donor’s assistance. On September 25, 2007, the government promulgated a new
statistics law, and in December 2007 the accompanying regulatory texts were approved.
Burundi is expected to become a GDDS participant in 2008, once the authorities complete
reviewing the metadata.
Outstanding statistical issues
Real sector
Serious deficiencies in real sector data handicap analysis and macroeconomic management,
with national accounts compiled infrequently. Source data on agriculture, the most important
activity, is extremely weak. Since 1998, Burundi has reported annual national accounts
estimates to the Fund with about a three-month lag, but these are derived from a
macroeconomic projection model maintained by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and
Development Cooperation (MEFD). Recently, the Statistical Office has developed, with
AFRISTAT’s help, a set of provisional national accounts for 2005, the new base year. This is
a major effort for the Institute, given that the last national account data were from 1998.
The CPI is compiled on a monthly basis. Its coverage has been extended to include provinces
and not only the capital, Bujumbura. Weights are based on an outdated 1991 household
expenditure survey, and are expected to be revised in 2008. There are no producer price
indices, and data on employment are out of date.
Government finance
The central bank compiles government finance statistics using source data from the MEFD.
Until recently, computerized ledgers were seldom maintained by ministries, preventing the

9

establishment of balances and other accounting controls. Limited accounting information was
available on extra-budgetary units. There were also problems in recording arrears on external
debt and current expenditure financed by foreign grants, leading to significant discrepancies
between the balance of revenue and expenditure and financing estimates. With World Bank
and FAD assistance, improved public financial management information systems that
generate, among other things, standard quarterly budget execution reports were implemented
in 2005 and are now largely operational. These improvements have been translated into
better and faster compilation of government finance statistics. STA has provided training in
government finance statistics to compilers both at the Joint Africa Institute and INS.
However, its coverage and quality need to be improved. Summary government finance
statistics transactions data through July 2007 have been reported in the International Finance
Statistics. No annual GFS data have been reported to STA for dissemination since 1999.
Monetary statistics
A November 22–December 4, 2007 STA technical assistance mission helped the Banque de
la République du Burundi (BRB) improve its monetary and financial statistics. As a result,
monetary statistics compiled by the BRB largely follow the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual methodology, which should facilitate the harmonization of its monetary
statistics with other member countries of the East African Community. The BRB fully
completed the migration to the Standardized Report Forms for the submission of its monetary
statistics to the Fund. Burundi’s monetary statistics have been published in the June 2008
issue of the IFS Monetary and Financial Statistics Supplement. With the support of the 2007
mission, the BRB compiled a new and enlarged broad money aggregate (M3), that is planned
to replace M2, which does not include deposits in foreign currencies.
Balance of payments
Annual balance of payments and international investment position statistics are compiled
according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Merchandise trade
statistics are derived from customs data, but no adjustments are made for unrecorded
international trade flows such as gifts in kind that do not go through the banking system.
Data for services are collected mostly through bank settlement reports. Income estimates are
almost exclusively derived from monthly bank settlement reports. For both services and
income, the accuracy of the source data is not routinely assessed against other available data
sources. Data on current and capital transfers, as well as on financial accounts are incomplete
and further BRB action is needed to improve their quality and reliability. Balance of
payments and international investment position data are published in International Financial
Statistics and in the Balance of Payments Yearbook through 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Burundi
On July 7, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Burundi. 1
Background
Burundi is emerging slowly from more than a decade of civil conflict. GDP per capita is
about US$139 and only 18 percent of the population is food secure. 2 While some
progress has been made toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it will
remain a significant challenge to achieve any of the targets by 2015.
Economic growth slowed down, while inflation increased in 2007. Real GDP growth
decelerated to 3.6 percent, from about 5 percent in 2006, mainly because of a poor
coffee harvest. About 80 percent of the population rely on agriculture for income and
employment. By the end of 2007, inflation had increased to 14.7 percent (year-on-year),
from 9.3 percent in 2006, owing to higher international commodity prices. In the first four
months of 2008, domestic prices of fuel and basic staples rose on average by
23 percent, pushing the consumer price index up by 11.7 percentage points over the
period from January to April 2008. Excluding food and oil, the increase in the consumer
price index was about 3.5 percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

According to the World Food Program, 82 percent of households survives on between
1,400 and 1,900 kilo-calories per day, against the World Health Organization’s
recommended 2,100 kilo-calories required to live a normal and healthy life.

2
The overall fiscal balance (on a commitment basis and after grants) turned to a surplus
of 1 percent of GDP from a deficit of 1.8 percent in 2006. While total revenue and
expenditure changed marginally, grants disbursements increased markedly. Broad
money growth decelerated to 10.1 percent in 2007, against 16.4 percent in 2006, partly
reflecting an improved fiscal position.
External developments were dominated by a decline in exports and a sharp rise in
grants. Total exports (in US dollar terms) declined because of a poor coffee harvest.
Total grants are estimated to have risen by about 64 percent to US$163 million, fuelling
higher imports. Overall, the current account deficit (including current official transfers)
widened to 16 percent from 14.5 percent in 2006. As the funds stemming from the surge
in aid were not fully absorbed, gross international reserves rose to 3.9 months of imports
from 3.3 months in 2006. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 8.6 percent
during 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for the progress they have made in implementing Burundi’s first PRGFsupported program in a difficult post-conflict environment. While structural reforms have
been slow, most monetary and fiscal reforms have progressed well. Directors were
encouraged by the cease-fire agreement recently signed, and noted that, with continued
improvements in the security situation, Burundi’s medium-term economic outlook is
positive. They stressed that effective donor coordination and predictable disbursement
of financial support, as well as timely technical assistance, will be important to support
these efforts.
Directors agreed that solid policy implementation will be key to meeting Burundi’s
principal economic challenges over the medium term. Ensuring fiscal sustainability in the
face of a heavy debt burden will depend on broadening the revenue base and improving
the composition of spending, while financing the budget through grants and highly
concessional external resources. Improvements in governance, including through
strengthened public financial management, will be critical for sustaining donor support. It
will be important to carefully manage public expectations of a peace dividend and to fully
cost all social initiatives in the budget. With support from the international community,
the government should give high priority to enhancing its capacity to deliver social
services.
Against the background of the recent acceleration of inflation deriving from rising
international food and oil prices, Directors encouraged the monetary authorities to act to
anchor inflation expectations and contain second-round effects of food and oil price
shocks. They also stressed the need to use available monetary and exchange rate
instruments to mop up liquidity. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their
efforts to strengthen the financial sector by improving banking supervision, addressing

3
weaknesses in the banking system, and enhancing central bank internal controls and
risk management systems.
Directors agreed that the managed-float exchange rate regime has served Burundi well,
and helped to cushion exogenous shocks. They noted staff’s assessment that the
exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium rate.
Directors stressed that structural factors continue to be an obstacle to Burundi’s
competitiveness and growth. They saw the need to accelerate structural reforms,
especially in the coffee sector, and expedite adoption of the new investment code.
Directors also welcomed Burundi’s membership in the East African Community, which
should spur structural reforms to improve the business environment.
Directors welcomed the priority the authorities are giving to food security. A concerted
emergency response strategy is needed to ensure that the poor do not suffer from the
expected drought as food and oil prices soar.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the statistical system. High priority
should be given to national accounts statistics, where the weaknesses are extensive.
Directors noted that the recent promulgation of a new statistics law would help build up
statistical institutions and processes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Approves US$75.6 Million PRGF Arrangement for Burundi
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
SDR 46.2 million (about US$75.6 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) for Burundi, to support the implementation of the country’s poverty
reduction program and its efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability. It takes into
account the financial impact of rising world food and oil prices in 2008.
The Executive Board’s approval enables Burundi to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 6.6
million (about US$10.8 million) under the PRGF arrangement.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“The Burundian authorities are to be commended for the progress they have made in
implementing Burundi’s first PRGF-supported program in a difficult post-conflict
environment. Though structural reforms have been slow, most monetary and fiscal reforms
have progressed well. However, despite the progress made, poverty remains widespread, and
the challenges for Burundi in meeting the MDGs continue to be significant.
“The new three-year PRGF-supported program, anchored in Burundi’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, is designed to reduce inflation to single digits; ensure fiscal sustainability in
the face of heavy debt; improve the composition of spending; strengthen public financial
management and enhance governance; and accelerate structural reforms to stimulate growth
and reduce poverty.
“The authorities’ fiscal program for 2008 targets a substantial increase in capital spending,
while accommodating additional spending to boost agricultural output and help alleviate the
impact of increasing food and fuel prices on the poor.
“The success of the authorities’ PRGF-supported program will depend, in part, on strong and
coordinated assistance from the international community. Accelerating structural reforms,
most notably on governance issues, will also be critical,” Mr. Portugal said.

2
The approved PRGF arrangement for Burundi succeeds an arrangement that expired earlier
this year. The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans
carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year
grace period on principal payments.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Economic growth decelerated in 2007, while inflation increased, mostly driven by rising food
and energy prices. Higher grants disbursement from international donors contributed to an
improved fiscal position and helped build international reserves.
After an upturn in 2006, real GDP growth decelerated from 5 percent to 3.6 percent in 2007,
mainly because of a poor coffee harvest. End-period inflation increased to 14.7 percent, from
9.3 percent in 2006, owing to higher international commodity prices and exchange rate
depreciation. In the first four months of 2008, domestic prices of fuel and basic staples rose
on average by 23 percent, pushing the overall inflation rate to 11.7 percent during the same
period. Excluding food and oil, the inflation rate would be about 3.5 percent.
The overall fiscal position improved in 2007. The overall fiscal balance (on a commitment
basis and after grants) shifted to a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP from a deficit of 1.8 percent
in 2006. Social spending was estimated to have increased from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to
9.2 percent in 2007. The authorities have implemented a number of measures with a view to
ensuring fiscal discipline and improving transparency in public finances.
Program Summary
The purpose of the new PRGF arrangement will be to consolidate macroeconomic stability,
further reduce the heavy debt burden, and help the government of Burundi pursue
implementation of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. It will also support the
government’s efforts to obtain debt relief under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
The main objectives of the new three-year PRGF program will therefore be to:
•

Return to single-digit inflation. An independent central bank with price stability as its
principal mission will be essential for this purpose. Better budget and monetary
policy coordination will also be essential, especially during this period of increasing
inflationary pressures.

•

Improve the composition of public spending to the benefit of the priority sectors,
while preserving fiscal sustainability. To that end, the wage bill will have to be
controlled. It will also be important to rely mainly on grants and highly concessional
loans to avoid unsustainable debt.

•

Strengthen public financial management (PFM). The program will seek to stabilize
the existing PFM system, with particular attention to two ongoing initiatives: (1) the
passing and gradual implementation of the new budget organic law; and (2)
consolidation of a single Treasury account and an effective cash flow management
plan; and

4
•

Strengthen the internal control systems of the central bank. Emphasis will be placed
on parliamentary passing of the draft central bank law and on the implementation of a
number of financial safeguard measures to strengthen internal controls and risk
management systems.

Provided that the public security situation continues to improve, the macroeconomic
objectives are as follows for the period of the PRGF program: (1) GDP growth should
average 5 percent over the medium term, up from the average of 3.6 percent in 2004–07; and
(2) inflation would slow to about 6 percent by 2011.
The projected growth pattern, which resembles those observed in other post-conflict
countries, is predicated on three factors: (1) continued removal of major economic
distortions, especially in the coffee sector, which will boost total factor productivity; (2) a
substantial increase in investment, driven by international aid and largely consisting of
infrastructure renovation, which will help relieve major supply bottlenecks; and (3) further
advances in trade liberalization with accession to the East African Community, which will
help diversify the economy, stimulate competition, and attract more investment.

Statement by Peter J. Gakunu, Executive Director for Burundi
and Dieudonne Nintunze, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 7, 2008
Introduction
1.
Against the backdrop of a difficult post-conflict environment, the Burundian
authorities have remained committed to prudent macroeconomic policies and their ambitious
structural reform agenda, which have resulted in commendable performance over the last five
years. The authorities sustained their efforts towards economic recovery and achieved
macroeconomic stability and robust growth. Some progress was made in employment
creation and poverty reduction, but the proportion of people living in absolute poverty is still
high, while the economy remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
2.
The authorities are determined to strengthen the implementation of priority programs
articulated in the PRSP, with a view to consolidating their positive economic achievements,
accelerating growth and making substantial progress in reaching the MDGs. They are in
broad agreement with the thrust of the staff appraisal in the well balanced reports, and they
request Executive Directors’ support for a new three-year PRGF arrangement.
Recent economic developments
3.
Burundi implemented a wide range of reforms under the first PRGF-supported
program, which contributed to stabilize the economy and relaunch growth. The reform
package included strengthening of public finance management, enhancing the monetary
policy instruments, liberalizing the trade and exchange regimes, and improving efficiency in
the productive sectors. This resulted in good economic performance, despite a very complex
environment dominated by a fragile political and security situation and exogenous shocks
including drought. Consequently, economic growth was commendable, although it was
volatile due mainly to the impact of bad weather and the associated shortfalls in hydropower
energy generation and coffee production.
4.
The authorities succeeded in maintaining single digit inflation in 2006 and 2007, but
inflationary pressures resurged in the second half of 2007 because of increases in oil and
food prices. Headline inflation during January - April 2008 reached 11.7 percent, while the
core inflation was 3.5 percent. Although the external position worsened with a terms of trade
deterioration of 20.3 percent in 2007, the authorities met their official foreign reserves
objectives which increased from the equivalent of 3.6 months of import cover in 2006 to 3.9
months in 2007. Burundi currency remained stable, and the real effective exchange rate
(REER) is estimated to have depreciated by 8.6 percent in 2007.
5.
The authorities remained strongly committed to fiscal discipline and macroeconomic
stability, resulting in a significant improvement in the fiscal position in 2006-07. The primary
fiscal deficit was lower than programmed, as revenue performance remained robust, while

2
the non-priority primary expenditure level was reduced by about 3.5 percent and 2.6 percent
of GDP in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The authorities have commendably increased
poverty-reducing spending from only 6.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 8.7 percent in
2006 and 9.2 percent in 2007. However, it should be noted that the budget execution suffered
from development expenditure cuts due to lower than programmed donors disbursements;
and this impacted negatively on the implementation of the authorities’ investment programs.
6.
The Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) pursued prudent monetary policy in
support of its low inflation objectives. In this regard, the BRB implemented a medium term
action plan aimed at strengthening the central bank’s internal operations, and modernizing
monetary policy instruments to make them more market based. This included strong progress
in strengthening liquidity management, including the introduction of foreign exchange
auctions, as well as negotiable treasury securities. Accordingly, the BRB met most of the
monetary performance criteria and indicative targets. The medium-term lending rates applied
by commercial banks increased slightly by about 1 percentage point to an average of 19.2
percent in 2007, reflecting an increase in the central bank’s average refinancing rate from 13
to 14 percent. The BRB has continued to strengthen banking sector supervision, including
progressive increases in minimum capital requirements, and to monitor the implementation
of restructuring plans of non-complying and weak banks.
Outlook and policies for 2008 and in the medium term
7.
The 2008 and medium term economic prospects are positive, with real GDP growth
projected at 4.5 percent in 2008 and to average 5 percent annually over the medium term.
The strong growth prospects are expected to benefit from the deepening of structural reforms
as security conditions are improving; the elimination of distortions in productive sectors; an
increase in investment to upgrade growth-enhancing infrastructure, which would reduce the
cost of doing business and improve productivity; as well as progress in regional integration
and liberalization of investment and trade, which would stimulate diversification of the
economy and enhance competition. Inflation is projected to be reduced gradually to single
digit levels in the medium term, largely due to prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The
fiscal and external positions are expected to continue improving following the overall
economic recovery prospects.
8.
The authorities are aware that this positive outlook is subject to downside risks and
challenges. The per capita income is still very low, the poverty incidence is high and
widespread, HIV/AIDS prevalence is also high, and the quality of infrastructure and social
services is still low. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to consolidate the peace
process; sustain macroeconomic stability and high economic growth; and substantially
reduce poverty. This would be realized through a resolute implementation of their PRSP,
which offers an appropriate framework for the diversification of the sources of growth and
exports, integration in the regional and global economy, capacity building, and improvements
in public finance management.

3
Fiscal policy
9.
On the fiscal front, the authorities are aware that the main challenge is to ensure fiscal
and debt sustainability in the medium term. To this end, domestic revenue would be
maintained at a relatively high level of about 19 percent of GDP, benefiting from the ongoing
reforms of the tax system with the support of technical assistance from the IMF and donors.
These reforms aim at further strengthening tax administration, broadening the tax base, and
making the tax system more equitable and efficient. Also, preparations for the introduction of
the VAT are advancing.
10.
The budget execution would be based on sound cash management, and the audit of
expenditure, monitoring and reporting practices will be reinforced. In this regard, the
authorities have made progress towards the adoption of a Single Treasury Account system,
and are strengthening implementation of the public finance management and accountability
reforms (PFM) with the support of the World Bank and the IMF. The authorities will also
continue to extend the Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) to
line ministries. A physical census of all public employees is being carried out and the results
would assist in strengthening wage bill management and informing further reforms of the
public service.
11.
The authorities are determined to continue improving the composition of expenditure
in favor of priority social sectors and growth-enhancing investments. While the average
individual salary is very low in Burundi, the wage bill ratio to GDP is high at about 10.8
percent in 2007. In this connection, the authorities will take advantage of the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) supported by the
World Bank to help design strategies to rationalize the expenditure structure over the
medium term.
12.
The combined impact of high oil and food prices on fiscal accounts in 2008 is
estimated at about 1.5 percent of GDP. This does not take into account the effect of drought
and the ongoing process of returning of refugees. The authorities will improve budget
projections of the impact of the already declared free primary education, and child and
maternity health care policy. Reflecting all these efforts, the authorities would like to count
on the understanding of development partners for additional budgetary support.
Monetary and exchange rate policies, and financial sector issues.
13.
The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to prudent monetary policy. Efforts
to enhance the operational independence of the BRB will be intensified. To this end, a new
law on the BRB Charter has been submitted by the Government to Parliament. The BRB is
enhancing its monetary policy management capacity with the support of TA from the IMF,
and pursuing the development of indirect monetary policy instruments, including open
market operations with government securities. In addition the authorities are strengthening
financial intermediation and developing financial markets. Financial sector supervision will
be further strengthened, and the authorities are keen to draw lessons from the forthcoming

4
FSAP to refine their financial sector reform program. The managed floating exchange rate
regime will continue, as it has served Burundi well so far.
Structural reforms and issues
14.
The authorities are committed to deepening their structural reform agenda aimed at
providing an investor friendly environment, promoting private sector development, and
making further progress on transparency and good governance. This includes reforms that are
required to substantially increase productivity and efficiency in the productive sectors, and
attract more private sector investments, especially in the coffee and sugar sectors. The
authorities will also pursue the implementation of the governance action plan agreed with
cooperating partners on “Interpetrol-related case”.
15.
Burundi will make effort to reap the benefit of regional economic and trade
integration. Nevertheless, in the short-run, the authorities will need to address the challenge
of aligning its domestic policies to its regional obligations, especially the EAC, while
mitigating the transitory costs and the budgetary implications.
16.
The authorities wish to reach the completion point under the HIPC initiative as soon
as possible. To this end, they are expediting the implementation of the related floating
triggers.
17
Burundi has a huge need of capacity building support, and the authorities called on
the Fund and other cooperating partners to remain engaged to support them. In this
connection, the authorities are aware of weaknesses in their statistical system, and have
adopted an action plan to fast-track the required improvements.
