STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 18, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Average growth of 8 percent over the past decade, supported by rising oil
output and prices, has solidified Kazakhstan’s position as a regional economic power.
Following rapid economic recovery from the 2007–08 crisis, growth has decelerated but
remains solid. Inflation and employment growth are stable. Financial sector repair is
ongoing, but its pace is held back by persistently high non-performing loans (NPLs).
Outlook and risks: Medium-term growth prospects are strong, helped by a substantial
projected increase in oil output, with full scale production in the Kashagan oil field
expected to commence in 2015. There are some downside risks to the outlook, primarily
emanating from the external environment, including from a possible sustained
slowdown in global growth and lower oil prices.
Key Article IV policy recommendations: The authorities’ vision of developing
Kazakhstan into a leading emerging market economy requires concerted efforts to
strengthen the policy architecture. The currently stable macroeconomic conditions and
appropriate policy mix provide the authorities an opportune time to:


Speed up progress on resolving the large stock of NPLs.



Bolster the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, with a view to promoting
durable and inclusive medium-term economic growth and alleviating
vulnerabilities to shocks.



Enhance the diversification strategy, including by strengthening institutions, the
business environment, and human capital, while carefully managing the
country’s oil wealth.

CONTEXT
1.
Economic fundamentals remain relatively strong, although financial sector healing is
not yet fully secured. Following rapid output recovery from the crisis, real GDP growth slowed to
5 percent last year, mostly reflecting declines in oil and agricultural output. External pressures on
prices have eased and inflation remains within the authorities’ objective range of 6-8 percent. Based
on standard international rankings, the business environment is improving, albeit from a low base.
Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO is expected this year.1 A persistently large stock of NPLs—a
legacy of the global crisis—is holding back a meaningful recovery in banks’ profits, although credit
growth (especially consumer lending) is picking up.
2.
Implementation of Fund’s past policy advice is ongoing. The authorities have taken steps
to address earlier recommendations, including officially abolishing the exchange rate band (2011)
and continuing to implement prudent fiscal policy. In addition, recent technical assistance on
financial sector issues, public financial management, and statistics has been well received. However,
the policy response to high NPLs has been relatively slow, while enhancing monetary and fiscal
policy frameworks requires a steadfast approach.
3.
Looking ahead, the authorities are keen to develop Kazakhstan into a major diversified
emerging market economy. To meet this goal, improving macroeconomic policy frameworks and
properly managing oil wealth, while bolstering human capital and institutions, will be crucial. There
is broad agreement among policy makers on the need to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil
by promoting non-oil activity, and to lower the large presence and reach of state-owned enterprise
activities throughout the economy.
4.
The political backdrop is broadly stable. Risks to political stability have largely subsided
since the deadly clashes between protesting oil workers and police in December 2011. However, the
recently proposed changes to the pension system (in particular the plan to increase the retirement
age for women) have generated public discontent. Kazakhstan has started to play an increasing role
in mediating conflicts across the region.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth has decelerated, but macroeconomic conditions remain solid. Real GDP growth
slowed from 7½ percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2012, as the positive non-oil output gap reached a
peak of about 1½ percent earlier in the year. The deceleration was particularly noticeable in the
mining and agriculture sectors, and continued through the first quarter of 2013 with GDP growth
amounting to 4.6 percent year-on-year. Employment has expanded at about 2½ percent annually
1

WTO accession has been delayed from last year reflecting prolonged negotiations, in part due to issues related to
the Customs Union with Russia and Belarus.

over the last three years. Helped by moderating food prices, headline inflation stood at 6.0 percent
at end-2012, down from 7½ percent at end-2011. More recently, headline inflation has fallen to just
below the authorities’ 6-8 percent target range, while core inflation has remained stable at around
5-5½ percent (Figure 1).
6.
The balance of payment (BoP) position weakened somewhat in 2012. The current
account surplus (CAS) was almost halved, to 3.8 percent of GDP, due to a weaker trade surplus
(reflecting in part a decline in the share of oil exports in GDP as well as a surge in non-hydrocarbon
imports) and a deteriorating deficit in the services balance. The fall in the CAS was mostly offset by a
decline in the deficit of the financial account, reflecting higher FDI and other investment inflows.
Central bank international reserves decreased by $1 billion, to $28.3 billion, but remain just below
what is implied by standard reserves adequacy metrics. However, the National Fund of the Republic
of Kazakhstan (NFRK) stood at a healthy $63 billion, or 30 percent of GDP, at end-June, 2012.
Preliminary first quarter results for 2013 reveal a BoP surplus of $0.3 billion (compared to $2.1 billion
in 2012 Q1), largely reflecting a narrower CAS.
7.
Kazakhstan’s external competitiveness position has improved somewhat. Based on
standard CGER analysis, the average estimate of the real exchange rate’s misalignment yields a small
undervaluation of 2-3 percent, but there is some variation across the different measures, with the
macro-balance approach suggesting some overvaluation, while the equilibrium real exchange rate
model implying undervaluation. At the same time, Kazakhstan’s nonoil sector has seen some
increased global export penetration in recent years, suggesting some gains in the competitiveness
position.2 External debt remains within a safe threshold following the successful restructuring of
banks’ external debt over the years, and results of the external DSA suggest a sustainable external
debt path. Overall, therefore, the external situation appears stable.
8.
The financial sector is recovering, but only gradually. Efforts to resolve the stock of NPLs
are ongoing, but with limited impact so far. Ratios remain elevated, at 30 percent for the system,
albeit with large variations across banks (Figure 2). Profits have improved over the past year, but
remain very weak, with the return on assets ratio for the largest banks (excluding troubled BTA and
Alliance banks) barely reaching 1 percent last year. The system’s capital adequacy ratio increased
from 17 percent to 18 percent in 2012, following the external debt restructuring and state-funded
recapitalization of BTA. While private sector credit growth remains moderate overall at 13 percent,
consumer lending, concentrated in small- and medium-sized banks, is expanding rapidly (from a low
base) at around 40 percent year-on-year.

2

Kazakhstan’s non-oil commodity exports as a share in global non-oil exports increased from 0.12 percent in 2009 to
0.16 percent in 2011.

The fiscal position worsened somewhat in 2012, mainly due to lower oil revenues. The
overall fiscal surplus declined to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012, from 5.9 percent of GDP in 2011 (Figure
3), while the nonoil deficit deteriorated only slightly from 8.8 to 9.0 percent of GDP, compared to an
estimated sustainable level of 6 percent of GDP.4 These developments reflected weaker performance
in the oil sector as well as tax exemptions for new oil projects, accompanied by a rise in
expenditures of 0.8 percent of GDP (driven mainly by non-wage current spending), partly offset by
the continued increase in nonoil revenues. In early 2013 revenue performance was relatively weak

Excess liquidity is defined as banks’ reserve assets in excess of minimum reserve requirements plus holdings of NBK
notes and deposits at the NBK.

The sustainable level of non-oil deficit was estimated by staff using a Permanent Income Hypothesis annuity
framework to be 7.5 percent of non-oil GDP, which is equivalent to 6 percent of total GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

while expenditures were also subdued. The oil export customs duty was increased by 50 percent in
April 2013.
11.
There have been two important reorganizations in the public sector. In early 2013, the
responsibilities for fiscal planning were transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the newly
reorganized Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning, while the Ministry of Finance continues to
be responsible for implementation of the budget. In line with a recent presidential decree, a new
extra-budgetary entity (Baiterek) was created to combine all the main development institutions,
most of which were previously part of Samruk Kazyna state investment holding company (SK).
12.
The unification of the pension funds has become a policy priority. In a step that could
partly reverse earlier reforms,5 Kazakhstan’s 10 pension funds, with total assets of $22.5 billion
(10 percent of GDP) are being unified with the aim of improving returns on the assets while
maintaining individual accounts. The single pension fund will be owned by an independent
government agency and managed largely by the NBK.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
Medium-term growth prospects are strong, driven by a substantial projected increase
in oil output. In 2013, GDP is expected to grow at 5¼ percent, only moderately above 2012,
reflecting a recovery in oil and agricultural output. On the demand side, the negative impact of fiscal
consolidation—including a freeze on public sector nominal wages, with implications for private
sector wages and consumption—is expected to be more than offset by higher net external demand.
Over the medium term, however, full scale production in the Kashagan oil field, projected to
commence in 2015, will strengthen overall growth, while the small positive output gap in nonoil
GDP closes as nonoil growth converges to 6 percent. Assets in the NFRK are projected to rise to 40
percent of GDP by 2018. The authorities’ growth projections, both for 2013 and for the medium
term, are more optimistic than the staff’s. While the authorities’ projections are relatively cautious
regarding prospects for oil output, industrialization and diversification programs are assumed to
help achieve and maintain 6¾ percent overall GDP growth over the medium-term.

An early mover among CIS countries, Kazakhstan’s pension system was transformed in 1998 from a single pay-asyou-go (PAYG) defined benefit system to a mix of PAYG, a mandatory defined-contribution scheme, and a privately
managed voluntary scheme.

1/ Overall growth in 2013-2017 is projected to be about 0.75 percentage points lower than in last year’s
Article IV staff report mostly because of lower expected growth in 2013 and more conservative oil output
projections in the medium-term.

14.
There are some downside risks to the outlook, primarily emanating from the external
environment (see Annex I). A potential slowdown in the global economy and lower oil prices than
currently projected would negatively affect external demand and growth. Close trade, investment,
and financial links with Russia and China make Kazakhstan particularly vulnerable to shocks affecting
these economies. Like other emerging market economies, Kazakhstan is also prone to reversal in
short-term capital flows; however, the vulnerability associated with external borrowing by banks has
declined markedly in recent years. Continued reliance on oil and the still unresolved NPLs issues in
the banking sector are key sources of domestic vulnerabilities. The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment of risk and were particularly concerned about prospects for the Russian economy. They
also noted that the NFRK, in addition to ensuring intergenerational equity, could support stability by
being used to arrest any sharp deceleration in growth in the event of large negative shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Given the broadly stable macroeconomic conditions, policy discussions centered on
the need to bolster policy frameworks. The external situation appears stable. Moreover, despite a
somewhat lower-than-expected fiscal balance than originally budgeted for 2013, staff viewed fiscal
and monetary policies as remaining broadly appropriate, with inflation under control and large
spending cuts planned for 2013. However, if fiscal policy turns out looser than currently foreseen
and inflationary pressures reemerge due to rapid expansion in private sector credit, the policy mix
will need to be reevaluated. In view of relative stability, staff and the authorities discussed how to
strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework, with a view to ensuring medium-term durable
economic growth and alleviating vulnerabilities to shocks. While the primary near-term goal is to

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

provide a lasting solution to the high stock of NPLs, medium-term objectives are to revamp the
monetary policy and fiscal frameworks, and to use the oil wealth to diversify the economy.

A. Financial Sector
16.
In view of limited progress on NPLs, the authorities have adopted an increasingly
proactive posture (Box 1). Last year, the authorities established a centralized problem loans fund
(PLF), funded by the NBK, and bank-run special purpose vehicles (SPVs). However, implementation
of these measures has been slow, while continued weakness in private sector balance sheets
contributed to persistently elevated NPLs ratios. The authorities are considering a more flexible
approach to the design of the PLF, to make it more attractive to banks and to increase its size if
necessary, working closely with the IMF resident advisor on this issue. Furthermore, and importantly,
the authorities have recently introduced ceilings on NPLs―20 percent in 2013 and 15 percent in
2014. The NBK and staff agreed that to achieve meaningful traction, enforcement should be strict
and applied on a consolidated basis (in particular to include SPVs). Specifically, banks with NPLs
higher than current limits should present the supervisory authorities with specific action plans on
how they intend to reduce their NPLs, and be held accountable for the realization of these plans.
Finally, staff supported the authorities’ intention to consider extending the tax exemptions on
written-off loans for banks and buyers of distressed debt beyond 2013, and to make the
administrative procedures less burdensome.
17.
The government is planning to sell its stake in previously rescued banks.6 Staff
supported this decision, but suggested that to bolster the stability of the banking system as a whole
and to avoid the emergence of new risks; the exit should reflect market-based principles and take
place in a fully transparent manner. In particular, the announced proposed sale of BTA (third largest
bank) to Halyk (largest bank) raises questions about the nature of the transaction and the potential
resulting systemic risks. While details are still being worked out, Halyk Bank, which owns the largest
pension fund, has received an offer from Samruk Kazyna (SK), the state-owned conglomerate, to
swap its stake in BTA for Halyk’s pension fund. If the deal goes through, Halyk’s assets will exceed
25 percent of total banking system assets. Notwithstanding the recent recapitalization of BTA, its
financial position remains fragile, with NPLs of about 87 percent as of end-December, 2012. The
authorities assured staff that the transaction will satisfy the required criteria but viewed systemic
risks as manageable.
18.
Staff noted that potential risks from rapidly growing consumer lending requires
strengthening of macroprudential tools. While the NBK did not view this as posing a significant
threat to the banking system, it is contemplating new macroprudential rules to stem the growth in
retail credit, for example, through introducing ceilings on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios.
Staff welcomed this approach and, to avoid exacerbating the size of NPLs, called for early attention
to the problem, including by bolstering on-site bank supervision, enhancing liquidity and credit risk
6

During the crisis, the government took majority ownership stake in BTA, Alliance and Temir banks, which,
combined, account currently for roughly 15 percent of banking system assets.

assessments, and stepping up the Early Warning System. The mission and the authorities also
discussed the modalities of the upcoming FSAP update, currently planned for late 2013 or early
2014. The authorities welcomed the proposed full-scale update to include a ROSC on all financial
institutions.
Box 1. Kazakhstan: Resolution of NPLs
High NPLs are a major legacy of the crisis for Kazakhstan’s banks. They weaken banks’ profits and cash
flows and ultimately undermine their ability to lend, and consume significant human resources. NPLs also
create uncertainty in wholesale funding markets due to concerns about banks’ underlying positions. To
address this long-outstanding issue, the authorities introduced a framework with options to sell NPLs to a
central-bank funded PLF, transfer them to SPVs, or write them off using a temporary tax relief.
Progress has been limited and the NBK has followed up on its efforts with further action in recent
months. The small size of the PLF (less than 1 percent of existing NPLs) and limited scope of loans it could
purchase has been a shortcoming. Banks are also reluctant to sell their loans to the PLF at a discount in the
hope of loans recovery. Moreover, the ability of SPVs to reduce NPLs in practice is limited because banks
plan to transfer primarily the problematic real estate properties to them. Finally, due to burdensome
procedures, those banks that are interested in writing off their loans claim that they will not be able to do so
for all of them by end-2013 when tax exemptions expire. To address some of these issues, the authorities are
making the PLF more flexible in scope and prices it can offer to banks. To incentivize banks to deal with their
NPLs, the NBK has also introduced NPL ceilings (20 percent of total loans on January 1, 2013 and 15 percent
on January 1, 2014). Further, to facilitate the resolution of NPLs, bankruptcy legislation has been improved in
line with the recommendations of the MCM/LEG technical assistance mission of November 2010.
Still, to speed up the resolution of the problem, more decisive policy measures are needed.

To become more effective, the PLF could consider extending the range of asset purchases to real
estate and construction—areas that represent the bulk of problem loans. The PLF could offer banks the
possibility of entering into profit-sharing agreements by providing them with the opportunity to gain from
the potential of realized collateral. To make the PLF more attractive to banks and offer them better
prospects to realize collateral, it could create and manage pools of similar types of assets and offer them to
specialized investors on auctions. This could be done for assets either sold or commissioned to the PLF by
banks. Similar applications to enhance the effectiveness of asset management companies where used by the
Korea Asset Management Corporation, Malaysia’s National Asset Management Company, and the
Resolution Trust Corporation in the U.S.

To ensure that NPL ceilings are effective, strict implementation is needed. Banks should be required
to provide specific plans as to how they will lower their NPLs and the NBK should actively monitor these
plans’ implementation. Banks that fail to follow their plans to reduce NPLs should be required to raise more
capital or risk limits on their operations or be subject to further supervisory action.

As an additional incentive, the authorities could consider mandatory audits of assets quality for
major banks at some specified period—say end-2014. This comprehensive review by independent parties
could help ascertain asset quality at banks and provide assurance to markets that true restructuring has
taken place. Strengthened inspections, including through on-site examinations, particularly of large banks,
were instituted successfully in Japan and the U.S.

Extension of the tax exemption on written-off loans and for buyers of NPLs beyond 2013, along
with simplification of procedures, should provide banks with more time to utilize this approach.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
The monetary policy stance remains appropriate. With headline inflation projected to
hover around the midpoint of the authorities’ objective range (6-8 percent) and core inflation to
remain stable, the NBK is expected to keep its policy interest rate on hold in the coming months.
This stance may need to be reevaluated if excess liquidity in the banking system translates into more
rapid private sector credit expansion or if fiscal policy turns out looser than currently expected by
staff.
20.
The NBK explained the positive steps it has taken to enhance its regulation of liquidity
in the banking system. In view of limited instruments for efficiently managing the buildup of excess
liquidity in recent years, the NBK has introduced important changes to minimum reserve
requirements (MRR). In particular, the new regulations exclude banks’ cash on hand and
correspondent accounts in foreign currency from reserve assets in order to provide a more accurate
assessment of the size of tenge liquidity in the system. Moreover, in addition to conducting weekly
auctions for the issuance of short-term notes, the NBK has begun to be more active in the provision
of short-term liquidity to banks through repo operations to smooth seasonal fluctuations in liquidity
conditions (e.g. relating to quarterly tax payments). Looking ahead, as stipulated in the 2013
monetary policy guidelines, the NBK plans to engage in more active open market operations
(OMOs) for both the provision and withdrawals of liquidity, through changes to its standing
facilitates and the introduction of a new repo rate between the two standing facilities’ interest rates.
Staff supported these initiatives and other measures envisaged to enhance the central bank’s ability
to control money market interest rates.
21.
Strengthening monetary policy further will require introducing a policy rate that
signals better the stance of policy and enhancing the communication strategy. The official
refinancing rate– the NBK’s policy interest rate– has played little role in guiding key market interest
rates. Based on staff’s analytical work, illustrating the benefits that the NBK can achieve from gaining
greater control over key money market rates, staff suggested that the envisaged repo instrument
could become the new policy rate, preferably within a narrower interest rate corridor. This rate
should help guide better key money market rates, hence bolstering the signaling effects of
monetary policy. While this may imply additional interest cost, this should be manageable.
Moreover, to anchor expectations about policy intentions and operations, staff argued the
importance of communicating more openly and clearly the transition plans to active OMOs and,
more generally, elaborating on the factors guiding the interest rate decisions in the NBK’s postmeeting communiqué and quarterly inflation reports. The NBK is well aware of the challenges
involved in adopting a new policy rate through active OMOs, and agreed on the need to
communicate the plans more openly to the public to ensure an effective transition process.
22.
Looking ahead, the authorities agreed to consider the scope for allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility over the medium term. While the economy’s dollarization (roughly
40 percent of bank deposits are dollar denominated) complicates the operations of monetary policy
and adopting formal inflation targeting may not be appropriate at this juncture, there is scope to
take preparatory steps, including increasing the reliance on the interest rate lever and reducing the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

role of the exchange rate as a policy instrument within the broader monetary policy framework. The
authorities argued that interventions in the foreign exchange market were not meant to counter a
particular trend in the exchange rate, but rather to smooth sharp fluctuations in the supply and
demand for foreign currency, including those impacting NBK’s management of the NFRK. However,
they agreed to consider staff’s recommendations.

C. Fiscal Policy
23.
The revised 2013 budget (consolidated to include the NFRK) implies lower fiscal
balances than initially planned. The weaker revenue performance observed in the first few months
of 2013 is expected to continue throughout the year, largely reflecting lower-than-expected nominal
GDP and oil prices. In response, the authorities have further cut planned spending by 0.2 percent of
GDP relative to the original budget, resulting in an overall reduction in spending of 1.4 percent of
GDP relative to 2012. Nevertheless, the overall balance is expected to stay broadly unchanged from
last year compared with an improvement of 0.5 percent of GDP in the original budget. Since the fall
in revenues appears to be mostly cyclical and the expenditure cuts are already large, staff did not
recommend further spending cuts this year. However, it urged the authorities to ensure that
spending remains within the revised budget and to adhere to their plans to make up for the shortfall
next year.
24.
While the authorities are committed to significant fiscal consolidation over the
medium term, staff noted that the assumptions underlying their current official projections
may be unrealistic. According to these projections, the state budget deficit net of the NFRK
transfer will fall to 3 percent of GDP by 2020 (consistent with a sustainable consolidated nonoil
deficit of 6 percent of GDP). However, there are several issues with these projections. In particular,
the consolidation plans rely primarily on reducing expenditure in percent of GDP, and hence do not
appear in line with announced (but still not fully well-defined or budgeted) large scale public
spending plans related to the government’s development and diversification programs.
Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the revenue projections do not seem to include planned
measures and are not fully aligned with a credible broader macroeconomic framework. Finally, the
fiscal framework is partial and not defined on a consolidated basis.
25.
The authorities discussed their plans to address some of these weaknesses in their
revised medium-term fiscal framework by the end of this year. Some development and
diversification spending plans will be included in the new framework (accompanied by some
increases in transfer from the NFRK through 2018). Moreover, the framework is expected to ensure
that tax revenue projections are consistent with a realistic macro framework, and that planned tax
policy measures are incorporated. The latter aim at reducing the budget’s medium-term reliance on
oil, and include increasing excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco products; limiting the use of
preferential tax regimes in agriculture and in the SME sector; introducing a new luxury tax; revising
the personal income tax to make it more progressive; and streamlining the property tax. The
authorities intend to keep their 2020 deficit target unchanged. The authorities believe that
concentrating macroeconomic and budget planning within the Ministry of Economy and Budget
Planning could help ensure consistency between macroeconomic and fiscal projections.

26.
Staff also argued that the fiscal framework could be further enhanced, especially by
improving transparency. Given that many of the development and diversification programs will
continue to be carried out through quasi-fiscal institutions and private public partnerships, it is
crucial that they are recorded in a transparent manner and that any contingent liabilities to the state
are properly accounted for in the broader fiscal framework. Furthermore, the NFRK should be fully
integrated in the fiscal accounts and the nonoil deficit of the consolidated budget should play a
prominent role in guiding fiscal policy. The authorities acknowledged the deficiencies caused by
excluding the NFRK from fiscal accounts and are looking forward to collaborating with a
forthcoming IMF TA mission on improving the coverage of fiscal statistics and compliance with the
GFS manual.
27.
Gross public debt is projected to stay at low levels over the medium term, but
unrecorded contingent liabilities may pose a risk. Due to continuing fiscal surpluses gross
financing needs are negative, however, the government chooses to maintain a domestic debt
market. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance

D. Structural Policy Issues
28.
The authorities consider economic diversification a key long-term policy priority,
given the long-term risks of excessive reliance on oil. Their envisaged plans, although not yet
fully defined, focus on accelerating industrialization and development through improving
infrastructure, encouraging investment and innovation, boosting productivity, as well as targeted
support to help priority sectors. Staff urged the authorities to clarify in specific terms their
diversification strategy and cautioned against the downsides of vertical policies of picking winners. It
also urged the authorities to avoid further increasing the role of the state in the economy.

SK assets and external debt are estimated, respectively, at about 50 percent of GDP and 30 percent of GDP.

29.
Staff stressed the importance of implementing basic structural reform to improve the
functioning of the economy alongside industrialization/diversification plans. For successful
diversification, it is essential to focus on bolstering human capital and institutions—areas where
Kazakhstan lags behind successful emerging market economies (Annex II). Moreover, an improved
business environment and high-quality of public service delivery are key elements needed to
enhance broad based and private-sector-led growth.8
30.
In this regard, the authorities also agreed on the need to ensure continued
commitment to prudent management of oil revenues and to carry out public investment in
line with absorptive capacity and high standards of efficiency. Staff argued, based on the results
of its analytical work, that while ambitious public investment programs may help boost growth, the
cost may be high in terms of adverse macroeconomic outcomes (see Selected Issues Paper
“Leveraging Oil Wealth for Development: Opportunities and Challenges”). In particular, excessive
public spending could affect the competitiveness of the nonoil tradable sector negatively (Dutch
disease) and thereby defeat the purpose of diversification. It would also risk wearing down the
accumulated buffers or alternatively piling up costly external debt. Furthermore, to ensure that the
government’s development and diversification programs are efficient, staff urged the authorities to
conduct careful cost-benefit analysis of envisaged projects as well as evaluation of outcomes in
consultation with international financial organizations. This analysis should cover all programs
implemented through various modalities, including the general government budget, quasi-fiscal
institutions, and public-private partnerships. The authorities found staff’s analytical work useful and
broadly agreed with its implications.
31.
The systemic nature of SK requires enhanced transparency of its operations. The size of
SK has grown over time, reaching $100 billion (50 percent of GDP) in assets last year; roughly three
quarters of the assets are distributed among the oil, gas and financial sectors (Box 2). Given the
large presence and reach of its activities across many sectors of the economy, concerted efforts are
required to properly account for SK’s financial operations, particularly including those involving the
fiscal accounts (transfers of taxes and royalties to the budget, loans from the government, holding
of government securities, treatment of contingent liabilities, foreign borrowing on behalf of public
entities, etc.). Staff also argued that continued reliance on SK to channel public investments to the
economy required development of risk metrics to fully and transparently account for the range of
contingent liabilities to the state. The authorities broadly shared staff views and noted that the
creation of Baiterek as a separate entity should help enhance the transparency of quasi-fiscal
operations.
32.
The mission and the authorities discussed the authorities’ plans to unify Kazakhstan’s
private pension funds under state ownership and NBK management. The draft law to unify
private pension funds has been approved by parliament. It will be essential to avoid exacerbating

competition in the market for pension services. In response, the authorities noted that they intend

provide support to the NBK’s move to more active OMOs. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance
underscored the need for full collaboration with the NBK to secure successful outcomes. The
authorities further argued that the unification of private pension funds should be seen as a means to
cut unnecessary administrative costs, while promoting a more diversified investment portfolio
geared at achieving higher rates of return on pension assets.

SK’s involvement in the pension fund unification is expected to be small, although this is uncertain.
For now, it is envisaged to play only a mediatory role by purchasing pension funds of the three large banks
and transferring these over to the government’s unified Fund.
The role of SK in the country’s diversification strategy is expected to continue. In the framework of the
government’s development and diversification strategy SK’s investment portfolio eyes 100 projects mostly in
the non-oil sector, with a total value of $81 billion, to be financed through both SK’s own budget and
through partners. The timeframe for implementation began two years ago in line with the industrial
modernization plan of the government; as of now, 27 projects worth $10 billion have been executed; the
remainder is ongoing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Medium-term prospects are good, offering an excellent opportunity to bolster the
policy architecture. Average growth of 8 percent over the past decade, supported by rising oil
output and prices, has solidified Kazakhstan’s position as a regional economic power. Following
rapid economic recovery from the 2007-08 crisis, growth has decelerated but remains solid, and is
expected to rise slightly in 2013 to around 5¼ percent. Medium-term growth prospects are
stronger, driven by a substantial projected increase in oil output starting in 2015. The authorities
should take advantage of the positive outlook to strengthen the policy frameworks with a view to
achieving durable and inclusive growth and alleviating vulnerabilities to shock.
34.
Greater determination is needed to resolve the NPLs problem and enhance supervision
and macroprudential surveillance to counter financial stability risks. In view of slow progress on
NPL resolution, the authorities should follow through on their consideration of redesigning the PLF,
and taking additional action if necessary. The new ceilings on NPLs should be strictly enforced to
ensure full compliance. The planned exit from troubled banks should ensure that transactions are
market-based and transparent to bolster the stability of the banking system as a whole and to avoid
the emergence of new risks. Given rapid growth in consumer lending, the authorities must ensure
that risk management and lending practices are sufficiently robust to avoid exacerbating the NPLs
problem. Further strengthening of supervision and macroprudential tools is critical. Among key
measures, priority should be given to shoring up on-site supervision, enhancing liquidity and credit
risk assessments, and stepping up the Early Warning System.
35.
Further bolstering the monetary policy framework requires a new policy rate,
enhancing communication, and reviewing the role of the exchange rate. With enhanced
regulation of banking system liquidity underway and additional measures already taken by the NBK,
introducing a policy rate that signals better the stance of policy is crucial. To anchor expectations
about policy intentions and operations, the NBK should communicate more openly and clearly the
transition plans to active open market operations and, more generally, elaborate on the factors
guiding the interest rate decisions in its public communications. There is also scope to re-evaluate
the role of the exchange rate and how it fits within the broader monetary policy framework, and
allowing for greater flexibility over the medium term.
36.
In line with NBK’s intentions, the unification of the private pension funds must avoid
exacerbating fiscal risks and undermining earlier reform efforts. In particular, the authorities
should adopt a clear and sound market-based investment strategy for the assets, while ensuring
that individual accounts are maintained. Moreover, close collaboration between the NBK and the
Ministry of Finance will be essential to secure increased financial institutions’ participation in the
market for government paper, which would support active OMOs as a corner stone of the revamped
monetary policy framework.
37.
Lowering the non-oil deficit over the medium term is a key priority, which necessitates
a credible fiscal consolidation strategy. The consolidation plans outlined in the current medium-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

term fiscal framework may be inconsistent with announced (but non-budgeted) large scale public
spending plans related to the government’s development and diversification programs.
Furthermore, the assumptions underlying both expenditure and revenue projections need to be fully
aligned with a macroeconomic framework that takes into account the effects of envisioned fiscal
measures.
38.
Further enhancing the fiscal framework requires improved coverage and transparency.
The authorities should integrate fully the NFRK with fiscal accounts and use consolidated budget
balances for guiding fiscal policy. Further, the large scale quasi-fiscal sector necessitates improved
transparency of quasi-fiscal operations, including those related to the government’s development
and diversification programs. The authorities’ recognition of the need for action in these areas,
particularly the intention to monitor more closely the external debt of the quasi-fiscal sector, is
welcome.
39.
Reducing the economy’s dependence on oil remains a primary long-term objective for
the authorities. For successful diversification and to promote broad-based and private-sector led
growth, it is crucial to bolster human capital, the business environment, and institutions. At the
same time, it is essential to ensure continued commitment to prudent management of oil revenues
and carrying out critical investment in line with absorptive capacity and high standards of efficiency.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–
month cycle.

represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical
average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is used to project
debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic

Global slowdown affecting

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment: Medium

Latest Fund staff’s projections
suggest that growth in China and
Russia is slowing. Risks to
prolongation (or further
weakening) of the Euro-area
crisis remain an additional
downside risk.

Kazakhstan would be affected
through trade, finance, and
investment channels. A
deterioration of market
conditions in the EU or Russia
could have an impact on trade
flows, FDI and portfolio
inflows.

Staff assessment: Low

Staff assessment: High

A global recession with a
protracted slow growth could
depress demand for energy and
cause a sharp fall in oil prices.

While reserves are sufficient to
contain an immediate shock,
growth in the non-oil sectors
would be negatively affected.

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment: Medium

Attempts to resolve banking
sector issues have not been
successful so far. Schemes to
resolve the high NPLs need to be
improved.

Financial sector stress could
put pressure on deposits,
leading to a possible credit
crunch. Potential capital
shortfalls represent a large
contingent liability for the
government.

Staff assessment: Low to
medium

Staff assessment: Medium to
high

Russia, China, and the EU are the
main trading partners. Risk
indicators tend to move in line
with those of Russia. China is a
major source of investment.

Large and prolonged decline in
oil prices
The economy remains highly
dependent on oil for export
proceeds and budget revenues.

Failure to improve the
health of the banking
system
The banking system is saddled
with very high NPLs. A forced
merger of Halyk and BTA
banks could raise systemic
risks.
Political uncertainty
Political incentives may be
misaligned with economic
priorities.

32

Political factors may hinder
Following episodes of social
unrest in late 2011 the authorities effective policymaking and
succeeded in consolidating power. affect growth and stability.
However, the recently proposed
changes to the pension system
have generated public
discontent.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official
exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held daily. Auctions
are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are quoted for over 30 other
currencies on the basis of cross-rates. From late 1999 to October 2007, the exchange rate regime
was a managed float with no preannounced path. From October 2007 the tenge was maintained
within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. In February 2009 the tenge was devalued by
18 percent against the US dollar, and a trading band of T150/US$ +/- 3 percent was established. In
February 2010, the trading band was widened and set at an asymmetric T150/US$ +10/-15 percent.
In February 2011, the trading band was officially abolished, and the de jure exchange rate
arrangement was changed from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands to a managed
float. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as crawl-like, because the tenge has been
consistently tracking a trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2 percent margin. The exchange rates at
numerous exchange bureaus are very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and
selling rates is very small. The exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010). The last consultation was
concluded on June 18, 2012 (see IMF Country Report No. 12/164).
FSAP Participation and ROSCS
Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000. The staff report
on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on November 27, 2000
(FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision, Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good
Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of
Securities Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP Update mission took place in
February 2004 and a second FSAP Update mission took place in March 2008. The fiscal transparency
module was completed in October 2002 and the final report published in April 2003. A data module
mission took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was published in March 2003. An update
of the data ROSC was undertaken in 2006 and the report was published in February 2008 (Annex V).
AML/CFT Assessment
Kazakhstan’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework was recently assessed against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) 40+9 Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the Eurasian Group on money
laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG), the FATF-style regional body of which Kazakhstan is a
member, and the final mutual evaluation report was adopted in June 2011. The report indicates that
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

the main sources of criminal proceeds in Kazakhstan are crimes related to fraud and abuse of public
office. The evaluators found that Kazakhstan had a relatively comprehensive AML/CFT framework in
place, but that significant deficiencies nevertheless remained, notably with respect to customer due
diligence measures and the reporting of suspicious transactions.
Technical Assistance
Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area of
economic policy, including through about 90 technical assistance missions provided during
1993–2013 by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the
Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, to the Ministry of Finance, and a peripatetic expert to the Financial
Supervision Agency. Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank, EU
TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance. The
following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan since 2003.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress in a number of areas related to monetary and
exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting, payments system reform,
central bank organization and management, foreign operations and reserve management, banking
supervision, monetary statistics, currency issuance, monetary operations, and money-market
development.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 25, 2013)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and the International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992 and a member of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. In 2010 Kazakhstan became an IDA donor under the
IDA16 replenishment. Kazakhstan is the largest client of the IFC in Central Asia.
IBRD in Kazakhstan
The Bank’s lending operations in Kazakhstan are aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY12-17, endorsed by the Board in May 2012. As of June 2013, the IBRD loan program
comprised eleven active projects with a total commitment of $3.55 billion, of which $1.28 billion has
been disbursed. While 90 percent of the commitments are concentrated in the on-going SouthWest roads project and the new East-West roads project (became effective on June 14, 2013), the
portfolio remains diverse with two-thirds of the projects focused on institutional building. The other
nine active projects are: forest protection and reforestation, technology commercialization, customs
development, tax administration reform, health sector technology transfer and institutional reform,
technical and vocational education modernization, statistical capacity building, Ust-Kamenogorsk
environmental remediation, and Alma electricity transmission.
The Bank also provides extensive advisory and analytical services (AAA) to the Government through
the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP). The JERP is instrumental in providing policy analysis,
strategic planning expertise, and good practice options to assist the Government with the reform
agenda in the field of economic and social development and the institutional capacity of the
Government to conduct economic and sectoral work. The JERP for FY13 amounted to over $4.5
million and comprised 24 largely interrelated and programmatic activities focusing on the
Government’s strategic priorities in competitiveness agenda (including counter-cyclical
macroeconomic policy options, trade integration, transport logistics and investment climate
improvement, enterprise modernization, and insolvency regime); public finance management
(including introduction of the result oriented budget, improvement of inter-budgetary relations, and
internal audit system); and social modernization (including development of the framework for better
human capital outcomes, improvement of social safety network, ensuring adequacy of pension
income, and bringing the quality education to international standards).
IFC in Kazakhstan
In the context of the CPS for FY12-17, IFC’s role is to contribute to the Government's development
plans by supporting the private sector to advance economic diversification and growth agenda,
particularly in the non-extractive sectors and frontier regions. In the short term IFC is focusing on
strengthening the financial sector, both in the context of the post-crisis recovery and as a
prerequisite to pursue the diversification agenda, and infrastructure development, including via
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). As regards to infrastructure, IFC’s PPP Transaction Advisory team
is helping the government structure the first PPP in the road sector for the Almaty Ring Road. In the

medium term more efforts will be dedicated to the establishment of best practices in international
banking, improvement of the corporate governance and the regulatory environment, SMEs
development, increasing investments in value-added manufacturing, agribusiness and services, and
supporting the energy efficiency.
IFC’s investment program has been expanding in the context of the crisis response. It grew tenfold
between FY05 and FY08 (to $110 million) and nearly doubled again in FY09. In FY10, IFC invested a
record $336 million in five projects in the financial and agribusiness sectors, with vast majority
provided to commercial banks. Post-crisis IFC’s investment level has moderated and averaged at
about $100 million per year in FY11-13. As of June 2013, Kazakhstan remains IFC's largest client in
Central Asia with total committed portfolio of $385 million, of which $264 million has been
disbursed. The investment portfolio is mostly concentrated in the financial sector and general
manufacturing, although IFC has begun making investments in the agribusiness and infrastructure
sectors.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of July 5, 2013)
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is the largest investor outside the
oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan and in 2013 will celebrate its 20th anniversary in the country. As of
30 June 2013, the EBRD’s total investments in Kazakhstan, including co-financing, stood at €12
billion, with the Bank’s own share totaling €4.8 billion (both these figures include approximately €1.3
billion in cumulative Trade Facilitation Program turnover). As of 30 June 2013, the EBRD’s portfolio in
Kazakhstan amounted to €1.9 billion. During 2012, the EBRD signed 18 projects, including regional
ones, for a total amount of EBRD finance €374 million. During the first half of 2013, the EBRD signed
seven operations with a total annual bank investment of €155 million.
In its country strategy, approved in 2010, the EBRD aims to assist Kazakhstan in promoting
economic diversification and moving towards a more sustainable model of financial development.
The EBRD’s main operational objectives for 2013 are:


In the corporate sector, support investment in the manufacturing and the agribusiness sectors
to address immediate financing needs, while promoting the modernization and diversification of
the economy, best business and environmental practices, and energy efficiency.



In the financial sector, work with the Kazakhstani authorities and other IFIs to strengthen the
country’s financial sector; re-engage with partner banks; expand the partner banks group; and
assist the authorities with resolving the banks’ NPL problem and identifying and implementing
policy reforms to promote de-dollarization, develop local capital markets, and increase the
availability of sustainable local currency financing.



In the infrastructure sector, restructure the national railway company and support its
energy-efficiency improvement program; improve the infrastructure in Kazakh municipalities;
expand activities into the solid waste and district heating sectors and support municipal sector
reform, including innovative methods for developing and financing projects in the water
segment.



In the power and energy sector, support clean energy through the provision of financing to
modern generating facilities, stemming losses in the distribution segment through rehabilitation
of power lines and developing pilot renewable energy projects with private operators (subject to
bankability and integrity).

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 1, 2013)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. In the early years of
transition from a centrally planned to a more market-driven economy, ADB focused on efforts to
sustain a higher growth rate, promote environmental friendly development, support the private
sector, and encourage regional integration.
As of 1 July, 2013, cumulative public sector loan commitments to Kazakhstan amounted to
$2.68 billion, of which about $1.7 billion has been disbursed. Commitments cover 24 public sector
loan operations in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, and small and medium-sized enterprises
(SME). These loans were complemented with 67 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to
about $30.5 million. Kazakhstan is no longer eligible for the concessional resources from the ADB’s
Asian Development Fund. Kazakhstan became a donor to the Asian Development Fund with a $5.2
million contribution in 2012.
ADB’s new country partnership strategy (CPS) to guide operations during 2012–2016 aims to
support economic diversification and increased competitiveness. The CPS envisages to support
regional cooperation, private sector development and operations, inclusive growth, and knowledge
solutions. ADB’s focus is in the transport, finance, urban, and energy sectors. As knowledge solution
is central to the new CPS, the government and ADB established the joint Knowledge and Experience
Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013. The KEEP, operationalized through a government-ADB
Memorandum of Understanding, commits the parties to a 50% cost-sharing arrangement with a
total financing of $2.5 million during 2013–2015.
Ongoing operations are in road transportation, SMEs, urban infrastructure, and energy efficiency
sectors. ADB has been supporting Kazakhstan in realizing its transit potential and integration into
the global transport network via two Multi Tranche Financing Facilities (MFF) totaling $1.5 billion to
improve road networks in two regions of Kazakhstan (Zhambyl and Mangystau), along the CAREC
Transport Corridors 1 and 2. Six projects are under implementation with some sections completed
and in use. Once completed, the projects will contribute to increased external trade and economic
development. As part of ADB’s support to urban infrastructure development, a $300 million project
for Astana Light Rail Transport (phase 1) is being prepared for 2013 approval. This LRT project is a
first of its kind to be implemented in Kazakhstan and will require global experience in project
implementation. LRT system once completed will become a backbone of Astana city’s urban
transport network in the future.
In 2010, ADB approved a $500 million MFF for the SME Investment Program to enhance efficiency
and competitiveness of the financial sector and SMEs. Tranche 1 in the amount of $150 million was
provided to DAMU Entrepreneurship Development Fund for onlending to 3 participating financial
institutions (PFIs), and was fully disbursed in April 2013. A subsequent tranche 2 is being discussed
for 2013.

In 2012, a $1 million technical assistance for preparing the Karaganda District Heating Network
Rehabilitation project was approved. The project aims to ensure security of heat supply and enhance
district heating systems in the city, and reduce technical and commercial energy losses.
Other technical assistance projects include: preparation of the CAREC road projects in
2009 ($825,000); capacity development to support SME development approved in 2010 (for
$650,000); and preparation of the Astana Light Rail Transport project ($565,000) approved in 2011.
Kazakhstan also participates in a number of ongoing regional TA projects.
Private sector operations of ADB in Kazakhstan began in 2006, with private sector financing to six
entities in the financial and agribusiness sectors amounting to $415.2 million approved to-date.
Near-term ADB private sector financing prospects are in private infrastructure and energy sectors.
Kazakhstan was one of the 4 founding partners of the CAREC Program in 1997 (together with the
People’s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan). Since then, six other countries
have joined the partnership, and CAREC-related investments in the partner countries have totaled
$21 billion, over the period 2001–12. Four of the six CAREC road and rail corridors traverse
Kazakhstan, and developing these Central Asian corridors is a priority for achieving the vision of land
bridges connecting Europe and Asia. In October 2013, Kazakhstan will host CAREC 12th Ministerial
Conference in Astana which will bring together the ministers of the 10 member countries to discuss
the progress of CAREC. In May 2014, Kazakhstan will host the ADB Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors. Over 3,000 participants are expected to attend the event and discuss global and regional
development issues.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 1, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are monetary and balance of payments statistics, with remaining deficiencies in
coverage of fiscal statistics as well as national accounts.
National accounts: The quality of GDP statistics is affected by the limited coverage of small
businesses in selected activities such as retail and construction. While progress has been made in
compiling and reporting GDP by final expenditure consistent with output-based measures,
dissemination of quarterly GDP series is irregular.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts
consistent with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However,
statistics on the enlarged government (including public enterprises) is not available.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs)
complied by the central bank have a few inconsistencies.
Balance of payments:. The authorities are in the process of transitioning to the compilation of
balance of payments in concordance with the sixth edition of Balance of Payments Statistics Manual
(BPM6). However, deficiencies remain in foreign direct investment statistics as local branch offices of
foreign companies operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident entities. This leads
to discrepancies with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as domestic production.
In external debt statistics there are discrepancies between data compiled by different governmental
agencies owing to methodological differences. Statistical treatment of trade within the customs union
is not accurate, which has contributed to large and increasing errors and omissions. The authorities
are cooperating with relevant agencies in the customs union partner countries to resolve these
problems.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 14, 2013

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Kazakhstan
On August 2, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Kazakhstan, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal under the lapse of time procedure.2
Macroeconomic conditions remain solid, although growth has decelerated of late. Real GDP
growth slowed from 7½ percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2012, and further to a still-solid
4.6 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of 2013. The strong growth has allowed
employment to expand at about 2½ percent annually over the last three years. Helped by
moderating food prices, headline inflation has fallen to just below the 6-8 percent target
range, while core inflation has remained stable at around 5-5½ percent.
Following a cumulative 200-basis points cut in the central bank’s official refinancing rate
early in 2012, the authorities have kept the rate on hold at 5½ percent since August 2012.
The financial sector is gradually recovering. Banks’ profits have improved over the past year,
but remain weak, with the return on assets ratio for the largest banks (excluding BTA and
Alliance banks) reaching just 1 percent last year. The system’s capital adequacy ratio
increased from 17 percent to 18 percent in 2012, following the external debt restructuring
and state-funded recapitalization of BTA. While private sector credit growth remains
moderate overall, consumer lending, concentrated in small- and medium-sized banks, is
expanding rapidly (from a low base). Efforts to resolve the large stock of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) are ongoing, but with limited impact so far.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
2
The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

Concerning the non-bank sector, Kazakhstan’s 11 pension funds, with total assets of
US$21.2 billion (11 percent of GDP) are being unified under the partial management of the
central bank, following a Presidential decree early in 2013.
The fiscal position worsened somewhat in 2012, mainly due to weaker performance in the oil
sector as well as tax exemptions for new oil projects, accompanied by a rise in expenditures
of 0.8 percent of GDP. The non-oil deficit deteriorated only slightly from 8.8 to 9.0 percent
of GDP, compared to an estimated medium-term sustainable level of 6 percent of GDP. In
early 2013, revenue performance was relatively weak while expenditures were also subdued.
Over the medium term, the authorities are planning large investment projects in the broader
public sector to boost economic development and diversification.
The growth outlook is solid. In 2013, GDP is expected to grow at 5¼ percent, only
moderately above 2012, reflecting a recovery in oil and agricultural output. Over the medium
term, full scale production in the Kashagan oil field, projected to commence in 2015, will
strengthen overall growth. A potential slowdown in the global economy, particularly in
Russia and China, and lower oil prices than currently projected are the main downside risks
to growth.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Executive Directors welcomed Kazakhstan’s sustained growth performance. They noted that
average growth of 8 percent over the past decade, supported by rising oil output and prices,
has solidified Kazakhstan’s position as a regional economic power. Directors urged the
authorities to take advantage of the positive outlook to strengthen the policy architecture with
a view to achieving durable and inclusive growth and alleviating vulnerabilities to shocks.
Directors stressed that greater determination is needed to resolve the non-performing loan
(NPL) problem and to counter financial stability risks. In particular, in view of slow progress
on NPL resolution, the authorities should follow through on their consideration of
redesigning the Problem Loans Fund and strictly enforce the new ceilings on NPLs to
achieve full compliance. Given rapid growth in consumer lending, Directors called on the
authorities to ensure that risk management and lending practices are sufficiently robust to
avoid exacerbating the NPL problem. In this regard, further strengthening of supervision and
macroprudential tools is critical, including shoring up on-site supervision, enhancing
liquidity and credit risk assessments, and stepping up the Early Warning System. Directors
cautioned that the planned exit from troubled banks should ensure that transactions are
market-based and transparent to bolster the stability of the banking system as a whole and to
avoid the emergence of new risks.

Directors welcomed the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s (NBK) enhanced regulation of
banking system liquidity. They urged the authorities to follow through on their plan to
introduce a new policy interest rate that signals better the stance of policy. Directors also
stressed that, to anchor expectations about policy intentions and operations, the NBK should
communicate more openly and clearly the transition plans to active open market operations
(OMOs) and more generally elaborate on the factors guiding the interest rate decisions in its
public communications. In addition, they encouraged close collaboration between the NBK
and the Ministry of Finance to secure increased financial institutions’ participation in the
market for government paper, which would support active OMOs as a cornerstone of the
revamped monetary policy framework. Directors added that there is also scope to re-evaluate
the role of the exchange rate and how it fits within the broader monetary policy framework,
with a view to allowing for greater flexibility over the medium term.
Directors stressed that lowering the non-oil deficit over the medium term is a key priority,
which necessitates a credible fiscal consolidation strategy. In this context, they noted that the
consolidation plans outlined in the current medium-term fiscal framework will need to be
consistent with announced (but non-budgeted) large scale public spending plans related to the
government’s development and diversification programs. Furthermore, the assumptions
underlying both expenditure and revenue projections need to be fully aligned with a
macroeconomic framework that takes into account the effects of envisioned fiscal measures.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to revamp the medium-term fiscal framework, and
noted that this required improved coverage and transparency. The authorities should integrate
fully the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) with fiscal accounts and use
consolidated budget balances to guide fiscal policy. Further, there is a need for improved
transparency of quasi-fiscal operations, including those related to the government’s
development and diversification programs. In this regard, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to monitor more closely the external debt of the broader public sector.
Directors also cautioned that the unification of the private pension funds must avoid
exacerbating fiscal risks and undermining earlier reform efforts. In particular, the authorities
should adhere to their intention to adopt a clear and sound market-based investment strategy
for the assets, while ensuring that individual accounts are maintained.
Directors urged further action to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil. In particular, they
noted that successful diversification promoting broad-based and private-sector led growth
requires bolstering human capital, the business environment, and institutions. Directors also
highlighted the importance of carrying out critical public investment in line with absorptive
capacity and high standards of efficiency and oversight.
