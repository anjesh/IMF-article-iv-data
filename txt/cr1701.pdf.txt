IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review under the Policy Support Instrument
(PSI) for Senegal and Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third review
of Senegal’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI)1 approved on June 24, 2015 (see Press Release No. 15/297). The Board also
concluded the 2016 Article IV Consultation2 with Senegal. The Board’s decision was taken
on a lapse of time basis.3
Senegal’s macroeconomic situation is stable. Growth is expected to exceed 6 percent in
2016, while inflation remains low. The fiscal deficit has been declining steadily from
5.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and is projected to reach 4.2 percent of GDP in 2016. The
current account deficit has narrowed and is projected to reach 6.5 percent of GDP in 2016,
driven by lower oil prices and improved export performance.
Program performance through September 2016 has been satisfactory. All end-June 2016
assessment criteria and indicative targets were met, except for the indicative target on tax
revenue which was missed by a very narrow margin due to lower-than projected customs
revenue. Of the five structural benchmarks (SBs) set for the period from June to October
2016, three were met. Of the other two SBs, one has been implemented and the other on the
reorganization of the tax office will be postponed as part of a wider reform.

The PSI is an instrument of the IMF designed for countries that may not need, or want, IMF financial
assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of their policies. The PSI helps countries
design effective economic programs that, once approved by the IMF's Executive Board, signal to donors,
multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund's endorsement of a member's policies (see
http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/psi.htm).
2

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
3

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

In completing the third review of Senegal’s economic performance under the program
supported by the PSI and concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Senegal,
Executive Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Implementation of the first set of PSE projects has helped move Senegal to a higher growth
path, but sustaining this growth over the medium term requires steadfast implementation of
reforms that would enable SMEs to thrive and attract FDI for globally competitive
production. Continued efforts to increase the competitiveness of the private sector, including
through making tax collection more transparent, lowering electricity costs and improving
service distribution, and creating an environment where SMEs and FDI can contribute to
broad-based growth, will allow the private sector to take the reins of growth over the medium
term. Staff welcomes efforts to revamp the rules for the SEZ, drawing on the experience of
China and Mauritius, and with input from organizations representing the investors from
China, Europe and the US. It will be important, however, for the SEZ to move away from tax
holidays and to have a transparent, rules-based tax regime that is easy to comply with and has
reasonable rates.
The authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic stability. Efforts to increase
revenue collection and rationalize public consumption have helped control budget deficits.
However, these efforts need to be pursued with further vigilance, particularly with respect to
the wage bill, a more transparent and fairer public sector wage remuneration system and a
more equitable and efficient collection of taxes, where tax expenditures are significantly
reduced. Reforms to ensure everyone pays their fair share of taxes in a transparent system,
should make it possible to raise more revenue, whilst removing tax disincentives facing
SMEs and FDI in globally competitive activities. The use of comfort letters to encourage
bank financing of projects in advance of budget appropriations can undercut fiscal discipline
and create contingent liabilities, and should be kept to the absolute minimum.
The financial sector should play a stronger role in supporting private-sector led growth.
Financial indicators are improving, but from a low level. Regional supervision should be
strengthened, including with a view to further reducing non-performing loans. Domestic
reforms are needed to improve incentives for extending credit.
Senegal remains at low risk of debt distress, but debt levels are rising. Increased nonconcessional borrowing, including on the regional market, has raised the debt service burden
on the budget. Maintaining its low risk of debt distress is predicated on sustaining the high
levels of growth envisaged under the PSE while adhering to the planned fiscal consolidation
path, which will require rapid progress in fostering private investment. Better selection,
evaluation and monitoring of investment projects to ensure a strong economic return and
accessing concessional and semi-concessional borrowing whenever possible as part of a
comprehensive debt management strategy will contribute to keeping debt on a sustainable
path while ensuring efficient implementation of the public investment program envisaged
under the PSE. Moreover, there is an urgent need to strengthen Treasury operations that are
under pressure from legacy arrears and financial difficulties of the postal system. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to take stock of the pressures on the Treasury by
conducting an audit by end-March 2017 and formulate an action plan as soon as possible.

3

The outlook for the Senegalese economy is positive and risks are manageable, provided there
is a concerted effort to continue improving economic governance. PSE success depends on
rapidly implementing the critical mass of reforms which have been identified, including from
the peer learning catalyzed by the Fund. An explicit review of the political economy of
reforms should facilitate implementation of these reforms. However, risks, mainly domestic,
relate to the entrenched rent seeking and patronage that may hinder opening up economic
space and ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of taxes in a transparent system.
Failure to overcome these lobbies for the status quo would, as has happened four times since
1990, result in the current growth momentum being lost. External risks include possible
increases in the cost of public borrowing and slow growth in key partner countries. Security
risks in the region could also adversely affect investment and, hence, growth and exports.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Article IV issues. Implementation of the “Plan Sénégal Emergent” (PSE) is beginning to
pay dividends, contributing to projected growth of over 6 percent for the second year in
a row. However, for growth to be sustained, further reforms are needed to improve the
business environment and create economic space for private domestic and foreign
investment. The challenge of meeting infrastructure development objectives without
undermining debt sustainability will require continuing efforts to improve the quality of
investment while pursuing a prudent debt strategy that keeps the cost of borrowing at
reasonable rates. Failure to strengthen debt management and master treasury
operations may jeopardize the rating of low risk of debt distress.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation remains on track to achieve the 3 percent of GDP
WAEMU target. Continued efforts to increase revenues and rationalize public
consumption, including by containing the wage bill, will support consolidation while
protecting public investment in human and physical capital. Reforms to improve public
financial management such as the precautionary reserve envelope, investment project
bank, debt anchor and medium-term fiscal framework will improve expenditure
efficiency while supporting sustainability.
Structural reforms. Unlocking private investment through FDI and SMEs requires
reforms to facilitate broad-based growth of credit to the private sector, reduce costs and
improve service provision in the electricity sector, strengthen the business climate,
including through the creation of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), and improve public
sector governance.
Program implementation. Performance under the PSI-supported program has been
satisfactory, with all end-June 2016 assessment criteria and indicative targets met, except
for the indicative target on tax revenues which was missed by a very narrow margin due
to lower-than-projected customs revenues. Of the five structural benchmarks (SBs) set
for the period from June to October 2016, three were met. Of the two unmet SBs, one
was implemented with delay.
Staff recommends completion of the third PSI review.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Political and Economic Context
1.
The authorities are looking to break from the status quo of the last three decades
which saw relative stability accompanied by unambitious annual GDP per capita growth of
½ percent. Public investment and efforts to support agriculture have contributed to an increase in
GDP growth. However, the PSE requires growth to be sustained in the 7-8 percent range over
20 years if Senegal is to achieve emerging market status by 2035.1 This in turn requires decisive
action to improve economic governance. Given that Presidential elections will take place in 2019
there is room to speed up required reforms. To overcome potential policy paralysis and push
forward with reforms, efforts are needed to enable a coalition for change to tackle obstacles from
vested interests.
2.
For the growth uptick to be sustained, economic space has to be opened up for SMEs
and foreign private investment. Senegal has experienced several episodes of increased growth
over the past three decades, but none have been sustained because they were largely public sector
driven. While the PSE calls for important public investment projects to crowd in private investment,
it also calls for fundamental reforms that will enable Senegal to be a globally competitive hub.
Progress is needed on reforms to strengthen fiscal institutions, including by making paying taxes
easy to comply with and improving the quality of public investment. Continued public and private
sector investment in the electricity sector to diversify sources, reduce costs and improve distribution
and reliability will address an important impediment to doing business in Senegal. Further efforts
are needed to facilitate credit to SMEs, including by creating an environment where credit bureaus
have access to sufficient data and collateral can play its proper role in credit creation. Steadfast
implementation of policies and reforms contained in the PSE would provide the structural change
needed to sustain the current growth momentum over the medium term.
3.
The authorities are using peer learning to develop and implement reforms.
Implementing the PSE requires navigating the political economy of reform to overcome the rent
seeking and patronage that has held back inclusive growth over the last few decades. Success is
more likely if a reform strategy draws on international experience from peers and experts. In this
spirit, over the last two years, the IMF has complemented traditional technical assistance (TA) by
acting as a catalyst for Senegal to work with peers from African countries that have successfully
negotiated the political economy of reforms to exit low-income status, namely Cabo Verde,
Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles. The focus of this dialogue has been on how to implement reform
(Box 1). This peer learning is beginning to bear operational fruit that could facilitate implementation
1 To reach upper-middle income status in 20 years, Senegal would need to quadruple its current US$1000 per capita.
To achieve this goal, a 7 percent average annual GDP growth rate combined with no more than 3 percent in
population growth would be needed. However, it should be noted that in the World Bank’s income classification, the
lower bound for upper-middle income countries increased by about 30 percent between 1995 and 2015. This means
that Senegal’s current US$1000 GNI per capita may need to reach about US$5320 in 2035 to reach upper-middle
income status, implying that GDP growth rates higher than 7 percent may be required.

of key reforms, particularly by transforming the rules of the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to make
them appealing to SMEs and FDI.
Box 1. Peer Learning to Promote Reform
Brainstorming with Senegal on how best to support their reform effort
In December 2014, ahead of discussions on a new three-year PSI, the IMF Senegal team facilitated a
brainstorming between Senegalese officials, peers from Cabo Verde, Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles, and
World Bank and Fund experts. The objective was to help develop a roadmap to implement reforms that the
Senegalese had formulated prior to the conference. Fund staff acted as facilitators and note takers for a
conversation between those who will need to implement reform, peers who have gone through similar
challenges, and experts from the Fund and the World Bank who offered insights from international best
practice. Key topics covered included how to (i) raise revenue and increase the efficiency of public
expenditure and human capital; (ii) improve the business climate; and (iii) achieve the growth objectives, as
envisaged in the PSE.
Book Sprint
In January 2016, Fund staff organized a “book sprint”1 in Washington, DC, for Senegalese authorities, with
support from the European Union and participation of peers from Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles, and
World Bank experts. The resulting book (expected to be published in early 2017) draws on policy lessons
from successful countries that have managed to overcome some of the political economy constraints to
reforms, on the path to graduating to middle-income emerging economy status. The areas covered by the
book include (i) creating a sound, balanced and efficient fiscal framework through new revenue raising
measures, expenditure rationalization and more efficient public investment; (ii) relieving constraints to doing
business and promoting private investment, including FDI; (iii) promoting an inclusive and deeper financial
sector; and (iv) achieving high, sustained, and inclusive growth. As many low-income countries in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) face similar challenges in their aspiration to move to middle-income status, this
book has broader relevance for the region. In finalizing the book additional input is being sought from
academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) and from the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches sur le
Développement International (CERDI).
Operational Outcomes from the Peer Learning
In March 2016, the Prime Minister of Senegal chaired a seminar with key Ministers to build consensus on the
reforms proposed in the book sprint (Annex 2). A working group has now been set up to develop proposals
on how to tackle the political economy to facilitate eleven reforms. Assistance is being sought from the
European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM), LSE and CERDI to support the analysis of
the working groups. Proposals are expected in mid-2017 for inclusion in the 2018 budget. This effort could
increase the impact of budget support from development partners by deploying resources to explicitly build
the necessary coalitions for reform to prevail.
South-South collaboration
Peer learning is also starting to bear fruit in South-South collaboration. Following the peer learning events,
the Senegalese authorities visited Mauritius to learn about developing tourism and improving the
governance of SEZs. The governments of the two countries subsequently signed a memorandum of
understanding and further visits to both Senegal and Mauritius ensued. Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 1. Peer Learning to Promote Reform (concluded)

of Mauritius visited Dakar to take the collaboration to more practical action. Mauritius will assist Senegal in
developing its tourism industry (Annex 1) and to jointly manage a SEZ as a space of good economic
governance that will provide space to SMEs and FDI for globally competitive production. In counterpart,
Senegal will assist Mauritius with culture-related projects, particularly the setting up of a Museum to
remember slavery.
Going Forward
To continue supporting reform implementation in Senegal, the IMF will work with the Senegalese authorities
to ensure that IMF TA, including peer learning, is aligned with their priorities. These include (i) ensuring the
new rules for the SEZ include a tax system that has reasonable rates and is transparent and easy to comply;
(ii) improving project management; (iii) better managing fiscal risks from public-private partnerships (PPPs);
(iv) fully implementing the single treasury account; (v) enhancing tax administration; (vi) rebasing of national
accounts; and (vii) adopting the special data dissemination standards (SDDS). In this context, Fund staff will
continue working with authorities to seek guidance from peers and experts from the IMF and other
institutions on how best to implement improvements within prevailing political economy constraints.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth continues to increase towards the PSE objective, while inflation remains low.
Growth is projected to stay above 6 percent in 2016, with contributions from agriculture, natural
resources, services and PSE project implementation.
Growth will remain strong in the primary sector
thanks to good weather, improved irrigation and
government efforts to enhance the quality of seeds.
Phosphate, oil refining and associated transportation
services are also expected to support strong growth.
In addition, continued PSE-related public investment
to boost further agricultural productivity, improve
infrastructure and lower energy costs is expected to allow growth to increase above 7 percent over
the medium term, assuming it is accompanied by reforms to open space for SMEs and FDI geared to
globally competitive production. Credit to the private sector has accelerated moderately at
8.1 percent over the past 12 months through August 2016.

declining steadily from a recent high of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and is projected to reach
4.2 percent of GDP in 2016. This has been achieved by increasing revenues and rationalizing public
consumption, while creating space for further investment in human capital and public

infrastructure. In the first half of 2016, tax revenues were just short of the indicative target, by
0.02 percent of GDP, due to lower-than-projected customs revenues. Nonetheless, the deficit target

Senegal’s external sector remains stable, with comfortable WAEMU reserves at just
under 4½ months of imports, providing a buffer against shocks. The current account deficit has
narrowed and is projected to reach 6.5 percent of GDP in 2016, driven by lower oil prices and
improved export performance. In the short run,
agricultural and natural resource exports may be more
than offset by higher investment-related imports,
widening the trade deficit, but a stronger business
environment should boost the competitiveness of
export-focused firms. FDI levels remain low relative to
peers, underscoring the need for reforms to improve the business environment and attract investors.
The real effective exchange rate has depreciated about 4 percent over 2 years and remains broadly
in line with fundamentals.

The outlook remains broadly positive and risks to Senegal’s economy remain
manageable. Growth is projected to remain robust at 7 percent over the medium term. The primary
risks facing the economy are domestic. A failure to implement rapidly key reforms in the PSE would
result in a loss in growth momentum, returning Senegal to anemic per capita GDP growth and
putting pressure on debt sustainability. External risks include possible increases in the cost of public
borrowing and slow growth in key partner countries. Security risks in the region could also adversely
affect investment and, hence, growth and exports.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions centered on policies to sustain high growth and meet development
objectives without undermining stability. Accordingly, discussions focused on policies and
reforms to: (i) create fiscal space and improve the quality of investment; (ii) strengthen budget
implementation in the context of a medium-term framework; (iii) improve external competitiveness

and maintain debt sustainability; and (iv) open up space for SMEs and foreign investment. The
authorities broadly implemented most staff recommendations from the 2014 Article IV2 (Annex III).

A. Fiscal Policy: Promoting Growth and Preserving Stability
Fiscal policy for the near term
9.
Discussions focused on economic policies and structural reforms needed to meet
growth and development objectives, while making further progress on fiscal consolidation
and preserving debt sustainability. As the PSE calls for more fiscal space to finance public
investment in both physical and human capital and poverty-related spending, staff discussed with
the authorities the need for steadfast action in the following areas: (a) curtailing public consumption
and improving investment quality, while strengthening revenue collection and expanding the tax
base; and (b) strengthening public financial management (PFM) and governance.
10.
The authorities are committed to achieving the fiscal deficit of CFAF 372 billion
(4.2 percent of GDP) as programmed under the PSI. Although the end-June tax revenue
indicative target was narrowly missed by 0.02 percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit target was met. The
weak performance of customs revenue was offset by strong performance in other revenue
categories, including non-tax revenues.3 The outturn for July and August shows improvement in
Customs revenue collection, boding well for the end-year revenue indicative target. Slow execution
of capital spending also contributed to an overall underspending of 0.2 percent of GDP relative to
budget projections for the first half of the year. Further efforts on customs revenue collection will be
essential to meet the end-December revenue and budget deficit targets. A new structural
benchmark pertaining to the collection of 50 percent of the remaining stock of unpaid taxes
(arrears) by the end of this year has been introduced as a revenue raising measure.
11.
While public wage spending was in line with projections, the slow execution of capital
spending raises concerns about PSE implementation. Both wages and salaries and other current
spending were around the 50 percent execution rate, in line with the budget’s mid-year objective.
The under-execution of capital expenditures was mainly attributable to capital expenditure financed
and executed by the state, as the execution rate of capital expenditures financed by external
resources was also satisfactory at about 53 percent. Disbursements for projects under budgetary
grants were executed as planned while those associated with capital grants remained one-third less
than projected.

The weak performance of customs in the first half of 2016 was offset by strong performance in domestic tax and
non-tax revenues. The Direction Générale des Douanes (DGD) fell 27bn CFAF short of their 271bn CFAF objective.
The difficulties experienced by customs administration have been offset by the Direction Générale des Impôts et
Domaines (DGID) which collected 9 percent more than the end-June objective of 603bn CFAF (representing an
over-performance of 55 billion). An additional offset came from the exceptional performance of non-tax revenues
(+100bn CFAF from SONATEL 4G license and +40bn CFAF of swap-related revenues) which were included in the
Supplementary Budget approved on July 5.

Fiscal policy for the medium term
12.
The target for the 2017 budget deficit remains at CFAF 349 billion (3.7 percent of
GDP, MEFP ¶9), with continued consolidation planned over the medium term to reach the
WAEMU deficit convergence criteria of 3 percent. (Figure 1). The draft 2017 finance law
envisages further improvements in revenue collection and streamlined public consumption. Public
investment in both human and physical capital will increase in quality and quantity, consistent with
PSE objectives. Improvements in PFM and governance will support these fiscal consolidation efforts
in 2017 and beyond. Adhering to the 3 percent of GDP fiscal anchor called for by the WAEMU and
the PSE over the medium term is essential for debt sustainability.
13.
Revenue collection should continue to improve in 2017 and beyond (MEFP ¶10-15).
The control of the tax base will be strengthened and overall revenue collection optimized. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ decision to review tax exemptions. Steps will be taken in 2017 to
rationalize tax expenditures, based on the 2013 report on tax expenditures and the conclusions of
the working group established for this purpose, an action plan was adopted by the government in
October. The authorities will continue to modernize customs administration and operationalize
procedures for recovery of arrears, while introducing case management units within each recovery
unit. In addition, the operationalization of the single taxpayer identification number (NINEA)
platform through the interconnection between the DGID and the DGD, will help broaden the tax
base through better control over imports and better monitoring of the customs clearance of
potentially revenue-yielding products. Specific revenue-raising measures in the 2017 budget will
include finalizing the business tax reform, increasing the threshold on the Comprehensive Property
Tax, reducing tax exemptions for large taxpayers, limiting the tax credit for dependents, increasing
the tax on cement, introducing an export tax on peanuts and moving revenues collected for the
Fonds de Soutien à l’Energie (FSE) to the budget. On land reform, the land register identification
number (numéro d'identification cadastrale—NICAD) is operational and the management of state
rental fees automated. The digitization of the land register is expected before the end of 2017.
14.
Streamlining expenditure and curtailing public consumption are important for
continued fiscal consolidation over the medium term (MEFP ¶16). The wage bill should continue
to be contained and subsidies better targeted. On the wage bill, the authorities are committed to
imposing budget constraints on hiring frontline staff in security and defense and ensuring that all
current contractuals in the education, health, and vocational training (totaling 40,000) will be
gradually integrated into the payroll. The authorities are committed to improving the management
of subsidies based on the recommendations of the working group finalized in September of this
year. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to reduce subsidies to 0.5 percent of GDP in the 2017
budget. These subsidies will be limited to improving productivity in the agriculture sector through
high quality seeds, better irrigation and increased mechanization, and the authorities committed to
withhold subsidies to enterprises such as SENELEC (the state-owned electricity company), Société
Africaine de Raffinage (SAR, the oil refinery), and SONACOS (cooking oil mill).

Box 2. Domestic Revenue Mobilization: Achievements and Next Steps
Pursuing ongoing efforts to further mobilize government revenue (which includes both
improvements in tax policy and tax administration) is a critical objective, which falls within the spirit of the PSE,
that has been supported by intensive TA by the Fund. Reforms in recent years have aimed to increase tax
revenue in line with both WAEMU convergence criteria (20 percent of GDP) and the needs of the PSE, from
about 18 percent of GDP in 2012 to 21 percent of GDP over the medium term. TA in the tax area to date has
achieved an increase in revenues to about 20 percent of GDP. Efforts to reach the target have been also
combined with support to make the system easier to comply with and fairer, by limiting exemptions and
reducing tax expenditures, as well as minimizing the use of discretion.
Improving domestic revenue mobilization has been associated with strengthening local capacity. For
example, building on the authorities’ independent efforts to estimate tax expenditures, TA missions have
teamed with tax officials to estimate the revenue losses from alternative policy options. This work led to the
December 2012 tax reform. Pending issues from this reform - highlighted by two recent TA missions—are to
be addressed in a forthcoming round of reforms in which the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and the
authorities have agreed to share the analytical burden. All non-implemented TA recommendations from past
missions have been “re-activated” under a shared work plan (telecoms and financial sector taxation, Droit de
Timbre, Droit d’Enregistrement). Some have already been studied by the authorities for inclusion in the 2017
budget, notably the taxation on rental income and the simplification of the business tax. Going forward, it is
necessary to further expand the set of estimated tax expenditures and the revenue impact of removing them.
Data gathering and analytical efforts also need to become more focused, systematic and routine. These
analyses should be geared towards overcoming existing policy challenges: i) operationalization of the VAT
credit refund system; ii) improvement of research capacity to feed the audit and risk processes; iii)
development of capacity in the simulation of natural resource sector models.
In terms of tax administration, the Senegalese authorities have benefited from Fund TA to help them
address core weaknesses. These included a weak headquarters function, counter-productive pay incentives for
tax collectors, an outmoded and fragmented organizational structure, complex and paper-based core
processes, insufficient automation, and ineffective audit and enforcement. The main emphasis has been to
modernize the organizational structure, improve and simplify procedures, develop a compliance enforcement
program, and ensure robust IT support. Thus far, reforms’ major achievements include the effective
organization of head offices and regional directorates; a full-fledged large taxpayer unit and medium-sized
taxpayer office; the introduction of electronic return filing procedures; and the adoption of risk-based
approaches to compliance management. That said, progress on a number of fronts has been slow, in
particular: i) implementing the new organizational structure; ii) expanding e-filing and e-payment procedures;
iii) strengthening the exchange of information between the tax and customs administrations; iv) deploying
enforcement actions to collect assessed taxes; v) expanding the number and coverage of audit and
intelligence activities; vi) transferring full collection responsibility from the Treasury to the tax department.
Going forward attention should be given to (i) improving governance with a more transparent, fairer and
effective system of remuneration and greater reliance on IT for taxes payments; (ii) decentralizing decision
making; (iii) addressing procedural and management bottlenecks.
The area where results have been weakest is customs administration. TA has focused on
strengthening the monitoring of exemptions, valuation and transit of goods. While Customs has made good
progress with IT developments, their impact on customs operations has been limited because of insufficient
re-engineering of business processes and internal resistance to change. The taxpayer identification number
(NINEA) is now in use for customs operations and import/export data is provided to the tax administration,
but there is scope for better exchange of information to further improve compliance. Going forward, the
planned upgrade of the customs’ IT system should be combined with the implementation of a streamlined
and fully automated clearance procedure, removal of duplicate manual steps, and a revised structure of
customs offices. Moreover, a deeper cooperation between the tax and customs administrations is necessary,
which requires interfaced IT systems and a Memorandum of Understanding between the two.

15.
The improvement of the quality and quantity of public investment projects should
continue in 2017 and beyond (MEFP ¶17). Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to develop
a bank of projects which will include investment projects readily available for implementation that
have undergone feasibility studies, and the use of technological advances to improve the overall
planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of projects. This should speed up the
implementation of public investment projects and improve their efficiency, while enhancing
transparency
16.
Treasury cash management should continue to be strengthened (MEFP ¶19-21). Work
is progressing to modernize Treasury operations and the objective to introduce the Treasury Single
Account (TSA) by end-2017 remains within reach. However, cash management challenges remain,
exacerbated by the surfacing of legacy arrears and the financial difficulties faced by the postal
system, which has resort to government financing through an overdraft with the Treasury. To
address these issues, the authorities plan to conduct an audit of Treasury operations by end-March
2017 (structural benchmark) to comprehensively assess the situation before developing an
appropriate action plan.
17.
Staff raised concerns regarding the issuance by the Ministry of Finance of comfort
letters. The letters are aimed at encouraging financial institutions to provide advances for projects
for which a spending appropriation is expected in a future budget law. While not a de jure
guarantee, there is a risk that they become de facto debt guarantees that pre-commit fiscal
resources. The authorities agreed with the staff’s view and committed to limit such letters to
settlement of payments related to the agricultural sector (subsidy of agricultural inputs and
equipment) and to defense and national security (MEFP ¶23).
18.
The two-year old Precautionary Reserve Envelope (PRE) has provided budgetary
flexibility (Box 3). The PRE will continue in 2017, with an envelope set at 0.7 percent of GDP (or
CFAF 65.4 billion) in the 2017 budget. Of this, 0.4 percent of GDP (CFAF 42 billion) is for investment
and 0.3 percent of GDP (CFAF 23.4 billion) for current operations.

B. Improving Competitiveness and Preserving External Stability
19.
The current account narrowed by 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015, stabilizing at 7.4 percent
of GDP, and is projected to improve further in 2016. Senegal’s current account deficit as a
percent of GDP has declined by 3.3 percentage points to 7.4 percent from its recent high of
10.8 percent in 2012; it is expected to decline further to 6.5 percent in 2016. The key reasons for the
improvement in the external sector are strong export performance and lower oil prices. Export
volumes increased in the last three years (2013-15) by an average of 11½ percent per year, a
dramatic improvement relative to the annual average of 2.3 percent in the preceding decade. The
recent acceleration in exports—which are projected to grow (in volume) at 8 percent per year over
the next five years—has been driven by chemicals (especially phosphates), food (especially peanuts)
and metals, which have benefitted from the export of new products, such as zircon. Lower oil prices
also supported a declining deficit (Box 4).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 3. Two Years of the Precautionary Reserve Envelope
The “Precautionary Reserve Envelope” (PRE), introduced in 2015, is a tool to promote PSE-related sectoral
reforms and provide incentives for ministries to improve efficiency, while implementing critical PSE projects.
More specifically, the PRE has the dual objective of using the envelope to adjust budget plans to meet
deficit targets and to improve the vetting and quality of (eligible) investment expenditure, by allowing the
Ministry of Finance to withhold financing for projects until cost-benefit analyses are carried out.
In 2015, the PRE—reported in the investment part of the 2015 Initial Budget Law—amounted to 0.5 percent
of GDP (or 53 billion CFAF) and focused solely on capital expenditure. At the end of 2015, 33 percent of the
envelope (or CFAF 17bn) was mobilized to fund priority investments that were sufficiently mature (examples
include, the Route des Niayes; supply of low-cost housing; integrated tourist zones; the Business Park; and
the feasibility studies for the high-speed regional rail network Dakar-Aéroport International Blaise Diagne).
After a first year in operation, the authorities expanded the PRE in 2016 to include current expenditure by
linking the disbursement of additional resources (in a competitive way) to progress with the implementation
of key structural reforms. This was done to secure an envelope that would profit line Ministries operating in
priority sectors (such as education, agriculture and foreign affairs) in return for the implementation of
innovative and productive reforms. Some of the additional spending (relative to the previous year’s budget)
is allocated to the PRE instead of being released to Ministries, once appropriated by the National Assembly.
The PRE in the 2016 budget amounts to 0.7 percent of GDP (or 63 billion CFAF), of which 0.2 percent of GDP
is current expenditure (18.6 billion CFAF), including in wages and salaries, goods and services, transfers and
other expenditure, and 0.5 percent of GDP is capital expenditure (44.4bn CFAF) including (8) projects defined
in the budget for which financing will not be released until acceptable feasibility studies have been
completed.
On current expenditures, the 18.6 billion CFAF was distributed as follows:
- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was allocated an amount of 650 million CFAF subject to the preparation of a
draft text to regulate the recruitment of local staff for embassies and consulates and conditioned on the
development of a rationalization strategy for the diplomatic card;
- The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment has an amount of 1.05 billion CFAF provided it comes up
with a strategy to rationalize farm inputs;
- The Ministry of Education was allocated an amount of 4.2 billion CFAF provided it conducts a census of the
number of teachers assigned to administrative duties;
- Ministry of Training, Learning and Crafts has an amount of 1.025 billion CFAF provided they develop a
strategy to limit teachers’ travel expenses;
- The Ministry of Higher Education and Research has an amount 5.75 billion CFAF conditioned on development
of an inventory of current state of teaching (including an inventory of both administrative and contractual
personnel), capping of the amount of bursaries and capping of recruitment (both in terms of staffing and
salaries).
- The Ministry of Local Governance, Development and Spatial Planning was allocated 6 billion CFAF if the
Agreement CADAK CAR and UCG would result in a better management of invoices.

For current expenditures in the PRE, as of end-June 2016, three Ministries (Foreign Affairs, Education and
Higher Education) have not benefited from the entire initial allocation for not having respected fully the initial
commitments. In terms of capital expenditure, at the end of June, only 11.4 percent of the corresponding PRE
envelope had been disbursed. This is a concern since it either represents poor execution of approved projects in
the first six months of the year or the fact that some of the investments listed in the bank of projects were not
properly subjected to technical and financial studies or cost-benefit analyses.

20.
Remittances remain a dependable and steady source of current account inflows, but
are expected to decline as a share of GDP. In 2015 remittances accounted for 12.3 percent of
GDP. Looking forward, remittances are projected to decrease to under 10 percent of GDP by 2021.
While lower remittance inflows as a percent of GDP would be partially offset by lower imports, this
trend could contribute to a widening of the current account deficit and create additional external
financing needs in the medium/long term, if export growth does not keep up with the current
projections. Thus, it will be critical for Senegal to further promote the development of a strong and
diversified external sector, as part of the PSE.
21.
Foreign direct investment is still low relative to Senegal’s potential, but is expected to
increase in line with PSE objectives. Foreign direct investment has been on a slight upward trend
in the past few years, with a small further increase to 2.4 percent of GDP projected in 2016 thanks to
new investment in the mining industry. Reforms to improve the business climate and
implementation of a SEZ with strong governance rules are expected to bring FDI to 4.2 percent of
GDP in 2021. While FDI-related imports will contribute to a slight deterioration of current account
starting in 2017, higher FDI-related exports will drive an improvement in the external position over
the medium term. The positive outlook for FDI could be further boosted by the recent offshore oil
and gas discoveries in the Senegalese-Mauritanian waters.

Box 4. Export Performance and Competitiveness
Senegal is a relatively diversified economy, both in terms of export products and partners: exports are
dominated by food products, gold, and some manufacturing (mostly cement and chemicals), and are largely
destined to Africa (mostly neighboring countries) and Europe. Export volumes have grown by 10 percent per
year, on average, over the period 2011-2015, a significant improvement compared to the first decade of the
2000s—during which export volumes were flat. Performance within the region has been strong with exports
concentrated in non-oil commodity exporters and driven by buoyant demand and high prices in these
countries. Recent years have also seen a change in export products in Senegal, with an increase of cement,
minerals (the production of zircon started in 2014) and food products, and a decrease of animal products,
consistent with a diversification involving more value addition.
Export market share increased especially rapidly in 2009 and 2011, but then partially contracted in 2013.1
However, the quality of goods produced—which is another key element characterizing external
competitiveness—is a source of concern, since export quality in Senegal is lower than in the average SSA
country and has not grown significantly.2 Therefore, there is room for quality upgrading, especially in
agriculture and food products, and recent policies aimed at supporting the development of horticulture
exports go in the right direction.
To further strengthen export performance, Senegal needs to address structural factors limiting investment
in export-focused sectors, including by improving the business environment and reducing regulatory costs
for exporters. For instance, the Global Competitiveness Index compiled by the World Economic Forum ranks
Senegal at 110 out of 140 economies, with significant gaps in infrastructure, market size, and in the
macroeconomic environment. Senegal ranks 147th (out of 190 economies) in the 2017 ease of doing
business index compiled by the World Bank, with a score that is close to the SSA average and lower than all
fast growing SSA countries (Mauritius and Rwanda are ranked, respectively, 49th and 56th). In particular,
Senegal scores poorly on the ease of paying taxes and getting electricity, and on the quality of trade and
transport infrastructure.
In terms of policy actions, the two priorities should be: 1) the improvement of the quality of the product
mix; and 2) the strengthening of the business environment to attract investors, making Senegal a regional
hub. The first target could be achieved through investment in human capital and improvement in
institutional quality. Moreover, the promotion of the SEZ with an emphasis on good governance and on
attracting FDI goes in this direction, and it will stimulate economic diversification. At the same time, there is
substantial scope for quality upgrading in the primary sector, which represents an important share of the
economy (14 percent of GDP). TO improve competitiveness and attract investors, reforms should be directed
at tackling infrastructure gaps and bottlenecks in energy supply, regulation logistics infrastructure, and tax
administration.

quality is measured by the export’s unit value adjusted for differences in production costs, relative distance

Box 5. Ten Years of Increasing Debt in Senegal
Senegal public debt has been increasing since 2006, after the HIPC and MDRI debt relief initiatives. As
a share of GDP, debt increased from 20.9 percent in 2006 to 45.3 percent in 2013, to further increase to
59.3 percent in 2016, a level higher than the one in 2003, pre-HIPC completion point (see chart). Commercial
debt (e.g. bank loans and Eurobonds) started in 2009 and reached 7.3 percent of GDP in 2015. While debt
levels are still below the relevant DSA thresholds, the adverse debt dynamics could signal future risks for
debt sustainability in the absence of corrective action.
Most of the recent increase of public debt is
driven by domestic borrowing. Domestic
debt almost doubled between 2011 and 2016,
while the share of concessional borrowing has
declined. This compositional shift implies an
increase in the average cost of borrowing, since
Treasury bills have been issued at around
5 percent in 2015 and bonds carried interest
rates higher than 6 percent, higher that the
average interest rate on foreign borrowing
over 2010 to 2015. In addition, the government
has been borrowing in domestic currencies
from other lenders, such as the West African
Development Bank (BOAD) at rates as high as 8.5 percent.
Plans to finance significant infrastructure projects relying on commercial external borrowing would
put further pressure on debt sustainability, raising debt service in the medium term. Debt service on
total public debt is expected to reach
Interest payments-to-revenue and grants ratio
25.4 percent of government revenues in 2016
(2006 to 2015)

and it is projected to be above 35 percent in

22.
To gain export market share and attract FDI, Senegal needs to make further progress
on structural reforms and on the provision of key infrastructure. The real effective exchange
rate has remained relatively steady the past few years, with some depreciation over the past two
years due to low inflation in Senegal, and remains broadly in line with fundamentals. Indeed,
Senegal’s inability to increase competitiveness is due largely to non-price issues (Box 4).4
23.
Public debt levels and borrowing costs are increasing, calling for a strengthening of
debt management. The ratio of public debt over GDP is estimated to reach 59.3 percent in 2016

but on a sharp rising trend, from 34.7 of GDP in 2010 (Box 5). The government has been increasing
their reliance on domestic borrowing, taking advantage of favorable conditions in the WAEMU
market to extend average debt maturity and limit borrowing costs. However, average conditions in
the regional markets are significantly more expensive than concessional and semi-concessional
borrowing. Moreover, even though external borrowing is mostly concessional from multilateral and
traditional bilateral donors, there has been an increasing reliance on other donors (i.e. China, India)
and on more expensive sources of external borrowing to finance PSE-related investment projects.
Given these trends, the authorities will need to ensure that the debt management strategy take into
consideration the three main risks to debt sustainability, namely (i) financing mix; (ii) Treasury
operations; and (iii) contingent liabilities. The authorities agreed that it was important to pursue a
prudent debt policy and outlined several measures to strengthen debt management (MEFP ¶24).
24.
Senegal remains at low risk of debt distress, but debt indicators are rising. Under the
baseline scenario, all debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds. Under the stress tests, the debt service to revenue ratio shows two breaches of the
threshold corresponding to the two Eurobond repayments (2021 and 2024). The temporary nature
of the breaches signals a liquidity rather than a solvency problem. However, under the historical
scenario debt ratios for debt stocks and flows are permanently above their respective thresholds,
raising concerns about debt sustainability in case the dividends of the PSE fail to materialize and the
authorities deviate from sound fiscal policies. Finally, public debt as a share of GDP is also below the
threshold, but debt service is absorbing a large and growing share of revenues. To preserve the low
risk of debt distress rating, the Senegalese authorities have committed to stabilize debt ratios,
strengthen debt management practices and limit non-concessional borrowing.

In the past year, lending concentration has fallen slightly,

long-term lending to large borrowers. The service,
commercial and industrial activities sectors have the

relatively slow growth, whereas agriculture and transport

Nonetheless, the authorities should continue to monitor potential NPL-related risks, given that NPL

SENEGAL

levels remain elevated and still high lending concentration could make the financial system
vulnerable to firm and sector-specific shocks. The authorities agreed that this will require further
progress in building operational capacity and enhancing banking supervision, including better
enforcement of prudential limits.5
26.
Senegal’s banking sector could play a stronger role as a financial intermediary to spur
private-sector led growth. Senegal’s financial sector is relatively well capitalized and consists of
27 institutions which provide credit to the economy, 23 of which are banks. Many banks have
significant foreign ownership, with only one bank having more than 25 percent government
ownership. However, banks find it difficult to assess risk of borrowers and are uncertain about their
ability to recover collateral in the event of default. To help promote lending to the private sector,
and SMEs in particular, the authorities created in 2013 three institutions to guarantee or provide
direct lending: Fonds de Garantie des Investissements Prioritaires (FONGIP), the Fonds Souverain
d’Investissements Stratégiques (FONSIS) and Banque Nationale pour le Développement Economique
(BNDE). While these institutions could support some growth in credit to SMEs, they will need to be
monitored to ensure that lending and guarantee decisions are made with proper risk evaluation.
More broadly, additional reforms will need to address the root factors which limit credit to the
private sector. In particular, improvements in the quality of documentation submitted by loan
applicants and more data on credit history would allow banks to convert more easily savings to
loans, especially to SMEs. Staff noted that requiring banks to provide credit history of applicants, as
was done in Côte d’Ivoire, and making it mandatory for applicants to register with the credit bureau
would help disseminate the information necessary for banks to properly assess lending risks.6

Energy Sector
27.
Electricity is an important impediment to private sector development. In the 2017
World Bank ease of doing business index, Senegal ranked 162 out of 190 countries on ease of
getting electricity. Moreover, energy costs are high, raising production costs and making it more
difficult for Senegalese firms to compete on international markets. The combination of lower global
oil prices and some efficiency gains in SENELEC, the public electricity company, resulted in no public
subsidies for 2016, which would remain the case for 2017 under current projections for oil prices.
28.
The authorities have taken steps to improve electricity production and distribution
and lower costs (MEFP ¶29-30). The government’s comprehensive strategy aims to (i) increase
production capacity, (ii) lower costs through diversifying sources of production and improving
governance and the regulatory framework, (iii) strengthen the distribution network, including
through rural electrification, and (iv) improve service provision and increase the use of renewable
5

These issues are being followed up in the regional WAEMU consultations (2016 WAEMU Selected Issues, IMF
Country Report No. 16/98).

Côte d’Ivoire adopted legislation establishing a credit bureau in early 2014. Initially, collection and distribution of all
credit information required prior consent of the borrower, creating obstacles to collecting data on credit history of
borrowers. To overcome this obstacle, the basic law (Article 53) was amended in early 2016 to remove the prior
consent requirement for loans before the law’s initial adoption in 2014. This has given banks access to the credit
history of a borrower and is expected to improve risk assessment of loan applicants.

sources. Progress has recently been made in all of these areas through both public and private
investment. In 2016, electricity supply is projected to increase by 280 MW, 14 percent of which will
be domestic solar energy production. Production will continue to increase in 2017, with renewable
energy sources making up over one-third of new production, with the long-term goal of making
20 percent of all energy production renewable. Private sector investment has helped increase the
household rate of electrification in rural areas to over 30 percent, although costs to consumers in
difficult to reach, largely poor rural areas is higher than in the cities. There are moves to equalize
electricity prices across the country through cross-subsidization.
29.
Oil and gas discovery off the Senegalese coast presents opportunities and challenges.
Initial estimates of the discovery suggest that oil and gas reserves could be significant, with
production coming on line as early as 2020-21 for gas and two years later for oil. Pending a
reputable international firm setting a date and production targets, however, production and
earnings from gas and oil have not yet been integrated into the macro-framework. While the
discovery has the potential to have a positive impact on the energy sector and the economy more
generally, strategic decisions from whether to build refining capacity to design and implementation
of the appropriate fiscal regime will be key to managing challenges associated with natural resource
discovery. It will also be important to manage expectations about natural resource incomes, given
that experience in a range of countries (e.g. Brazil, Ghana, São Tomé and Príncipe) shows that
expectations can run ahead of reality, setting the budget up for unaffordable commitments to raise
public wages and boost other spending programs. The authorities have requested TA from
development partners to address policy issues related to natural resources.

Business Environment
30.
Progress has been made in improving the business environment, but much work
remains to be done. Senegal was in the top ten reformers for two years in a row in the World Bank
Doing Business rankings for 2015 and 2016. Under the recent change in methodology introduced in
the Doing Business 2017 report, the 2016 ranking was revised to improve Senegal’s ranking from
153rd to 146th, with a loss of one place from this new base to 147th in 2017.7 This reflects faster
reform elsewhere as the index finds continued improvement in Senegal.8 The first phase of the
government’s comprehensive structural reform plan to improve the business environment
(Programme de réforme de l’environnement des affaires et de la compétitivité - PREAC I 2013-15)
implemented around 90 percent of the 56 measures envisioned. The PREAC II 2016-18 includes land
and judicial reform, legal measures to promote SMEs, revision of the investment code and simplified
tax administration, among other things. Nonetheless, Senegal’s business environment is still

7

The Doing Business 2017 report notes that the three-year update in methodology adds postfiling processes to the
paying taxes indicator and a gender component in three indicators, as well as a pilot indicator on selling to the
government. Somalia is added to the list of countries for the first time, increasing the total countries to 190,

The 2017 report notes that “Compared to previous years, there is a lower number of top improvers from
Sub-Saharan Africa even though this region accounts for over a quarter of all reforms globally.”

considered relatively poor and steadfast implementation of reforms is needed, especially as other
countries are moving steadily to improve their business climate. Its low level of FDI relative to peers
is evidence that, despite its stability and favorable geographical position in the region, it has been
unable to attract investment in line with its potential.
31.
Opening up economic space for domestic and private investment is necessary to
sustain economic growth over the medium term (MEFP ¶26). For SMEs and FDI to play a larger
role in the economy, obstacles created by entrenched interests which benefit from rent seeking and
patronage will need to be addressed (Annex 2). Accordingly, progress has been slow on structural
reforms to improve economic governance. In collaboration with the Government of Mauritius and in
partnership with the US Corporate Council on Africa (CCA), the Council of French Investors in Africa
(CIAN) and the China Africa Development Fund (CADF) the authorities are working on changing the
rules of SEZs to move from offering extended tax holidays to instead emphasize good governance
and ensure taxes are paid at a reasonable rate with ease of compliance (Box 6). These efforts,
combined with improved infrastructure, should encourage FDI and facilitate growth of credit to the
private sector.
Box 6. One Country, Two Systems: Towards an African Shenzhen
The Senegalese authorities are drawing on the ideas of Paul Romer and Paul Collier to change the rules for
SEZs and develop the area near Dakar named Diamniado into an African Shenzhen. To achieve this, they
have set up a joint venture with Mauritius which will contribute the “soft infrastructure” for a business
friendly regulatory framework that will be designed with input from the CCA, CIAN and the CADF. They will
also leverage on the Investment Promotion apparatus of Mauritius to market the SEZ. A joint appeal to US
and French investors is being planned for late-2016, once the regulatory framework has begun to be
clarified.
Currently, the authorities are giving high priority to pass legislation that would authorize a “High Authority”
to set up the economic governance for the SEZ through regulations and with the Minister of Finance
defining the appropriate fiscal framework. This work is being undertaken with input from the Government of
Mauritius, the CCA, CIAN and CADF to ensure that the framework appeals to investors.
In parallel, a team is being set up to rapidly find the developer for the SEZ to make Diamniado into an
African Shenzhen, which, as in China, would operate under different rules within the “One Country, Two
Systems” concept. To minimize fiscal risks and maximize incentives to rapidly find appropriate international
investors, the international developer would take all the commercial risk and, after 10 to 20 years, make a
lump sum payment to the joint venture company responsible for making the SEZ work. This approach means
that Senegal would not need to raise the funds to finance what would be the very expensive undertaking of
building a modern city attractive to foreign investors, high income professionals, SMEs and workers.

PROGRAM ISSUES
32.
Program performance under the PSI remains satisfactory. While three end-March
indicative targets (ITs) were missed, all end-June assessment criteria (AC) were met. All end-June ITs
were met except for the IT on tax revenues which was narrowly missed (by 0.02 percent of GDP)
because of lower than projected customs revenue. Structural reforms progressed broadly as
envisaged. Of the five structural benchmarks set for the period from June to October 2016, three
were met. Of the two unmet SBs, one was implemented with delay. The end-June benchmark on
extending the first-generation TSA to all bank accounts of the network of accounting agents of the
agencies and public institutions, the end-September benchmark on establishing a platform
(integrated projects bank) which describes the lifecycle of the projects and the end-October
benchmark on announcing a debt anchor in the 2017 budget were met. The end-September
benchmark on adopting an action plan for reducing tax expenditures was implemented with delay.
The end-September benchmark which was not implemented relates to the creation of a structure
(specialized office, division, etc.) responsible for recovering problem claims. The delay arises from
internal debate on whether this change should be part of a broader reorganization planned for next
year or could proceed earlier with the risk of further changes then being required. The authorities
plan to have the new structure in place, in either case, in early 2017. Further, the structural
benchmark on the development of a management strategy for government and public enterprise
investment portfolios, which was not met as envisaged by March 2016, has now also been
implemented with delay.
33.
Safeguards Assessment. The 2013 assessment of the WAEMU regional central bank,
BCEAO, found a continuing strong control environment. All recommendations from the assessment
have been implemented. These include strengthening the external audit arrangements by
appointment of an international firm with ISA experience for the audits of FY 2015—17, reinforcing
the capacity of the audit committee with external expertise to oversee the audit and financial
reporting processes, and adoption of IFRS starting with the financial year 2015.
34.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. However,
there are still weaknesses in data on national accounts, social indicators and government finance
statistics. The authorities are working on addressing these issues, including by rebasing GDP from
the existing 1999 base year to 2014. The move to GFSM 2001/14 is encouraging, but more work
needs to be done to present the data in this format in the budget and to report fiscal data for the
broader public sector. With the support of TA from development partners, including the IMF, the
authorities are making good progress towards adhering to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) which is expected to be achieved by end-June 2017 (Box 7).

20

SENEGAL

Box 7. Senegal’s Subscription to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
Senegal joined the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) on September 10, 2001. Most of the GDDS
metadata were updated in 2009. The Senegalese authorities intend to subscribe to the SDDS by end-June
2017. This would make Senegal the fourth SSA country to subscribe to the SDDS after South Africa,
Mauritius, and Seychelles. A recent Fund TA mission concluded that the objective is feasible, given the
current situation of the statistical system and the determination shown by the authorities.
In terms of data dissemination practices compared to SDDS requirements, out of the 22 data categories
prescribed for the SDDS:






Senegal disseminates 10 data categories according to the requirements of the SDDS (GDP, production
index, CPI and PPI, central government operations, interest rates, stock market, merchandise trade,
exchange rates, and population),
Senegal produces nine data categories which are not yet disseminated in conformity with the SDDS
(employment, unemployment, wages, central government debt, depository corporations survey, central
bank survey, balance of payments, official reserve assets, and international investment position), and
Three data categories are not produced (general government operations, reserve data template, and
external debt).

Progress has been made toward reaching the objective of subscribing to the SDDS. On August 31st, 2016,
the National Statistics Agency, ANSD, published the National Summary Data Page where about 19 out of the
22 data categories prescribed for the SDDS are currently published (2014-2015) some of which with limited
coverage. More work is needed on the following data categories: General Government Operations, External
Debt, Reserve template, quarterly nominal GDP, quarterly balance of payment, and quarterly employment
and unemployment. The authorities are confident that most, if not all, of the data categories will be available
for dissemination based on SDDS requirements by the end of 2016, in time for the process of subscription to
begin.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Implementation of the first set of PSE projects has helped move Senegal to a higher
growth path, but sustaining this growth over the medium term requires steadfast
implementation of reforms that would enable SMEs to thrive and attract FDI for globally
competitive production. Continued efforts to increase the competitiveness of the private sector,
including through making tax collection more transparent, lowering electricity costs and improving
service distribution, and creating an environment where SMEs and FDI can contribute to broadbased growth, will allow the private sector to take the reins of growth over the medium term. Staff
welcomes efforts to revamp the rules for the SEZ, drawing on the experience of China and Mauritius,
and with input from organizations representing the investors from China, Europe and the US. It will
be important, however, for the SEZ to move away from tax holidays and to have a transparent,
rules-based tax regime that is easy to comply with and has reasonable rates.
36.
The authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic stability. Efforts to
increase revenue collection and rationalize public consumption have helped control budget deficits.
However, these efforts need to be pursued with further vigilance, particularly with respect to the
wage bill, a more transparent and fairer public sector wage remuneration system and a more

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SENEGAL

equitable and efficient collection of taxes, where tax expenditures are significantly reduced. Reforms
to ensure everyone pays their fair share of taxes in a transparent system, should make it possible to
raise more revenue, whilst removing tax disincentives facing SMEs and FDI in globally competitive
activities. The use of comfort letters to encourage bank financing of projects in advance of budget
appropriations can undercut fiscal discipline and create contingent liabilities, and should be kept to
the absolute minimum.
37.
The financial sector should play a stronger role in supporting private-sector led
growth. Financial indicators are improving, but from a low level. Regional supervision should be
strengthened, including with a view to further reducing non-performing loans. Domestic reforms are
needed to improve incentives for extending credit.
38.
Senegal remains at low risk of debt distress, but debt levels are rising. Increased nonconcessional borrowing, including on the regional market, has raised the debt service burden on the
budget. Maintaining its low risk of debt distress is predicated on sustaining the high levels of growth
envisaged under the PSE while adhering to the planned fiscal consolidation path, which will require
rapid progress in fostering private investment. Better selection, evaluation and monitoring of
investment projects to ensure a strong economic return and accessing concessional and
semi-concessional borrowing whenever possible as part of a comprehensive debt management
strategy will contribute to keeping debt on a sustainable path while ensuring efficient
implementation of the public investment program envisaged under the PSE. Moreover, there is an
urgent need to strengthen Treasury operations that are under pressure from legacy arrears and
financial difficulties of the postal system. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to take stock of
the pressures on the Treasury by conducting an audit by end-March 2017 and formulate an action
plan as soon as possible.
39.
The outlook for the Senegalese economy is positive and risks are manageable,
provided there is a concerted effort to continue improving economic governance. PSE success
depends on rapidly implementing the critical mass of reforms which have been identified, including
from the peer learning catalyzed by the Fund. An explicit review of the political economy of reforms
should facilitate implementation of these reforms. However, risks, mainly domestic, relate to the
entrenched rent seeking and patronage that may hinder opening up economic space and ensuring
that everyone pays their fair share of taxes in a transparent system. Failure to overcome these
lobbies for the status quo would, as has happened four times since 1990, result in the current
growth momentum being lost. External risks include possible increases in the cost of public
borrowing and slow growth in key partner countries. Security risks in the region could also adversely
affect investment and, hence, growth and exports.

Staff recommends completion of the third PSI review. All end-June 2016 quantitative
assessment criteria and end-June indicative targets were met, with the exception of the indicative
target for tax revenue which was missed by a small margin.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months in
accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles Decision No. 14747- 10/96.

Annex I. Operationalizing Peer Learning in Tourism
1.
As an outcome of the peer learning facilitated by the Fund, the Mauritius Government has
proposed the following actions to tap the tourism potential of Senegal.
2.
A joint team will be set up to implement a project to upgrade the main tourist resort areas
of Saly and La Somone. The project would:


Set up a mechanism to generate community and stakeholder support and involvement for the
actions taken;



Clean up the area and put in place arrangements to keep this up;



Put in place public infrastructure to beautify the sites and make them accessible and attractive,
inter alia by putting in place pavements for pedestrians, planting palm and coconut trees and
improving access to key areas in the community which offer tourist facilities;



Reviewing the arrangements to combat erosion to achieve functionality whilst emphasizing
aesthetics;



Working with operators to facilitate their efforts to improve their hotel infrastructure and décor;



Upgrading training including the possibility of benefitting from scholarships from the
Government of Mauritius for study in Mauritius;



Exchange of expertise and close collaboration on technical matters; and



Setting up financing mechanisms that could be supported both by the development partners of
Senegal and also borne by tourists.

3.
In parallel, Mauritius would also assist to develop Pointe-Sarène, another resort area which
has huge potential if properly developed. Fully realizing the value of the site will require careful
planning and preparation which may take some time. In this context, a Senegalese delegation is
invited to visit Mauritius to see how Mauritius has handled similar developments. One of the lessons
Mauritius learnt is that the road should be as far removed as possible from the beach to maximize
the value of the area being developed. Moreover, there are large gains from integrating villa and
hotel development.

Annex II. Improving Economic Governance
1.
Growth in Senegal has been rising, but it has been driven largely by the public sector. For
growth to be sustained over the medium term, SMEs and FDI that aims at globally competitive
activity (as opposed to sharing rents) will have to take the reins. Reforms to improve the business
environment are needed to create wealth and break with the status quo so that individual initiative
can result in job and wealth creation and allow Senegal to achieve its full potential. Rent seeking and
patronage is one of the major culprits for the inability of SMEs to thrive and for the low level of FDI
in Senegal relative to its peers.
2.
Senegal is committed to undertake reforms to improve economic governance and some
progress has been made under the PSE. Governance reforms require consensus to overcome vested
interests. Success can only be achieved if there is a political commitment coupled with the
appropriate technical expertise. A reform program should be ambitious, but realistic. Accordingly, in
March 2016, the Prime Minister and key Ministers agreed on 11 reforms that are needed to spur
growth and stability in Senegal (see Box A1) and whose implementation is blocked by entrenched
interests that have proved hard to overcome. Working groups are being set up with the mandate to
explicit consider the political economy of these reforms and how to build coalitions that can
overcome current resistance to change.
3.
The 11 reforms and others under the PSE cover fiscal policy and public finance,
agriculture, oil and gas, electricity, the regulatory framework for business and the financial
sector. The reforms are needed to facilitate the emergence of SMEs while attracting productive FDI
and protecting fiscal revenues, strengthen PFM, preserve Senegal’s low risk of debt distress, improve
wage bill management while creating additional fiscal space, improve project management,
accelerate the development of private and financial sectors while safeguarding the stability of the
financial system, reduce poverty while promoting social inclusion, and facilitate PSE implementation
by strengthening public sector governance. Civil service reform is also needed to address incentive
problems which are incompatible with good governance and to allow an integration of agencies
back into the central administration whilst ensuring pay can be modulated to attracting and keeping
talent and scarce skills.
4.
In all these areas, greater transparency through improving the quality of data, more frequent
reporting and greater use of audits could be core elements of a broad strategy. Moreover, it is
important to move to a rules based approach with a minimum of discretion and transition to a
regime of ex-post verification rather than ex-ante authorization. In addition, judicial reform is
needed to ensure that contractual agreements are respected, ex-post verification is fair and that
cases are handled in an efficient and expeditious manner.

Box A1. The 11 Reforms
In March 2016, the Prime Minister and key Ministers agreed on 11 reforms to spur growth and stability in
Senegal and their implementation is blocked by entrenched interests that have proved hard to overcome.
They cover Special Economic Zones and industrial platforms, PFM, project management, financial sector,
agriculture, social inclusion and poverty reduction, and governance.
1. Encourage the emergence of economic spaces with their own governance and with a tax regime that
preserves the integrity of tax revenue;
2. Bring together the different structures responsible for planning, programming and financing of public
investments;
3. Strengthen and empower the Public Debt Directorate and the National Council for Public Debt to improve
debt management;
4. Implement a public sector remuneration medium-term strategy;
5. Strengthen the capacity of the line ministries' units in charge of studying; planning; and defining sectoral
strategies, project / program preparation and ex-ante evaluation;
6. Rehabilitate the function of selection of projects or investment programs and the compliance with the
validation process of projects lifecycle;
7. Establish commercial courts for a rapid resolution of disputes between economic actors;
8. Strengthen competition in the market for goods and services, particularly with regard to import of sugar;
9. Diversify social protection programs;
10. Adopt the Law designed to promote SMEs;
11. Enhance the predictability of decision-making

5.
Fiscal policy reform is required because tax expenditures are large and make the
system inequitable and uncompetitive. In the 2017 Doing Business Index WB report, Senegal
ranked 174 out of 190 in “paying taxes” which measures the administrative burden of paying taxes
and how much firms pay in taxes. The current system is particularly unattractive to SMEs and foreign
investors and does not provide the appropriate incentives for the informal sector to join the formal
sector, making it difficult for firms that wish to comply without favors to compete. While Senegal
recently facilitated tax payments by supplying tax forms and VAT declarations online and created a
Center for Medium Sized Enterprises, it has yet to activate or require that taxes be filed and paid
through e-filing and e-payment. This would not only improve efficiency, but would increase
transparency in tax collection. Restructuring pay incentives would also contribute to more effective
tax collection. The current incentive structure rewards tax collectors for collecting fines from
taxpayers for violations which introduces distortions. Restructuring salaries to increase base pay in
line with recent average total wages for tax collectors, while continuing some well-designed pay
incentives, could increase overall revenues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

SENEGAL

6.
In addition, the 6 to 7 percent of GDP of tax expenditures should be curtailed, given that
they are not well-targeted and undermine the revenue base necessary to finance the PSE. This
reform would reduce compliance costs, consistent with the objective of the 2013 tax reform to
simplify the tax system. This would be particularly beneficial for SMEs, especially if combined with
online filing and payment. Moreover, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of taxes at a
reasonable rate would set the stage for SMEs to emerge from the informal sector and create jobs as
they expand.
7.
Public Finance reform is needed to ensure value for money and improvement of
service delivery. The move to program based budgeting and the Precautionary Reserve Envelope
offer an opportunity to link additional spending to improved service delivery and meet demanding
(and increasing) social needs. At the same time the EU is supporting efforts to improve the quality of
management in the Ministry of Finance and this could be replicated more widely if successful. These
reforms should complement the move to strengthen PFM and improve control of the project cycle
and a better mastery of risk allocation in PPPs. Efficient selection, implementation and
monitoring of public investment projects is essential to crowd in private investment and boost
long-term growth, but the process needs to be transparent to ensure that there is no deadweight
loss and that (presently discounted) fiscal risks are being properly accounted for. Continued
implantation of the PRE and the creation of the investment project bank will be important steps, but
all procurement should be subject to a competitive and transparent bidding process, including
through the use of e-procurement. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) should be well managed to
ensure that they yield maximum value for the country without carrying fiscal contingent liabilities.
The move to GFSM 2001/14 has been encouraging, but public investment has not been properly
reported in the budget and may require some expenditures to be shifted to “transfers” of “goods
and services”. Greater use of auditing of SOEs and compilation and publication of consolidated
general government fiscal data could reduce fiscal risks and lay the foundations of SOE reform.
8.
Reforms in agriculture have begun, but need to be broadened and accelerated,
particularly in the groundnut sector which is the dominant activity. The proliferation of
subsidies creates opportunities for patronage and rent seeking and decreases resources needed for
infrastructure and development spending. Established rent seeking in the sale and distribution of
seeds and collection and processing of groundnuts are holding up moves to better targeted and
transparent subsidies. This is an area where work on the political economy of reform would be
particularly useful. Similar considerations apply to rolling back the quasi-monopoly on sugar. The
authorities recognize the need for progress on reducing subsidies and have formed a working group
which is expected to make policy recommendations in late 2016.
9.
Land reform is also held back by established clientelism and privileged access by elites. The
challenge is to find a tradeoff between the protection of small family farms and the promotion of
investment including in horticulture. Whilst this has been tackled on an ad hoc basis to allow
horticulture to become an emerging sector, realizing the full potential of Senegal needs more

decisive action around the work of the land reform commission. In addition to promoting
investment in modern agriculture, land reform could allow collateral to play its proper role in bank
lending.

Recent oil and gas discoveries off the coast of Senegal could boost energy supply and
provide positive benefits for public finances and GDP growth, but the tax regime will need to be
carefully designed to avoid potential pitfalls often seen with natural resource discoveries. In
particular, the fiscal regime for exploration and for taxation of the sector need to be repatriated to
the Ministry of Finance to ensure an effective accounting of income.
11.
The importance of tackling electricity availability and costs is highlighted by Senegal’s
rank of 162 out of 190 in “getting electricity” in the Doing Business Index. Some progress has
been made in increasing supply through greater private sector involvement in production and
distribution and accessing lower cost sources of energy, including the creation of two new
generation facilities. There has been a streamlining of the application review process for new

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

SENEGAL

electricity connections and excavation permits and a reduction of the amount needed for a security
deposit. However, electricity generation remains extremely costly and the rural electrification plan
has been implemented slowly. Moreover, the lack of transparency in the energy sector, including the
chain from oil imports to final pump distribution, makes it very difficult to estimate the government
budget implications of movements in oil prices. Reforms of SENELEC could provide greater
efficiency in distribution and reduce future government subsidies.
12.
Senegal ranks 133 in “getting credit” which is below the SSA average (this is the
ranking for all WAEMU countries). On a scale of 0-8 (8 being best), Senegal has a score of zero on
the sharing of credit information. Some action has been taken in this area through the creation of a
credit bureau in 2015 (operative since February 2016), but its effectiveness is likely to be impaired
for two reasons: 1) the disclosure is not compulsory (borrowers can refuse to sign a disclaimer to
allow its credit request to be shared), and 2) banks are not required to share information from
lending that is not recent. The lack of a comprehensive (and) historical information on the universe
of borrowers makes the credit bureau ineffective and makes it difficult for banks to assess credit risk.
The creation of public institutions to provide guarantees and direct lending to SMEs and others
(FONGIP, FONSIS and BNDE) suggests that progress on reforms is needed to facilitate credit to
SMEs. In addition, transparency of the balance sheet of these institutions is needed to ensure
financial sector stability.

Annex III. Authorities’ Response to the 2014 Article IV Policy
Recommendations
Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policies to address development needs while maintaining debt sustainability
1. Positive response. Fiscal consolidation is proceeding ahead of schedule, with the
authorities expected to reach the 3 percent deficit WAEMU criteria by 2018, one year earlier
than planned.

1. Bring the fiscal deficit in line with the
WAEMU target of 3 percent of GDP in the
medium-term.
2. Contain public consumption and increase
quantity and quality of public investment.

2. Positive response. There has been a good start which needs to be sustained. The wage
bill is monitored carefully to avoid overruns and a system to control supplementary pay is
being implemented. Some progress has been made on ex ante evaluation of projects and
mechanisms to track the cycle of an investment project have been put in place, including
through the use of the Precautionary Reserve Envelope. The mechanisms, some of which are
on a pilot basis, need to be expanded. There has been a shift from public consumption to
public investment, but this shift needs to continue.
3. Positive response. Results are positive, but efforts need to be continued and expanded.
Revenues as a percent of GDP are rising. The taxpayer identification number (NINEA) is
playing a greater role in tax collection and efforts have been made to collect tax arrears. The
tax services have been reorganized and cash payment of taxes eliminated. However, NINEA
needs to be used to coordinate between revenue collecting agencies and action is needed
to reduce high tax expenditures (6 percent of GDP). Greater efficiency and transparency in
tax collection is needed.

3. Reforms to increase revenues.

4. Implement medium-term budget
framework and strengthen debt management.

4. Positive response. Significant progress has been made which needs to be used to
generate momentum for further reform. A first generation Treasury Single Account (TSA)
has been created. Program budgeting is being prepared for implementation with the next
budget and the authorities are working towards a MTBF for the 2018 budget. A debt anchor
with commitment to take measures when deviating from a sustainable debt path is
expected with the supplementary budget this fall. However, debt continues to increase, with
debt service taking one third of revenues and the TSA needs to capture all budget
transactions to increase transparency and improve budget management.

Policies to rekindle growth and enable the private sector
5. Steadfast implementation of the PSE to
boost growth to 7 percent by 2019 and
accelerate poverty reduction.

6. Energy sector reforms.

7. Reforms to improve the business
environment.

5. Positive response. Growth increased to 6.5 percent in 2015 (3.5 percent per capita growth)
and is projected to reach 7 percent by 2018. Many elements of the PSE have been
incorporated in the PSI as structural benchmarks and implementation has been good. The
authorities have assigned responsibility of implementation of specific elements of the PSE
with timelines to individuals in the government. However, action to open space to SMEs and
the broader private sector needs to be given urgency if the higher growth is to be sustained.
6. Mixed response. Some progress has been made on accessing low cost energy and
improvements in energy infrastructure are underway. The authorities are working with
development partners to increase the role of the private sector in generation and
distribution. Subsidies from the budget to SENELEC have been eliminated, partly due to
lower oil prices. However, final electricity prices remain very high, reducing private sector
competitiveness and SENELEC needs to pursue its reform plan to deal with inefficiencies and
reduce the contingent fiscal liability it generates.
7. Positive response. Senegal has made good progress in this area, but is so far behind that
efforts need to be broadened and accelerated. Senegal’s World Bank Doing Business ranking
has improved and it has been in the top ten reformers in the last two years. However, it was
so far back that its ranking remains low at 153 out of 189 countries. There has not been

Authorities’ Response
Strengthening the financial sector and external stability
significant progress on energy, land and judicial reforms. Further progress on reducing rent
seeking and patronage is urgently required. SMEs continue to have difficulty doing business
and FDI levels remain low. There has been no progress on labor market reforms.

8. Improve private sector access to credit,
while maintaining financial sector stability
.

9. Promote competitiveness and export
diversification and implement measures to
unlock FDI.

8. Mixed response. Credit bureaus were created, but lack the historical data needed to be
effective. Judicial reforms are needed to allow collateral to support lending. The creation of
three institutions to guarantee and provide direct lending to firms, including SMEs, has
supported some credit creation to the private sector, but there are potential balance sheet
risks which need to be evaluated. In the banking sector, lending guarantees still play an
important role. The financial sector is relatively stable, with concentration risks and high
levels of NPLs being monitored by the National Financial Stability Commission.
9. Poor response. While the current account deficit has been reduced, this has been driven
largely by lower oil prices. Non-price competitiveness and the business environment remain
weak, hindering export growth and diversification, with FDI remaining well below levels seen
in comparator countries. The authorities should rapidly reform the Special Economic Zone
regime to emphasize paying reasonable taxes within a business friendly framework and
move away from over 50 year tax holidays in a poor business environment.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Dakar, November 14, 2016
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
U.S.A.

Madame Managing Director,
1.
The government of Senegal requests completion of the third review of its macroeconomic
program supported by the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for the period 2015–17. Details of this
program were described in the initial Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of
June 8, 2015. In support of this request, the attached MEFP reviews program implementation and
updates the government’s short- and medium-term objectives and policies under the program.
2.
Program implementation has remained satisfactory. All end-June assessment criteria were
met. All end-June ITs were met except for the IT on tax revenues which was narrowly missed (by
0.02 percent of GDP) because of lower than projected customs revenue. Structural reforms
progressed broadly as envisaged as only one structural benchmark of those set for the period June–
October 2016, namely the one on the creation of a structure (specialized office, division, etc.)
responsible for recovering problem tax claims, was not implemented. We preferred to wait for a
comprehensive reform in preparation.
3.
As part of the continuation of the program, four (4) new structural benchmarks have been
added. These are: (i) Recovery of at least 50 percent of the CFAF 89.15 billion of tax claims deemed
recoverable (December 2016); (ii) finalization of the draft decree on the creation, empowerment and
organization of the national public debt committee (December 2016); (iii) the audit of the 2016
financing and identification of liquidity gaps (March 2017); and (iv) the operationalization of the
DGD-DGID platform and production of a report on basic data cross-checking between the two
entities (June 2017).

4.
The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are
appropriate for achieving the objectives of the PSI-supported program. Given its commitment to
macroeconomic stability, the government will continue to take any additional measures needed to
safeguard growth momentum and diversify its sources, to strengthen the economy’s resilience in a
difficult international environment and a sub-regional context vulnerable to security hazards, and to
ensure the stability of the macroeconomic framework, consistent with program objectives. The
government will consult with the IMF—at its own initiative, or whenever the IMF Managing Director
requests such consultation—before adopting any such measures or in advance of revisions to the
policies contained in the attached MEFP. Moreover, the government will provide the IMF with such
information as the IMF may request in connection with the progress made in implementing the
economic and financial policies and achieving the program objectives.
5.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached MEFP and TMU, and
the related Staff Report.
Very truly yours,

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies,
2015–17
1.

This Memorandum updates the Memorandum of June 8, 2015 on our economic and
financial program supported by the Policy Support Instrument for the period 2015–17. It
reviews recent economic developments and describes the policies that the government plans to
implement for the remainder of 2016 and in the short term to build on the good macroeconomic
results achieved.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.

On the domestic front, implementation of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE)
continues, with appreciable effects on the economy. At the end of the first six (6) months of
2016, nonagricultural economic activity measured by the General Activity Index (GAI) grew
5.7 percent, reflecting the healthy pace of activity in the secondary sector together with the
renewal of growth in the tertiary sector. The secondary sector benefited from the positive
orientation of the mining, chemical manufacturing, construction materials, construction, and
energy subsectors. The revival of service activities is attributable to the strength observed, in
particular, in the fields of transport, post and telecommunications, financial services, and real
estate. In view of this especially favorable trend and the outlook for the rest of the year, and
taking into account the continuing efforts in the agriculture subsector, the projected real GDP
growth rate remains at 6.6 percent. In terms of inflation, the level of consumer prices would
remain low (+0.9 percent over the first six (6) months of 2016, year-on-year), reflecting the easing
of world prices. As for foreign trade, the current account deficit is projected at 6.5 percent, owing,
on the one hand, to the increase in exports following the plentiful groundnuts crop and the
recovery of the export industries, and, on the other, to control of the oil bill together with the
positive results of the policy of replacing imports of certain products with local production.

3.

Program implementation remains satisfactory. All end-June quantitative assessment
criteria were met. All end-June indicative targets were met with the exception of one. The quarterly
ceilings on treasury float (CFAF 50 billion) and direct contracting (15 percent), and the floor on
social expenditure (35 percent), were all observed. However, the floor on tax revenue
(CFAF 900.8 billion) was missed by a slight margin (less than CFAF 2 billion), mostly because of a
decline in customs revenue. Nevertheless, the budget deficit target of CFAF 202 billion was largely
achieved as a result of the government pursuing its policy of rationalizing public consumption
expenditure.

4.

Significant progress was also made in meeting structural benchmarks. Of the five
structural benchmarks set for the period from June to October 2016, three were met and one was
implemented with delay (Table 2). The only structural benchmark that has not been implemented
is the creation of a structure (specialize office, division, etc.) responsible for recovering problem
tax claims. We preferred to wait for the comprehensive reform of the Direction Générale des
Impôts et des Domaines (DGID) currently underway.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 45

SENEGAL

5.

Progress on other structural reforms was also observed. Two (2) of the five (5) working
groups organized to discuss clearly defined topics produced a report that was subsequently
approved. These two groups are responsible, respectively, for enterprises in difficulty and
government subsidies to enterprises. Memorandums on the three (3) other topics, namely, the
inclusion of parafiscal taxes in the budget, tax expenditures, and the establishment of an
independent accountants’ network within the DGID, were submitted to the Minister of Economy,
Finance, and Planning. Decisions concerning the recommendations are expected before the end
of this year.

6.

Satisfactory implementation of WAEMU directives. Progress was noted in the
implementation of WAEMU directives. A budget orientation discussion is now held every year and
a detailed report on budget execution is forwarded to the Finance Committee of the National
Assembly each quarter, which is simultaneously published on the Directorate General of Finance
(DGF) website. In all, of the eight (8) directives making up the WAEMU harmonized public finance
framework, only two have yet to be transposed: the directive on materials accounting and the one
on the fiscal regime of local governments.

MACROECONOMIC POLICY AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR 2017
7.

The implementation of PSE reforms and priority projects will be a determining
factor in the acceleration of growth. The real GDP growth rate is projected at 6.8 percent in
2017, most likely as a result of improved agricultural performance, the revitalization of industry,
and the continued vibrancy of service activities. To remove the constraints slowing private sector
development, the government will step up the pace of implementation of projects and reforms.
Inflation will remain modest in 2017, in a context of stability in the global commodities markets.
The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to improve, particularly as a result
of the growth of merchandise exports.

8.

In order to keep growth buoyant, to make it more inclusive and to fortify the
economy’s resilience to internal shocks as well as those inherent in the international setting
and the context of insecurity within the subregion, the IMF-supported program will, as before,
revolve around the following three aims: (i) rebuild the government’s fiscal space, (ii) strengthen
public financial management and governance; and (iii) improve the business environment.

A.

Restore the Government’s Fiscal Space

9.
The budget deficit target is set at CFAF 349 billion, or 3.7 percent of GDP in 2017.
This target is based essentially on satisfactory revenue collection, effective control of current
expenditure, and increased investment expenditure to support growth.
10.

The DGID will mobilize revenue essentially by expanding the tax base and
effectively monitoring taxpayers. Cooperation between the DGID and the Direction Générale
des Douanes (DGD) will continue, particularly as a result of the increased information exchanges
made possible by the creation of an information exchange platform based on the NINEA
(National Registration Number for Enterprises and Associations), in use since February 11, 2016. A
Committee established within the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning is responsible for
the initiation of automatic tax data sharing. Moreover, following the DGID audit of what remains

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

to be recovered at end-April 2016, the government is committed to collecting at least 50 percent
of the CFAF 89.15 billion in tax claims considered recoverable by end-December 2016
(structural benchmark) and boosting that figure to 60 percent by end-March 2017.

11.

The modernization of the DGID continues. In this connection, the following measures
will be implemented: (i) place the databank in service; (ii) expand e-filing and e-payment options
for CGE (Large Enterprises Center) taxpayers on January 1, 2017, and in 2018 for other taxpayers;
(iii) finalize preparation of the procedures manual; (iv) increase the rate of tax audit coverage
through a program of hiring tax inspectors and auditors. The reorganization of the DGID is
expected to be completed by January 31, 2017.

12.

On the subject of land, the NICAD (cadastral identification number) is now in use, the
management of state fees is automated, and the digitization of the land register is set for
completion by end-2017.

13.

The 2017 budget law is expected to include the following tax-related measures:
(i) finalize the overhaul of the business license tax to complete the 2012 reform, (ii) raise the
threshold of the Comprehensive Property Tax (Contribution Globale Foncière - CGF), (iii) raise the
ceiling on tax payments as a share of current revenue (bouclier fiscal), now set at 40 percent, to
increase the share of gross revenue, (iv) limit the tax credit for dependents in order to increase tax
revenue, (v) introduce a cement tax, (vi) introduce an export tax on peanuts, and (vii) introduce tax
to be used by the budget for the purposes of economic development which replaces the CODETE
(i.e. a parafiscal tax which was collected for the Fonds de Soutien londs de (FSE)).

14.
Increasing the Customs Administration’s contribution to the mobilization of fiscal
revenue will be based on: (i) modernization of the Customs Administration (Annex 1);
(ii) expansion of the tax base through stricter control of informal sector imports;
(iii) reconfiguration and improved tracking of the clearance of revenue-generating products; and
(iv) redoubled efforts to combat the unfair competition that enterprises face.
15.

The rationalization of tax expenditures will continue. The government adopted an
action plan based on the 2013 report on tax expenditures and the conclusions of the related
working group. The aim of this action plan is to reduce tax expenditures.

16.
The rationalization of public consumption expenditure will continue. To that end, the
government will ensure strict control of wage bill increases by revamping recruitment practices in
the civil service. The majority of positions in the civil service are administrative, whereas in order
to promote the development described in the PSE, priority should be given to technical positions.
Consequently, in replacing retiring employees, the number of administrative hires will be reduced
in favor of technical hires. The government also intends to gradually integrate currently active
contractuals into the civil service and will avoid hiring new contractuals. In addition, the
government will limit subsidies in the 2017 budget to CFAF 45 billion, to be granted solely for the
purpose of supporting agricultural sector development. As a result, companies such as SENELEC
(national electric company), SAR (oil refinery), and SUNEOR (groundnuts processing company) will
not receive subsidies in the 2017 budget.

The emphasis on social expenditure and quality investment will continue. Social and
investment expenditure will continue growing, to 979.23 billion and 1225.2 billion, respectively, in
2017, compared to 918.63 billion and 1045 billion in 2016. With a view to improving expenditure
quality, the government is far along in the process of preparing a databank of carefully
researched projects ready for prompt implementation. The government also intends to take
advantage of technological advances to improve the process of planning, programming,
budgeting, monitoring/assessing, and supervising projects. To that end, the public project
management system will be automated in order to accelerate project execution, boost efficiency,
and enhance the transparency of public investment. With the help of technical and financial
partners, the government will also explore the possibility of adopting e-procurement to expedite
the public procurement process.

B.

Strengthen Public Financial Management

18.

The modernization of the Treasury will continue. More specifically, the payment
systems and the process of digital transformation and automation of Treasury administration
procedures will be modernized in accordance with the 2016-2018 performance contract and the
Strategic Development Plan (Annex 2).

19.

Implementation of the single Treasury account (STA) will be completed. The STA will
be finalized in December 2017 and the criteria for assessing accounts pending “repatriation” will
be defined. Thus, all accounts held by the government and its various organs (agencies, high
authorities, public enterprises) in commercial banks will be inventoried by end-June 2017 and the
balances transferred to the Treasury no later than end-December 2017.

20.

The transition from a cash administration system to the cash management system
initiated in 2015 allowed for identification of the sources of dispersion of current cash
flows: (i) budgetary transactions initiated in previous fiscal years (deposit account credit
balances), (ii) budgetary or cash transactions in the current fiscal year that negatively affect free
cash flow potential (difference between revenue balancing operations and expenditure and
clearing balancing operations net of the payment of postal finance checks). The position of prior
deposit account credit balances was calculated at December 31, 2015 as CFAF 311.5 billion,
excluding checks outstanding on that date in the amount of CFAF 74.9 billion. Estimates of
revenue balancing operations, net of expenditure balancing operations, which do not constitute
cash flow, amounted at end-June 2016 to CFAF 36 billion. Moreover, since the start of 2016, the
public Treasury cleared CCP (postal) checks totaling CFAF 86.240 billion, compared to
CFAF 63.183 billion in payments received, for a current cash outflow of CFAF 23.057 billion that
year.

21.

The handling of the cash flow issue becomes crucial in order for the Treasury to deal
more effectively with treasury float. In this context, all operations that negatively affect the
Treasury will need to be studied in order to estimate better the government’s financing needs. In
particular, the issues include: (i) the balances of the comptes de depots from previous fiscal years,
(ii) the timing expenditures and reimbursements of the foreign operations of the military, police
and gendarmerie, (iii) illiquidity of revenues, and (iv) financial operations related to the Poste. To
mitigate the current problems of the Treasury, an audit should be conducted no later than March
2017 (structural benchmark) to thoroughly assess the situation and develop a plan for covering

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

the gap, as well as formulate strong recommendations for the future, including for overcoming
the structural problems linked to postal financing.

22.

To improve fiscal transparency, necessary steps will be taken by the Directorate General
of Finance (DGF), in cooperation with the Directorate of Public Accounting and the Treasury, to
put in place an application dedicated to monitoring the budgetary execution of titles 4 (current
transfers) and 6 (capital transfer), which account for more than 60 percent of internally financed
operating and investment expenses. Moreover, with regard to observance of the one-year budget
rule, the amounts of transfers drawn on the deposit accounts of unincorporated government
agencies and Funds and not used by the end of the fiscal year will be returned to the government
budget by recognizing the deposit account credit balance as fiscal revenue. However, certain
capital transfers held in the above-mentioned deposit accounts and representing a counterpart of
an investment project could be studied on a case-by-case basis, given their economic significance
and/or the commitment of the government to technical and financial partners, by a committee
made up of representatives of the DGF and the DGCPT during the complementary period. As for
external financing, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that its use is monitored in SIGFIP
(expenditure tracking system).

23.

Comfort letters. With the government having regained the financial capacity to honor its
commitments, banks are no longer apprehensive about the observance of payment deadlines for
services and work performed by economic agents in a contractual context. Consequently, the
government will limit the comfort letters sent to financial institutions to commitments regarding
the irrevocable domiciliation of payments in favor of the agricultural sector (subsidization of
agricultural inputs and equipment) and the defense and national security sector, as well as
incorporated government agencies.

C.

Strengthen Public Debt Management

24.

The government is committed to pursuing a reasonable debt policy. For several years
now Senegal has enjoyed a good reputation for macroeconomic management, particularly as
concerns debt. This has resulted in good ratings from rating agencies and better access to
regional and international financial markets. To protect this reputation and continue benefiting
from the resources needed for development, the government intends to implement a reasonable
debt policy. To that end, the unit responsible for public debt will be strengthened with a view to
obtaining loans at the best possible costs for the national economy. The composition and
mandates of the National Debt Committee will be reviewed to enable it to play an effective
advisory role in selecting loans and monitoring the level of debt. The finalization of the draft
decree on the establishment, function and organization of the National Public Debt Committee
will be done by end-December 2016. Financing will be sought and guaranteed solely by the
Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning, based on the recommendations of the National Debt
Committee. In this context, the government will give preference to concessional and
semi-concessional loans from traditional donors, such as the AfDB and the WB, and will ensure
that the average interest rate of new external loans does not exceed 4 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49

SENEGAL

D.

Promote the Private Sector

Local private sector

25.
The government plans to revitalize the framework for concerted action with the
private sector, in particular through the Presidential Investment Council, which is expected to
serve as an effective framework for ongoing dialogue between the government and the private
sector. Measures continue to be implemented to improve the business environment (Annex 4). In
particular, the government recognizes the preponderant role of small and medium-sized
enterprises in job creation, economic growth, and poverty reduction. Accordingly, the
government will forward the law on the development of SMEs to Parliament as quickly as
possible, while ensuring that the relevant tax legislation is based solely the General Tax Code. The
government is also committed to (i) exploring the option of creating a one-stop shop (Maison de
l’entrepreneur) which would require streamlining as well as better coordinating the various
agencies supporting SMEs; and (ii) conducting a study on the tax treatment of SMEs with a view
to encouraging and facilitating their entry into the formal sector.
26.

Economic Zones. In this context, an economic zone to facilitate the development of SMEs
and attract more FDI is being established in partnership with the Mauritian government and
private sector, the U.S. Corporate Council for Africa, The French Board of Investors in Africa, and
the China Africa Development Fund. The business climate in this zone will be on a par with that of
the top 10 countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings and will be managed by a
board of directors, the members of which include the above-mentioned partners. The tax system
applied to the zone will be simple, with reasonable rates and few exemptions. This zone is
expected to be operational by the end of the year.

27.

The government plans to increase support for entrepreneurship with the help of
BNDE, FONGIP, and FONSIS. In three years of existence, FONSIS (Sovereign Strategic
Investment Fund) secured CFAF 84.2 billion for the financing of productive projects. This support
was made possible through innovative financial arrangements. FONGIP (Priority Investment
Guarantee Fund) invested CFAF 17 billion to guarantee financing for SMEs and individuals to
support production, particularly in the agriculture and agroindustry, livestock, fishing, and
handicrafts sectors. Since its inception, the BNDE (National Economic Development Bank) has
mobilized CFAF 71 billion in financial assistance for SMEs. These funds essentially benefited
492 SMEs. The government will conduct an initial assessment of the economic and social impact,
with a view to making needed adjustments and ensuring the financial viability of these
institutions. At this stage, the objective is to develop synergies, complementarities, and
convergence bands to ensure effective fulfillment of the responsibilities assigned those entities.

28.

The government will continue its efforts to restructure public enterprises in
difficulty. In the groundnuts sector, for example, it plans to finalize the process of privatizing the
groundnuts marketing and processing company SONACOS SA (formerly SUNEOR) by 2018.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

Energy

29.

The government will continue reforming the electricity sector. Development of the
electricity sector is accelerating, with particular emphasis on the diversification of sources in order
to reduce production costs and, eventually, rates charged to households and firms. In this context,
a major effort is being made to develop solar energy (Annex 3).

30.

The government reaffirms its determination to continue the reform of SENELEC.
Two major studies on revising the legislative, regulatory, and institutional framework of the
energy sector and the task of completing the accounting segregation and separation of SENELEC
activities, financed by PASE (Electricity Sector Support Project), are under way. The SENELEC
Strategic Plan for the period 2016-2020, currently pending approval, is founded on the following
strategic pillars; (i) reform of human resources management to motivate and guarantee the
security of personnel; upgrade industrial infrastructures to comply with relevant standards;
(ii) modernization through development and innovation; (iii) restoration of financial profitability;
(iv) optimal development of supply and control of demand; diversification of activities and
deployment abroad. The study on the harmonization of the electricity rates of rural concession
holders and SENELEC has begun. The reorganization of ASER (Senegalese Agency for Rural
Electrification) is awaiting approval by its Board.

Financial Sector

31.

The credit information offices (BIC) opened on February 1, 2016. The difficulties
involved in obtaining access to records threaten to limit the hoped-for impact of the BICs in this
launch phase. Discussions will be held to find ways and means of overcoming these difficulties.

32.

To extend to the private sector the capability of paying wages in excess of
CFAF 100,000 by direct deposit to bank accounts or by any other means of electronic
payment, the following actions are planned: (i) referral to the BCEAO of an application for
amendment by the WAMU Council of Ministers of Law 2004-15 of June 4, 2004, which
incorporated the directive on measures to promote the expansion of banking services and the use
of non-cash means of payment; (ii) submission of the amended draft law for approval upon
receipt of the Council of Ministers’ response; and (iii) continuation of dialogue with banks and
SFDs (decentralized financial systems) in the context of monitoring implementation of the law.

33.

The government is aware that the improvement and viability of the economic
activities of the various populations, especially the low-income segment, require access to a
range of basic financial services. Consequently, the government has agreed, with support from
the World Bank, to adopt a national financial inclusion strategy. To that end, it conducted a
household financial capability survey to obtain basic data for the diagnostic phase. The work
continues, including in particular finalization of the diagnostic assessment and the definition of
the governance framework and guidance of the strategy. The document on the national financial
inclusion strategy is expected to be made available in the final quarter of 2017.

New program monitoring indicators

34.

Assessment criteria for end-June 2017 and indicative targets for end-March and
end-June 2017 are proposed (Table 1 of the MEFP). The government and IMF staff also agreed
on the measures and structural benchmarks shown in Table 2 of the MEFP. Reviews will occur at
six-month intervals. The fourth review is scheduled to be completed by end-June 2017, the fifth
review by end-December 2017, and the sixth review by the end of the term of the PSI.

Attachment I. Annex 1—Modernization of the Customs
Administration
The rollout of the new comprehensive version of GAINDE (computerized customs system) in
November 2016 will represent a new level of technological development with the elimination of
paper and the widespread adoption of electronic signatures. The receipt confirming payment in
full will be introduced sometime around February 2017, in order to keep track of all payments
made (exclusive of duties and taxes) at ports and airports. Finally, the customs escort system is
being streamlined through a series of measures, including: (i) revision of the unloading regulations;
(ii) consultation with the Autonomous Port of Dakar and port stakeholders following the
prohibition of unloading in the port precinct and in unauthorized areas; (iii) obligation to unload
only on authorized platforms; (iv) definition of a list of products that cannot be unloaded;
(v) meeting with the customs authorities of the countries most concerned with transit, namely, Mali
and the Gambia; and (vi) better organization of customs escorts. In addition, the implementation
of an integrated transit management platform is planned with Mali to minimize customs revenue
losses related to the fraudulent transfer of in bond goods.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55

Attachment I. Annex 2—Modernization of Payment Systems
and the Process of Digital Transformation and Automation of
Treasury Administration Procedures
1.

Enormous investments have already been made in the information system. A unified
communications system is also being put in place, including the ongoing development of a
software program for computerized mail management, the interconnection of the Trésorerie
Paierie pour l’Etranger (TPE – foreign payment office) with its stations abroad using the e-TPE
software program currently being developed with the help of a service provider, and the
installation of IP telephony. Regarding the quality approach, a process of ISO certification of
revenue and public debt management procedures is under way at the General Revenue Office of
the Treasury (RGT) and the Directorate of Public Debt (DDP). The first performance and
satisfaction audits will be started by the end of the year, with the help of the service provider
recently chosen to assist the DGCPT with this quality approach.

2.

The Treasury acquired software for the computerized management of outgoing and
incoming checks (CIC NG) and the real-time processing of transfers (Virtek), enabling it for the
first time to participate directly in the central bank’s SICA-STAR automated payment and clearing
system. These applications, as well as check scanners and I.T. equipment, have already been
distributed to all Treasury accounting offices in the Dakar and Thiès regions, which account for
most of the financial operations in the DGCPT network. The DGID and the DGD, through
Perception de Dakar-port, actively participated in the test phases, which led to approval of the
system by the BCEAO.

3.
Interoperability with other systems in use at the department level is ongoing. The
checks of the Large Enterprises Center (CGE) and the Medium-Sized Enterprises Center (CME) as
well as other collection units at the DGID are now processed directly by the RGT. For Customs, a
committee including the CORUS (electronic payment of customs duties and similar levies) project
and the Treasury I.T. Directorate was formed to integrate e-payment transactions, at this level,
directly into the Treasury system. Eventually, all government e-payments will have to be made
directly via the Treasury system to ensure the effectiveness of the Treasury single account system.
With the DGF, tests of the transfer of the central payroll file directly through the Treasury system
were conclusive, as were the test transactions carried out with partner banks.
4.

The interconnection with the payment systems also figured in the modernization of
the Treasury accounting system. The Aster software program was migrated to a web architecture
with the elimination of the regional bases. The automation of procedures was expanded with the
automatic generation of accounting entries at the time of receipt of revenue or the payment of
expenditures, with interfacing between Aster and the payment system applications and the
generation of return entries based on information related to the payment in SIGFIP.

Attachment I. Annex 3—The Electricity Sector
In 2016, the dual fuel oil-fired power plants of Taiba Ndiaye (87 MW) and Cap des Biches (50 MW)
began supplying 137 MW of power, with an additional 50 MW of power imported from
Mauritania. For the remainder of the year, it is expected that the Taiba Ndiaye and Cap des Biches
extensions will be brought online, which will increase their total power to 105 MW and 85 MW,
respectively. Similarly, the solar energy plants of Bokhole (20 MW) and Malicounda (20 MW) are
expected to begin operating in October and November 2016. For 2017, the following startups are
expected: (i) Méouane solar power plant (30 MW), (ii) Merina Dakhar power plant (20 MW),
(iii) Sakal solar power plant (20 MW), (iv) Kahone solar power plant (20 MW), (v) Diass solar power
plant (15 MW), and (vi) Sendou coal-fired power plant (125 MW), for a total power output of
230 MW, not counting energy imports from Mauritania. The Scaling Solar program will make a
combined total of 100 MW available to three sites (Touba, Kahone, and Niakhar). The most recent
version of the production plan is currently in process of approval, and the most significant option
included in the plan is that the system will be further developed with gas-fired power plants.

Attachment I. Annex 4: Other Factors for Improvement of the
Business Environment
1.

The government plans to continue its efforts to build investor confidence. The priority
of the roadmap of the 2016-2018 Program of Reforms of the Business Environment and
Competitiveness (PREAC) for the first twelve (12) months will be to complete the structural reforms
that Senegal has been slowly working on since 2004. These reforms pertain to property, tax
collection and payment procedures, systematization and professionalization of the amicable
settlement of commercial litigation, establishment of the commercial court, comprehensibility of
fees for administrative and intermediary acts, regulation of the informal sector and labor legislation,
in addition to upgrading to computerized investment and trade procedures. Sectoral projects and
reforms aimed at controlling and lowering the costs of production factors and intermediation
(logistics, irrigation, electricity, vocational training, financing, interconnection and connectivity with
neighboring countries, investment platforms) will be undertaken and finalized by mid-2018 with a
view to building and strengthening the competitiveness and position of the Senegalese Hub in the
West African subregion. Finally, dedicated international reference zones will be set up, based on the
models of Morocco, Mauritius, Singapore, and China, for the establishment of competitive areas in
the form of economic zones, core growth regions, and agricultural centers (agropoles).

2.

The National Land Reform Commission (CNRF), established by Decree 2012-1419 of
December 6, 2012, prepared a draft land policy paper. The process of approving the paper is under
way and will inaugurate a new phase, via the drafting of legislative and regulatory instruments, some
of which, incorporating major innovations, would require testing to ensure strengthening and
ownership prior to their implementation.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative assessment
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks necessary to monitor the Fund-supported
program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) in 2015-2017. It also establishes the terms and
timeframe for transmitting the information that will enable Fund staff to monitor the program.

Program conditionality
2.
The assessment criteria for end-December 2016 and the indicative targets for endDecember 2016 are set out in Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP). The structural benchmarks established under the program are presented in Table 2.

Definitions, adjusters, and data reporting

A.

The Government and Public Sector

3.
Unless otherwise indicated, “government” in this TMU means the central government of the
Republic of Senegal. It excludes the central bank and the non-government public sector
(see paragraph 4).
4.
Unless otherwise indicated, “public sector” in this TMU means the government, local
governments and all majority government-owned or controlled entities.

B.

Net lending/Borrowing (Program Definition)

Definition
5.
Net lending/borrowing (program definition), or the overall fiscal balance, is the difference
between the government’s total revenue and total expenditure (costs and acquisition net of
nonfinancial assets). The operations of the Energy Sector Support Fund (FSE) are integrated in the
TOFE. The definition of revenues and expenditures is consistent with that in the 2001/14
Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM). Government expenditure is defined on the basis of
payment orders accepted by the Treasury, as well as those executed with external resources. This
assessment criterion is set as a floor on the overall fiscal balance as of the beginning of the year.

Sample calculation
6.
The floor on net lending/borrowing (program definition) as of December 31, 2014 is minus
CFAF 381 billion. It is calculated as the difference between revenue (CFAF 1,877 billion) and total
expenditure (CFAF 2,258 billion).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

SENEGAL

Adjustment
7.
The floor including grants is adjusted downward by the amount that budget grants fall short
of program projections up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion at current exchange rates (see MEFP
Table 1).

Reporting requirements
8.
During the program period, the authorities will report provisional data on the overall fiscal
balance (program definition) and its components monthly to Fund staff with a lag of no more than
30 days after the end of the relative month. Data on revenues and expenditure that are included in
the calculation of the overall fiscal balance will be drawn mainly from preliminary Treasury account
balances. Final data will be provided as soon as the final balances of the Treasury accounts are
available, but no later than two months after the reporting of the provisional data.

C.

Social Expenditure

Definition
9.
Social spending is defined as spending on health, education, the environment, the judicial
system, social safety nets, sanitation, and rural water supply (as contained in the table on social
expenditure).

Reporting requirements
10.
The authorities will report semiannual data to Fund staff within two months following the

Budgetary Float

Definition
11.
The budgetary float (instances de paiement) is defined as the outstanding stock of
government expenditure for which bills have been received and validated but not yet paid by the
Treasury (the difference between dépenses liquidées and dépenses payées). The assessment criterion
is set as a ceiling on the budgetary float, monitored at the end of the quarter.

Reporting requirements
12.
The authorities will transmit to Fund staff on a weekly basis (i.e., at the end of each week),
and at the end of each month, a table from the expenditure tracking system (SIGFIP) showing all
committed expenditure (dépenses engages), all certified expenditures that have not yet been cleared
for payment (dépenses liquidées non encore ordonnancées), all payment orders (dépenses
ordonnancées), all payment orders accepted by the Treasury (dépenses prises en charge par le Trésor),
and all payments made by the Treasury (dépenses payees). The SIGFIP table will exclude delegations
60

for regions and embassies. The SIGFIP table will also list any payments that do not have a cash
impact on the Treasury accounts.

E.

Spending Undertaken Outside Simplified and Normal Procedures

13.
This assessment criterion is applied on a continuous basis to any procedure other than the
normal and simplified procedures to execute spending. It excludes only spending undertaken on the
basis of a supplemental appropriation order (décret d’avance) in cases of absolute urgency and need
in the national interest, pursuant to Article 12 of the Organic Budget Law. Such spending requires
the signatures of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister.
14.

The authorities will report any such procedure immediately to Fund staff.

F.

Public Sector External Payments Arrears

Definition
15.
External payment arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed and not paid when due
(in accordance with the terms of the contract) on the external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
public sector. The definition of external debt given in paragraph 19 is applicable here. The
assessment criterion on external payments arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis.

The authorities will promptly report any accumulation of external payments arrears to Fund

Definition
17.
Debt. The definition of debt is set out in paragraph 8(a) of the Guidelines on Public Debt
Conditionality in Fund Arrangements attached to Executive Board Decision No. 15688-(14/107),
adopted December 5, 2014.
a)
The term “debt” will be understood to mean a direct, i.e., non-contingent, liability created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, according to a given repayment schedule; these payments
will discharge the principal and/or interest. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows:
i.

Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61

SENEGAL

to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements.);

b)

ii.

Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and

iii.

Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception
of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of
the property.

Under the definition of the debt above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
and interest arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered
debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

18.
Debt guarantees. The guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the
public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments
in cash or in kind).
19.
External debt. External debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than
the CFA franc, regardless of the residency of the creditor.

G. Public Sector Contracts Signed by Single Tender
Definitions
20.
Public sector contracts are administrative contracts, drawn up and entered into by the
government or any entity subject to the procurement code, for the procurement of supplies,
delivery of services, or execution of work. Public sector contracts are considered “single-tender”
contracts when the contracting agent signs the contract with the chosen contractor without
competitive tender. The quarterly indicative target will apply to total public sector contracts entered
into by the government or by any entity subject to the procurement code. The ceiling on contracts
executed by single tender will exclude classified purchases and fuel purchases by SENELEC for
electricity production reflected in a new regulation that allows SENELEC to buy fuel from SAR on the
basis of the current price structure.

Reporting requirements
21.
The government will report quarterly to Fund staff, with a lag of no more than one month
from the end of the observation period, the total amount of public sector contracts and the total
value of all single-tender public sector contracts.

H. Tax Revenues
Definition
22.
Tax revenues are the sum of revenues from taxes and levies on income, profits and capital
gains, salaries and labor, on assets; taxes on goods and services; on foreign trade and international
transactions; and other tax revenues. The indicative target will be assessed on the basis of data for
these revenues provided in the quarterly TOFE.
23.
Specifically, petroleum revenues are the subject of specific monitoring in connection with
international price trends. These are the VAT on oil, excise taxes on oil, customs duties on oil, vehicle
taxes, and the Petroleum Product Imports Security Fund (FSIPP).
Additional information for program monitoring
24.
The authorities will transmit the following to Fund staff, in electronic format if possible, with
the maximum time lags indicated:
(a)
Three days after adoption: any decision, circular, edict, supplemental appropriation order,
ordinance, or law having economic or financial implications for the current program. This includes in
particular all acts that change budget allocations included in the budget law being executed (for
instance: supplemental appropriation orders (décrets d’avance), cancellation of budget
appropriations (arrêtés d’annulation de crédit budgétaires), and orders or decisions creating
supplemental budget appropriations (décrets ou arrêtés d’ouverture de crédit budgétaire
supplémentaire). It also includes acts leading to the creation of a new agency or a new fund.

Risk of external debt distress

Low

Augmented by significant risks stemming from domestic
public and/or private external debt?

No

Senegal remains at low risk of debt distress, consistent with the Staff Report of January
2016 (EBS/16/03).1 All debt burden indicators are below their respective thresholds, with
only the debt service-to-revenue ratio showing two spikes that breach the threshold under
stress scenarios due to Eurobond rollover. These breaches are small and temporary
reflecting liquidity rather than solvency issues. However, public debt and debt service have
been rising in recent years. The low risk of debt distress is predicated on adherence to the
planned fiscal consolidation path, an acceleration of reforms under the Plan Sénégal
Emergent (PSE), and limited non-concessional borrowing. The public DSA does not find
significant weaknesses, but the persistent high debt service as a share of revenue calls for
strengthening debt management and prudent borrowing strategies.

Senegal’s public debt statistics cover external and domestic debt issued by the central government (including
debt guaranteed by the government). External debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency
other than the CFA franc, regardless of the residency of the creditor. The baseline DSA incorporates
remittances, as they represent a significant share of GDP (12.1 percent over 2013-2015) and exports of goods
(61 percent over 2013-2015). Senegal’s policy performance is ranked “strong” by the CPIA with a score of 3.8.

SENEGAL

BACKGROUND
1.
Public debt ratios have been revised upwards in 2016, but they remain on a declining path
over the medium term. Historical figures on the composition of the stock of external debt have not been
revised with respect to the ones published in the last DSA update (EBS/16/03). For 2016, external public
debt in Senegal is projected at 39.9 percent of GDP, compared to 39.3 percent projected in the previous
DSA. The reasons for this difference are changes in nominal GDP and a small increase in external
borrowing. Commercial debt stood at 20 percent of the stock of total external public debt in 2014 and
declined to 17.8 percent in June 2016. Domestic debt is projected to increase from 15.8 percent of GDP
(CFAF 1,280 billion) at end-2015 to 19.2 percent of GDP (CFAF 1,681 billion) at end-2016, reflecting the
accumulation of additional domestic debt, related to Treasury operations (see also Staff Report). This
projection of domestic debt for 2016 is significantly higher than 15.8 percent projected in the latest DSA. As
a result, total public debt is projected to reach 59.1 percent of GDP (CFAF 5,152 billion), 4 percent of GDP
more than what was estimated in the previous DSA (EBS/16/03). Moreover, debt service on total public
debt reached 25.4 percent of revenue in 2016 and is projected to increase significantly to 36 percent of
revenue in 2018.
Text Figure 1. Senegal: Public Debt, 2006-15
(Percent of GDP)

2.
The authorities are committed to reduce debt ratios over the medium term, thanks to a
continuous effort of fiscal consolidation, improvements in the current account and a strengthening
of debt management policies—including more attention to the terms and volume of
non-concessional financing. The authorities are increasingly financing government needs on the internal
and regional markets. On the one hand, this strategy is welcome given that it mitigates exchange rate risks
and the vulnerability to the volatility of external capital flows. In addition, Senegal has been able to
lengthen the maturities and reduce borrowing costs on domestic debt. The average maturity on domestic
debt increased from 22 months in 2011 to 57 months in 2015, thanks to issuances of 10-year bonds in
2013 and 2015. Interest rates on one-year Treasury Bills declined from 6.2 percent in 2011 to 4.9 in 2015,
while rates on five-year T-Bonds moved from 9.1 to 5.9 percent between 2012 and 2015. On the other

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

hand, domestic borrowing is still more expensive than semi-concessional and concessional lending and
some recent loans carry interest rates as high as 8.5 percent, undermining future debt sustainability. As a
result, the authorities are committed to a debt management strategy that will rely predominantly on
concessional and semi-concessional borrowing, largely from traditional bilateral and multilateral lenders,
and resort to non-concessional borrowing only in exceptional cases and for specific high-return projects.
Eurobond issuances and, more generally, borrowing on commercial terms, will be considered if financing
terms are favorable and if it is not possible to obtain non-concessional financing from development
partners, particularly the African Development Bank and the World Bank.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND BORROWING PLAN
3.
The DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the Staff Report and
updates the previous DSA produced in EBS/16/03, for the first review of the three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). In line with the previous DSA, the baseline scenario assumes the
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and an ambitious investment plan, as
outlined in the PSE. This scenario is expected to deliver strong and sustained economic growth and a
narrowing fiscal deficit over the medium term. As a result, medium-term projections are significantly better
than historical averages—especially for real GDP growth and the primary balance—but aligned with recent
outcomes in 2014-15, implying that the take-off is assumed to persist, conditional on reforms being
implemented. The main assumptions are as follows:


Real GDP growth is estimated at 6.6 percent in 2016 and will increase to 7.1 percent in 2021 to
reflect the effects of infrastructure investment, export growth, and reforms under the PSE. Over
the long run, real GDP growth is projected at 5.5 percent over the period 2022-36, slightly lower
than in the previous DSA. This is in line with the international experience that suggests that over
a long period, as economies converge to middle income status, the real growth rate slows down.



Fiscal deficit. The overall fiscal deficit is projected at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2016, 3.7 percent in
2017, and 3.0 percent in 2018. In the long run, the deficit is set at 3.0 percent of GDP, revised
slightly upwards compared to the previous DSA to reflect the presence of investment needs to
meet development challenges.



Current account deficit. The current account deficit is projected to continue its recent
downward trend in 2016, reaching 6.5 percent of GDP. Starting in 2017, the current account is
projected to slightly worsen because of increasing FDI-related imports, but in the medium term
higher FDI-related exports will drive an improvement in the external position. Over the
long-term, the average current account deficit should stabilize at 6.7 percent of GDP, about one
percentage point less than what was expected in the previous DSA, mostly because of more
favorable terms of trade. Remittances remain a significant component of the current account—
estimated at 11.8 of GDP in 2016—but are expected to decline as a percent of GDP over the
medium term, reaching 9.2 percent of GDP in 2021.

Defined as the last 15 years of the projection period. For the current DSA update,



Inflation. Inflation has increased in 2016, consistent with changes in commodity prices. The GDP
deflator is projected at 1.8 percent in 2016 and is expected to remain at that level until 2021, a
small upward revision compared to the previous DSA.



External financing mix and terms. The DSA assumes that the financing mix will be consistent
with a prudent borrowing strategy. Even though recent borrowing has seen an increase in
semi-concessional and non-concessional borrowing, including on commercial terms in the
WAEMU market, the authorities are engaged in pursuing a borrowing strategy that prioritizes
concessional and semi-concessional over non-concessional financing to reduce borrowing costs
and extend maturities. Consistent with this strategy, the DSA projects a moderate substitution
between concessional and commercial borrowing—with two exceptions in 2021 and 2024 to
rollover the outstanding 10-year Eurobonds issued in 2011 and 2014 with semi-concessional
borrowing. With respect to the previous DSA, there has been a small revision upwards in the
assumption on commercial borrowing, to reflect the recent greater willingness to contract
non-concessional borrowing and the fact that traditional multilateral and bilateral concessional
financing are unlikely to fund substantial investment planned under the PSE. As a result, the
decline in the grant element of new disbursements is steeper and more in line with a country
growing to middle-income status (Figure 1, first panel). The average maturity of new debt is
close to 17.2 years, with 4.2 years of grace period (down from 19 and 4.7, respectively). Finally,
the average cost of new borrowing is assumed to be 4 percent, consistent with the commitment
in the MEFP.



Domestic borrowing. Domestic debt is assumed to account for 30 percent of total public debt,
7.5 percent of which has maturity below one year. New short-term domestic debt is assumed to
be issued at an average interest rate of 5 percent, while medium- and long-term domestic debt
is assumed to carry a real interest rate of 6 percent with average maturity of 4.7 years, consistent
with the current structure of domestic debt.



Discount rate. The discount rate for this DSA is set at 5 percent.

EXTERNAL DSA
4.
External debt indicators are below the thresholds under the baseline scenario and even
under most stress tests (Figure 1). Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is projected at
39.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and is estimated to decline to 35.1 percent of GDP in 2021 and below
30 percent in the long term. The ratios of the Present Value (PV) of PPG external debt—projected at
32.9 percent of GDP in 2016—show a declining trend under the baseline scenario and are comfortably
below the thresholds, which take remittances into account, even under the most extreme scenarios.
However, the PV debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018, under the worst case stress test, gets closer to the threshold,
indicating that the authorities should carefully monitor the terms of new borrowing. Debt service ratios
show two spikes in corresponding bullet repayment of the 2011 and 2014 Eurobonds, which are due,
respectively, in 2021 and 2024. The financing plan assumed in the DSA already incorporates higher than
usual semi-concessional borrowing in those years to rollover the Eurobonds. These two spikes do not—
breach the thresholds under the baseline scenario, but they do under the stress scenarios when
considering the ratio of debt service over revenue, as already shown in the previous DSA. In particular, the
breaches are temporary and in the long term the debt service-to-revenue ratio remains below the
thresholds under all bound tests. Under the historical scenario, all debt ratios are increasing in the long run,
persistently breaching the respective thresholds. However, under this scenario, real GDP growth, the current
account and net FDI flows are set at their historical averages, which are very different from recent economic
trends and the current economic projections.
5.
Notwithstanding the breaches of debt ratios under the historical scenario and of the debt
service-to-revenue ratio under bound scenarios, Senegal remains at a low risk of debt distress. While
the DSA shows some increasing concerns regarding debt sustainability, there are several factors which
suggest a low risk of debt distress. First, the breaches in the debt service-to-revenue thresholds are very
small and temporary, as they are due exclusively to the bullet repayment of the Eurobonds. The rollover is
assumed to be financed through semi-concessional borrowing and the re-financing plan does not point
out any additional vulnerability, given that debt service ratios remain under the respective threshold in the
long term. Second, relative to the previous DSA, this analysis assumes a more realistic borrowing plan—
with a steeper decline in the grant element of new financing—and this assumption does not translate into
an adverse debt dynamics or an additional breach of debt thresholds. Third, the temporary breaches are
observed under a currency depreciation scenario which may overstate the risk of debt distress in Senegal
where external debt is denominated mostly in euro (45 percent of external public debt in 2015)—the
pegged currency—and only 28 percent in U.S. dollars. However, the depreciation of the CFA franc remains
a factor to be carefully taken into account going forward for debt management purposes. In addition, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

SENEGAL

breaches under the historical scenario should warn about the risks of deviating from the current path of
structural reforms and economic transformation envisaged under the PSE. Nonetheless, assuming that
authorities will continue their reform effort, the historical scenario cannot be taken as a good benchmark to
assess debt sustainability. Senegal, in fact, is already experiencing a growth trajectory which is significantly
different from the recent history—real GDP is projected to average over 6.5 percent in 2015-16, compared
to the historical average of 3.9. Moreover, the current account substantially improved, declining from a
deficit of 10.8 percent in 2012 to 6.5 percent in 2016, and FDI inflows are expected to increase in the
coming years, thanks to reforms to improve the business climate and the implementation of the Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) with strong governance rules. To sustain growth in the long term it will be important
to strengthen reforms and good governance.2

PUBLIC DSA
6.
Indicators of overall public debt and debt service do not point to significant vulnerabilities
stemming from domestic debt. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt increases from
50 percent in 2015 to 52.1 percent in 2016, but then is projected to moderately decline to 45.3 percent of
GDP in 2021 (Figure 2 and Table 3). Over time, the ratio is projected to further decrease, reaching
41.5 percent in 2036. Overall, these ratios are higher than the ones estimated in the previous DSA,
reflecting higher initial public debt and differences in financing assumptions and in the macroeconomic
framework (notably slightly higher fiscal deficit and lower growth). Under the most extreme scenario of a
30 percent depreciation of the currency in 2016, debt ratios increase more than under the other scenarios
in the short term, but in the long term the evolution of total public debt is similar to what is projected
under the baseline scenario. On the other hand, the public debt outlook deteriorated slightly—but is still
well below the public debt benchmark of 74 percent of GDP for strong performers—in the absence of
further fiscal consolidation. The debt outlook when keeping real GDP growth and the primary deficit
constant at their historical levels highlights the importance of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to
support strong growth and preserve debt sustainability. Under the historical scenario, the PV of total public
debt is on a growing path and in 2025 is projected to be above the benchmark of 74 percent of GDP. As
noted in the external DSA section, in the case of Senegal, historical averages are very different from the
current baseline scenario, and they may be too pessimistic, given Senegal’s improved economic
performance. Overall, risks to public debt sustainability remain low, but stress tests underline the
importance of making continuous efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit, strengthen economic growth and
strictly control the volumes and terms of non-concessional borrowing.

Sector-Led Growth.”

7.
The evolution of debt service is more volatile and debt service is above 30 percent of
revenues in the medium term. The public DSA exposes vulnerabilities related to debt service which are
not clearly visible in the external DSA. In 2016, debt service absorbs 25.4 percent of government revenues,
but this ratio is projected to be above 35 percent in 2017 and 2018. In addition, there are two other spikes
in the debt service-to-revenue ratio in 2021 (39.4 percent) and 2024 (34 percent) when the two Eurobonds
are due. More generally, average debt service is projected to be above 30 percent of revenue over 2016-36
under the baseline scenario and at 40 percent under the most extreme shock scenario. As in the external
DSA, this illustrates the importance of implementing the planned fiscal consolidation. In addition, the
authorities should continue the work done so far to extend the average maturities on domestic debt.

CONCLUSION
8.
According to staff’s assessment, Senegal continues to face a low risk of debt distress. The
minor and temporary breaches of the debt service-to-revenue thresholds signal a liquidity, rather than a
solvency, problem, and overall debt dynamics do not raise concerns under both the baseline and stress
scenarios. However, the bound tests conducted under the external and public debt sustainability analysis—
and especially the evolution of debt ratios under the historical scenario—indicate that debt sustainability
hinges on continuing fiscal consolidation and on steadfastly implementing reforms to achieve high and
sustained growth, as envisaged in the PSE.
9.
Relative to the previous DSA, the current projections highlight that rising level of debt and
debt service require a cautious approach to semi-concessional and commercial borrowing. Debt
service on public debt is already high and is expected to increase in the near term, and a further
deterioration of borrowing terms could put debt sustainability at risk. In this context, staff recommends a
careful and continuous monitoring of financing needs and of borrowing plans, the development of a
transparent pipeline of bankable projects, and a strengthening of debt management.
10.
The authorities agree with the analysis in this DSA. The conclusions of the DSA were shared
with the authorities who broadly concurred with the assessment and with maintaining a “low” debt risk
rating. They agreed with staff that Senegal needs to reinforce its debt management capacity, especially in
view of the country’s gradual transition to market sources. They also expressed a strong commitment to
limit non-concessional borrowing and postpone projects for which there is not adequate concessional or
semi-concessional financing available.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.
Exchange System:
Senegal, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange regime is a conventional peg to the
euro.
The union's common currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of
CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at
CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund, if any such measure is introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies for
Member Countries” (Country Report No. 14/84).
Article IV Consultations:
The previous consultation discussions were held during September 16–26, 2014. The Article IV
consultation was completed by the Executive Board on December 15, 2014 and the staff report was
published on January 14, 2015 (Country Report No. 15/2). In concluding the 2014 Article IV
consultation, Executive Directors noted that satisfactory program implementation has helped Senegal
preserve macroeconomic stability. However, due to internal and external factors, the economy has
continued to underperform and unemployment and poverty remain high. The large current account
deficit and increasing exposure of the external position to shifting market sentiment pose additional
risks to the outlook. Directors stressed that prudent policies and ambitious structural reforms are
critical to boosting growth and reducing poverty. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ new
development strategy as outlined in “Plan Sénégal Emergent” (PSE) and looked forward to its
steadfast and timely implementation.
Directors emphasized that accelerating the pace of structural reforms will be key to achieving the PSE
objectives. They agreed that reform efforts should be aimed at improving governance and the
business climate in order to promote private sector development and to attract foreign direct
investment. Priority should also be given to making delivery of public services more efficient,
improving the impact of public spending through PFM reforms, containing public consumption to
generate the fiscal space for investment in human capital and public infrastructure, and
strengthening social safety nets. A comprehensive restructuring of the energy sector and increasing
4

export competitiveness will also be important. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to engage
with a few comparator countries to develop an active peer learning effort to roll out the required
reforms.
Directors encouraged the authorities to anchor fiscal policy on long-term debt sustainability within a
medium-term budget framework and reach the WAEMU convergence criteria on the fiscal deficit of
3 percent of GDP by 2019. They noted that attaining this goal will require further strengthening of tax
and expenditure policy measures. While supporting the PSE priorities, Directors emphasized that all
related investment should be consistent with the authorities’ earlier fiscal consolidation plans and
Senegal’s absorptive capacity. In addition, decisions to contract nonconcessional financing should be
carefully weighed.
Directors welcomed the initiative to improve the quality of public investment by establishing a
precautionary reserve envelope from which funding would only be released for projects with proper
feasibility studies. Directors encouraged the authorities to extend this in the 2016 budget.
Directors stressed that continued efforts will be needed to improve public financial management,
budget institutions, and economic governance. They underscored that reforms should focus on key
areas such as macro-fiscal policy design, development of a medium-term expenditure framework and
improved fiscal discipline in budget execution.
Directors highlighted the importance of addressing financial sector vulnerabilities, especially the
quality of bank assets. They encouraged continued vigilance of the high level of non-performing
loans in close cooperation with the BCEAO and WAEMU Banking Commission. Directors supported
the strategy to improve access to financial services.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) Participation:
A joint team of the World Bank and the IMF conducted a mission under the FSAP program in 2000
and 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued in 2001 (IMF Country Report
No. 01/189). An FSAP update was undertaken in 2004, focusing on development issues (in particular
nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit, in line with the priorities
defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126). A regional FSAP for the WAEMU was
undertaken in 2007 and the FSSA was issued in May 2008 (SM/08/139). A ROSC on the data module
was published in 2002. An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency module in 2005.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism

The onsite visit for Senegal's AML/CFT evaluation took place in July/August 2007 in the context of
ECOWAS’s Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA). The
report was adopted in early May 2008 by the GIABA Plenary held in Accra, Ghana. The report
highlighted several areas of weaknesses in the AML/CFT system, confirmed by a score of
12 non-compliant and 16 partially compliant ratings out of the 40+9 FATF AML/CFT
recommendations. In May 2009 Senegal joined the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units
(FIUs). The FIU publishes on its website statistics on suspicious transaction reports received, the
number of cases transmitted to the judiciary, and the number of convictions. Senegal’s eighth
follow-up report was discussed at GIABA’s May 2016 Plenary. It acknowledged the progress
achieved in its legal, regulatory and institutional framework, including the efforts to revise the
AML/CFT legal framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard, and encouraged Senegal to continue
making improvements. Senegal was removed from the follow-up process and will be assessed under
the 2012 FATF standard in early 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical Issues Appendix
As of October 31, 2016

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. There are weaknesses in data on national accounts, production, and social indicators. The
authorities are committed to improving the quality and availability of economic, financial, and social
indicators, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other international organizations
and donors.
National accounts: The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of
National Accounts, 1993. The lack of adequate financial resources has constrained efforts to collect
and process data. Because of financial constraints, surveys of businesses and households are not
conducted regularly. However, efforts continue to be made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data dissemination. The
Regional Technical Assistance Center for West Africa (West AFRITAC) has been assisting Senegal with
the improvement of their real sector statistics, in particular annual and quarterly national accounts
(QNA). Senegal started releasing the QNA in 2012 and integrated economic accounts (IEA) in 2014.
Senegal has also put in place a plan for rebasing its national accounts to 2014; the plan includes the
implementation of the 2008 SNA. The rebased series will be available in June 2017.
Government finance statistics (GFS): GFS are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources, and quarterly disseminated as government
financial operations tables (TOFE) in the ministry's publications. Following Fund’s TA, TOFE
presentations were improved and aligned with the extended WAEMU TOFE. Remaining step is to
implement the recent WAEMU fiscal directives. A regional advisor in GFS has been conducting
technical assistance missions aimed at improving the consistency of fiscal reporting and migrating
to the methodologies of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The regional advisor also
supported efforts to resume reporting of annual and higher frequency data for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and electronic dissemination of the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled and disseminated
by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). In August 2016, BCEAO completed the migration of
Senegal’s MFS to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other depository
corporations. These SRF-based data are being processed by the IMF Statistics Department for publication in
the November 2016 issue of International Financial Statistics (IFS). framework.
Financial sector surveillance: Senegal does not report financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to the IMF.
A technical assistance mission on FSIs is scheduled to visit the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar, Senegal in
2017. This mission will assist the authorities in their efforts to develop a set of core and encouraged FSIs
for deposit taking institutions for WAEMU member countries, including Senegal.

External sector statistics: As one of the eight WAEMU member states, the National Directorate of
BCEAO for Senegal has been collecting data following BPM6 since 2013. The BCEAO compiles
quarterly BOP statistics for internal purposes but reports only annual data to STA (latest data
reported–2014). Senegal equally report annual IIP to STA. Since Senegal has committed to subscribe
to the SDDS, ESS compilation needs improvements, including the compilation of the monthly
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data template. The three-year JSA-AFR project,
recently launched and which goes through 2019, is aimed at improving adequacy, timeliness and
frequency of ESS in Senegal; a TA mission is considered for January 2017. With STA support, steps will
be undertaken to address certain shortcomings, including: (i) better estimation of general
merchandise trade to include uncontrolled cross-border trade with neighboring countries.

II. Data Standards and Quality
The country participates in the enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in 2001. The
authorities have appointed a national e-GDDS coordinator. In 2016, an STA mission visited Senegal to
help the authorities set up a National Summary Data Page where e-GDDS data are regularly disseminated
to the public.
A Data ROSC was published on the IMF website in 2002.
