STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 13, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Overview. Korea has experienced impressive growth since the 1970s, enabling it to
escape the middle-income trap. However, this prosperity has been concentrated lately
within the highly competitive export-oriented conglomerates, whereas household income
growth and service sector productivity have been sluggish. Moreover the population is
aging rapidly. To sustain income convergence with the most advanced countries and
enhance stability and inclusiveness, Korea needs ambitious reforms to its fiscal framework
(including to create space for higher social spending), labor market, and services sector.
Such reforms would be mutually reinforcing.
Near-term Outlook and Risks. The economy is recovering gradually, helped by
supportive monetary and fiscal policies and strong exports, and it emerged as a “safer”
haven in last summer’s market turmoil. Growth should strengthen further in 2014,
although risks are on the downside. The main near-term risks are external: sharply slower
growth in Korea’s main trading partners or severe market stress. Given significant private
debt overhang, key domestic risks are weak domestic demand and, over time, lower
potential growth if structural reforms fail to offset the drag from rapid aging.
Policy Recommendations. Policies should aim to tackle the weakness of domestic
demand and counter forthcoming headwinds to potential growth.

Fiscal Policy. Keep supporting demand in 2014, which may require a supplementary
budget. Increase countercyclicality through higher automatic stabilizers and a structural
balance fiscal rule. Create fiscal space to boost household incomes and the growth
potential by allowing a temporary structural decline in government savings and
broadening the narrow tax base.

Structural Policies. Continue to focus on labor market reforms to enhance
participation and reduce duality and, as the social safety net expands, accelerate services
sector deregulation and SME consolidation.

Monetary Policy. The current accommodative stance is appropriate given the lack of
inflation or financial stability concerns. Normalization should not start until there is
confidence that the output gap will close soon.

Exchange Rate Policy. The exchange rate should continue to be market-determined
and intervention limited to smoothing disorderly market conditions. FX reserves are ample
and there is no need for further accumulation.

Financial Sector. As the FSAP found no imminent stability risks, focus on closely
monitoring vulnerabilities such as household and corporate debt to further enhance
resilience; and supporting growth, including by reducing government intervention.

Korea is reaping the benefits of prudent
macroeconomic management and financial
moderation. It was affected relatively mildly by the
recent global market turmoil, being even dubbed a
safe haven: after some short-lived turmoil, bond
yields rose only modestly and the exchange rate
appreciated (Box 1). This reflected both strong
macroeconomic fundamentals and an absence of
strong financial tailwinds prior to the turmoil phase,
partly due to active macroprudential regulation.

2.
However, the economy faces significant medium-term growth and inclusiveness
challenges. Slow household income growth hinders stabilization in household debt and weighs on
domestic demand, while services sector productivity is very low. These features hamper rebalancing of
the economy towards more inclusive and domestically-driven growth, less sensitive to the vagaries of
global demand. Separately, absent reforms, rapid population aging will be a drag on growth potential
that could stall income convergence with the most advanced economies.
3.
To address these challenges, ambitious reforms are needed, as elaborated in the
remainder of this report. After discussing the near term macroeconomic context and policies, the
report discusses policies to lift domestic demand—by shifting resources away from the prosperous
export-oriented corporate sector to households—and to boost potential growth. It then examines in
greater depth how to make the fiscal framework and financial sector policies more growth-friendly.
As shown in Figure 1, the policies under each heading are mutually reinforcing. Exchange rate
appreciation would further help the necessary rebalancing.

THE MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONTEXT
A. Current Situation
4.
After moderating sharply in 2012, GDP growth appears to have bottomed. Facing
strong headwinds from the global economy, GDP growth slowed to 2 percent in 2012. Export growth
stalled to a mere 0.4 percent, while fixed investment, strongly related to exports, contracted by
1.7 percent. Held back by high household debt, private consumption growth remained tepid.
However, activity has bottomed and the economy expanded by 1.1 percent in Q2 and Q3 2013, with
exports rebounding strongly and private consumption and construction strengthening, due in part to
low base, but also to a pickup in wage growth and policies to reinvigorate the housing market.
5.
Inflation has been subdued, due to the absence of demand pressures and moderating
commodity prices. Inflation fell from 4.2 percent in 2011 to 1.4 percent in 2012 (end of period), well
below the target band of 2½–3½ percent, as the economy weakened and food prices fell. In
addition, government subsidies for child care and education costs reduced inflation by around
0.4 percentage point. As a result, headline inflation remained in the 1–1½ percent range during the
first half of 2013, falling to 0.7 percent in October, while core inflation was muted, though stable, at
around 1½ percent during 2013.

Box 1. Is Korea A Safer-Haven?1
To assess prospects for the continuation of Korea’s newly-acquired safe haven status, staff estimated a
model of capital flows in the presence of unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and including both
push and pull factors:1
Key findings:

 QE operations or announcements were found to have had generally little or no direct influence on
capital flows to Korea. The only significant exception was cross-border banking capital flows.
 While the indirect effects of QE, through financial prices, seem to be significant, impulse responses
indicate the existence of an important nonlinear behavior. In particular, bond inflows demonstrate a
“safe-haven” behavior (i.e., flows increase with higher VIX), until the risk aversion has reached
certain threshold levels. The threshold, which is time-varying, and is now about 40 (about one
standard deviation above the median of VIX during the sample period). Bond flows start to
decrease with higher VIX, when VIX rises beyond this threshold.
 Overall, the indirect effects point to a largely positive impact of QE on capital flows through the
alleviation of risk aversion (captured by VIX) and global dollar liquidity stress (represented by the
LIBOR-OIS spread).
Implication:

 A growth-driven smooth QE exit, which leaves long-term U.S. rates anchored and does not hurt U.S.
investor confidence, is unlikely to cause capital outflows from Korea, and could even cause inflows
to Korean equity and bank debt through positive signaling effects associated with an orderly
steepening of the yield curve.
 However, a disorderly QE exit, that pushes up the VIX and/or the LIBOR- OIS spread would likely
cause capital outflows. The negative effects would likely be exacerbated, particularly for bond flows,
if the unwinding of bond positions causes dislocation of the onshore dollar funding market. For
equities, the impact would be unambiguously negative. But for bonds, the impact of a spike in the
VIX could be positive so long as it stays within about one standard deviation from the historical
median.

________________

The model is estimated as yth = ah+ b1hxth+ b2hzth + b2h*UMPt +uth , for t=1, …, T
(yth: capital flows of type h, from an array comprising portfolio bond, portfolio equity, and bank flows, xth t: m×1
h
vector of push factors, zt :n×1 vector of pull factors, UMPt: n×1 vector of UMP proxy variables). The regression
uses weekly data (from January 2008 to June 2013) compiled by the Korea Exchange as the dependent variable for
portfolio (equity and bonds) flows. For banking flows, monthly balance of payment data are used. For proxies of
UMP, the regression uses the weekly change in the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve of the amount
outstanding of unconventional operational measures. An event dummy variable is also included to capture the
impact of QE announcements. For QQME, the BOJ’s monthly balance sheet data are used. A standard set of
independent variables, mainly financial market indicators, are used as control variables.

Korea’s high interconnectedness
exposes it to external shocks. Korea’s trade
openness is about twice as high as the OECD
average (54 percent of GDP), with main exposures
to China, the U.S., the E.U. and Japan and
significant value chain links with these and other
Asian countries. Financial ties are primarily with
the U.S. and U.K. For instance, foreign bank claims
on Korea are large and are mostly held by U.K. and
U.S. banks, while exposure to euro area banks is
relatively limited. Foreign holdings of portfolio
capital amount to 40 percent of GDP.

The current account surplus has widened to a record high, while capital flows remain
moderate. Despite fears related to the depreciation of the yen against the won, exports have
rebounded in October by 7 percent, after growing 2–2½ percent for most of 2013, reflecting the
strong competitiveness of Korea’s world-class electronics, at the same time as much weaker imports.
As a result, the current account (CA) surplus is projected to widen to around 5½ percent of GDP in
2013. In the first half of 2013, steady bond inflows were offset by equity outflows. However, the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s decision in August to delay QE tapering prompted a sustained pickup in equity
inflows. Meanwhile, banks have been repaying external loans and Korean corporates continued to
invest overseas, resulting in overall negative net capital flows—not large enough, however, to offset
the current account surplus. Thus, the exchange rate has been under upward pressure.

The external sector position is substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies and external imbalances have widened. The 2013 External
Sector Report (ESR) assessed Korea’s 2012 CA balance to be 1–4 percent of GDP above the level
implied by fundamentals and desirable policies (“norm”). Refinements in the staff estimate of the
norm (in particular updated estimate of the social spending norm) and actual developments have
contributed to an updated EBA estimate of a CA gap of around 4 percent reflecting in part fiscal
policies in the rest of the world1. Given that Korea’s terms of trade changes may not be fully captured
in the exercise, staff assesses that the CA is now around 3–4 percent above the norm. An updated
EBA estimate for Korea finds that the REER is 8 percent below equilibrium, relative to 11 percent in
the June 2013 EBA. While the exchange rate has appreciated recently, updates to the social spending
norm have led to a higher norm, indicating continued undervaluation. Staff therefore continues to
assess that the exchange rate remains moderately undervalued in the range of 2–8 percent, with the
upper end of the range seeming more plausible in light of the recent widening of the current
account surplus.2 Also the lower end of the range is derived as the deviation from historical average,
which is not necessarily a valid equilibrium benchmark. Reserves rose to US$343 billion in October
2013 (US$ 16 billion above end-2012), broadly unchanged at 130 percent of the IMF’s adequacy
metric. The BOK’s forward position has risen by US$ 7 billion since end-2012, which may have further
mitigated appreciation pressures (see Box 1). Korea’s international investment position is modest at
around -9 percent of GDP, and has been improving in line with CA surpluses.

1

The External Sustainability Approach of the EBA points to a CA gap of 2½ percent, but is given less weight due to
uncertainty involved in defining the benchmark NFA level.

The exchange rate assessment provided in this report refers to developments in the REER up to December 2013.

As noted in the Financial System Stability Assessment, Korea’s financial system is sound
though household and corporate debt levels are high. Domestic banks are well capitalized, with
an average capital adequacy ratio of 14.3 percent during Q3 2013, and have markedly enhanced their
foreign currency liquidity positions since the global financial crisis. Depository institutions’ lending
growth to the household sector has continued to decline, increasing by 3.2 percent annually as of
end-June 2013, down from a double-digit peak prior to the crisis. However, lending by nondepository institutions continues to be brisk, up 13 percent annually over the same period. Overall,
household and corporate debt levels (based on OECD data, which includes private and state-owned
enterprises) reached 76 percent and 164 percent of GDP as of end-2012, respectively.

Housing prices in Seoul continue to
decline, but have leveled off in the rest of
Korea. These developments reflect a large
inventory of unsold homes and limited
expectations of price appreciation. The authorities
introduced various temporary measures—including
tax breaks—to revive housing transactions, but
volumes have remained low after a spike in mid2013, when these measures expired.

Staff Views
11.
The economy appears set for a modest recovery while inflation is expected to remain
muted. Real GDP growth is projected to reach 2.8 percent in 2013 and strengthen further to
3.7 percent in 2014. In 2014, domestic demand is expected to strengthen as consumption and
investment recover supported by higher wages and stronger exports respectively, as well as a bounce
back from the low base. In line with the authorities, staff expects a negative output gap to persist in
2014, with inflation returning to the target band only in late 2014, assuming that the one-off effect of
government subsidies on inflation disappears.
12.
Risks to the near-term outlook are to the downside. The main risks to the short-term
outlook are external given Korea’s openness to global trade and finance. The key ones include a
disorderly exit from quantitative easing in the U.S., re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area,
and deeper-than-expected slowdown in emerging markets, especially China (see Appendix 1). While
Korea is unlikely to be much affected by mild turmoil from U.S. monetary policy normalization, more
severe turmoil would have considerable knock-on effects.3 The main near-term domestic risk is
protracted sluggish demand reflecting notably high household and corporate debt and uncertainty

In the immediate aftermath of the May 22 QE tapering announcement, Korea faced small outflows from the equity
market, after which inflows resumed and the country was treated as a “safer” haven.

about the outlook and policies4, which will weigh on both consumption and investment. In the longer
run, weak household income growth, deleveraging needs, and conservative fiscal plans mean that
demand is likely to remain highly dependent on net exports. On the supply side, the structural
reforms implemented may be insufficient to stem the further fall in growth potential implied by rapid
population aging.
Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities’ broadly concurred with staff on the near-term outlook and risks. They
expect that growth will rise back to potential in 2014 (3.9 percent) as a result of the more favorable
world economic outlook, lagged effect of the stimulative policies of 2013, and reduced uncertainty as
the government enters the second year of its term. They viewed possible disruptive QE tapering as the
key external risk. While they agreed that Korea has become more resilient to external shocks, they
noted that its “safer haven” status still has to be tested.

C. Near-Term Policies
Staff Views
14.
A supplementary budget rendered the 2013 fiscal stance slightly expansionary and the
2014 budget proposal, if approved, would be less expansionary than the 2013 budget. The
supplementary budget of 1¼ percent of GDP was adopted in May to authorize borrowing to make
up for a large revenue shortfall and finance a spending increase of around ½ percent of GDP. The
government also postponed to 2017 the deadline for broadly restoring balance. The proposed 2014
budget keeps the overall deficit unchanged from the 2013 supplementary budget (at 1.8 in percent
of GDP). However, revenues have slipped further, likely leading to a larger-than-budgeted deficit
(2.1 percent of GDP) in 2013. Thus, without a supplementary budget, the 2014 budget would entail a
slight withdrawal of fiscal impulse, and automatic spending cuts on top if there are further revenue
short falls. This could unhelpfully dampen the recovery.
15.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and provides
significant space for countercyclical use in both directions. The Bank of Korea cut its policy rate
to 2.5 percent in May 2013, amid the uncertain global outlook, the continued negative output gap,
and subdued inflation. However, looking ahead, growth is expected to strengthen over the next 6
quarters, and the previous loosening still has to fully work through the economy, suggesting little
need for further cuts. This will also avoid fueling further household indebtedness. With inflationary
pressures muted, monetary policy normalization should start only when the recovery is firmly
established and there is confidence that the output gap will close soon.
16.
Exchange rate policy has entailed active intervention at times, in both directions, but
asymmetrically. Staff analysis, based on estimates of the rise in reserves unexplained by interest
income and spikes in the FX forward positions around periods of appreciation, suggests that
intervention has tended to be more active in the face of appreciation (Box 2). The won should
continue to be market determined, and intervention (either in spot or forward markets) limited to
smoothing excessive volatility in the event of disorderly market conditions and not to influence the
pace of appreciation toward the equilibrium level. Reserves are adequate and there is no need for
4

Policy uncertainty comes primarily from the fact that many of the government’s broad reform directions have yet to
be translated into concrete laws or regulations. This reflects in part polarization-induced paralysis in the National
Assembly.

further accumulation relative to the range of metrics. Any additional accumulation should be carried
out by the BOK rather than by increasing government borrowing. Over the medium term, greater
exchange rate appreciation would encourage reallocation of resources to the non-tradables sector,
thereby further supporting rebalancing.
17.
Korea has strong buffers and should use its ample policy space to deal with large
shocks. In the event of a sharp external downside scenario, it can deploy supportive monetary and
fiscal policies. In addition, in case of sharp capital outflows, it can use its large foreign exchange
reserves buffer, allow exchange rate depreciation—the authorities appropriately used both responses
in the aftermath of May 22 and could do the same as needed—and deploy crisis response tools used
in 2008 such as the BOK’s foreign exchange swap with domestic banks, and even government
guarantee on banks’ short-term external debt. If the domestic risk of the vicious cycle between weak
domestic demand, tepid household income and high household indebtedness materializes and leads
to sub-potential growth, the authorities could deploy supportive fiscal policy, as well as monetary
loosening, and accelerate structural reforms.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The main near-term policy challenge, in the authorities’ view, is to support the
recovery while moving to a medium-term fiscal consolidation path. On the one hand, they aim
to continue supporting the recovery in the near term, including by proposing the same deficit in the
2014 budget as in 2013 budget. On the other hand, the government intends to resume fiscal
consolidation over the medium term, citing the need for fiscal prudence and their expectation that
private demand will revive next year, allowing for gradual withdrawal of fiscal impulse.
19.
The authorities viewed the current monetary policy stance as accommodative, and
argued that the won is in line with fundamentals. Given the level of the policy rate, they viewed
the room to cut more limited than in large open or closed economies, given Korea’s exposure to
capital flows volatility. They did not view high household debt as a significant constraint on monetary
policy for now, in either direction. They disagreed with staff’s assessment that the won is moderately
undervalued, noting its appreciation since 2012. They stressed that smoothing operations are
restricted to alleviating excessive exchange rate volatility in the face of market herding.

TACKLING THE WEAKNESS OF DOMESTIC DEMAND
For a sustained and inclusive recovery, policies need to break the nexus among weak household income
generation, suppressed domestic demand, and high indebtedness. This entails redirecting savings from
the corporate sector and government to boost households’ incomes, as well as labor market reforms.

A. Background
20.
Sluggish domestic demand has rendered Korea highly dependent on, and susceptible
to, fluctuations in global demand. Since 2005, domestic demand, like household disposable
income, has grown by about 1 percentage point less than real GDP on average, primarily due to
weak private consumption growth. As a result, the economy is heavily reliant on external demand,
which explains about 60 percent of the quarterly variation in growth since 2003. Rebalancing the
engine of growth toward domestic demand would deliver both higher living standards and lower

Households have responded to their
muted disposable income growth by reducing
savings and compressing consumption. Private consumption growth has averaged 3.7 percent on
average since 2000, about ½ percentage point below real GDP growth. During the same period, the

12

household saving rate fell to 4.7 percent, well below the OECD average of 5.9 percent. The squeeze
on consumption and savings has been disproportionately intense for lower income households, amid
rising inequality. With household debt now reaching 136 percent of disposable income, many
households’ ability to consume is getting constrained.

Increasing government transfers. Korea's social spending is low by international standards:
staff estimates a gap of about 6 percent of GDP between Korea and its OECD peers5. There is
adequate fiscal space to narrow the gap (see below), through a combination of a lower
government savings and higher tax revenues. Better targeting of existing transfers to lowerincome households, who have a high propensity to consume, would also help. Such transfers
would not only boost income but also possibly reduce precautionary saving.

Advancing labor market policies that raise the share of salaried wage income and the
number of wage earners in each household. There is no evidence that wages of regular
workers are low by international standards; however regular workers account for a low share of

female participation would raise household disposable income. The former could also further
contribute to redirect corporate savings to households (see next section).

C. Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities argued that the lingering weakness of domestic demand is primarily
cyclical, but also saw structural factors. They expect the cyclical drag to subside once policy
uncertainty diminishes and the new government’s growth-supporting measures take effect, and
when exports durably pickup. They noted they have an extensive agenda to combat the structural
drag, including ramping up social transfers and labor market reforms to improve the wages and
social protection of non-regular workers. They acknowledged that financing higher social spending
amid the medium-term consolidation plans is a challenge. The authorities agreed that the current
taxation of capital income is non-neutral and that the exemptions on capital gains tax coupled with
partial double-taxation of dividends may be a disincentive to dividend payouts. The government’s
Medium-to-Long term Tax Policy includes a higher capital gains tax on equity as a possible avenue
for revenue raising.

ARRESTING THE DECLINE OF GROWTH POTENTIAL
Given rapid population aging, only a comprehensive package of reforms to preserve the size of the
workforce and boost service sector productivity could maintain potential growth at around 3½ to
4 percent during the next 10 years, and strengthen its inclusiveness.

A. Background
25.
Korea’s growth has been on a declining trend after decades of robust and sustained
growth. Staff estimates that Korea’s potential growth decreased from around 7 percent during
1990-97 to 4¾ percent during 2000-07 and further to 3¼–3½ percent in 2011–12, with a slight
increase in contributions of total factor productivity and labor inputs outstripped by a decline in the
contribution of physical capital.
26.
Going forward, population aging will be a major further drag on potential growth. On
current trends, the working age population is projected to peak in 2016, and Korea is expected to
become one of the oldest countries in the OECD by 2050, with the dependency ratio increasing
rapidly. As a result, without offsetting policies, Korea’s potential growth would decrease to around
2–2½ percent by 2025 and its per capita GDP would cease to converge and instead plateau at the
present rate (about 65 percent of the U.S. level).
27.
Labor market duality and low
employment of segments of the population are
key impediments to higher and more inclusive
growth. Korea’s employment rate is below the
OECD average, particularly for women—their
participation rate was around 60 percent in 2012
compared to 70−80 percent in the most advanced
countries—and for young males, due to high
enrollment in tertiary education, mandatory military
service and a widening skills mismatch. Moreover,
there is a very high share of temporary, self14

employed and part-time workers (together over half of the labor force). This dualism stems from
high protection for regular workers, which leads firms to favor hiring less costly non-regular workers.
The latter receive little training, which negatively impacts productivity. Moreover, because of high
wage costs due to a seniority–based wage system, firms tend to push workers to retire before the
mandatory retirement age (which averaged 57 years in 2010). Given the low pension replacement
rates, such workers then tend to become non-regular workers or self-employed in the services sector
with much lower productivity.
28.
Another drag on potential growth results from low productivity in the services sector.
Korea has a world-class manufacturing sector, but services sector productivity is just around half that
of manufacturing (against an OECD average of
Facilities Investment in Manufacturing and
Services (Scaled by Gross Value Added)
87 percent), and investment in services has

also reflects the role of the services sector as de facto
social safety net.

B. Staff Views
29.
Reforms to increase labor force participation are key to boosting potential growth.
Further increasing investment in public childcare and childcare benefits, facilitating part-time work,
and building on substantial progress to achieve full tax neutrality for second wage earners could
boost female participation enough to critically support potential growth. Further efforts to reduce
skill mismatches including through vocational training, improving youth access to information on
career opportunities and including job-search techniques in school curricula would boost youth
participation in the workforce.
30.
Efforts to reduce labor market duality should be stepped up. Broadening the access to
training opportunities and improving social coverage for non-regular workers would raise
productivity and reduce precautionary saving. To preserve overall employment, some changes in
regular workers’ contracts may be needed, including moving to performance rather than senioritybased wage, reducing the relatively high degree of employment protection, and accelerating the
shift from mandatory retirement allowance to corporate pension schemes with defined contributions
or defined benefits. An important step in this direction was taken in May 2013, when the Federation
of Korean Trade Unions, Korea Employers Federation, and the government signed a grand bargain
(Tripartite Jobs Pact to Achieve 70 percent Employment Rate). This called for employers to adopt a
legally protected minimum retirement age and for unions to accept performance-based wage.
However, with implementation of the wage reform left to be negotiated at firm level, there is a risk
that in many cases only the increase in minimum retirement age would become binding. This could
place an unsustainable burden on some firms, leading them to shut down or cut jobs to survive.

31.
Boosting services sector productivity is also imperative but will take politically and
socially difficult steps.


Considerable productivity gains could be achieved by deregulating health, education, and
legal and other protected professions, and network services (such as rail and utilities).
Promoting greater competition in intra-group service provision within the chaebols would
also help. Together, these steps would attract investment to these sectors, create jobs, and
foster greater efficiency, which would filter through to the rest of the economy.



The services sector also comprises a myriad of small and unprofitable SMEs that depend on
government guarantees, subsidies, and protections for their survival. Such features that
prolong the life of unviable enterprises impair productivity. Loan guarantees should thus
expire after a few years, and banks be encouraged to develop risk management practices
that allow them to provide non-guaranteed funding to viable SMEs. Reducing information
asymmetries, e.g., via credit bureaus, would be essential to this process. Until then, policy
banks should refocus their lending toward SMEs. As well, efforts are needed to revive access
of SMEs to capital markets. An expansion of the social safety net would be a prerequisite to
the acceptability of these reforms.



Additionally, tax breaks and financial support that disproportionally benefit manufacturing
should be eliminated over time.

32.
The benefits of comprehensive structural reforms are likely considerable, though the
reform agenda should be carefully sequenced. Staff simulations suggest that a comprehensive
package may enable Korea to continue with a potential growth of 3½ to 4 percent over the next 10
years. However, in order to do so the government has to fully implement current plans (to boost
labor force participation, reduce duality and deregulate certain services) and further intensify reform
efforts6. This could enable Korea to reach per capita GDP of US$48,000 by 2025 (71 percent of the
projected U.S. level).

C. Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities shared staff’s views that addressing labor market duality and low
participation is essential to sustained and inclusive growth. Indeed, the government has a broad
reform agenda to tackle labor market duality and boost the employment rate to 70 percent by 2017
(from 64 percent). The “70 percent Roadmap” shifts the focus of job creation from current male,
manufacturing and conglomerates toward female, services and SMEs. It also focuses on increasing
youth and aged employment and improving work-life balance by cutting long working hours.
Regarding duality, they considered the existence of different work modalities a natural outcome in
the labor market. Their priority is to expand social insurance, including through subsidizing lowincome employees of SMEs, eliminate discrimination for non-regular workers, and increase mobility
between regular and non-regular workers.

6

Staff’s baseline projections assume concerted structural reforms (beyond current plans) but do not assume
implementation of recommended reforms to the fiscal framework.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

34.
The authorities welcomed staff’s recommendation to boost services sector
productivity. They also concurred that further deregulation and competition is needed, as well as
higher investment in this sector. They noted that FTAs with the U.S. and E.U. will help in this regard,
particularly in markets for legal services and accounting. The authorities stressed that deregulation
should be sequenced along with strengthening the social safety net. They viewed boosting service
sector productivity as the key pillar, along with fostering venture capitalism, in the government’s
creative economy initiative. Both deregulation and convergence of services with information and
communication technology would be necessary to achieve this.
35.
The authorities argued that despite imperfections, SME guarantees should be provided
for the time being. They view the credit guarantee system as important in that it enables financial
access to SMEs which lack collateral and corrects information asymmetry and limitations pertaining
to banks’ credit scoring systems. However, the government is continuously making efforts to contain
moral hazard by reducing long-term guarantees.

A MORE GROWTH-FRIENDLY FISCAL FRAMEWORK
There is a strong case for cautious recalibration of the fiscal framework to make it more supportive of
growth, in two ways: enhanced countercyclicality (via higher automatic stabilizers and a structural
balance rule), and more fiscal space (via lower medium-term government saving and a broader tax
base), to help address structurally weak domestic demand and large social spending needs. This can be
done while fully providing for rising aging costs.

A. Background
36.
Korea’s long record of fiscal prudence has been an anchor of macroeconomic stability
but the framework that delivers it could be more efficient. Fiscal discipline relies primarily on
strict borrowing and asset sale constraints on the central government set in annual budgets, and
indicative medium-term fiscal plans that aim to gradually eliminate the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding social security) and eventually reduce public debt to about 30 percent of GDP. Automatic
stabilizers are weak by advanced economies standards, reflecting a low taxes-low transfers system
that provides little cushion during downturns. As a result, Korea has relied mostly on politically
contentious supplementary budgets to provide stimulus during slowdowns. Otherwise, revenue
shortfalls naturally occurring in downturns have to be offset by spending cuts. The tax base is also
very narrow.7

The conditional revenue gap—i.e., difference between actual tax revenue and what should be collected given the tax
and economic structure—at 7.4 percent of GDP, is one of OECD’s largest; see Fiscal Monitor (2013, October)

Korea enjoys low gross debt and large assets, implying an impressive net creditor

which are deemed large. Of this, 31 percent corresponds to the assets of the National Pension Fund
that can fully meet its pension obligations through 20608. The government views the large asset

B. Staff Views
A More Countercyclical, Rules-Based Fiscal Framework
38.
The fiscal framework should aim to strike a balance between short- and medium-term
flexibility and long-term prudence.


Short-run: the existing annual financing constraints allow for only limited scope for countercyclical policies that risk being less timely and targeted than automatic stabilizers. There is
room to enhance the degree of counter-cyclicality of fiscal policy in Korea.9



Medium-term: the indicative fiscal plans imply an overly contractionary fiscal policy stance
that would exacerbate existing external macroeconomic imbalances and provide insufficient
support for domestic demand. In particular, without tax reform to boost revenues, they
would hinder enhancing social spending needed to kick start structural reforms. The
government has a record of flexibly adjusting these medium-term plans, but this approach
creates policy uncertainty.



Long-term: the fiscal framework should ensure sustainability in the face of population aging.
Budget spending on health, old age pension supplement and other pension schemes outside
the national Pension Fund, is expected to increase by about 3.4 and 6.8 percent of GDP in net
present value terms through 2030 and 2050, respectively. To ensure the long term
sustainability of public finances, reforms that enhance labor force participation and boost
potential growth are critical, albeit they have fiscal costs.

This is a key difference with, for example, Japan where the bulk of the debt build-up since the early 1990s reflected
rising but unfunded pension costs.

39.
Moving towards a structural rule-based fiscal framework would ensure timeconsistency in policy objectives. A structural budget balance rule for the general government
would allow timely counter-cyclical policies and reduce uncertainties over medium-term policy
objectives. Such rules are being adopted by a growing number of countries, including by most of the
EMU countries, the United Kingdom and Colombia. A key element of such a rule is a structural
balance target, underpinned by a prudent level of debt, and accounting for the expected increase in
spending due to demographics. The structural balance target should be revised every 3–5 years to
reflect updated actuarial projections of pension schemes as well as health spending, long-term debt
sustainability assessment as well as risk-based assessment of contingent liabilities. Within these
constraints, the target can be calibrated to allow space to boost productive social spending and
address macroeconomic imbalances.
40.
Well-designed complementary mechanisms would ensure credibility and support the
implementation of such a rule. An automatic mechanism to correct for past deviations from the
balance rule would provide a medium-term anchor. Escape clauses would ensure needed flexibility in
the face of low automatic stabilizers to address large adverse shocks. A politically independent fiscal
council with mandate and expertise to analyze policy proposals, could monitor the implementation
of numerical rules, and propose revisions to the structural target would be essential for credibility.

Fiscal Space
41.
Staff analysis suggests that it would be helpful, and safe, for general government
savings to be reduced, in structural terms. Considering debt-stabilizing conditions, a prudent level
of debt and projected aging costs and their current financing schemes, a medium-term consolidated
government deficit of up to 1¼ percent of GDP excluding the National Pension Fund (compared to
the zero balance targeted by the current indicative rule) would still allow the debt to GDP ratio to
decline for a prolonged period of time. This would leave ample time for reforms to rebalance the
economy and contain long-term aging costs (see Box 3). This fiscal space can be used to finance the
reforms discussed previously to support domestic demand and boost the growth potential (see
Box 3). Once the economy rebalances, the structural balance target can be recalibrated.
42.
Additional fiscal space could be generated through revenue measures concentrating on
gradually broadening tax bases. There is considerable scope for both efficiency and equity gains
(Box 4). The average effective personal income tax rate is one of the lowest in OECD, and for the
median wage earner is close to zero. The base should be broadened by gradually eliminating the
wage and other deductions while providing targeted support through social spending. VAT should
be extended, notably to all new real state supplies, including the value of land, insurance and
financial services, and suppliers to exporters. The corporate income tax is a source of multiple
distortions that could usefully be streamlined, in particular there is a need to move toward neutrality
in taxing various sources of capital income.

Safeguards
43.
The government has ample financial assets to contain fiscal risks stemming from
medium-term structural loosening. As noted above the government has a large net creditor
position, even after ring-fencing the assets of the national pension system.

Box 3. Towards a Rules-Based Fiscal Framework1/
A structural balance target would enhance counter-cyclicality and ensure time-consistency
between policy objectives. A structural balance rule—such as the one mandated by the 2012 EU
Fiscal Governance Reform—allows the budget balance target to be adjusted every year for the output
gap, therefore enabling the free operation of automatic stabilizers The balance target should be
regarded as the lower bound for fiscal policy and set in such a way that it ensures convergence of the
debt-to-GDP ratio towards a prudent level while incorporating projected ageing costs.
The debt ceiling on which to anchor the rule should not exceed the lower bound of a safe range
of public debt levels. Following Debrun et al. (forthcoming)* the safe level of public debt can be
defined as the maximum stock of gross financial liabilities the government can stabilize under highly
adverse interest rate-growth conditions while generating the highest plausible primary surpluses. As
such, the safe level of debt ensures sustainability even in case of large adverse shocks. The safe level of
debt for Korea is estimated to be around 65–70 percent of GDP, with robustness tests pointing to a
prudent lower bound at about 55 percent of GDP.
Korea faces rapid population ageing, transforming the country from the third-youngest
currently to the second-oldest in OECD by 2050. Unless mitigated by policy actions, this trend will
have profound effects not only on health and pension spending but also on potential per capita
growth, which matters for debt sustainability.



The actuarial deficit of the National Pension Fund through 2060 is estimated to amount to about
30 percent of GDP but is fully covered by accumulated assets. The means-tested basic old-age
benefit is expected to increase by at least 1.5 percent of GDP by 2050.



Health spending is projected to increase by about 3 percent of GDP by 2030, reaching close to
8 percent of GDP by 2050.

Simulations suggest that, under current policies, Korea can safely allow for a modest structural
loosening in the medium term. The simulations are based on the authorities’ current policies and
staff’s medium-term projections, assuming slight deterioration in the long-run interest-growth
differential once the economy converges. While the National Pension Fund is ring-fenced (i.e., higher
spending is not debt-creating), other pension spending is fully passed through to the costs. Following
current policies 80 percent of the increase in health spending is assumed to be covered by annual
increases in health premiums. The accompanying chart shows the debt dynamics under two scenarios.
First, keeping the medium-term structural target (excl.

Reforms should be geared towards optimizing the tax structure to alleviate macroeconomic
imbalances.



Property taxation. Despite recent reductions, it is still tilted towards taxing transactions, potentially
weighing on the functioning of the real estate market. Shifting to recurrent taxes on property would
enhance efficiency.



Employment. Current policies to use CIT exemptions to create employment opportunities can be
counterproductive. Since CIT is a tax on profits (the return to investment), CIT exemptions induce
corporations to substitute away from labor towards capital. In this manner current exemptions can
contribute to capital intensive manufacturing and low-skilled intensive services.



Income distortions. The taxation of capital income should aim to achieve the greatest possible
degree of neutrality, to avoid various distortions in the economy and incentives to artificially
transform one type of capital income into another. Deductibility of interest expense leads to a bias
towards debt financing. Exemptions for many categories of taxpayers on capital gains could
incentivize excess accumulation of retained earnings. Similarly, there is no clear rationale for even
partial double taxation of dividends; this deters households from diversifying their portfolios towards
ownership of shares.



Inequality. The wide range of deduction and exemptions under PIT are considerably dampening
progressivity. High deductions benefit disproportionately more well-off taxpayers as poorer do not
have sufficient income to benefit from deductions. Attempts to curtail personal income tax
exemptions should move in tandem with efforts to close self-employed tax loopholes.

There is scope to contain long-term aging costs. Increasing the retirement ages in both
the private and public sectors would enhance sustainability in the face of increasing longevity.
Boosting participation and reducing labor market duality will reduce the costs linked to the basic
pension scheme. Payroll contribution rates in Korea are currently very low and it should be possible
to raise them with limited impact on participation given the highly credible link between current
contributions and future pensions, and low participation tax rates. Korea’s rapid excess cost growth

in health10 suggests ample scope to curtail future health costs growth, including with policies to
reduce expenditure on pharmaceutical drugs, eliminate incentives for a high number of visits, and
reduce hospitals’ role in providing long-term care.
45.
Greater transparency on fiscal risks would be desirable particularly, but not only, in the
event of the new rules-based framework. While fiscal risks arising from direct credit guarantees
are manageable,11 state-owned-enterprise debt, some of which reflects quasi-fiscal activities, is high
(estimated at 38.8 percent of GDP as of end-2012 with incomplete coverage, albeit their net debt is 19 percent of GDP), and policy banks own about a quarter of the system-wide loan book, exposing
the public sector to contingent liabilities. The government’s plans to expand the monitoring system
to cover assets and liabilities of the whole public sector are welcome; the budget should include a
comprehensive assessment of established fiscal risks.

C. Authorities’ Views
46.
While the recommendation to adopt a structural balance rule was received with
interest, the authorities do not plan to loosen fiscal policy in the medium term. The authorities
recognized that a structural balance rule would be desirable on macroeconomic stabilization
grounds. However, it was considered hard to implement and potentially hostage to political
difficulties. Instead, the authorities intend to proceed with the adoption of a “PAYGO” scheme on a
central government level that requires fiscal neutrality of any new policy changes, thus favoring
stronger fiscal discipline to any loss in cyclical stabilization. In a similar vein, against the background
of high exposure to external shocks, looming aging costs and potential geopolitical risks arising from
North Korea, the authorities did not view structural fiscal loosening in the medium-term as prudent
and aim, for now, to follow the planned consolidation path12.
47.
The authorities intend to gradually increase social spending financed by broadening
the tax base. To achieve both an expanded welfare state and the medium-term consolidation
objectives, the authorities plan to broaden the revenue base and reallocate spending, rather than
increase debt. They plan to reduce tax expenditures, strictly apply sunset clauses and tackle tax
evasion. Although preferential treatment of specific industries has decreased over time, wide tax
exemptions to invest in new technologies, attract FDI, and support SMEs remain a part of the
authorities’ strategy to create employment. A high level commission has been set up by the
President to consider the pros and cons of moving over time to a higher welfare-higher taxes system.

10

The Excess Cost Growth (ECG) captures the excess in real per capita health expenditures over the growth in real per
capita GDP after the effect of demographic changes has been netted out. Staff estimates that the ECG forms about
two-thirds of the total increase in health cost in Korea through 2030, one of the highest in the OECD.

11

Total credit guarantees to SOEs are estimated at around 2.4 percent of GDP, whereas guarantees issued by funds to
support SMEs constitute another 6.1 percent of GDP.

12

As such, staff’s baseline projections do not build in the desired structural decline in savings, but do envisage a
slower consolidation path than in the authorities’ medium term fiscal framework stemming from the need to support
the economy in the near term and avoiding imparting an overly contractionary fiscal impulse in the medium term.

TOWARDS A MORE GROWTH-ENHANCING AND
STABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
The 2013 FSAP found the near-term vulnerabilities of the Korean financial sector limited, but exposures
to household and corporate debt warrant close monitoring. Over the medium term, the financial system
should play a greater role in supporting growth, including by reducing government intervention. A
more formalized macroprudential institutional setup, with a stronger role for BOK, would be beneficial.

A. Background
48.
The resilience of the Korean financial system has increased since 2008 as a result of
concerted policy efforts. Banks’ liquidity profiles have improved markedly due to well designed
macroprudential requirements, as reflected in lower external debt and FX liquidity mismatches.
Owing in part to preemptive capital injections by the public sector, banks’ capital adequacy is sound.
In addition, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are below 1 percent, reflecting, in part, active disposal of
bad assets.

Banks’ profitability has continued to decline. Since 2008, profitability has been hampered
by low interest rates and elevated credit costs, as well as informal guidance on banks’ pricing. The
return on assets of commercial banks in 2012 was only ½ percent, compared to 1–1¼ percent in

50.
Credit risks at some non-bank financial institutions have increased. Stricter bank
regulations led to a shift of household borrowing to this sector, which accounted for 47 percent of
household credit at end-2012. The share of delinquent loans in some of these institutions is now
relatively high, and stress tests suggest that some have relatively thin buffers against credit shocks.

51.
While household debt is high, it is covered by household assets to a large extent,
mitigating near-term financial sector risks. At 136 percent of disposable income as of end-2012,
household debt is high compared with OECD peers, and has been rising. Debt owed by households
with low debt servicing capacity (debt service-to-income ratio over 40 percent) reached 33 percent at
end-2012. However, household debt deemed to be at risk accounts for only 0.7 percent of total debt,
13

than in Korea in 23 countries.

once the high asset buffers (mostly real estate) are accounted for. It is estimated to increase to
0.9 percent in the event of a 300 bps rise in interest rates. In the near term, short of a sizable housing
price shock, financial stability risks appear limited to certain household segments—including lowincome, older and self-employed.
52.
Corporate sector vulnerabilities show a marked duality. Corporate sector leverage is high
and concentrated and corporate debt (based on OECD data, which includes private and state-owned
enterprises) was at 127 percent of equity at endOECD Countries: Corporate Sector Leverage

vulnerable sectors accounted for 33 percent of
aggregate corporate debt at end-2012.

B. Staff Views
53.
Impediments to the financial sector contributing more to growth should be removed.
As noted above, SME financing needs an overhaul. The drivers of weak banking sector profitability
should also be addressed. These include curbing pressures on banks to cut interest rates and fees
which may depress bank profits and limit the availability of credit for higher risk borrowers. In this
regard, a balance needs to be found between consumer protection and banks’ soundness; and in
removing disincentives for banks to engage in more extensive risk-taking and innovation, thus
enhancing their ability to support growth. Caution is warranted with regard to the policy to
encourage banks to expand overseas, given potential stability risks. Policies to this end should be
complemented by more robust cross-border framework for bank regulation and supervision to
mitigate possible negative spillovers.
54.
FSAP stress tests suggest that the Korean banking system appears sound. Banks remain
solvent under extreme growth shocks or a protracted economic slowdown. Their foreign currency
liquidity positions are robust, with a small but manageable liquidity shortage emerging only under
an extreme scenario.

end-2012, the four “national champions” accounted
for a staggering share –about 30 percent—of the aggregate retained earnings of Korean listed companies.
Weaker profitability has impaired the ability of
corporates to deleverage further and to meet
interest expenses. The aggregate debt at risk of
the corporate sector—i.e. the debt of financially
distressed corporates whose earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT) cannot cover their interest
expenses—stood at 29 percent of corporate debt at
end-2012, only marginally lower than the 31
percent at end-2008 (Figure). The share of
financially distressed companies has also edged up
since 2010, but remains lower than in 2008,
suggesting that now risks are concentrated in
somewhat larger companies.

distressed companies is considered at risk.

Vulnerabilities are concentrated in certain sectors—construction, cross-border transportation and
shipbuilding—that have been impacted particularly negatively by the growth slowdown and the
sluggish property sector. Cross-border transportation and construction are considerably more leveraged
than other industries, and both sectors had negative profitability in 2011 and 2012. All three sectors have
debt at risk that has been higher than for other corporates, over 40 percent of corporate debt in the crossborder transportation and shipbuilding sectors. The shipbuilding industry, while still profitable, remains
vulnerable to the shift towards lower upfront installments in the global shipbuilding industry and more
limited bank funding. Their impact on aggregate corporate sector risks is non-trivial, as they collectively
accounted for 26 percent of corporate assets at end-2012.

The analysis of the corporate sector is based on Worldscope data which includes listed companies, some of

55.
While near-term risks of high household and corporate sector debt appear muted, they
warrant continued close monitoring. Given the sensitivity of asset quality to adverse interest rate
or growth shocks, close monitoring of exposure risks and associated provisioning should continue.
Separately, it is important to minimize moral hazard in household and corporate debt workout

programs. The authorities’ intention to strengthen monitoring of commercial real estate lending and
lending to the self-employed are welcome14.
56.
While the current supervisory framework has been reasonably effective, it should be
enhanced further. Banks’ supervisory structure needs to be strengthened by minimizing the
perception of political influence, and eliminating complex processes and overlap of responsibilities
across multiple agencies. As the recently completed FSAP pointed out, key recommended
improvements to financial supervision include15: (i) a more risk-sensitive approach; (ii) extension of
Basel II to financial holding companies (which came into effect on December 1, 2013); (iii) expansion
of supervisory activities on a group-wide basis; and (iv) better assessment of banks’ corporate
governance. Also, regulation of large non bank depositary institutions should be aligned with that for
banks, with stricter supervision and higher capital and provisioning requirements16.
57.
While the current institutional framework for macroprudential policy and crisis
management has worked well, it can be enhanced. There would be benefits to establishing two
distinct committees with separate mandates on macroprudential policy and crisis management. Such
an arrangement should focus on enhancing transparency and accountability, ensuring a greater
degree of independence from the political process, and clarifying and strengthening the financial
stability role of the BOK.

C. Authorities’ Views
58.
The authorities viewed the depressed bank profitability as cyclical rather than
structural. They noted that banks are suffering due to the low growth and interest rate environment,
but foresaw this unwinding as the business cycle turns around. However, the authorities are
encouraging banks to expand overseas to boost profitability, targeting areas compatible with Korean
banks’ limited expertise and balance sheet power, such as bad assets disposal.
59.
The authorities argued that they have successfully implemented measures to reduce
household debt, and that they do not view corporate debt levels as excessive. They emphasized
that the growth of household debt has slowed and that banks’ exposures to low income households
are low, and do not present risks to banks’ profitability. The authorities concurred that boosting
household incomes is a viable way to grow out of debt. They also considered banks’ exposure to
large distressed conglomerates to be limited as they have encouraged banks to proactively
restructure. They stressed that the bulk of the expected losses have already been provisioned for. The
authorities viewed the current level of banks’ prudential buffer sufficiently large to absorb adverse
shocks on the corporate balance sheets.

14

Lending to the self-employed accounts for an increasingly large share of banks’ and non-banks’ exposures.
Commercial real estate lending, while more limited in size, is subject to weaker underwriting standards (including no
LTV limits) and, thus, to potentially higher credit risks. The BOK has recently flagged potential financial stability risks
from both sectors and called for remedies including a gradual strengthening of LTV regulation.

15

In addition, the FSAP found that stress testing carried out by the authorities could be further improved.

16

The capital framework of institutions sized similarly to banks should be strengthened and calculated using the Basel
computations and definitions.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

60.
The authorities acknowledged that there is close supervisory monitoring of banks’ risk
pricing behavior. They pointed out that they monitor voluntary guidelines on banks’ risk pricing,
and emphasized that these are motivated by the need to ensure sufficient consumer protection. They
stressed that the guidelines are entirely voluntary and there are no sanctions for non-compliance.
More broadly, they stressed that ensuring sufficient consumer protection is a global trend, and an
area that requires sufficient policy focus.

STAFF APPRAISAL
61.
Korea’s economy is experiencing a modest recovery, helped by supportive monetary
and fiscal policies and buoyant exports. Korea’s GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2.8 percent
in 2013 (from 2 percent in 2012), and inflation is subdued. Despite a supplementary budget in the
spring and an accompanying cut in the policy rate, domestic demand remains relatively weak,
growing at only 2 percent. Growth is expected to strengthen to 3.7 percent in 2014, in view of the
projected global recovery and the gradual pickup in domestic demand. Despite this, the output gap
is expected to remain negative through 2014. In view of the fragile recovery, macroeconomic policies
should remain supportive. The expansionary fiscal and accommodative monetary stances should be
maintained until there is confidence that the output gap will close soon.
62.
Korea has emerged as a safe haven of sorts in the summer’s market turmoil. A strong
fiscal position, large CA surplus and ample FX reserves have further strengthened Korea’s
attractiveness to risk-averse investors, including many central banks and sovereign wealth funds.
However, the robustness of this new safe haven status has yet to be tested.
63.
The external sector position is substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies, and the won moderately undervalued. Policies are needed
to bolster domestic demand and bring rebalancing back on track. The won should continue to be
market determined, with intervention (either in spot or forward markets) limited to smoothing
excessive volatility in the event of disorderly market conditions and not to influence the pace of
appreciation. Reserves are adequate and there is no need for further accumulation relative to the
range of the metrics. Any additional accumulation should be carried out by the BOK rather than by
increasing government borrowing. Further won appreciation would facilitate the overall rebalancing
of the economy towards households and domestic demand.
64.
Risks are on the downside, both in the near and longer term. While, Korea would likely
not be very affected by further mild turmoil from US monetary policy normalization, adverse growth
surprises in any of its main export markets—China, U.S., and the EU—or more severe market stress
would significantly damage its outlook. On the domestic demand side, absent reforms considered in
the baseline, momentum will be muted, reflecting the debt overhang in parts of the household and
corporate sectors, which will weigh further on both consumption and investment. In the longer run,
weak household income growth, deleveraging needs, and conservative fiscal policy mean that
demand is likely to remain highly dependent on net exports. On the supply side, rapid population
aging implies a further significant fall in the growth potential. In turn, continued weakness in
domestic growth would likely worsen the debt problems of households and corporates. These risks
to growth call for a comprehensive and ambitious set of reforms that will be mutually reinforcing
across a number of areas, including to the fiscal framework, the labor market and services sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

65.
Fiscal policy has an essential role to play to support domestic demand, boost growth
potential and reduce inequality. Fiscal policy should be more countercyclical to allow automatic
fiscal support in downturns. Specifically, the borrowing ceiling should become non binding and the
balance target a structural one. The central government balance could be safely reduced to a deficit
of 1¼ percent of GDP over the medium term, even accounting for projected large aging costs. This
would free up resources to finance higher social spending and help rebalance the sources of growth
toward domestic demand. A debt rule anchored at a prudent level that could be significantly higher
than the present one, would ensure continued fiscal prudence. There is also sizable scope to finance
additional spending by broadening the currently narrow tax base. Contingent government liabilities
arising from credit guarantees and quasi-fiscal operations of state-owned firms and banks need
close and transparent monitoring. The government’s plans in this regard are much welcome.
66.
Continued reforms to increase labor force participation and reduce labor market
duality would further support households’ income growth and raise the growth potential.
Higher public spending on childcare and creating more part-time work opportunities could boost
female participation enough to critically support potential growth. Further efforts to reduce skill
mismatches would boost youth participation in the workforce. Reducing the gap in training and
social protection between non-regular and self-employed workers and regular workers would raise
productivity and reduce precautionary saving. While the Tripartite Jobs Pact is a step in the right
direction, skillful policy making would be required to tackle considerable implementation challenges,
and more has to be done to combat dualism, including reducing the relatively high degree of
employment protection for regular workers.
67.
Deregulation, restructuring and reduction in government intervention are needed to
boost value-added in services and productivity throughout the economy. As the social safety
net expands, incentives that discourage SME growth and allow non-profitable ones to survive should
be phased out. Loan guarantees should expire after a few years, and banks be encouraged to
develop risk management and pricing practices that allow them to provide non-guaranteed funding
to a broader range of viable SMEs. Policy banks should refocus their lending on SMEs. Initiatives to
expand SME access to capital markets should continue. Also, considerable productivity gains could
be garnered by deregulating network services, health, education, and other professions and by
promoting competition in service provision to and by chaebols.
68.
The FSAP found the financial sector sound overall, though risks warrant close
monitoring. Banks are highly capitalized and have low nonperforming loans ratios, reflecting active
disposal guidance. The associated write-offs, along with low net interest margin and non-interest
income, have contributed to continued weak profits. Low loan-to-value ratios on mortgage loans
and large household asset buffers limit risks from potential further deterioration in household debt.
However, weak debt repayment capacity and buffers among low income households could further
erode profits. Similarly, in certain parts of the corporate sector—construction, transportation, and
shipbuilding—a prolonged cyclical downturn had raised risks. Despite these risks, banks’ vulnerability
to external liquidity shocks has declined, as macro-prudential regulations have reduced markedly
their short-term debt. Non-bank depositary institutions are vulnerable to asset quality shocks, but
they are individually small and largely not interconnected. Overall, systemic risk appears limited.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

69.
Despite this, financial stability would be further supported by active monitoring of
risks, adjustments in incentives, and streamlined, more structured institutional frameworks.
Pressures on banks’ pricing behavior should be minimized and the authorities should seek to curb
potential moral hazard in debt workout programs. The current supervisory structure would benefit
from enhanced independence, greater focus on the core supervisory mandate, and institutional
streamlining so as to improve coordination. Overall effectiveness would be enhanced by supervision
of financial activities on a group-wide basis, and establishment of a dedicated macro-prudential
council and a fully formalized committee on crisis management.
70.
In sum, the Korean economy has fared well in the recent turmoil and is well positioned
to benefit from the global recovery, reflecting skilled policy-making. However, it will need deep
changes in its economic structure to continue lifting the living standard of its population, in an
inclusive way, closer to that of the richest advanced economies. Many of the reforms needed, and
identified above, are already in train or planned. Steadfast implementation across these areas will be
needed to meet this challenge.
71.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

Policy Response: In most of the scenarios related to external shocks (with the exception of the oil price shock), the appropriate policy response
would entail utilizing ample fiscal space and monetary loosening to buffer the effect of the shock. Intervention can be used to smooth excessive

Appendix II. Main Recommendations from the 2012 Article IV
Consultation and Follow Up
The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on August 27, 2012. At the
time, Executive Directors noted that the near-term challenge is to manage the escalating downside
risks to the outlook. Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, but stressed that, in light of the elevated inflation
expectations, normalization should resume one the economy strengthens and the negative output
gap starts to close.
Directors noted that in the event of a severe downside scenario, Korea has policy space to response,
especially on the fiscal side. They also underscored that flexible exchange rate and ample
international reserves would help cushion against external shocks.
Noting that the won is assessed to be moderately undervalued in real effective terms,Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to limit intervention to smoothing exchange rate fluctuations.
Directors called on the authorities to continue vigilance on external vulnerabilities and follow
through with their strategy for ‘soft-landing’ of household debt. Directors also supported the
government’s plan for a targeted increase in social spending over time.
Since then, the growth moderated more sharply than expected, and negative output gap is now
expected to remain through 2014. Inflation is also projected to remain subdued until 2015. Against
this backdrop the authorities have taken the following policy actions:


A supplementary budget of 1¼ percent of GDP was adopted in May to authorize borrowing
to make up for a large revenue shortfall and finance a spending increase of around ½
percent of GDP.



The government also postponed the deadline for broadly restoring balance to 2017. The
proposed 2014 budget keeps the overall deficit unchanged from the 2013 supplementary
budget (at 1.8 in percent of GDP).



A plan to implement the Presidents’ social spending pledges, by tax base broadening and
spending reallocation, was unveiled.



The Bank of Korea cut its policy rate to 2.5 percent in May 2013.



The won has appreciated by 7.5 percent since the last Article IV. However, exchange rate
policy has entailed active intervention at times.



The authorities are on-track with the strategy ‘soft-landing’ of household debt.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Korea’s exchange rate system has been classified as “floating” since 2009. Over 1997–2008, the
exchange rate was classified as “free floating” (“independently floating” under the older classification
system). Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with UN Security
Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision 144 (52/51).
FSAP and ROSC Participation:
An FSAP update, requested by the authorities, was conducted in April and July 2013. The missions
included an assessment of various financial sector standards; the soundness of the financial sector,
including vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks; and the crisis preparedness and management
framework of Korea. Prior to this, the previous FSAP mission was conducted in October 2002. The
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report for the 2003 assessment has been published
(Country Report No. 03/81) and is available on the web at:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a report was
drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report has been published
and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm.
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during December 2009, and a Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was drafted and finalized in July 2010. The report has
been published and is available on the web through the link:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10229.pdf
Technical Assistance:
FAD: A technical assistance mission on government finance statistics took place in Seoul during the
period November 8–19, 2010. A mission visited Seoul during August 31-September 16, 2005 to
provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy and administration. A technical assistance
mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to evaluate current practices in budgeting and
public expenditure management and to provide advice on setting up a medium-term fiscal
framework.
MCM: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul to provide advice on financial holding company
supervision and derivatives regulation during December 8–17, 2008, on measures to deepen the
money market during December 4–14, 2007, on strengthening the debt management function and
further development of the government securities market during September 20–October 2, 2006, on
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

the reform and development of the foreign exchange market during March 30–April 13, 2006, and
on macroprudential and derivatives supervision during October 27–November 7, 2005.
STA: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000 to provide advice
on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward improving the recording of
financial derivatives and developing an international investment position statement, and during
November 28–December 11, 2007 on the GFSM 2001 framework. Two missions to support reforms
related to government finance statistics visited Korea during November 28–December 11, 2007 and
November 8–19, 2010, respectively.
Resident Representative:
The resident representative office in Seoul was opened in March 1998 and was closed in September
2008.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 20, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the
1993 System of National Accounts. Chain-linked (reference year 2005) and nominal GDP estimates are
compiled using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also compiled
using the income approach. After the revision to reference year 2005, the estimation method for
expenditure components has been altered from the commodity flow method to the direct estimation
method, in which each expenditure component is measured directly. The size of the informal sector has
not been measured. Improved methods are required to adjust quarterly (seasonally-unadjusted) GDP
estimates to agree with annual (benchmark) GDP estimates.
Consumer Price Index: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 92.9 percent of total households of Korea;
it excludes farming and fishing households. The geographical coverage, which includes 37 urban areas,
should be extended to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated only every five years; currently,
expenditure weights are derived from the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The new CPI
index adopts both geometric means and the ratio of arithmetic means. The geometrics means should be
used for all unweighted aggregation. The missing prices of products, except for the seasonal items, are
imputed by the price movements of similar products of the same item in the same geographic area.
However, the CPI could be improved further by imputing missing prices of the seasonal items rather than
carrying forward the last reported prices.

Producer Price Index: The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large
segment of service activity. It excludes exported products, however, because the Export Price Indexes are
compiled separately in Korea. The rebased PPI (2010 = 100) employs 2008 SNA concepts and definitions
for the record and valuation of the prices and weights. The PPI could be improved by making more use of
imputing missing prices using the prices of similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last
reported price. Mostly, the simple geometric average and the weighted geometric average are employed
in the elementary level index compilation. But in some, the indices are computed by the weighted
arithmetic average .Nevertheless, the headline PPI should be changed to the one based on a geometric
mean at the elementary level. The PPI classification by activity conforms to the KSIC, which is itself based
on the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)––with slight modifications only to reflect local
considerations. The Korean commodity classification used for the PPI does not conform to the Central
Product Classification (CPC) and one based on the CPC should be adopted as soon as possible.
Government Finance Statistics: Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the
central government, one using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized
standards. Concepts and definitions used in the latter followed the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986 until recently. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious
program to implement reporting according to GFSM 2001, and the first set of financial statements based
on the reformed system was released in 2012. The 2009 ROSC indicated that while compilation practices
are generally sound, some room for improvement of the accessibility and timeliness of data and
metadata existed. Following the 2009 ROSC, the Korean authorities resumed reporting consolidated GFS

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

data on the general government for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
The timeliness of these data does not comply with SDDS requirements, mainly due to the lack in
timeliness on local government source data. During the 2009 ROSC, the authorities also agreed to
improve national dissemination practices and initiated work on improving national websites. However,
high frequency data for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are not yet reported.
Financial Sector Data: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK)
broadly follow the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual 2000. Both liabilities and assets in
foreign currencies are converted into Korean Won at the previous business day's trading volume
weighted average rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. The data are revalued monthly. The BOK is in
discussion with STA about reporting MFS using the standardized report forms (SRFs) and drafting related
metadata for publication in the IFS. Draft SRFs for the central bank and other depository corporations
were reported to STA.
Korea participates in the regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for
dissemination on its website. FSI data and metadata are available to the public through the IMF’s website
at: http://fsi/FSIHome.aspx#Country.
External Sector Statistics: The BOK currently compiles the BOP and IIP statistics consistent with the
Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual, sixth Edition (BPM6) analytical
framework (see http://ecos.bok.or.kr/). The authorities have indicated that the data published in the BOK
website are the results of the first-stage implementation of the BPM6, and data compiled by fully using
this framework are scheduled to be disseminated in 2013.
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved. In early 2007, the BOK switched
from annual to quarterly reporting of the International Investment Position. Data dissemination on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity meets the SDDS specifications. Since April 2006, the
authorities have disseminated foreign reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a month, as had
been done since 1997.
Korea reports balance of payments and IIP data for the IFS (quarterly data) and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (annual data) publications.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Korea has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September
1996, and it uses SDDS flexibility options for the
timeliness of the general government operations,
central government operations and. analytical
accounts of the banking sector data. Korea is also
availing itself of a relevant flexibility option for the
coverage of exchange rates.

As a result, the overall deficit (excluding social security funds) is now set at
25.5 trillion won (1.8 percent of GDP), slightly smaller than the government’s
proposed target of 25.9 trillion won (1.8 percent of GDP).

The Strategy and Finance Committee of the National Assembly has passed a
draft 2013 Tax Revision Bill. If approved as is by the National Assembly, the overall revenue
impact of the bill (which is reflected in the 2014 government budget just adopted by the
National Assembly) is estimated at +2.19 trillion won over the medium term (+0.43 trillion
won for 2014), slightly larger than entailed by the original budget proposal (+1.96 trillion
won over the medium term; +0.37 trillion won for 2014).

The Ministry of Strategy and Finance released 2014 Economic Policies. This
document states that the government will manage fiscal policy in a flexible manner to
maintain recovery momentum in the first half of the year, and will frontload spending for
major government projects. This policy intent is welcome.

Latest data releases are broadly consistent with the staff’s projections.

CPI inflation remained at 1.1 percent in December (1.3 percent for 2013) broadly in
line with the staff’s expectation (1.0 percent in December and 1.1 percent for 2013).
Starting with the December CPI release, Statistics Korea began to shift from
expenditure weights derived from the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey to ones derived from the 2012 Survey. This shift resulted in slight revision of
the inflation data series.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Korea

On January 10, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Korea.
GDP growth has bottomed in 2013 after slowing sharply in 2012. The economy expanded by
1.1 percent in Q2 and Q3 2013, with exports rebounding and private consumption and
construction strengthening. Real GDP growth is projected to reach 2.8 percent in 2013.
Reflecting stronger exports and muted domestic demand, the current account surplus widened
and is expected to reach around 5 ¾ percent of GDP. Inflation has fallen from 4.2 percent in
2011 to 0.9 percent in October 2013, well below the target band of 2½–3½ percent, in the
absence of demand pressures and falling food prices.
The economy is expected to strengthen further and growth to rise to 3.7 percent in 2014.
Domestic demand is expected to strengthen as consumption and investment recover supported by
higher wages and stronger exports respectively, as well as a bounce back from the low base.
However, risks are on the downside. The main near-term risks are external: sharply slower
growth in Korea’s main trading partners or severe market stress. With a significant private debt
overhang, key domestic risks are weak domestic demand and, over time, lower potential growth
if structural reforms fail to offset the drag from rapid aging.
To support the economy, a supplementary budget of 1¼ percent of GDP was adopted in May
2013 to authorize borrowing to make up for a large revenue shortfall and finance a spending
increase of around ½ percent of GDP. The government also postponed to 2017 the deadline for
broadly restoring balance. The proposed 2014 budget keeps the overall deficit unchanged from
the 2013 supplementary budget (at 1.8 in percent of GDP). To maximize policy effectiveness,
the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate to 2.5 percent in May 2013, amid the uncertain global
outlook, the continued negative output gap, and subdued inflation.
The resilience of the Korean financial system has increased since 2008 as a result of concerted
policy efforts. Banks’ liquidity profiles have improved markedly due to well designed

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

macroprudential measures, as reflected in lower external debt and FX liquidity mismatches.
Banks are highly capitalized, with an average capital adequacy ratio of 14.3 percent during Q3
2013, and have low nonperforming loans ratios, reflecting active disposal. However, low net
interest margin and non-interest income have led to weak profits. Depository institutions’
lending growth to the household sector has continued to decline, increasing by 3.2 percent as of
end-June 2013, down from double-digits prior to the crisis. However, lending by non-depository
institutions continues to be brisk, up 11 percent annually over the same period.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Korean authorities for their skillful policymaking, which
allowed the economy to fare well in the recent crisis and position itself to gain from the global
recovery. They stressed the need for continued structural reforms to rebalance the economy
toward domestic demand, promote inclusive growth, and continue lifting living standards.
Directors noted that, while a modest recovery is underway, domestic demand remains relatively
weak and the output gap is expected to remain negative through 2014. They considered it
important to ensure that the monetary and fiscal stances remain supportive of the recovery until it
is firmly entrenched. Directors agreed that risks to the growth outlook are on the downside, both
in the near and longer term. These include, on the external side, adverse global growth surprises
and severe market stress. On the domestic demand side, Directors saw as key risks high private
sector indebtedness and ensuing deleveraging needs, weak household income growth, and
population aging.
Directors commended the authorities for their fiscal prudence, which has provided Korea with
ample fiscal room to maneuver. They agreed that priority should be placed on enhancing
automatic stabilizers and increasing social safety nets, while broadening the tax base. Most
Directors supported the authorities’ current medium term fiscal path to restore a balanced budget,
given rapid population aging, contingent liabilities, and geopolitical risks. Others saw scope for
somewhat higher deficit targets—implemented prudently—in support of social needs and
rebalancing growth toward domestic demand. Directors generally felt that a structural fiscal
framework deserves further consideration, although a few did not see a strong case for it given
Korea’s track record of fiscal discipline. Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to
enhance fiscal transparency, including on contingent government liabilities.
Directors noted the widening of Korea’s external imbalance and the increased pressure on the
exchange rate, which the staff assessed as being moderately undervalued in real effective terms.
A number of Directors expressed the need for caution in interpreting the results of model based
assessments. Directors were of the view that the won should continue to be market determined,
with intervention limited to smoothing disorderly market conditions. In this context, many
Directors considered that increased transparency in interventions would help enhance the
credibility of the authorities’ exchange rate policy. Structural policies to bolster domestic

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

demand and continued flexibility of the won in line with fundamentals would facilitate economic
rebalancing. Some Directors considered that the current level of reserves is adequate and does
not warrant further accumulation, while a few others, noting the proven benefits of building a
strong buffer in past crises, cautioned against prejudging the case.
Directors supported the authorities’ reform agenda aimed at increasing labor force participation
and reducing labor market duality. They saw the merits of deregulation, including in network
industries, reducing government intervention, and promoting competition in the service sector.
Directors encouraged further efforts to boost service sector productivity and strengthen the
competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises, including by phasing out the prolonged
use of loan guarantees.
Directors agreed that the financial sector is sound overall. They nevertheless encouraged the
authorities to monitor risks closely, particularly weak bank profits, debt owed by fragile
households and corporations, and activities in nonfinancial depository institutions. Directors
underscored the importance of further improving the supervisory structure, including by
strengthening operational independence, group wide supervision, and institutional coordination.

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for the Republic of
Korea, Wonjin Choi, Advisor to Executive Director, and
Kyounghwan Moon, Advisor to Executive Director
January 10, 2014
On behalf of the Korean authorities, we thank the staff team for their constructive policy dialogue
with the authorities, including the productive FSAP discussions.
Korea has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well owing to strengthened economic
fundamentals, comfortable policy buffers, and concerted policy efforts. Although the growth rate
has remained below its potential in recent years, Korea has successfully safeguarded
macroeconomic and financial stability since the global crisis. Nevertheless, there remain
considerable policy challenges, which include relatively high household sector indebtedness, rapid
population aging, weak domestic demand, high exposure to external shocks resulting from trade
and financial openness, and geopolitical risks and the resulting potential fiscal burden.
The Korean authorities have been addressing these challenges preemptively with prudent
macroeconomic policies and strenuous structural reforms. Fiscal policy has been firmly anchored
to longer term sustainability while providing adequate short-term support when needed. Monetary
policy has remained flexible to developments in inflation and financial markets. Exchange rates
have continued to be flexible, absorbing most of the external shocks to the economy, with
interventions strictly limited to smoothing operations. Macroprudential policies have also been
employed to prevent systemic risks, being mindful of the right balance with traditional
macroeconomic policies.
We note that most of the staff assessment and advice are broadly aligned with the authorities'
appraisal and policy directions. The 2013 mission has provided interesting ideas, part of which
seemed to depart from previous missions’ positions and policy advice. We found some of them,
such as on fiscal policy, to be a potentially reviewable option, but do not consider them relevant at
the current juncture given the need to take into account country-specific factors. We particularly
note our authorities’ disagreement with the staff assessments on the external sector, including on
exchange rates and foreign exchange intervention, which are based on a subjective judgment and
potentially biased information, leading to confusion and undermining the credibility of the
analysis. We also note statistical inconsistencies, including in corporate debt, which could affect
relevance of staff’s views. We urge the staff team to listen more carefully to the authorities’ policy
endeavors to balance diverse risks and to give due consideration of country-specific factors in the
assessment.
Recent development and outlook
The economy has been showing stronger signs of recovery. Real GDP grew 3.3 percent y.o.y in Q3
2013 on the back of improved private consumption and investment. The authorities project that
this trend will continue, with the 2014 GDP growth being projected to reach 3.9 percent, based on

2
greater domestic demand. Private consumption is expected to increase 3.3 percent supported by
improvements in employment. Investment is also expected to grow 6.6 percent.
CPI inflation has fallen to 1.3 percent in 2013, below the Bank of Korea (BOK) target band of 2½3½ percent, due to weak aggregate demand, subdued commodity price, and the one-off downward
effect of expanded childcare subsidies. CPI inflation is expected to rise to 2.3 percent this year as
demand pressure increases.
Job creation has rebounded strongly in 2013 aided by growth recovery and the new
administration’s vigorous labor market policy agenda, “70 percent Roadmap,” to boost the
employment rate to 70 percent by 2017. The employment rate increased to 64.9 percent in
November 2013 from 64.2 percent in 2012. Improvement in female employment is also gaining
speed with the number of females employed recently exceeding the previous trend. The
unemployment rate fell to 2.9 percent in November 2013 from 3.2 percent in 2012. This strong
performance is expected to continue through 2014, with the employment rate reaching 65.2 percent
and unemployment remaining at about 3 percent.
The current account surplus has widened in 2013 largely due to lower oil prices and sluggish
domestic demand. The value of exports increased 2.2% and that of imports decreased 0.8% in
2013. However, the imports began to turn around from Q3 2013, and this trend is expected to
further strengthen in 2014. The authorities project that the current account surplus will decline to
below 4 percent of the GDP in 2014 as the import growth (9.0 percent) is expected to outpace the
export growth (6.4 percent), reflecting the improving domestic demand and the lagging effect of
the Korean won appreciation in the second half of 2013 (8.2 percent against the US dollar and 15.4
percent against the Japanese yen, and 6.7 percent in the BIS REER term). It is also worthwhile to
note that while the currencies of most emerging market economies depreciated in large part due to
the prospect of the QE tapering, the Korean won actually appreciated significantly during the
period.1
Fiscal policy
Korea has maintained a strong record of fiscal soundness, which has buttressed the economy
during the periods of a crisis or when geopolitical risk materialized. The authorities are committed
to sustaining fiscal prudence and meeting the medium-term fiscal policy objectives, as stipulated in
the Five Year National Fiscal Management Plan. This includes a gradual recovery to a broadly
balanced budget position by 2017 and stabilization of government debt at the current level through
broadening the revenue base, reducing the tax expenditures, and consolidating the expenditures.
The 2014 budget included measures to raise the personal income tax revenue from high-income
earners and also to consolidate tax exemptions further.
1

The real effective exchange rate of the Korean won between April and November 2013 has appreciated the most
(5.0%) among 34 countries in the world (US 0.8%, China 1.6%, Japan 0.4%, Euro Area 3.1%, UK 3.4%), excluding
Venezuela (25.8%) [William R. Cline, “Estimates of Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rates, November 2013,”
Peterson Institute for International Economics, November 2013].

3
The 2013 budget was expansionary with the deficit being expected to widen to 1.8 percent of GDP
owing to the implementation of the supplementary budget aiming at supporting domestic demand
and job creation. The 2014 budget envisages the overall deficit at 1.8 percent of GDP, which will
provide a similar magnitude of fiscal support to the economy as in 2013. While staff noted the
need for a supplementary budget in 2014, the authorities consider it particularly unlikely at the
current juncture, as its implementation should depend on future economic development rather than
being prejudged now, and also given the improving economic prospect this year. Nevertheless, the
authorities will expedite their efforts to enhance the responsiveness of fiscal policy to business
cycles by strengthening the role of automatic stabilizers such as expanding targeted welfare
provision.
The authorities remain cautious about staff’s recommendation to increase fiscal deficits and raise
government debt to about 60 percent from the current mid 30 percent level. Huge potential fiscal
costs related to geopolitical uncertainties as well as rapidly aging population should be taken into
account in determining longer-term fiscal policy objectives.2 The authorities will remain vigilant to
fiscal risks and strengthen fiscal rules for ensuring fiscal sustainability. In this regard, the
authorities see the need for tighter monitoring of the liabilities of the SOEs and the overall public
sector under a more stringent standard. With a view to providing a more accurate picture of the
fiscal sector, they are planning to publish data on comprehensive public sector indebtedness. The
resulting greater fiscal transparency on the public debt situation will help guide the authorities’
decisions on medium-term fiscal objectives and also enhance public awareness on the pursuit of
fiscal policy.
Monetary and Exchange rate policy
The monetary authority has maintained an accommodative policy stance, keeping the policy rate
low at 2.5 percent, considering weak global and domestic demands as well as financial market
uncertainties related to the normalization of unconventional monetary policies in advanced
countries.
The external sector has remained resilient despite external shocks. The exchange rate has
continued to be determined in the market. Given the Korean economy’s high degree of openness
and the tendency for the exchange rate to overshoot in the event of major external developments
such as North Korea’s nuclear program, the Korean authorities consider that market interventions
are useful to smooth excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market. Nonetheless,
interventions have been restricted to smoothing operations, in a limited way in both directions,
rather than “active and asymmetrical” as staff indicated.
We do not consider staff’s analysis of exchange rate intervention in Box 2 to be relevant.
Expressions like “while subject to uncertainty” and “Discussion with market sources” in Box 2

Despite large uncertainties about the potential cost of reunification with North Korea, which vary considerably
depending on the ways of unification and estimation methods, the estimates range from 20-30 percent of GDP to more
than 100 percent of GDP depending on assumptions.

4
point to the subjective judgment and potentially biased information. Staff’s estimates of the
changes in interest incomes and FX valuation differ greatly from the actual changes. Unlike staff’s
assertion that the increase in the forward position is associated with the curbing of pressure for
won appreciation, the BOK’s forward position is to provide FX liquidity to the market and has
little to do with the exchange rate.3 Staff’s assessment on the correlation of the REER of the
Korean won with the forward position is also limited to a certain period of time and when it is
expanded to the period of 2005 to 2013, the correlation is negative (-0.1).
The authorities remain concerned about the mechanical application of the External Balance
Assessment/the External Sector Report assessment, given that the norms are dependent on staff’s
subjective judgments in addition to the methodological limitations. While the CA surplus widened
in 2013, it is partly due to lower oil prices and subdued domestic demand including weak corporate
investment. We expect that the gap will be reduced this year.
The authorities consider that the current level of reserves is broadly adequate and also that there is
no need to prejudge a case for or against further accumulation. It will be helpful to note that before
the global financial crisis in 2008, Korea’s FX reserves were considered to be sufficient. When
market perceptions were changed to regard the reserves level as insufficient, the Korean won to the
US$ plunged by 38.1 percent (from 936.6 won/$ on January 3, 2008 to 1,513 won/$ on November
24, 2008).
Financial sector
As the FSSA shows, the Korean financial sector remains sound and resilient, with the balance
sheets of financial institutions being strong, financial intermediation being robust, and financial
regulations and the supervisory framework being competent and compatible with international
standards. The authorities will stand ready to amend rules and regulations where needed and in
tandem with progress of related international standards.
The authorities are devoted to closing regulatory gaps between banks and nonbank financial
institutions (NBFI), being mindful of NBFI’s potential impact on financial stability and the
ballooning effect from strengthened banking regulation. The regulatory framework will be
enhanced into a twin-peak model, where each agency is charged respectively with consumer
protection and prudential supervision. This change will help reduce the potential conflict between
two supervisory objectives and also contribute to strengthening the supervisory expertise of each
agency.

3

The rise in the BOK’s forward position since the end of last year is attributable mainly to the supply of foreign
currency liquidity through FX swap transactions to prevent a foreign exchange funding market crunch stemming from
geopolitical risk related to North Korea and concerns about the Fed’s QE tapering. From 2011 to September 2012, the
forward position declined by 44 percent despite the decrease in the dollar-won exchange rate, which contrasts to staff’s
argument.

5
The authorities have safeguarded financial market autonomy while limiting government
interventions to those areas justifiable for correcting market distortions, enhancing consumer
protection and promoting fair competition. Contrary to staff’s speculation, the authorities do not
exercise any kind of influence on banks’ operations other than the areas mentioned above.
Given the risk associated with high household debt, the Korean authorities have been exerting
strenuous effort to limit growth in household debt. Since 2011, policy efforts have helped stabilize
the growth of household debt in terms of a share of GDP. Also, the structure of household debt has
significantly improved as the share of bullet loans has decreased and the share of fixed-interest
loans has increased.4
The authorities remain doubtful of staff’s assessment that the private corporate debt level is high
and poses a risk to financial stability. Staff’s assessment is based on the entire corporate sector
debt data, mistakenly encompassing public enterprises as well, which seems to be beyond the
intended scope of staff analysis. According to the BOK’s official Flows of Funds data on private
corporations, the level of corporate debt as a share of GDP is 124.5 percent in 2012, far lower than
staff’s estimates of 174.3 percent, and corporate indebtedness and leverage are lower than those of
major advanced economies. While there still exist marginal firms which should be subject to
corporate restructuring on a continual basis, the overall corporate sector is financially sound with
liquid assets exceeding 110 percent of debt repayments and average ROA being higher than that in
most advanced economies.
We do not consider relevant the staff recommendation to establish two distinct committees by
separating mandates on macroprudential policy and crisis management. As a recent IMF staff
paper5 indicates, Korea’s current arrangements for macroprudential policies are functioning well
under close cooperation between relevant agencies. The current institutional arrangements are the
result of long-time discussions and hard-won coordination among government agencies.
Appropriate arrangements for macroprudential policies should depend on individual country’s
circumstances, including legal frameworks. Given the close linkage between crisis management
and prevention, we remain to be convinced of the need to separate the arrangements for
macroprudential policy from those for crisis management.
Structural reform
Increasing the labor force, reducing labor market duality, and strengthening competitiveness of the
service sector are crucial for sustainable and inclusive growth in Korea. The authorities are
pursuing the 70 percent Roadmap, consisting of: (1) solidifying grounds for overall job creation
through promoting start-ups, intensifying deregulation, encouraging innovations, reducing working

additional 30 percent housing price drop and continuation of economic recession for two years.

hours and strengthening service sectors; (2) taking tailored measures for promoting female and
youth employment through expanding childcare benefits, creating flexible part time jobs,
streamlining the job information system and reducing skill mismatches.
Being mindful that job creation will be limited without addressing adequately the labor market
duality, the authorities continue to pursue labor market reform through reducing working hours,
raising the retirement age and moving towards a performance-based wage system.
Policy priority is also placed on strengthening the service sector through streamlining deregulation,
boosting productivity, and leveling the playing field. Further deregulation will be pursued in high
value-added service industries, including healthcare, medical services, education and software
industries which will be a part of the future growth engines in Korea.
