Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Romania
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Matthew Fisher
June 12, 2008

Executive Summary
Background: A capital-inflow-driven absorption boom has underpinned rapid
catch-up growth but also fuelled macroeconomic imbalances. In particular, the external
current-account deficit has risen to unsustainable levels. And, since mid-2007, headline
CPI inflation has surged well above the central bank’s target, in part reflecting the firstround effects of food and energy price shocks. Rapid credit growth has raised risks to
financial stability, although the largely foreign-owned banking system remains wellplaced to absorb shocks. In this setting, fiscal policy has been highly procyclical and
lacked medium-term orientation. Monetary policy, also faced with a depreciating
exchange rate since international financial tensions erupted in mid-2007, has tightened
its stance. However, and notwithstanding unfavorable global economic headwinds, the
economy has yet to show signs of slowing.
Staff views: The main short-term challenge is to tighten fiscal policy, putting less of
the stabilization burden on the fledgling inflation-targeting framework, while also
avoiding the need to shift to a procyclical stance once boom conditions dissipate.
Moreover, fiscal policies should be anchored within a more medium-term framework,
also to address looming structural bottlenecks to catch-up growth in a forward-looking
manner. The quality of credit portfolios needs careful monitoring, and additional
preemptive measures to contain financial stability risks are warranted.
The authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s diagnosis and policy
proposals, but noted that the fiscal deficit had remained well below 3 percent of GDP,
while pressing investment needs and political constraints had made it difficult to adopt
a less procyclical fiscal stance.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
Large capital inflows have put Romania on a fast-growth track, but, amid
uncoordinated policy responses, macroeconomic imbalances are widening. Propelled by
EU accession and massive capital inflows, Romania has enjoyed a stretch of strong economic
performance, combining brisk catch-up growth with, until mid-2007, disinflation. But
economic tensions have built up. The current-account deficit has surged to unsustainable
levels. And, with booming absorption increasingly running up against binding supply
constraints, procyclical fiscal policies have clashed with the National Bank of Romania’s
(NBR) inflation-targeting framework (Box 1). Nominal exchange rate volatility and large
adverse shocks to food and energy prices have further complicated inflation control.
Box 1. Romania’s Response to IMF Advice
With capital inflows surging, the Fund advised that automatic fiscal stabilizers should
be allowed to operate, while public wage and employment policies should avoid
aggravating private-sector labor shortages. The government, however, argued that
fiscal policies foremost need to boost the economy’s supply capacity, including by
increasing investment spending, and that fiscal procyclicality may well be a price
worth paying for this. There has been broad agreement on the appropriate monetary
framework and policy requirements.

2.
Romania’s fragmented politics is integral to concerns about economic prospects.
The minority government controls little more than twenty percent of parliamentary seats
and has to rely on ad hoc coalitions to adopt key legislation. With parliamentary elections
due in late-2008 or early-2009, proactive policy making, particularly as regards politicallydifficult structural reforms, is largely on hold. However, new election rules, which include
raising the voter threshold to 5 percent, could result in future coalition governments with a
stronger mandate and purpose.
3.
Romania envisages entering the ERM II mechanism in 2012 and adopting the
euro in 2014. The authorities hope that this plan will allow time for the capital-inflowdriven macroeconomic imbalances to normalize, while anchoring policies to a clear,
ambitious, but achievable euro-adoption calendar.

II. BACKGROUND
A. Real and Nominal Convergence
4.
Fast but sustainable real catch-up growth requires stability-oriented policies.
Romania’s per-capita income based on purchasing-power parities (PPP), while still at the tail
end of the EU’s income league, has caught up at an impressive speed over recent years.
However, sustained fast real convergence will require stabilization policies that keep nominal
convergence at a sustainable pace, while

B. External and Internal Balance
5.
An absorption boom,
propelled by a surge in capital
inflows, is at the root of growing
macroeconomic imbalances.
Since 2003, absorption growth has
outpaced income growth by large
margins (Tables 1-2). A rapidly
growing economy-wide spendingincome gap was, however, overfinanced
by capital inflows, which added to
foreign-exchange reserves (text table).
The absorption boom was mirrored by a
ballooning current-account deficit,
which reached 14 percent of GDP
in 2007 (Table 3).

6.
As elsewhere in the region, private investment was the absorption boom’s main
driver (Figure 2). Capital inflows were facilitated by capital account liberalization and high
global risk appetite. But, with EU accession prospects secure, capital flows, particularly
foreign direct investment (FDI), were also attracted by perceptions of lower investment risk,
triggering a re-assessment of Romania as an investment location. Skyrocketing asset prices,
easy capital gains, and rising collateral values added self-reinforcing momentum to the
absorption boom. As in other countries, Romania’s private consumption-GDP ratio remained
remarkably stable, suggesting that consumption smoothing was not a principal boom driver.

not be ruled out (Box 2).
9.
Romania’s external net exposure remains contained, but rising short-term debt
has raised external stability risks. Although it has deteriorated sharply, the net IIP
compares favorably with that in other regional economies (Figure 5, Table 4). However, a
significant increase of debt at shorter maturities has raised the risk of abrupt shifts in capital
flows, although foreign-exchange reserve coverage of short-term debt remains satisfactory.
C. Financial Stability
10.
Direct and indirect credit risks are rising, and the banking system is increasingly
dependent on foreign funding. Real private credit expanded by some 50 percent in 2007,
and has increasingly been funded by foreign borrowing, mainly through parent banks, rather
than domestic deposits (Figure 6, Table 5). Particularly strong growth in domestic foreigncurrency credit—including a surge in Swiss-franc denominated credits from a low base—and
heavy direct foreign borrowing abroad have increased currency mismatches in corporate and
household balance sheets. While financial soundness indicators for the largely foreign-owned

Box 2. Romania: Exchange Rate Assessment1/
Overall, staff’s various approaches do not point to strong evidence of a significantly
overvalued real exchange rate at present that could result in future external instability.
As a general caveat, it is difficult to pinpoint the equilibrium real exchange rate or the
equilibrium current account for an EU convergence economy like Romania because the
economy has generally operated in out-of-equilibrium mode, starting convergence from
significantly undervalued real exchange rate levels.
This said, the macroeconomic-balance approach suggests that Romania’s currentaccount deficit norm, taking account of about 1½ percent of GDP capital transfers, is
10¼ percent of GDP, but with considerable margins of uncertainty (Box Figure). This
compares with an estimate of the underlying current-account deficit of 12½ percent,
taking account of Romania’s output gap as the only temporary factor. The difference
between norm and underlying current-account deficit indicate an overvaluation margin
of about 11 percent.
The external-sustainability approach also points to a sustainable external deficit
norm of about 10 percent of GDP, assuming Romania’s negative net international
investment position (IIP) will stabilize at some 65 percent of GDP, consistent with a
13 percent overvaluation margin.
However, the equilibrium real-exchange-rate approach based on panel data suggests
real exchange rate overvaluation of only about 7 percent in 2007. Reflecting the sharp
nominal depreciation since mid-2007, the level of the real exchange rate in March 2008
was already some 4 percent lower than the 2007-average, indicating that any remaining
margin of overvaluation would likely be small.
Turning to external price and cost competitiveness indicators, Romania’s export
market shares have steadily increased for all major export destinations. While nominal
unit labor costs (ULC) in manufacturing have risen particularly sharply, profitability
remains intact, and Romania’s euro-denominated wages are still among the lowest in
the EU; foreign-investor interest in re-locating production to Romania remains also
strong.

11.
Romania is vulnerable to adverse spillovers from global financial tensions. In line
with the growing external deficit and short-term debt, gross external financing requirements
soared to about 28 percent of GDP in 2007 (Table 3). Financial markets have reacted with
palpable concern: in addition to the recent sharp leu depreciation, a substantial correction
took place in the stock market, and sovereign-bond spreads and credit-default swap rates
widened substantially (Figure 7). Two rating agencies have downgraded Romania’s outlook
to negative.
D. Policy Developments
12.
The fiscal policy stance in 2007 was highly procyclical (Figure 8). The cash-based
fiscal deficit increased to 2¼ percent of GDP, up from ½ percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 7).
Adjusted for the automatic effects of the booming economy on the fiscal position, the
mission estimates that the 2007 structural deficit rose to almost 4 percent of GDP. As a
result, the fiscal stance was highly expansionary, adding an estimated net fiscal stimulus of
2 percent of GDP to an already overheating economy. However, the general government
balance sheet is strong: end-2007 gross public debt, excluding public guarantees, amounted
to only 12 percent of GDP, and net financial worth was positive.

Fiscal policy management remained short-term oriented.2 The originally
approved 2007 budget was revised four times, leaving little time or resources for more
medium-term budget planning. The traditional end-year spending surge could not be
contained, despite control efforts by the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, in its first accession
year, Romania had limited success in tapping EU grants, indicating weak capital-budget

planning and implementation capacities. Finally, in mid-2007, a proposal to hike pensions in
two steps during 2008–09 passed unanimously on a fast-track basis, although there was little
clarity on the financing of the second-stage hike or the implications for the medium-term
financial integrity of public pensions.
14.
Monetary policy responded proactively to the fluid macroeconomic
environment. During the first half of 2007, the NBR reacted to the sharply appreciating
currency and declining inflation with policy-rate easing. While booming domestic demand
and growing capacity pressures raised some questions about the wisdom of this easing
course, the NBR also had countervailing concerns that the nominal exchange rate might have
become overvalued. However, starting in July 2007, surging food and energy prices as well
as the sharply depreciating exchange rate pushed inflation well above the target band
(Figure 9). The NBR responded by hiking its policy rate in several steps to 9.75 percent.
15.
The NBR also took measures to contain banking system vulnerabilities.
Additional provisions for foreign-currency denominated loans to unhedged borrowers took
effect in March 2008. Moreover, with structural excess liquidity in the banking system
tightening, a new regulation has been issued requiring banks to strengthen their liquidity
management.
16.
In part reflecting political gridlock and post-EU-accession fatigue, the pace of
structural reforms has slowed down. The future speed of sustainable real convergence will
largely depend on advancing structural reforms. Looming structural growth bottlenecks
include Romania’s exceptionally large and inefficient agricultural sector, inflexible labor
markets, an education system insufficiently focused on marketable skills, an underdeveloped
public infrastructure, and low energy efficiency. Romania continues to trail best-performing
new EU member peers on most structural reform indicators, lagging particularly in the areas
of business licensing, ease of employing workers, registering property, public infrastructure,
and control of corruption (Table 8).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The Article IV discussions focused on the policies best suited to achieve
sustainable real and nominal convergence:
•

What is the outlook for a soft landing over the medium term, especially under
different fiscal and incomes policies?

•

What changes in fiscal policy management could help underpin less procyclical and
more proactive fiscal policies?

•

How should the NBR implement its fledgling inflation-targeting framework given
high inflation but also concerns about rising financial vulnerabilities?

What are the main financial vulnerabilities and how should financial-sector policies
insure against a potential hard landing?
A. Outlook

18.
Romania’s economic
sentiment remains robust, but both
global and regional leading indicators
point to strong cyclical headwinds. In
the latest World Economic Outlook,
global and EU growth is projected to
cool during 2008–09, and economic
sentiment in some other regional
absorption-boom economies has already
declined sharply. Although the timing
of an eventual slowdown in Romania
remains quite uncertain, especially with
the construction sector still booming,
there was broad agreement that the push
forces behind Romania’s absorption
boom are likely to lose momentum.

19.
Under unchanged fiscal policies, staff argued that it could be quite difficult to
keep inflation expectations anchored and to achieve external balance over the medium
term. The staff baseline scenario assumes that the authorities will meet their presently
planned 2008 fiscal deficit target (2 percent of GDP), while fiscal deficits beyond 2008
would revert to close to 3 percent of GDP, as envisaged in the 2007-10 Convergence
Program. Although a tight monetary policy is assumed to counter excess-demand pressures,
the uncoordinated policy mix would make it difficult to bring inflation back into target range
by 2009, potentially undermining the credibility of the inflation-targeting framework
(Figure 10, Table 9a). Moreover, relatively loose fiscal policies over the medium term could
also—by lowering public and private savings—frustrate external adjustment to a more
sustainable current-account deficit, although the external imbalance would narrow relative to
the present level, and external debt would stabilize at about 50 percent of GDP by 2013
(Appendix I). This scenario could, however, also reach a tipping point, where a sudden
adverse shift in market sentiment may result in a sharp slowdown of capital inflows. A
resulting slump in output combined with an abrupt depreciation could adversely affect the
debt-servicing capacity of households and enterprises, thus putting the banking system under
strain.
20.
Against this backdrop, the mission suggested that a soft landing would need to
be underpinned by a more prudent policy mix. In the staff’s recommended policies
scenario, fiscal policy would be tightened during 2008–09, reducing the deficit in two steps

1/ The recommended scenario assumes a tighter fiscal and income policy relative to the unchanged policies
scenario. Specifically, compared with the unchanged policies scenario, average fiscal expenditure is lower by
1½ percent of GDP during 2008-13, mainly reflecting lower pensions, wages, and capital spending.

23
close to what is broadly agreed to be a reasonable medium-term fiscal deficit target for
Romania (1 percent of GDP). With absorption growth moderating faster than under the
baseline, this facilitates more rapid disinflation and a gradual reduction in the current-account
deficit to sustainable levels (Figure 10, Table 9b). In fact, the authorities’ own medium-term
scenario, while somewhat more optimistic on short-term growth, had broadly similar
features, although it did not elaborate on the assumed policy mix. Staff noted that even a
prudent policy mix might not suffice to prevent a sharp slowdown given financial exposures
and external uncertainties, and financial sector policies especially would need to be prepared
for a potential hard landing. On the other hand, there would also be the upside risk that
favorable external developments continued to underpin a boom for some time, widening the
current-account deficit further, and rendering controlling underlying inflation pressures by
tightening the policy mix even more challenging.
21.
Thus, going forward, Romania’s external stability risks will be contingent on
future policies and shocks. However, under a more-balanced policy mix, external stability
risks should remain contained, particularly if financial-sector buffers are also strengthened
further. Conversely, given accumulated financial vulnerabilities, the risk of disruptive future
exchange rate movements would increase under less-balanced policies or large adverse
shocks.
B. Fiscal Policy
22.
There was broad agreement on the desirable features of a stability- and growthoriented fiscal framework:
•

A medium-term fiscal deficit target of about 1 percent of GDP would be appropriate
to maintain fiscal sustainability and to allow unimpeded symmetric operation of
automatic fiscal stabilizers.

•

To help stabilize the economy, fiscal policy should avoid procyclicality as the
economy moves through different growth phases.

•

And to support fast real convergence, while also attending to the population’s social
protection needs, fiscal policy should use budget resources, including EU funds, more
efficiently to strengthen the economy’s supply side.

23.
The mission argued that recent budgets were not in line with these requirements.
In particular, given the absorption boom, a cyclically-neutral fiscal stance would have
resulted in a small 2007 budget surplus, rather than the 2¼ percent of GDP deficit actually
registered. As regards the 2008 budget, a recent budget rectification and measures to control
spending have reduced the deficit target to close to 2 percent of GDP, clearly steps in the
right direction (Table 7). However, staff considered that a still lower 2008 deficit target of
1½ percent of GDP, while not first best given past years’ large procyclical fiscal impulses,
would provide a more balanced policy mix. The mission also expressed concern that revenue

24
projections seemed overoptimistic (by ¾ percent of GDP). At the same time, the mission saw
scope to curtail the large budgeted hikes in spending on capital as well as maintenance and
operations in line with the advocated tighter fiscal stance, while also relieving overheating
pressures in the booming construction sector.
24.
The government authorities noted that massive investment needs and political
constraints account for a perhaps less-than-ideal cyclical fiscal stance. While recognizing
the nub of the procyclicality problem, the government authorities viewed Romania’s low
debt and the 3 percent Maastricht deficit ceiling as providing fiscal space to boost investment
spending. The mission noted that EU fiscal norms, properly interpreted, militate against
procyclical fiscal behavior, and also pointed out that other regional absorption-boom
economies have behaved much less procyclically than Romania during 2003–07, while
broadly matching Romania’s achieved increases in public investment (Figure 11).
25.
Owing to populist pressures ahead of elections, both the mission and the
authorities saw significant upside risks to the 2008 fiscal deficit, which would need to be
strongly resisted. The upper house had already approved a cut in the VAT rate on food
items from 19 to 5 percent, with full-year fiscal cost amounting to up to ½ percent of GDP,
depending on implementation details. Some political parties had suggested to bring forward
the already approved pension increase from January 2009 to an earlier date. And there could
be potentially significant overruns in the public-sector wage bill, which the 2008 budget aims
at broadly stabilizing at the 2007 level as a ratio to GDP.
26.
There was also broad agreement that progress toward better fiscal policies
would need to be underpinned by changes in Romania’s “budget culture.” The mission
highlighted cross-country evidence for EU countries suggesting that sound budgetary
procedures and the effective use of medium-term fiscal frameworks are associated with lower
deficits and debts, less procyclical fiscal policies, and increased efficiency of government
spending.3 Key steps to improve fiscal institutions should include: upgrading fiscal expertise
and capacity at the executive and legislative levels; modifying rules and procedures to
alleviate the present short-term policy orientation, including by reducing the scope for
multiple budget revisions; and using independent expert panels to provide macroeconomic
and revenue forecasts, insulating the budget process from politically motivated biases.
27.
The 2009 budget would provide a good testing ground for a more forwardlooking fiscal policy approach. In staff’s view, besides the need to implement a stabilityoriented fiscal stance consistent with a deficit target close to 1 percent of GDP, the 2009
budget needs to be based on a review of the sustainability of the public pension system,

C. Monetary Policy
28.
The monetary stance going forward will need to remain clearly focused on
lowering inflation in line with the announced target path. While the macroeconomic
outlook is likely to remain fluid, there was agreement that, absent a sharp-slowdown
scenario, additional policy tightening may be needed to keep inflation expectations anchored,
while bringing inflation back into the end-2009 target range. Without prejudice to its primary
objective, the NBR also intended to give continued consideration to the impact of further
policy rate increases on financial vulnerabilities, but expressed confidence that price and
financial stability considerations complement each other at this point. There was also broad
agreement that NBR communication needs to try to avoid fostering impressions in the
markets that it would be strongly averse to allowing either the policy rate or the lei/euro
exchange rate to cross certain unconditional threshold values.
29.
Although inflation now exceeds the target range by an uncomfortable margin,
there was agreement that the inflation-targeting framework has proven its mettle in a
difficult external and domestic environment. In particular, the mission and the authorities
saw little merit in raising the inflation target or widening the band, as such accommodating
steps could only add to the difficulty of keeping inflation expectations anchored. However,
with inflation likely to remain significantly above the target range before re-entering it
in 2009, implementation and communication of the inflation-targeting framework would
remain a difficult challenge. The NBR plans to continue upgrading its implementation
capacity. The mission also noted that, following the lead of selected best-practice inflationtargeting central banks, an independent expert review of the framework might also be useful
to take stock of the NBR’s accumulated experience.
D. Financial Sector Policies
30.
With financial vulnerabilities rising, the NBR plans to further intensify financial
sector surveillance. There was agreement that risks to financial stability, foremost direct and
indirect credit risk, but also liquidity risk, had increased and needed close monitoring. The
NBR, while recognizing that capital buffers had shrunk considerably, took comfort from
stress tests—which included exchange rate, interest rate, and liquidity shocks—indicating
that existing buffers remain adequate. The mission noted that the NBR’s Financial Stability
Report testified to its greatly enhanced capacity to monitor and assess financial sector trends
and risks. At the same time, stress testing methodologies could be refined further, including
4

The analysis and detailed proposals in World Bank, 2006, “Romania: Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review” on these and other spending issues remain largely apposite.

27
by allowing stronger feedback effects between the real economy and banking soundness
indicators. The recent initiative to remedy the lack of reliable statistics for real estate prices,
while overdue, was also welcome.
31.
There was broad agreement that additional preemptive measures were
warranted to contain risks to financial stability. To contain credit risk, the mission
advised higher capital requirements for riskier exposures, including real estate ones. The
mission also urged to complement the new regulation for liquidity risks with on-site
inspections and to consider broadening the range of eligible collateral for its overdraft
facility. With many banks seemingly still focused on aggressively gaining market share,
including by promoting exotic credit products, it would also be important that the NBR
continued to encourage monitoring and containing operational risks. The authorities stressed
that they were ready to take additional measures as necessary. The NBR also underlined that
it will only allow banks to fully exploit the flexibility in Basel II after having carefully vetted
banks’ internal models.
32.
As part of EU commitments, the authorities are strengthening their crisis
preparedness arrangements. A crisis management group has been established, and a crisis
contingency plan is being prepared. The key elements of a safety net—lender of last resort
rules, deposit insurance, bank resolution framework—are in place, but remain largely
untested. The most recent memorandum of understanding on cross-border financial crisis
preparedness, signed by all EU countries, has again highlighted the need to coordinate
regulatory and prudential actions with pertinent foreign regulators.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Romania has made significant strides in catching up with EU income levels, but
fast real convergence has gone hand-in-hand with growing macroeconomic imbalances.
Once EU accession prospects looked secure, foreign capital flooded into Romania to take
advantage of perceived improvements in investment risks and returns, triggering an
absorption boom. This boom has been mirrored by a widening current-account deficit,
although the present level of the exchange rate does not raise significant external stability
concerns. With labor market conditions tightening and fiscal policies in procyclical mode, the
absorption boom has also raised underlying inflation pressures. Food and energy price shocks
have pushed headline inflation well above the NBR’s target range, while global financial
market turbulence so far has been mainly reflected in somewhat higher external funding costs
and increased exchange rate volatility.
34.
While the economic outlook is quite uncertain, with a better policy mix
macroeconomic imbalances should gradually normalize over the medium term, in line
with Romania’s ambition to adopt the euro by 2014. The economy has yet to show signs
of slowing to a more sustainable pace; at the same time, lingering global financial market
tensions hold the risk of a sharp slowdown. However, under any scenario, a key challenge for

28
Romania will be to adopt more stability-oriented fiscal and incomes policies that
complement, rather than counteract, the NBR’s monetary policy. But Romania’s policymaking challenges go well beyond plain policy coordination problems in an overheating
economy. In particular, the sustainable speed of real convergence will ultimately depend on
the ability of policies to address growth bottlenecks in a forward-looking manner, calling for
fresh efforts to catch up with best-performing new EU member peers on structural reforms.
35.
Fiscal policy should be tightened. Romania’s fiscal position—particularly as
indicated by low public debt levels—is relatively sound. Nevertheless, it would have been
appropriate to respond to the private-sector absorption boom by allowing automatic fiscal
stabilizers to operate around the broadly agreed medium-term fiscal deficit target of 1 percent
of GDP. As illustrated by the experience of other regional economies, a less procyclical fiscal
stance does not need to conflict with increased spending on capital. In this vein, and building
on the recent welcome budget rectification, the fiscal stance in 2008 should be tightened
further to achieve a deficit of about 1½ percent of GDP. A tighter fiscal stance would relieve
the burden on monetary policy, but also put the deficit on a credible consolidation path
toward its medium-term target and avoid the need to adopt a procyclical fiscal stance when
the economy shifts to a slower-growth phase. While upcoming elections will make achieving
this more ambitious deficit target politically difficult, there is considerable scope to restrain
budgeted spending on maintenance and operations as well as on capital, and such spending
restraint could help mitigate overheating pressures in the booming construction sector. It will
also be important to maintain wage discipline in the public sector, and resist populist
pressures to increase social spending or cut taxes during the run-up to the elections.
36.
A more proactive fiscal policy will need to be underpinned by a less myopic
budget culture. The present short-term focus of fiscal policies may well have been aligned
with the demands of an early stage of transition. At this point, such a policy culture has
become counterproductive, as illustrated by Romania’s so far limited success in tapping and
absorbing EU funds. Improving fiscal policy management requires increasing fiscal expertise
and capacity at all government levels, modifying the rules and procedures that underpin the
present short-term orientation, and establishing a role for independent expert panels to
mitigate biases in macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts.
37.
Monetary policy is facing a difficult environment in its efforts to restore low and
stable inflation. An absorption boom, a highly volatile exchange rate, and procyclical fiscal
policies would already constitute considerable challenges for a central bank still building its
inflation-targeting credentials. However, adverse supply shocks have aggravated headline
inflation pressures, and inflation expectations may no longer be fully anchored. The NBR
appropriately responded by tightening the monetary stance through several policy rate hikes,
and additional tightening may be needed to bring inflation back into target range by 2009.
Concurrently, the NBR should continue to strengthen its capacity to implement its
framework, including by taking stock of its inflation-targeting experience since 2005.

29
38.
Given rising financial stability risks, continued vigilance and additional
preemptive measures are warranted. Financial deepening has progressed at a rapid clip,
and private-sector currency mismatches are increasing. Moreover, banks’ non-performing
loans are rising, and previously large capital and liquidity buffers are being eroded, although
financial soundness indicators remain relatively healthy. Admittedly, it is difficult to identify,
motivate, and implement preemptive measures in a setting where financial fragilities are
rising but not yet acute. The recent preemptive measures addressing foreign-exchange risks
of unhedged borrowers and improving banks’ liquidity management are commendable steps
in the right direction. However, larger capital cushions for more risky exposures, including
real-estate exposures, are advisable, while additional measures to contain liquidity and
operational risks should also be considered. The envisaged update of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program later in the year will provide a good opportunity for reviewing the
strengths and vulnerabilities of Romania’s financial system.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Note: On January 1, 2007, the NBR introduced the ESCB's statistical methodology. Only some time series have been recalculated
back to December 2004.
1/ The NBR amended the capital adequacy requirements effective January 1, 2007 to be consistent with EU minimum requirements.
The former 12 percent capital adequacy ratio and 8 percent Tier I were substituted by a new 8 percent solvency ratio.
2/ Refers to loans and commitments to a single debtor above RON 20,000 according to the Central Credit Register, which covers
about 82 percent of total loans and commitments granted.
3/ During 2007, the share of credit to households for house purchase has remained relatively constant around 19–20 percent.
4/ Non-perfroming loans reflect unadjusted exposure to non-performing loans classified as "loss", "doubtful" and "substandard",
according to the NBR's loan classification regulations, as percent of total loans.
5/ Effective liquidity over required liquidity, the mandatory ratio is thus one.
6/ Loan-to-deposit ratio (domestic credit to domestic deposits, including government).
7/ Covers the regulated market at Bucharest Stock Exchange, including SIFs, and RASDAQ. Derivatives, which are traded at
SIBEX, are excluded.

1/ First budget rectification approved in March 2008.
2/ Includes co-financing of EU projects.
3/ Excluding public debt guarantees.
4/ Actual fiscal balance adjusted for the automatic effects of output gap and absorption gap on the fiscal position. See IMF Country
Report No. 07/390, Chapter III for details.
5/ Percentage deviation of actual from potential GDP.
6/ Percentage deviation between actual absorption and the level consistent with external balance.
7/ The significant difference between cash-based and ESA95 fiscal balances in 2006 is mainly due to cancellation of Iraq debt and
accrued spending commitments (including by the property compensation fund and local governments).

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator
in euro terms, g = real GDP growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent
of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in euros (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (euros terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (euros terms, in percent)

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individuual shocks to (i) interest rate and growth and (ii) non-interest
current account are permanent one and one-half standard deviation shocks, respectively. Figures in the boxes
represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Sevenyear historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2009.

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of
areas with more than 40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations where
applicable and repayment obligations otherwise. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations
(within predetermined limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong
enough to meet the expectations without undue hardship or risk.

48
have had a mixed record with regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused
on a number of key areas, including: fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and
the banking system; creating a market-oriented legal structure; training; and improving the
collection and reporting of statistics. The implementation of a comprehensive tax
administration reform designed in line with the recommendations of several technical
assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department started in January 2003. A report
on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency was completed on
November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254). In 2003 an FSAP was completed, and
an FSAP Update is tentatively scheduled for November 2008. Furthermore, technical
assistance by the Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department on inflation targeting is
ongoing.
X.

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework

The legislative framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) has been recently updated to bring Romania in line with international
standards and to fulfill the requirements set forth by the third EU directive on AML/CFT.
Obligations have been introduced for reporting entities to ascertain beneficial ownership of
client accounts and to carry out enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, such as in
the case of politically exposed persons. The supervisory framework has been extended to
cover certain non-financial businesses and professions. The level of AML supervision of the
banking sector has improved, and the NBR appears to be taking this issue seriously. The
authorities have also started to undertake more inspections of the financial sector at large and
on the non financial sector (including casinos, a sector that had been pointed out in the past
as particularly vulnerable to money laundering risks). Romania recently underwent an
AML/CFT mutual evaluation conducted by MONEYVAL, and the report is expected to be
approved at the forthcoming MONEYVAL Plenary (July 2008). The authorities should
ensure the effective implementation of the new AML/CFT provisions and continue to focus
on supervision of the financial sector at large as well as of casinos and bureaus de change.
XI.

Resident Representative

The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Juan Jose
Fernandez-Ansola assumed the post of senior regional resident representative in
September 2006.

49
APPENDIX III. ROMANIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural and
institutional reforms aimed at Romania’s successful EU integration and convergence.
Reforms include private and financial sector development, institution building and
governance. The World Bank has several sector investment operations, economic work such
as the Municipal Finance Policy Note and the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review,
and commitments through the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Policy areas where
the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into the IMF country dialogue include
strengthening the social safety nets, revitalizing the economy in rural areas, institution
building and governance, and improving the business environment.
2.
The Bank’s analysis is shared with the IMF and is used as input to the fiscal
framework, including structural reform measures which have important fiscal implications,
such as energy sector reform and restructuring. There are further areas of formal joint
responsibility such as the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
3.
Overall the IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s reform program and are coordinating their policy advice to the
Romanian authorities.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
Financial Sector. The Bank and the IMF jointly conducted a FSAP for Romania
which was completed in June 2003. The FSAP provided a shared perspective on the
development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and sequencing of reforms in the
financial sector. An update on the FSAP is tentatively scheduled for November 2008.
5.
Municipal finance reform. The Bank has led the dialogue on municipal finance
reform by preparing a Policy Note on the legal and regulatory reforms for municipal finance,
including a detailed assessment of the deficiencies of the legal and regulatory framework for
municipal borrowing and municipal bond issuance.
6.
Energy sector. The Bank has also led the dialogue on restructuring, reform and
eventual privatization of enterprises in the electricity, district heating and gas industries and
on the adoption of regulatory legislation in preparation for privatization to strategic investors.
As part of this process the Bank is supporting, inter alia, energy tariff reforms and reforms in
the electricity, district heat and gas sectors. These objectives are woven into the policy
conditions of the Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) program, along with conditions
related to the privatization of electricity distribution enterprises. These conditions have been
closely coordinated with the IMF. The dialogue with the Government is focused on such
critical long-term issues as restructuring of power generation and the integration of the

50
Romanian power sector with the Southeast European Regional Electricity Market and with
the EU’s electricity market, and provides assistance on the associated regulatory and market
operation issues. The Bank has also provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry
to establish a system of pricing and taxation of gas consistent with attracting further
investment into the industry. Policy dialogue in these and other areas, notably including the
district heating sector, will be further facilitated by ongoing dialogue with the Government
on the recently completed Energy and Infrastructure Strategy paper and its operational
recommendations.
7.
Banking sector. The Bank has taken the lead in dialogue and policy advice regarding
regulation, restructuring, privatization and liquidation of banks. Under the Programmatic
Structural Adjustment Loan 1 (PSAL 1), the Law on Bank Privatization was modified and
transparent privatization procedures established. Liquidity and solvency requirements of the
NBR were tightened and provisions introduced for improved compliance with prudential
regulations and external audits conducted according to International Accounting Standards.
Legal and institutional reforms were introduced for orderly disposition of non-performing
assets. These policy changes underpinned liquidation of the most troubled bank (Bancorex )
while Bank Agricola was restructured and eventually privatized as were two smaller state
owned banks. This policy agenda has been continued under the PAL program and included
privatization of the largest state bank BCR. The Bank is continuing the dialogue with the
government on the need to move forward with further improvements of the legal and
regulatory framework for the securities and insurance sectors. The Private and Public Sector
Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) will provide funding for these activities.
C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
8.
The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania was presented to the
World Bank’s Board on May 16, 2006. It was designed to facilitate Romania’s integration
with the EU building on three pillars: (a) accelerating structural and institutional reforms to
support sustainable growth; (b) addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and modernizing the public
sector; and (c) targeting poverty reduction and promoting social inclusion. A flexible lending
program of $450 million to $550 million per year was envisaged using a mix of investment
lending and programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPL). Base case lending includes
investment projects subject to pre-conditions of appropriate sector policy and an acceptable
medium term sector expenditure framework. High case lending would be a combination of
investment and development policy lending where the latter would require maintenance of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework as per Bank guidelines and periodic review in
consultation with the IMF.
9.
Since the beginning of the CPS period several investment loans have been made.
However, no further DPLs have been concluded and after the PAL 1 was completed, the
PAL program was officially dropped in January 2007.

51
10.
The World Bank has been active in Romania since 1991, and the portfolio is now the
largest in the ECA Region in terms of number of projects and third largest in commitments.
While the portfolio grew rapidly between 2004 and 2007, in the run-up to EU accession, no
new projects are currently planned. The current IBRD and GEF portfolio consists of
23 projects with aggregate net commitments totaling $1.785 billion and a total undisbursed
balance of $1.27 billion. Sector composition in terms of net commitments is dominated by
environment and socially sustainable development (35 percent, 12 projects), and energy and
infrastructure (39 percent, 5 projects), followed by the social sectors (14 percent, four
projects).
11.
Implementation of projects in the Bank’s Romania portfolio has slowed in recent
years. In FY06 and FY07 Romania’s annual disbursement ratio fell below its 16 percent
historical average and from a peak of 27 percent in FY03. Today, 86 percent of the
portfolio’s net commitments have been approved in the last four FYs, and three-fourths of
them are less than three years old. Given that new loans typically do not start disbursing very
much during the first two years following loan approval, this accounts for some of the
portfolio disbursement slowdown, while other delays are attributable to implementation
delays, policy changes or delays and financing gaps. The Bank and the Government are
working together to address this issue.
12.
IFC has dedicated substantial resources to assist the development of capital markets
and infrastructure (utilities and telecommunication), and provide support for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs). To date, IFC has committed over US$772 million of its own
funds in 42 projects and has arranged over $241 million in syndications to support projects in
the financial markets, information technology, food and beverage, general manufacturing,
health care and infrastructure. In addition to investments, IFC has undertaken a number of
advisory assignments aimed at supporting the privatization and restructuring of large stateowned enterprises, public utilities and the health sector.

52
APPENDIX IV. ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provided to the Fund have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate for
surveillance. The quality of the national accounts, price, fiscal, and balance of payments data
still needs improvement. The authorities have made progress in improving economic and
financial statistics with technical assistance, including from the Fund, over the past several
years. Romania began participating in the GDDS in February 2001 and graduated to
subscription to the SDDS in May 2005.
Real Sector
2.
Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Estimates
are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS). However, quarterly and annual national accounts
are not harmonized on a regular basis and late revisions have sometimes been significant.
Provisional and semi-final versions are disseminated in the Statistical Yearbook and other
publications, as well as on the web (www.insse.ro).
3.
The Consumer Price Index is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and is
considered reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the Producer Price
Index to include the domestic and export sectors.
4.
There are still deficiencies in labor market statistics that hamper the assessment of
developments in employment and wages, as well as their consistency and comparability with
labor statistics from other countries in the region. In order to address these shortcomings, the
INS (i) is addressing the reporting coverage of private sector wages, especially in the
construction sector; (ii) has started including ad hoc bonuses in the public-sector wage series,
although only as from 2007; (iii) is working on a new definition of employment consistent
with ESA 95.
Public Finance
5.
Annual GFS data are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash data using
various adjustment methods. Tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash method;
expense data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and, interest payments are calculated
on an accrual basis. Beginning in 2002, the Special Fund for Development of the Energy
System, the Special Fund for Public Roads, the Special Fund “Romanian Agriculture
Development,” and the Special Fund “Romania” were included in the state budget, while the
Special Fund for Insured Protection was eliminated from general government accounts. The

53
reported data excluded data on the Agency for Recovery Bank Assets.6 EUR receives
monthly budget data. The authorities introduced a new budget classification for the 2006
budget and have also produced the 2004-05 budget outturns on the basis of the new
classification.
6.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported for inclusion in the
GFS Yearbook, albeit with a significant lag. Consolidated general government data were
reported for the first time for inclusion in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and Financial
7.
Monetary statistics need to be reconciled with government finance statistics. In line
with 1993 SNA and MFSM, accrued interest on deposits and loans, and securities other than
shares should be incorporated in the corresponding outstanding amount of the financial
instrument.
8.
The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and financial statistics on a
regular and timely basis for publication in the IFS. Since December 2004, the NBR reports
monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The data are being
published in the IFS Supplement, beginning September 2006. Romania’s data and metadata
for financial soundness indicators are posted on the IMF’s website
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/cce/index.htm).
Balance of Payments
9.
The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund in a timely
fashion. A 2003 STA mission undertook a detailed review of the NBR’s compilation
methodology for balance of payments and international investment position statistics,
developed in consultation with Eurostat, and concluded that the proposed system is broadly
appropriate. The STA mission supported implementation of this compilation system in 2004,
along with a new FDI survey.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Romania
On June 25, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Romania. 1
Background
Underpinned by massive capital inflows, GDP growth has remained strong. In 2007, real GDP
grew by 6 percent, but agriculture was adversely affected by a drought (non-agricultural output
expanded at a robust 7.4 percent). Despite healthy export growth, the current-account deficit
widened markedly from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2006 to 14 percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting
booming domestic demand, strong credit growth, and procyclical fiscal and incomes policies.
The fiscal deficit (cash basis) in 2007 increased to 2¼ percent of GDP, sharply up from a deficit
of ½ percent of GDP. The government has reduced its original fiscal deficit target for 2008 to
close to 2 percent of GDP. Higher agricultural and energy prices as well as excess demand
contributed to more than a doubling of headline inflation from May 2007 (3.8 percent, year-onyear) to May 2008 (8.5 percent, year-on-year). The exchange rate depreciated sharply after the
turmoil in international financial markets started in August 2007, but has stabilized since
February 2008. In response to inflation rising well above its target range, the National Bank of
Romania (NBR) increased its policy rate several times from October (7.0 percent) to May (9.75
percent).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Recent indicators suggest continued strong growth during the first half of 2008. The current
account deficit, however, is expected to increase to 14½ percent in 2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong growth of the Romanian economy in 2007 and 2008,
with unemployment falling and external competitiveness preserved, as seen in rising exports
and gains in export market shares. These positive developments have contributed to an
impressive increase in per capita income. At the same time, Directors observed that large
capital inflows related to Romania’s accession to the EU, compounded by procyclical fiscal
policies, have contributed to booms in domestic demand and credit and emerging capacity
constraints. The current account deficit has also increased to unsustainable levels. Directors
expressed concern about underlying inflation pressures, as the first-round effects of food and
energy price increases have already pushed headline inflation above the National Bank of
Romania’s (NBR) target range. They noted that world financial market tensions contributed to a
sharp nominal depreciation of the Romanian currency, and cautioned that Romania remains
vulnerable to additional adverse spillovers from events in global markets.
Against that background, Directors considered that the key challenge for the authorities in the
period ahead will be to strengthen policies and enhance structural reforms to support
convergence to EU levels, consistent with the authorities’ ambition to adopt the euro by 2014.
This will require a better balance between fiscal and monetary policies to counteract private
sector-driven macroeconomic imbalances.
In assessing fiscal policy, Directors agreed that a much less procyclical fiscal stance would
have been appropriate given growing imbalances, even though the public sector balance sheet
remains sound. Looking ahead, Directors supported targeting a fiscal deficit of about 1½
percent of GDP in 2008. Also in view of upcoming parliamentary elections, Directors
underscored the importance of maintaining wage discipline in the public sector and resisting
pressures to increase social spending or cut taxes.
Directors urged the authorities to strengthen fiscal institutions. A more medium-term-oriented
fiscal policy would not only help Romania maintain sound public finances but also would
mitigate procyclical fiscal policy biases and increase the efficiency of public spending. A
medium-term fiscal framework would also enhance Romania’s capacity to absorb EU transfers.
Directors considered that improving Romania’s budget culture will require increasing fiscal
expertise at all government levels, modifying present short-term-oriented budget rules and
procedures, and making more use of independent expert panels to mitigate biases in budget
forecasts.
Turning to monetary policy, Directors welcomed the NBR’s commitment to price stability in a
challenging environment, and stressed the need to firmly anchor inflation expectations. The
NBR has appropriately tightened the monetary stance since mid-2007, but additional tightening
may be needed to bring inflation back into the target range set for 2009. Directors encouraged
the NBR to continue to strengthen its capacity to implement and communicate to the public its
inflation targeting framework. They agreed that Romania’s flexible exchange rate policy has

3
served the country well, operating as a self-correcting mechanism during the current
imbalances. Directors took note of the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
close to its equilibrium level.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to manage proactively and contain the
present financial stability risks, as evidenced by the rising level of nonperforming loans and
shrinking capital and liquidity buffers during a period of rapid credit growth. They welcomed
recent measures to raise provisioning for unhedged foreign exchange borrowing and to require
banks to improve their liquidity management. Additional preemptive measures to increase
cushions for more risky credit exposures may be needed, particularly in the real estate sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to conduct an Financial Sector Assessment
Program update later this year.
Directors recommended that structural reform efforts be relaunched to support per capita
income convergence to EU levels. Foreign investor interest in Romania remains strong, but
looming structural bottlenecks will need to be addressed if this interest is to be preserved or
even expanded. Further emphasis will need to be placed on structural reforms with a view to
raising energy efficiency, developing public infrastructure, liberalizing further the labor markets,
and strengthening the judicial system.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Romania
and Mihai Nicolae Tanasescu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 25, 2008
My Romanian authorities would like to thank staff for the useful discussions. They
appreciate the Fund’s advice and the presentation of the topics covered in the Selected Issues
report. They broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of Romania’s economic situation and
their general recommendations on economic and financial policies, and agree on the need to
address imbalances.
Economic performance and outlook
Macroeconomic performance has been strong. Romania has made marked progress in the last
eight years, from an economy based on agriculture and cheap labor to one driven by
investment. High rates of GDP growth, at an average of 5.6 percent for 2000-2007, an
increasing share of fixed capital formation, and large inflows of foreign direct investment
point to an economy catching up with European norms. Last year the real GDP grew
6 percent, and in the first quarter of 2008 GDP growth reached 8.2 percent. At the end
of 2008 the GDP growth is projected to reach around 7 percent. GDP growth’s main drivers
will remain final consumption and gross fixed capital formation. From the supply side, a
likely bounce in agricultural production, following a drought-induced contraction last year, is
expected to provide support for a stronger than expected economic growth. A certain degree
of uncertainty surrounds the likely impact of the global credit crunch, as well as the impact of
the slowdown in main trading-partner economies on the domestic economy, but endogenous
dynamics are likely to remain robust. Last year CPI inflation has continued to fall until mid2007, and reached its lowest level of 3.7 percent y/y at end March-2007. Solid growth and
price stability resulted in an increase of the number of employed persons in both 2007
and 2008, and the registered unemployment rate reached its lowest level of 3.9 percent in
April 2008.
Despite this good economic performance areas of concern still exist. Economic growth is
fuelled by domestic demand, based on a combination of rising wages and a credit boom, and
this has stimulated imports and an unsustainable current account deficit which reached at the
end-2007 14 percent of GDP from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2006. FDI coverage of the current
account deficit shrank from 67.5 percent in 2006 (excluding proceeds of 3.75 billions euros
from the BCR privatization) to 42 percent last year. The financing gap was covered by the
other liabilities component of the financial account, in the form of primarily private-sector
foreign currency borrowing. Medium-term downside risks to the growth outlook include a
wide external deficit and the rapidly growing private-sector external indebtedness, which
render the economy vulnerable to disruptions in external funding flows. Inflation has picked
up, reaching 8.5 percent (yoy) in May 2008, and may be attributed to some supply-side
shocks, such as energy and food prices, but the rise in annual inflation is still amplified by
the fast dynamics of aggregate demand, which is fuelled mainly by income and lending
growth, as well as by the exchange rate depreciation.

2
The authorities recognize the potential risks associated with Romania’s external imbalances,
especially in light of the diminished global growth outlook and persistent strains in
commodity and financial markets. Both fiscal and monetary policies for 2008 have adopted
some measures to contain the current risks. The government already approved a new budget
rectification and measures to control spending, and reduced its fiscal deficit target for 2008
from 2.8 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent of GDP (GDP as projected by authorities). At the
same time, the authorities have expressed their commitment to adopt a wage increase policy
in line with productivity gains, and to improve the public spending structure. The Central
Bank (NBR) responded proactively, and has already tightened broad money conditions, and
has raised its policy rate in several steps to 9.75 percent. The NBR also took measures to
contain banking system vulnerabilities by adding new provisions for foreign currency
denominated loans, and approved a new regulation requiring banks to strengthen their
liquidity management. On a positive note, non-privatization FDI, excluding the proceeds
from the BCR privatization, grew by 44 percent yoy in 2007, and the first four months
of 2008 balance-of-payments data showed a considerable improvement in FDI inflows,
which reached 3.2 billion euros, double the amount in the same period of 2007. The FDI
inflows have been concentrated in export-oriented industries, which likely reflects the strong
profitability of Romania’s export-oriented industries and suggests that the potential for
further inroads into world markets may be significant. At the same time the trade deficit
shows signs of stabilization in the first quarter of 2008. This was the result of growth in
exports outpacing that of imports (13.5 percent yoy vs. 12.3 percent yoy), and constitutes an
improvement relative to the first quarter of 2007, when we saw a large deterioration in the
trade deficit (108 percent yoy). Romania’s exports structure has been increasingly shifting
toward higher value added non-textile manufacturing goods, and shows an upward trend in
unit values of primary manufactured products, suggesting quality improvement in the
country’s exports. The authorities recognize that it is still too early to view the recent
narrowing of the gap between exports and imports as a trend. We note that the sharp current
account deficit widening in recent years has had a large investment component, and the latter
is expected to boost the productive capacity and the export orientation of the economy in the
medium-term.
Fiscal policy
My authorities plan to maintain a prudent fiscal stance within the Maastricht limits, in order
to anchor macro stability. In the last three years the fiscal balance played an important role in
bringing down the inflation rate, and fiscal deficits remained below 3 percent of GDP.
For 2008 the fiscal deficit is now projected at 2.3 percent of GDP and the authorities’ view is
that it is still broadly consistent with macro stability. They are of the view that a deficit of
this magnitude does not alter Romania’s sound fundamentals, including the very low level of
public debt (12.1 percent of GDP end-2007). This, together with the anchor provided by EU
membership, makes the country less vulnerable to an abrupt change in market sentiment. In
the first four months of 2008 the consolidated budget ran a 0.2 percent of GDP surplus
against a 0.1 percent deficit in the same period of 2007. The Romanian authorities are

3
committed to avoiding a fiscal slippage ahead of the end-2008 parliamentary elections, and
they consider crucial that fiscal policy supports the monetary policy’s disinflation objectives
and the anchoring of inflation expectations. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has taken
tough measures to control the budgetary expenditures, both at central and local levels,
including monthly caps for line ministries spending, and ceilings on the annual local
government borrowings and drawings under loan facilities.
Against this background, my authorities are fully committed to continuing to improve the
country’s budget culture and the fiscal institutions, avoiding short-term measures and the
practice of multiple budget revisions, and focusing on well-defined budgetary procedures and
on effective medium-term fiscal frameworks. In this context, a multiannual fiscal framework
will be drafted this year for the next three years, and projections will be supported by a clear
policy statement and based on realistic macroeconomic assumptions. At the same time, the
authorities are also working on creating mechanisms to ensure the efficient allocation of
resources and absorption of the EU funds, which will help implementing a more uniform
spending pattern over the year.
Monetary policy and financial sector
Monetary policy will remain clearly focused on lowering the inflation rate in line with the
announced target path, and NBR envisages a return of inflation to the target range in 2009,
while preserving financial stability and avoiding a widening of current macroeconomic
imbalances. After reaching a post-communist low of 3.7 percent yoy in March 2007, inflation
has returned to an upward path, overshooting the NBR’s end-2007 inflation target of
4.0 percent (+/-1 percent) by a significant margin. The main culprits of the recent inflation
rise were the higher fuel and food prices, the effects from a weaker leu, and demand side
pressures, due to rapid wage and credit growth. Recently, the NBR upped its end-2008
inflation projection to 6.0 percent yoy, from 5.9 percent yoy, a rate that exceeds this year’s
3.8 percent (+/- 1percent) tolerance range. In this context the NBR tightened its policy to
curb inflation, raising its key policy rate by a cumulative 275 bps since last October to
9.75 percent and pushed up the sterilized liquidity volumes in a move to bring the levels of
interbank rates closer to the monetary policy interest rate. At the same time, the NBR
maintained the existing minimum reserve requirements on both leu- and foreign exchange
denominated liabilities at 20 percent and 40 percent respectively, and extended higher
provisioning for foreign exchange denominated credits to unhedged borrowers, which has
reduced the share of foreign exchange credit from over 62 percent in March 2005 to around
55 percent currently. Even though the annual inflation rate is projected to exceed the upper
limit of the annual variation band, the NBR remains committed to inflation targeting, and
also stands ready to tighten its monetary policy stance further to achieve the target of
3.5 percent yoy at end-2009. In this respect, the NBR plans to continue upgrading the
implementation and communication capacity of the inflation targeting framework, including
by taking stock of its inflation targeting experience since 2005.

4
The leu’s nominal appreciation path over the last three years came to a halt in mid-2007, due
to the global credit crisis. We would like to note that, despite its short-term impact on
inflation, exchange rate flexibility is a plus, as it operates as a self-correcting mechanism for
current imbalances, alleviating the impact of external shocks, and it has helped move
Romania’s real effective exchange rate close to its equilibrium level.
The Romanian banking sector remains well-capitalized with an adequate solvency ratio
at12.7 percent at the end-2007, liquid, and resilient to shocks. The recent global financial
market turmoil has not had a major impact on Romanian banks, but the rapid credit growth
and the significant volume of foreign currency denominated credit represent risk factors that
deserve special attention by supervisors. In this context, the NBR is looking to contain credit
risk and to adopt new measures for riskier exposures, including real estate, and to
complement the new regulation for liquidity risks by broadening the range of eligible
collateral for its overdraft facility. Building on the progress made in strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework, the NBR enhanced its cooperation cross-border with
supervisory authorities in other countries. The authorities intend to have an FSAP update late
this year.
Structural reforms
My authorities consider that the continuation of structural reforms is crucial for real
convergence. Implementing tough structural reforms has enabled strong foreign-investor
interest in locating production in Romania, and consolidated the economy’s overall external
price and cost competitiveness. In this context, recently, both Nokia and Ford have opened
new factories in Cluj-Napoca and Craiova respectively, which offers new perspectives of job
creation and improving the standard of living for the people from these regions. On the
energy side, my authorities are determined to continue with the adjustments of the energy
prices and to close the gap with international prices, and to continue with the privatization of
the energy-sector companies. At the beginning of this year Romania has introduced the
second pillar of the pension system and it is committed to further restructuring the pension
system as a whole. The authorities will also continue with the implementation of their
judicial reform agenda. However, due to political constraints in the last year, difficult
structural reforms were largely on hold, but with parliamentary elections due in late-2008,
the future coalition government, with a stronger mandate and purpose, will continue to
accelerate implementing structural reforms.
Concluding, my authorities consider that the present economic policy mix will prevent wide
macroeconomic imbalances, which could be costly and disorderly. In this respect, the
continuation of structural reforms is crucial to boost both productivity and the external
competitiveness of Romanian products, and a tighter than projected fiscal policy together
with prudent monetary policy will help narrowing macroeconomic imbalances and will
consolidate the path to euro adoption which now is foreseen for 2014.
