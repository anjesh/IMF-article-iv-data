REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation, Third Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement, and Financing Assurances Review
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Michele Shannon
March 18, 2010
Discussions. A staff team visited Belgrade during February 9–23 to conduct the 2010
Article IV Consultation and Third Review of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The
mission met with Prime Minister Cvetković, Deputy Prime Ministers Dinkić, Djelić, and
Krkobabić, Minister of Finance Dragutinović, National Bank of Serbia (NBS) Governor
Jelašić, other senior officials, representatives of international financial institutions (IFIs),
the European Union (EU), and the private sector. Staff liaised with an EBRD mission
exploring options to foster domestic-currency lending. Some team members took part in
a Bank Coordination Initiative meeting in Vienna on February 26 to review foreign
parent banks’ commitments to Serbia. The staff team comprised Messrs. Jaeger,
Floerkemeier, Hajdenberg (all EUR), Mr. Arnason (SPR), Mr. Chailloux (MCM), and
Ms. Eble (FAD). Mr. Lissovolik (Resident Representative), Ms. Nestorović, and
Mr. Kokotović (local IMF office) assisted the mission. Mr. Antić (OED) attended most
of the policy meetings.
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The SBA, approved by the Executive Board on
January 16, 2009, was extended to 27 months and augmented to the amount of
SDR 2.6 billion (560 percent of quota) on May 15, 2009 (EBS/09/63). The third tranche,
subject to the completion of this review, amounts to SDR 319.6 million.
Program status. All end-December 2009 performance criteria were met. Progress was
also made on the program’s structural reform benchmarks, albeit with delays.
Response to Fund advice. Before 2009, Fund advice noted that Serbia’s unbalanced
mix of weak structural, expansionary fiscal, and tight monetary policies undermined
competitiveness and macro stability. With the SBA, the authorities' policies have been
broadly consistent with Fund advice, although, as regards fiscal strategy, the authorities
strongly preferred to put the full adjustment burden on current spending, while staff
would have preferred a mix between current spending restraint and VAT increases.
Exchange system. Serbia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains a
floating exchange rate system free of restrictions on current international payments and
transfers, except with respect to blocked pre-1991 foreign currency savings accounts.
Statistics. Statistical data are adequate for surveillance purposes. Since May 2009,
Serbia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

Executive Summary
Background
Before the global financial crisis hit in late-2008, Serbia grew rapidly, but only at the cost of
rising external imbalances and financial stability risks. Serbia has so far weathered the crisis
shocks relatively well. While the output slump was contained, domestic demand dropped
significantly, resulting in rapid external adjustment. Moreover, capital inflows surprised on
the upside, and external financing pressures have abated. However, the pickup in growth will
likely be moderate in the short term, reflecting slow trading partner recoveries, corporate
protracted deleveraging, and lagging labor market adjustment.
Policy discussions
The authorities’ macroeconomic policy response to the economic downturn has been
appropriate. Looking ahead, Serbia’s prospects to achieve sustained medium-term growth
will foremost depend on the authorities’ ability to implement stronger structural and fiscal
policies, but foreign banks and main trading partners will also need to support the shift to a
new growth paradigm. As the recovery takes hold, policies should foster more balanced
growth in the tradable and nontradable sectors, raise domestic savings, contain risks from
unhedged foreign-exchange (FX) lending, and lock in lower and more stable inflation.
On structural reforms, the authorities are committed to increase the role of the private sector,
improve the business climate, address public infrastructure bottlenecks, and seek to expand
trading opportunities through closer integration with the EU and through WTO accession.
Restoring fiscal sustainability within the authorities’ self-imposed constraints of a spendingbased adjustment strategy could build much-needed policy credibility. Bold steps are needed
to replace the nominal freezes of public wages and pensions and other ad hoc measures by
structurally sound spending reforms. However, reforms streamlining public consumption and
non-targeted social transfers have barely begun. And, with the recovery gaining hold and the
2012 elections approaching, political pressures for relaxing fiscal adjustment will be
mounting. Against this backdrop, the authorities’ fiscal strategy is subject to significant
implementation risks, and hence fiscal responsibility legislation is being developed to ensure
spending discipline.
The inflation targeting framework has served Serbia well and should prove effective in
locking in a new regime of lower and more stable inflation. As also confirmed by the FSAP
assessment, the financial sector has weathered the financial crisis spillovers well, but
continues to face challenges. In particular, adverse spillovers from problems at key foreign
parent banks represent a tangible short-term risk that requires careful monitoring.

5
I. BACKGROUND
A. Pre-Crisis Macro Diagnostics
1.
Before the global financial crisis hit in late-2008, Serbia enjoyed fast-paced GDP
growth. Starting from a low base, GDP growth during 2004-08 accelerated to 6¼ percent,
reflected in rapid convergence to EU income levels.

2.
But Serbia’s growth acceleration was accompanied by four troubling symptoms
(Figure 1):


Lagging tradable sector growth: Growth was strongly tilted toward nontradables, in
particular transport and communications, retail trade, and financial services (Table 4).



Low domestic savings: With domestic savings close to nil, the economy’s investment
level was effectively constrained by remittances from abroad—which were trending
downward—and the availability of foreign savings (Table 5).



Extensive foreign-exchange (FX) lending: High loan euroization, even if direct
cross-border FX loans to Serbian corporates are excluded, in an economy dominated
by nontradable producers led to the buildup of large unhedged FX positions.



High inflation: Average inflation during 2004-08 was the highest in the region.

3.
These symptoms were rooted in four unfavorable fundamentals of Serbia's
economy (Figure 2). First, the economy's supply side was hampered by slow and inconsistent
efforts at privatization, reflected in a relatively small private sector, and a difficult business
climate, particularly for export-oriented firms that need to operate in the formal sector.

6
Second, the large government sector invested little in the country's future, as indicated by
high untargeted spending on social transfers and a high public wage bill relative to public
investment. Third, notwithstanding high unemployment, public-sector-led wage settlements
often far exceeded targeted inflation and labor productivity growth, undermining the
economy’s cost competitiveness. And fourth, reflecting the severe monetary instabilities of
the 1990s, inflation expectations remained stubbornly high relative to actual inflation.
4.
A policy response sufficient to rebalance the economy did not emerge. The
authorities undertook efforts, until 2006 under the aegis of IMF-supported programs, to foster
more balanced growth: some public investment programs were launched to address
infrastructure gaps, but implementation was slow; inflation targeting was adopted to better
anchor inflation, but inflation expectations remained stubbornly above actual inflation; and
prudential and supervisory rules were tightened to increase capital and liquidity buffers in the
banking system, but foreign banks used direct cross-border loans to circumvent these rules.
In a setting of volatile politics, the authorities’ responses remained too fragmented to ensure
a more sustainable growth acceleration.
B. Financial Crisis Spillovers and Policy Responses
5.
By 2008, a massive absorption gap had opened up, with excess domestic
spending mainly reflected in a ballooning external imbalance. Absorption (domestic
demand) growth before the crisis far outpaced the rate consistent with internal and external
balance, reflected mainly in a
surge of imports and a
widening external imbalance.
However, a tide of capital
inflows, intermediated by the
largely foreign-owned
banking system, smoothly
financed the rapidly
widening current account
gap.
6.
In late-2008, the global financial crisis rapidly spilled over to Serbia through
both finance and trade channels (Figure 3). Country risk indicators soared, capital inflows
stopped suddenly, households withdrew a sizeable share of their deposits, and both exports
and imports plunged.
7.
Faced with a large projected external financing gap, the authorities adopted a
three-pronged approach, embedded in an IMF-supported SBA:


Fiscal adjustment to facilitate external rebalancing, buttress market and public
confidence, observe tight financing constraints, and restore fiscal sustainability.

7


Private sector involvement as part of an innovative Financial Sector Support Program
(FSSP), including assurances from foreign parent banks to at least maintain their
external exposures to Serbia, while keeping their subsidiaries capitalized and liquid.



External financing from IFIs and the EU to close the remaining gap.

8.
Fiscal adjustment in 2009 was in line with plans (Table 6). The economy’s
abrupt downturn unmasked a
weak underlying fiscal
position—the structural fiscal
deficit in 2008 is estimated at
4½ percent of GDP. The
revenue-GDP ratio dropped
sharply in line with the
contracting absorption gap,
while spending was restrained
through nominal freezes of
public wages and pensions but
also cuts in capital spending.
9.
Foreign parent banks kept their exposure commitments. Their end-2008
external exposure is estimated at 8.7 billion euros (25 percent of GDP), mostly consisting of
direct cross-border loans to Serbian corporations. Overall, the foreign parent banks honored
their commitments, but, facing
a lack of “bankable clients,”
many banks shifted part of
their exposure to short-term
instruments (T-bills, NBS
repos), and some banks put
excess liquidity into FX float
accounts with their parents
(0.6 billion euros).
10.
The three-pronged SBA approach mitigated the fallout from the global
financial crisis on output and helped rebalance the economy, but job losses were severe
and corporate payment problems soared. The 2009 output slump was limited relative to
regional comparators, in part reflecting mattress money smoothing private consumption and
government efforts to support bank lending through interest subsidies and loan guarantees.
At the same time, the decline in domestic demand was large, particularly in investment, and
reflected in rapid external adjustment. Unemployment—already high before the downturn—
surged to about 17½ percent, and employment, particularly in the manufacturing and
construction sectors, contracted sharply (Table 3). Corporate payment problems became
endemic, as also reflected in rising non-performing loans (NPLs) (Table 7).
11.
The dinar exchange rate has depreciated markedly since the onset of the crisis
(Figure 4). After an initial sharp drop, the dinar-euro exchange rate remained stable without

8
FX interventions throughout most of 2009. However, in December 2009, depreciation
pressures re-emerged, in part reflecting seasonal pressures in a shallow FX market. In line
with its stated FX intervention strategy, the NBS intervened to smooth exchange rate
volatility, but also allowed some further nominal depreciation.
12.
Balance-of-payments developments in 2009 were much more favorable than
expected (Tables 8-10). Not only did
external financing requirements turn out
to be lower than had been anticipated, but
capital inflows were also substantially
higher. As a result, FX reserve
accumulation was significantly higher
than targeted, while SBA disbursements
were rephased given less pressing
external financing pressures.
13.
Progress on structural reforms was limited. Serbia has continued to trail bestperforming transition peers across most key business climate scores (Table 11). Moreover,
reflecting adverse market conditions, the privatization agenda has stalled since the onset of
the crisis. The structural benchmark on large state enterprises’ business plans was partially
met, but the original deadlines for the benchmarks related to pension, fiscal responsibility,
and debt restructuring legislation will need to be extended, owing in part to additional time
needed to build political consensus but also to the complexity of the planned reforms (Table
2, LOI ¶1).
14.
Serbia has taken several landmark steps toward closer integration with the
EU. With internal political opposition to EU integration waning, in late-2009, visa
liberalization for Serbian citizens took effect, the EU interim trade accord was unfrozen, and
Serbia submitted its EU membership application
C. Outlook
15.
The recovery from the crisis will likely be gradual, also reflected in hefty
medium- term output and absorption losses relative to pre-crisis trends (Table 12). The
program framework is based on 2
percent real GDP growth in 2010,
with a gradual return to robust
GDP growth only in 2012-13.
Absorption is expected to remain
flat in 2010, reflecting the
combined impacts of declining real
incomes and employment, drawnout corporate deleveraging, and
tight credit conditions. Maintaining
external stability requires that
medium-term absorption growth,
especially consumption, remains

9
subdued (Box 1). This growth scenario is predicated on strong fiscal adjustment efforts and
structural reforms underpinning a more sustainable growth model, with the tradable sectors
emerging as a viable growth engine. Nevertheless, in line with sluggish projected demand in
main trading partners, export growth is projected to regain strength only in 2011.
Box 1. External Stability Risks
The sharp external adjustment has considerably reduced immediate external stability
risks, but external debt and balance sheet euroization remain uncomfortably high, and
growth will need to become more balanced to avoid a resurgence of external stability
risks.
Exchange rate risks: Serbia’s real effective exchange rate now seems fairly valued,
based both on the macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches,
which indicated undervaluation of 2½ percent and ¾ percent, respectively. The two
approaches point to a current account deficit norm of about 6 percent of GDP,
compared with underlying current account deficits of also around 6 percent of GDP
during 2009-15. However, this scenario assumes a shift to balanced growth over the
medium term, a significant departure from Serbia’s absorption-driven pre-crisis growth
model. In the alternative scenario with the economy resuming absorption-led growth,
the underlying current account deficit could rise to about 16 percent of GDP, well
above the current account deficit norm, resulting in an estimated exchange rate
overvaluation of about 17 percent.
External balance sheet risks: In the program scenario, external debt would decline
substantially (Appendix I), but the negative international investment position would
remain elevated and stabilize at about 100 percent of GDP (Table 12); in the alternative
scenario, by contrast, external debt would remain high over the medium term against
the backdrop of an overvalued exchange rate, reflected in unsustainable external
balance sheet dynamics. Although short-term external debt remains covered by net free
FX reserves in the program scenario, high balance sheet euroization means that risks
remain significant.
Export competitiveness: Before the crisis, goods exports were growing rapidly, but
starting from a low base (15 percent of GDP). While Serbia’s euro wage levels relative
to labor productivity seem in line with most transition peers, they significantly exceed
those of key regional competitors, including Bulgaria and Slovakia.
16.
Disinflation is expected to continue, with inflation stabilizing around 4 percent,
supported by prudent monetary and fiscal policies. Headline inflation will likely
undershoot point targets throughout the first half of 2010, but end the year close to the target
of 6 percent (±2 percent). Inflation expectations have begun to moderate, but still have not
responded fully to lower actual inflation. A credible inflation targeting framework, supported

10
by restrained nominal wage growth and a tight fiscal stance, will be key for locking in recent
disinflation gains.
17.
To underscore the risks of a return to the pre-crisis growth paradigm, the
mission presented an alternative absorption-led growth scenario, which would lead to
the re-emergence of high external stability risks (Table 13). While the alternative scenario
features a similar growth acceleration as the program scenario, the pre-crisis symptoms of
unbalanced growth would re-emerge: lagging tradable sector growth; low domestic savings;
extensive FX lending; and a high inflation rate, mainly driven by high nominal wage growth.
As a consequence, external imbalances would again balloon, resulting in high external
stability risks. At the same time, as in the pre-crisis period, the headline fiscal position would
be flattered by a rising tax-GDP ratio, owing to a widening external gap, while the structural
fiscal deficit would remain elevated.
18.
While risks to the short-term outlook may appear broadly balanced, potential
spillover risks from Greece, while considered a small-probability event, were on
everybody’s mind. A stronger global economic recovery, especially in the EU, would
further improve prospects for a pickup in external demand and private capital inflows. On the
downside, a delayed global recovery could result in weaker-than-projected output and
renewed exchange rate pressures. At the same time, contagion events in Eastern and
Southern Europe, possibly related to adverse spillovers from escalating problems in Greece
cannot be excluded. Serbia’s direct trade links with Greece are small, with only about
2 percent of exports going to Greece. But, with Greek bank subsidiaries accounting for about
15 percent of Serbia’s banking assets, problems originating from Greek parent banks could
have more serious repercussions.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The program scenario is anchored by a medium-term general government
deficit of 1 percent of GDP. This anchor assures fiscal sustainability, even if fiscal risks
related to government
loan guarantees or
restitution claims
materialize (Appendix
II). Moreover, the
medium-term deficit
target, combined with
stepped up public
investment, provides
room for increased
public savings (Table 6).

11
20.
The authorities are committed to a fiscal adjustment strategy supporting more
balanced growth (LOI ¶9-10). Given the currently high structural fiscal deficit and projected
further declines in the revenue-GDP ratio as the economy rebalances over the medium term,
further fiscal adjustment efforts are needed. Moreover, the authorities plan to keep the main
tax parameters broadly unchanged, while addressing infrastructure bottlenecks that require
significant increases in public investment. Given these constraints and priorities, there was
agreement that the main burden of medium-term fiscal adjustment will have to fall on public
wages and pensions:


Restrained wage increases and reforms of the public administration, health, and
education sectors are expected to reduce the public wage bill to about 8 percent of
GDP by 2015 (from 10¼ percent in 2009).



Parallel efforts to contain pension increases and implement parametric pension
reforms should allow for a reduction in net pension spending to about 10 percent of
GDP by 2015 (from 13¼ percent of GDP in 2009).

21.
Designing a fiscally affordable, economically efficient, and socially acceptable
pension system has been a longstanding policy conundrum. Serbia’s population is aging
rapidly, social expectations for what amounts to a fair pension are high, the pension
contribution base, i.e. formal employment, is low, and pensioners have a strong political
voice. Moreover, Serbia’s statutory pension indexation mechanism is prone to produce
unstable pension replacement rates over time (Box 2). The government has agreed on a
package of parametric pension reforms that should help reduce medium-term pension costs,
while raising the employment rate (LOI ¶14). In staff’s view, additional rounds of parametric
reforms will have to be considered, especially in view of the likely adverse demographic and
migration trends over the next few years. At the same time, setting up a funded second-pillar
pension system to relieve pressures on the first pillar is widely viewed as incompatible with
fiscal sustainability considerations.
While the authorities’ fiscal adjustment strategy is commendable in view of shared
medium-term diagnostics, there are high implementation risks:


Achieving an orderly exit from nominal wage and pension freezes: While the 2010
budget is in line with the adjustment strategy (LOI ¶11), the authorities noted rising
pressures against the agreed nominal freezes of public wages and pensions, but
nonetheless pledged to maintain this freeze for the time being (LOI ¶13-15). Some of
the authorities stressed the need to design early a realistic exit strategy that balances
macro stability, budgetary consolidation, and political economy considerations. Staff
noted that the nominal freezes were a stopgap measure that would need to be replaced
by structurally sounder reforms.



Political fragmentation paired with weak institutional fiscal restraints: With the 2012
elections approaching, it will become more difficult to maintain spending discipline.
To address this risk, the authorities are committed to drafting fiscal responsibility

12
legislation that could include binding ceilings on public wages and pensions during
2010-12 (LOI ¶15).


Weaknesses in administrative capacity: The authorities stressed the need to
improve the Ministry of Finance’s administrative capacity, also a condition for
additional EU budget support (LOI ¶26).
Box 2. Serbia’s Unstable Pension Indexation Mechanism
In 2005, to lower an unaffordably high average pension replacement rate, Serbia indexed
the pension rights of new pensioners as well as pensions in payment to the CPI. With
wages growing rapidly, by 2007, Serbia’s unorthodox across-the-board CPI indexation
mechanism had caused a sharp, and politically unsustainable, drop in the average
pension replacement rate.
As a result of two
exceptional across-theboard hikes in pensions
during 2008, partly
reflected the emergence of
a politically powerful
pensioner party, the
average pension
replacement rate surged
back close to its 2003
level.
Starting in 2009, pensions (and public wages) were frozen at their end-2009 level, and
are scheduled to remain frozen through April 2011. The present agreement is that
pensions after April 2011 would be re-linked to the CPI but augmented with a growth
bonus if the previous year’s GDP growth rate exceeds 4 percent. As an alternative,
which could be politically more palatable as a burden sharing arrangement between
public wage earners and pensioners, the government suggested during the review
discussions to consider indexing—for an 18-month period starting in April 2011—
pensions to public wages, and then to switch to CPI indexation. However, this
alternative indexation option raises several technical issues regarding measuring public
wages, and it is also fraught with fiscal risks if public wage growth cannot be contained.
Whatever the exact indexation arrangements over the next few years, there is agreement
that, over the medium term, pension replacement rates will have to be lowered
sufficiently to bring net pension spending to about 10 percent of GDP. However, to
ensure more stable pension replacement rates beyond 2015, a reform of Serbia’s acrossthe-board CPI indexation mechanism will likely be unavoidable.

13
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
With disinflation on track, the NBS’s gradual monetary easing remains
appropriate. Given a significant output gap, public nominal wage and pension freezes, and a
still high domestic real interest rate, it should be possible to lock in recent disinflation gains.
Nevertheless, inflation expectations have yet to respond fully to recent disinflation, and there
are both upside (higher energy prices, more exchange rate depreciation) and downside (more
protracted recovery) risks to inflation. Going forward, some policy easing is expected from
the announced gradual lowering of the high effective rate of reserve requirements (LOI ¶18).
There was agreement that the high reserve requirements served as a valuable liquidity buffer
during the crisis. At the same time, the NBS has also announced a plan to streamline the
overly complex and distortionary reserve requirement regime (Box 3).
Box 3. The Case for Reforming Reserve Requirements
Prior to the announced reforms, Serbia’s reserve requirement (RR) system was highly
complex: First, it had three statutory rates on FX liabilities (45 percent on borrowing and
deposits; 40 percent on household deposits; and 20 percent on subordinated debt); and two
rates on dinar liabilities (a 10 percent general rate, and a 5 percent rate on longer-term
deposits). Second, there were numerous deductions from the RR base, including for
guaranteed mortgages, FX borrowing from abroad since October 2008, and loans under a
government subsidy program. And third, banks had discretion to decide to which FX
liability category the available deductions would be applied.
This complex RR system heavily distorted banks’ decision making. In particular, it
diverted banks’ resources to targeting bank balance sheets that minimized their effective
RR rates. For example, while the average statutory RR rate for FX liabilities in December
2009 was about 40 percent, the average effective RR was only about 29 percent. Moreover,
the effective RR had declined significantly since the onset of the crisis as banks took
increasingly advantage of deductions, and there was a wide dispersion of effective RRs
across banks.

14
C. Financial Sector Policies
23.
The recent FSAP Update noted that the banking sector has weathered the
crisis spillovers well, but still faces a number of challenges (Table 16). The authorities
have already addressed some of these recommendations, including reducing the number of
weekly repo auctions and reforming reserve requirements.
24.
Serbia’s level of euroization is high, even by regional standards, and to the
extent that FX exposures are unhedged, imposes significant financial stability risks.
Moreover, the impact of changes in the monetary policy rate on the economy will remain
limited under the present euro dominance, while fear of floating because of unhedged
household and firm balance sheets constrains the shock absorption capacity of the nominal
exchange rate.
25.
The macroeconomic outlook provides a rare window of opportunity to launch
a coordinated strategy to gradually lower unhedged FX risks and euroization. There are
deep-rooted historical reasons why the public favors the euro over the dinar (Box 4).
However, the fallout from the crisis has re-alerted foreign banks, their home supervisors, the
Serbian authorities, and the public to the risks of FX lending. At the same time, the
macroeconomic outlook envisages a break with the past: lower and more stable inflation;
lower external imbalances and remittances; and higher domestic savings. If this scenario
materializes, it could chip away at the public’s lack of trust in the dinar. In the meantime,
shifting the composition of government debt toward the local currency will be key to signal
the government’s commitment to low inflation and to start building a benchmark yield curve
that allows pricing of dinar financial instruments (LOI ¶20). A coordinated strategy
exploiting this window of opportunity would need to consist of two elements:

Short-term containment of risks from new FX lending to unhedged borrowers:
Prudential and supervisory measures should continue to be used to discourage banks from
extending new unhedged FX loans, including direct cross-border FX loans to unhedged
borrowers in the nontradable sectors. This domestic response could be complemented by
home supervisors leaning on their parent banks to avoid risky lending practices, including
lending in Swiss francs.

Medium-term development of savings vehicles in local currency: Building on the
growing T-bills market, domestic market development measures, including corporate bond
issuance, could jumpstart a market for local currency saving instruments.

The roots of high euroization and unhedged FX risks reach back to the early years of
the breakup of Yugoslavia. They include: (i) a long history of high and volatile
inflation; (ii) past policy choices that have excessively favored the euro, including
repaying frozen FX deposits but not dinar deposits; (iii) lack of trust in the fiscal
authorities’ commitment to low inflation given often sharp reversals on earlier
promises of fiscal rectitude; (iv) a dearth of FX hedging solutions; and (v)
underdeveloped local currency markets.

26.
Notwithstanding the
crisis spillovers, the banking
system remains well capitalized.
The NBS has recently completed
diagnostic studies and stress tests
for all 31 banks. The results show
that even under the most severe,
and by now quite unrealistic
scenario for 2009-10, substantial
increases in NPLs would not have
resulted in significant
undercapitalization.
27.
Nevertheless, with Greek bank subsidiaries accounting for a significant share
of the banking system, the authorities are prepared for adverse spillover scenarios. The
four Greek subsidiaries operating in Serbia account for about 15 percent of banking assets,
but their parent banks were also engaged in extensive direct cross-border lending to Serbian
corporates. Based on the recent stress tests, all Greek subsidiaries appear to be well
capitalized and highly liquid, and should therefore be able to absorb even large shocks. At
the same time, the authorities have significantly strengthened their crisis management
framework, which already underwent a severe test in late-2008. The authorities believe that
they have the necessary crisis tools to deal with different adverse scenarios, including a
deposit run or the bankruptcy of a parent bank. They are also awaiting a decision by the
Austrian authorities of how they plan to restructure the recently nationalized Hypo Alpe
Adria Group, which has a significant presence in Serbia.
28.
The authorities are strengthening the debt collection and restructuring
framework. Serbia’s collateral enforcement and bankruptcy procedures are costly,
unpredictable, and lengthy. Blocking a delinquent debtor’s accounts is the preferred
mechanism of debt collection. However, with corporate debt distress rising sharply, this
preference has led to a rush to block corporate accounts, sometimes shutting down viable
companies. Voluntary debt restructuring is still at an early and experimental stage. Thus,
reforms have focused on the following: First, the blocked account mechanism should be
made more transparent to mitigate the rush-to-block incentives. Second, the new bankruptcy
law that took effect in early 2010 should accelerate proceedings and allow for prepackaged

16
plans that would help expedite debt restructuring and reduce the burden on courts and
insolvency administrators. Third, the authorities are developing an out-of-court corporate
loan workout mechanism as a quicker and lower-cost option (LOI ¶22).
29.
A review meeting of the Bank Coordination Initiative agreed on gradually
phasing out banks’ exposure commitments. It was agreed to lower the exposure limit from
100 percent to 80 percent of the end-2008 level, effective April. This relaxation reflects
subsiding external financing pressures and sets the stage for a gradual exit from the exposure
commitments. It will also allow banks to rebalance their portfolios in line with their strategic
priorities. While some banks are expected to deleverage and undo positions accumulated in
government securities and FX deposits with their parents, others are expected to continue
expanding their operations in Serbia.
D. Structural Policies
30.
Structural reforms will have to provide the main underpinnings for the
envisaged shift to a new growth model. First, cross-country evidence suggests that a larger
private sector is instrumental for increasing a country’s capacity to produce, save, and export,
while also creating a virtuous circle where privatization creates a stronger constituency for
more structural reforms (Figure 5). The authorities are committed to increase the role of the
private sector in the economy (LOI ¶25). Second, strengthening exports will require a much
better business climate, as illustrated by the experience of successful peers in the region (Box
5). In this regard, the authorities plan to implement several specific measures in 2010 ((LOI
¶24). Third, in line with the authorities’ fiscal strategy, the public sector envisages a
significant reduction in the amount of resources devoted to consumption and non-targeted
social transfers, while raising public investment to address urgent infrastructure bottlenecks.
And fourth, expanding exports will require increased trade through closer integration with
the EU, but likely also with some of Serbia’s former Yugoslavia trading partners. In this
context, Serbia is close to concluding its negotiations for WTO membership.
III. PROGRAM ISSUES
31.
Program modalities. The Fund arrangement remains adequate to meet Serbia’s
balance of payment needs through end-2010, alongside financing commitments from the EU
and the World Bank. While projected external financing needs for 2010 are somewhat lower
than originally envisaged, the fragility of the stabilization process warrants continued
precautionary FX reserve accumulation. In fact, free FX reserves are significantly lower than
gross FX reserves as well as the high level of short-term external debt. The authorities intend
to draw the amount available at the completion of the review (SDR 319.6 million).
32.
Capacity to repay and safeguards assessment: Serbia’s capacity to repay the
Fund is expected to remain adequate (Table 17). The NBS has further strengthened their
financial safeguards, including by appointing an external auditor for a multi-year term.
33.
New structural conditionality under the program. To limit risks for revenue
collections, especially with respect to VAT and social security contributions, new structural

17
conditionality was agreed to strengthen tax administration. Specifically, the tax
administration agency’s newly-established risk management unit will develop and establish
an integrated taxpayer compliance strategy that will enable the agency to better allocate its
resources toward improving taxpayer compliance (structural benchmark, July 2010).
Box 5. What Can Serbia Learn from Slovakia’s Growth Model?
Among Serbia’s Eastern European peers, Slovakia offers an example of a sustained
growth acceleration, which catapulted Slovakia’s per capita income significantly above
Serbia’s, notwithstanding a lower starting level in the early-1990s.

Slovakia’s growth model differs from Serbia’s along several dimensions: (i) Slovakia
relied heavily on tradable sector growth, mostly by attracting FDI inflows to export
sectors; (ii) it generated high domestic savings, allowing investment rates to consistently
exceed 30 percent of GDP without accumulating persistent external imbalances; (iii) the
share of FX lending was low; and (iv) inflation was low and stable.
Slovakia’s growth model was underpinned by the following key reforms:


Privatization was accorded high priority, including via the sale of stakes in the
telecommunications, gas, and power companies. The private sector share in the
economy is now about 80 percent, compared with 60 percent in Serbia.



The business climate was revamped, including the bankruptcy law, corporate
governance, and favorable conditions for FDI. For example, Slovakia ranks 42nd in
the World Bank “Doing Business” indicators, compared to 88th for Serbia.



The structure of public spending was managed to free room for public investment.
For example, the ratio of spending on public wages and social transfers to public
investment averaged 3½ in Slovakia during 1995-2002, compared to about 7½ in
Serbia during 2005-08.

18
IV. FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW
34.
Progress has been made toward settling remaining official external debt
issues—including external arrears. Regarding the renegotiation of restructuring
agreements with Paris Club members following the breakup of the Union of Serbia and
Montenegro in 2006, the authorities estimate that in excess of 80 percent of the outstanding
Paris Club debt has been reconciled. Agreement has been reached with non-participants in
the London Club settlement and with other official non-Paris Club creditors. Remaining
official external arrears mostly relate to debts of the former Yugoslavia.
35.
Expected disbursements from IFIs and other multilateral institutions—such as
the World Bank and the EU—to support structural reforms provide assurances that the
program is fully financed in 2010.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
During the years preceding the global financial crisis, Serbia enjoyed fast-paced
GDP growth, but at the cost of growing external and financial stability risks. On the
economy’s supply side, with structural reforms proceeding slowly and foreign banks
providing FX loans freely to unhedged corporates, growth was mostly driven by the
production of nontradables. On the economy’s demand side, sustained high private and
public consumption growth left little room for investing in the economy’s supply capacity.
As a consequence, Serbia’s relatively moderate investment-GDP ratios could only be
financed by running large current account deficits. On the eve of the global financial crisis,
the economy was seriously unbalanced on the external side, while the private sector’s
unhedged FX exposures signaled high financial stability risks.
37.
The authorities’ policy responses to the spillovers from the global financial crisis
have been appropriate, limiting the fallout of the global crisis on Serbia. The policy
package focused on fiscal tightening, maintaining the managed float to support external
adjustment, while enhancing financial crisis preparedness. At the same time, the authorities
obtained assurances from foreign parent banks under the Bank Coordination Initiative to
maintain their exposures vis-à-vis Serbia and keep their subsidiaries well capitalized, while
the IFIs provided substantial external financing.
38.
As the economy recovers, policies should shift the economy toward a more
sustainable growth paradigm. To achieve more balanced growth, Serbia will also have to
upgrade its deteriorated domestic infrastructure and catch up with other transition economy
peers on key structural reforms that promote private sector development and an improved
business climate. Tight fiscal policies based on current spending restraint should ensure fiscal
sustainability and higher public savings, while measures to reduce euroization and unhedged
FX lending should help reduce financial stability risks. More balanced growth will also require
higher private savings to reduce the dependence on foreign savings. However, with many countries
in the region urged or poised to strengthen exports, Serbia may face stiff competition in its
export markets.

19
39.
Reducing the public sector’s high claim on economic resources through fiscal
consolidation will be key to boost domestic savings and private investments into
tradable sectors. Bringing spending to more sustainable levels while keeping the tax burden
unchanged will require continued restraints on both pensions and public wages. This should
free up resources for essential public infrastructure investment, with well-targeted social spending
being protected. But maintaining nominal public wage and pension freezes through April 2011

could be a challenging, and developing a fiscally sound and politically credible exit strategy
from the nominal freezes should be a priority of the next review.
40.
With the disinflationary trend persisting, the gradual monetary easing pursued
by the NBS is appropriate. The planned streamlining and gradual lowering of reserve
requirements are welcome in this regard. But the NBS will have to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully to detect early any shift in the balance of risks. Planned
efforts to curtail the high level of euroization could also help to strengthen the scope for more
effective monetary policies.
41.
The Financial Sector Support Program has helped the banking system to
safely steer through the global financial storm, and systemic risks have largely abated.
But risks of regional spillovers, cannot be ruled out, as Greek parent banks of Serbian
subsidiaries in particular could face funding pressures in their domestic markets or may have
to undergo restructuring. Still rising corporate debt repayment problems are a key concern,
calling for improvements in the framework for debt collection and restructuring, including
putting in place a framework for voluntary loan workouts.
42.
Decisive progress on structural reform implementation is needed to tap Serbia’s
growth potential. Public enterprise restructuring and privatization efforts have stalled during
the economic downturn. But the authorities are committed to relaunch their privatization and
corporatization agenda once market conditions permit. Recent progress in the authorities’
regulatory guillotine project to streamline business laws and regulations is encouraging.
43.
On the basis of Serbia’s good performance under the SBA, staff supports the
authorities’ request for completing the third review and the financing assurances
review. Staff also recommends establishing quantitative conditionality for end-June 2010, as
specified in the Letter of Intent (LOI Table 1).

1/ Numbers are on a gross basis; credit numbers include provisions.
2/ As of December 2009, about 16 percent of off-balance sheet items represented various guarantees, mostly on
cross-border loans. Other off-balance sheet items include collateral against loans and repo contracts, undrawn
credit lines, and derivative contracts. Figures in euros and in percent of GDP correspond to the latest available
observation.

Appendix I. Serbia: External Debt Sustainability
Improved prospects for GDP growth and a faster narrowing of the current account deficit
led to some improvement of the external debt dynamics compared to the previous analysis.
On current baseline projections, total external debt is expected to peak in 2010 (at 80
percent of GDP).On the assumption that growth will gradually accelerate and the current
account deficit will stabilize in nominal terms, debt ratios would start to decline in 2011 and
return to the level of 2008 (64 percent of GDP) in 2015. Standard tests yield similar results,
except for the exchange rate shock, which raises the external debt-to-GDP ratio sharply.
Moreover, under the alternative scenario, the debt dynamics are, of course, much less
favorable, pointing to substantial risks.
1.
Serbia’s external debt has been rising since 2004, resulting in increased
vulnerabilities. Following persistently large external imbalances—and despite rescheduling
operations and early repayments to some multilateral creditors, including the Fund—external
debt reached 21.8 billion euros in December 2008. The rise was due to private debt, which
tripled since early 2006. In particular,
nonbank private debt rose sharply, as
prudential regulation on bank activity
became tighter and companies
switched to direct foreign borrowing,
often with domestic commercial banks
acting as intermediaries. This trend
was interrupted toward the end of
2008, when private sector debt started.
to decline. Nevertheless, external debt
remained high at about 23.4 billion
euros at end-2009 (Tables A1, A2).
2.
Better prospects for GDP growth and faster adjustment of the current account
balance have led to some improvement of the external debt dynamics compared to the
previous analysis. In particular, the debt-to-GDP ratio (including prospective liabilities to
the Fund) is expected to peak in 2010 at about 80 percent of GDP percent before returning to
a declining path.
3.
With global and domestic conditions beginning to improve gradually in 2010,
external debt ratios are expected to start declining already in 2011 under the baseline
scenario. GDP growth is expected to recover gradually, the current account to stabilize in
nominal terms, and FDI inflows to resume. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
decline to about 64 percent of GDP in 2015.

4.
Standard stress tests point to some risks. With a real depreciation of 30 percent, the
external debt-to-GDP ratio would initially rise to 116 percent, but decline thereafter. Under
the other standard shocks, external debt would rise to close to 80 percent of GDP before
returning to a declining path. However, such dynamics crucially depend on the assumptions
of gradually rising growth and current account adjustment in the medium term.
5.
However, the alternative scenario, based on absorption-led growth, would entail
significantly higher risks for debt sustainability. Under this scenario, the external debt-toGDP ratio would initially stabilize but would then begin to rise, reaching 83 percent of GDP
in 2015. Moreover, underlying vulnerabilities are masked by the progressively more
overvalued exchange rate. This underscores the need for strong policy action, close
monitoring, and readiness to implement further measures, if needed, should the outcomes be
worse than projected.

Appendix II. Serbia: Public Debt Sustainability
1.
General government debt in Serbia remains sustainable. However, rollover risks
will rise as the stock of domestic-currency T-bills is expected to increase from 3 percent of
GDP in 2009 to about 11 percent during 2010-14. At the same time, the large FX share of
public debt implies significant vulnerability to a depreciation of the currency. Additional
fiscal risks derive from contingent liabilities associated to off-balance sheet transactions,
from quasi-fiscal losses of state- and socially owned enterprises, from government support to
the private sector, and the eventual payment of restitution debt.
2.
Gross general government debt increased to 36½ percent of GDP in 2009, from
32 percent of GDP in 2008, but is projected to decline to 30 percent of GDP in 2014
(Table A1).1 At the time of the last review (see country report EBS/09/201), it was projected
that the debt ratio in 2009 would reach 31½ percent of GDP in 2009. The significant upward
revision of the 2009 level reflects the following factors: (i) the accumulation of large deposits
at the central bank (1½ percent of GDP); (ii) more-than-projected exchange rate depreciation
(½ percent of GDP); (iii) the carry-over effects from a downward revision in historical GDP
data (½ percent of GDP); (iv) the inclusion of local government debt in the estimates (1
percent of GDP); and (v) the issuance of guaranteed debt by the public enterprises (1½
percent of GDP). This has been partly offset by a lower fiscal deficit (0.3 percent of GDP).
3.
However, in an unchanged policies scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase to 50 percent of GDP in 2014. This is mainly because this scenario ignores
the expected expenditure-based adjustment. By contrast, under the assumption that key
variables remain at their historical averages, the public debt-to GDP ratio would decline to
13 percent, reflecting very high growth during the absorption boom coupled with low real
interest rates.
4.
Standardized bound tests show that Serbia’s debt is particularly sensitive to
exchange rate shocks (Figure A1). Given that 90 percent of the debt is denominated in
foreign currency (comprising mainly frozen currency deposit bonds and debt to multilaterals
and Paris Club creditors); a 30 percent real depreciation of the dinar would put the debt-toGDP ratio at 45 percent in 2014. Imposing half a standard-deviation shocks to GDP growth
and the primary fiscal balance, increases the public debt stock to 34 percent of GDP in 2014.
However, a similar shock to interest rates would leave debt-to-GDP at 32 percent.

1

The debt stock includes gross general government and government-guaranteed debt of the Republic of Serbia,
including debt to non-Paris Club official creditors under negotiation and in non-convertible currencies. It
excludes any borrowing from the Fund by the NBS.

51
5.
Further risks to the debt outlook come from large contingent liabilities, in
particular those related to public enterprises. The main sources of risk are the following:


Public enterprises. Some state-owned and socially owned enterprises are running
large quasi-fiscal deficits, mainly because of overly high wages and pricing below
cost. With most public enterprise debt included in the general government debt stock
(since they carry government guarantees), and with enterprises receiving explicit or
implicit subsidies through lower taxes and utility tariffs to cover their operations,
their past and regular losses are implicitly covered. However, there are risks from
delays in utility price adjustments, large investment plans and needs, and provision of
new loan guarantees to nonviable enterprises.



Financial sector stability. Financial sector distress could lead to the need for public
sector support of the financial system.



Government support to the economy. The domestic credit support program
launched in February of 2009, and continued in 2010, could add up to 2 percent of
GDP to public debt. Risks derive from state-guaranteed IFI loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises (1½ percent of GDP), and loans granted through the
National Development Fund and commercial banks (½ percent of GDP).



Restitution. A plan formulated by the government in 2007 to provide compensation
for assets confiscated by the communist government after World War could increase
debt by up to about 16 percent of 2010 GDP. Moreover, the sensitivity of public debt
to the exchange rate would be adversely affected if the restitution bonds were to be
denominated in foreign currency.

Attachment I. Letter of Intent (LOI)
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
U.S.A.

Belgrade, March 18, 2010

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Our program has continued to perform well. All end-December 2009 quantitative
performance criteria were observed, most of them with a considerable margin, including the
ceiling on the general government deficit (Table 1). We have also made progress on our
structural reform agenda, including the highly sensitive reform of the pension system, the
design of new fiscal responsibility legislation, and the complex revision of the corporate debt
collection and restructuring framework. But most importantly, supported by the tailwinds of
a global recovery and the strong commitment of foreign banks to Serbia, the economy is on
the mend: output has started to recover following a precipitous decline through mid-2009;
capital inflows have recently surprised on the upside; and disinflation is on track, with
inflation expectations receding.
2.
While the program is on track, clearly not all is well in our economy. The global
financial crisis hit hard, and the need to correct the economy’s external and fiscal imbalances
now acts as a brake on the recovery. Corporate insolvencies and payment problems are still
on the rise. Job opportunities, particularly for low-paid workers, have become scarce,
reflected in increasing poverty. As a result, firms and households have cut back spending
sharply relative to their incomes. This is also reflected in moderate credit demand and the
sharp import contraction. Coming on the heels of an unsustainable private-sector boom,
lower spending has led to a welcome rebalancing of the external account; the 2009 current
account deficit was likely limited to only 5½ percent of GDP. But rapid private-sector
adjustment has also unmasked a weak underlying fiscal position; with nominal tax revenues
stagnant at their 2008 level, the fiscal deficit rose to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2009,
notwithstanding across-the-board nominal freezes of most current spending and cuts in
subsidies and capital spending.
3.
In consideration of our strong implementation record and our continued
commitment to the program’s objectives, we request the completion of the third review of the
SBA and the disbursement of SDR 319.6 million. The fourth program review, assessing
performance relative to end-March performance criteria and benchmarks, and financing
assurances review are envisaged for June 2010. The fifth program review assessing end-June
performance criteria and financing assurances review are envisaged for September 2010.

56
4.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in this memorandum are
adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, and stand ready to take any additional
measures that may be appropriate for this purpose. The Government of the Republic of
Serbia will consult with the IMF in advance on the adoption of such additional measures in
accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultations.
Revised Macroeconomic Framework for 2010-11
5.
We continue to expect a gradual recovery of economic activity, with real GDP
projected to grow at 2 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2011. Investment and exports are
expected to be the main engines of growth, while consumption is likely to lag. The moderate
pace of recovery, along with the rebalancing of the economy away from absorption-led
growth and the delays in matching unemployed workers with new jobs, will continue to put
strains on the fiscal position, mainly through subdued tax revenues.
6.
Inflation is expected to continue to decline, providing the National Bank of Serbia
(NBS) with a window of opportunity to lock in a new regime of lower and more stable
inflation rates. A sizeable output gap, decelerating nominal wage growth, and favorable food
price trends have substantially moderated inflationary pressures, which in turn has allowed a
substantial easing of the monetary policy stance. Inflation could undershoot the NBS’s target
band during the first half of 2010, but we expect it to end the year close to the target of
6 percent (±2 percent). In 2011, inflation is expected to decline further to around 4½ percent.
7.
External current account adjustment is expected to pause in 2010, with the
continued decline in the trade imbalance more than offset by projected higher external
income payments and lower remittances. Following a contraction in 2009, export volume
growth is expected to regain double-digit strength only in 2011. We are now projecting a
current account deficit of 8 percent of GDP in 2010, followed by a gradual improvement over
the medium term.
8.
The external financing situation is projected to remain favorable in 2010 and
beyond, but there are significant risks. Foreign parent banks are expected to broadly maintain
their exposure to Serbia, notwithstanding a relaxation of exposure floors under the Bank
Coordination Initiative. Other private inflows, along with financing from the IMF, other
international financial institutions, and the EU, should be more than sufficient to meet all
external financing needs in 2010. We expect a further increase in international reserves,
albeit at a more modest pace than in 2009. These projections are, however, subject to
downside risks, in part because some parent banks of local subsidiaries could face domestic
funding pressures or restructuring needs.

57
Fiscal Policy
9.
A decisive break with Serbia’s pre-crisis pattern of growth driven by production of
nontradables and high consumption to one led more by exports calls for improving external
competitiveness and raising investment. While other economic policies will have to make
their contribution as well, a paradigm shift in fiscal policy will be key to achieving this
transformation of the economy. We are committed to implementing the painful and difficult
measures in the public sector that are required.
10.
Our fiscal strategy will continue to be based on four main principles: (i) the
presently high structural fiscal deficits will be gradually reduced over the next few years; (ii)
the economy’s overall tax burden will be kept roughly unchanged; (iii) balanced and
coordinated spending restraints will continue to be imposed on public wages and pensions;
and (iv), the fiscal space freed up by spending restraints will be utilized to raise public
investment. To succeed with this fiscal strategy, we will also have to enforce financial
discipline in the still large public enterprise sector, especially by containing wage increases.
11.
Consistent with this fiscal strategy, we will contain the general government deficit
in 2010 to 4 percent of GDP, and plan to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2011. As
in 2008 and 2009, we will execute spending cautiously to stay within the agreed general
government spending envelope of about 1,340 billion dinars. Should the recovery in
economic activity turn out to be somewhat stronger than presently expected, we will save any
revenue overperformance during the first half of the year. The 2010 gross financing needs of
about 2 billion euros will be covered by loans from international financial institutions and the
EU, and, to a significant extent, through borrowing from the domestic T-bills market, where
we intend to increasingly tap longer maturities to reduce rollover risk and foster local
financial market development.
12.
As regards revenue policies, we plan to keep any further changes to the tax system
at least revenue neutral, while taking measures to strengthen tax administration. At this point,
we have submitted to parliament limited amendments to simplify and broaden corporate and
personal income taxes. To increase tax compliance, we will adopt an integrated taxpayer
compliance strategy by end-July (structural benchmark).
13.
We remain committed to reducing the wage bill of the general government to about
8 percent of GDP by 2015. To achieve this medium-term objective, we plan to implement the
following specific policies during 2010-12:


The level of wages of government employees will remain nominally frozen; the case
for any wage increases will only be reviewed during the second half of 2010, and
only provided revenue trends during the first half of 2010 are more favorable than
presently expected. We will also ensure a wage bill freeze at the level of local
government utilities, and we have approved 2010 business plans for ten large state

58
enterprises monitored under the program that are consistent with a nominal freeze of
their respective wage bills.


The announced cuts in public administration staff at central and local government
levels by about 10 percent will be implemented by April 2010, and a strict hiring
freeze across all levels of government, including for temporary workers,
implemented.



During 2011-12, public sector wage increases will be limited to what is consistent
with our medium-term objective of bringing the wage bill to 8 percent of GDP by
2015.



To rationalize public employment further, we will finalize reform plans in the health
care and education sectors, along the lines of recent World Bank recommendations,
with the objective of starting their implementation in the context of the 2011 budget.

14.
To ensure fair burden sharing between public sector employees and pensioners, we
also remain committed to reducing the net spending by pension funds to about 10 percent of
GDP by 2015. Our specific policies during 2010-12 are as follows:


In line with the agreements presented in the last Letter of Intent, we have agreed on a
comprehensive package of parametric pension reforms that will be submitted to
parliament by end-May (structural benchmark). These reforms include an increase in
the minimum retirement age for old-age pensions from 53 to 58 years for men and
women, longer effective contribution periods for women, a cut in service credits for
the military and police, and a tightening of survivor pension entitlements. To address
the hardship of the poorest pensioners, we will increase minimum and farmers’
pensions, while putting a tighter cap on maximum pensions.



In line with the freeze of public wages, nominal pensions will remain frozen until
April 2011.



We believe strongly that continued but also balanced restraints on both public
pensions and wages will be required during 2011-12. As an alternative to the CPI
indexation plus GDP growth premium rule, we have proposed during the third review
a link between pension and public wage growth during the 18-month period starting
in April 2011. We recognize that IMF support for any indexation rule linking
pensions and public wages will require assurances in May that public wage growth
and fiscal targets during 2010-12 will remain credibly anchored in line with the
agreed economic program, including through fiscal responsibility legislation. After
the indexation adjustment of April 2012, we will shift to a CPI indexation rule. The
new indexation arrangement will be consistent with bringing pension spending to
about 10 percent of GDP by 2015.

59
15.
We recognize that jointly anchoring public wage and pension growth during 201012 in line with these undertakings will be a difficult task. We will establish binding nominal
ceilings on the general government wage and pension bills for the period 2010-12 in the
framework of the planned fiscal responsibility legislation to be submitted to parliament by
end-May (structural benchmark).
16.
Finally, we will review the recently adopted public debt provisions relaxing
restraints on local government borrowing and guarantees to ensure that local governments do
not engage in fiscal activities that could ultimately require financial bailouts by the central
government.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
Monetary policy will remain focused on keeping inflation close to the preannounced 6 percent (±2 percent) target for 2010. The NBS expects to continue easing its
monetary stance, albeit cautiously given the risks associated with still high, though receding,
inflation expectations, the possibility of faster-than-expected recovery of aggregate demand,
further increases in energy prices, and the planned upward adjustments of regulated prices.
Under the program, inflation developments will continue to be monitored using a standard
consultation clause. In line with our inflation targeting framework, we will maintain the
existing managed float exchange rate regime.
18.
We plan to streamline and lower reserve requirements. The present reserve
requirement regime is overly complex, with a large number of exemptions and multiple
statutory rates. In response, many banks have targeted asset and liability structures to lower
their effective reserve requirement rates. Under the new regime, almost all exemptions will
be phased out, and there will be only two statutory rates, one for foreign exchange liabilities,
and a lower one for dinar liabilities. This reform seeks to achieve several goals: (i) enhance
transparency; (ii) promote more efficient operations of the banks; (iii) encourage deeuroization; and (iv) reclaim for the NBS the ability to use reserve requirements as an
effective policy tool. At the same time, the new effective rate will be lower than the current
one, complementing the monetary policy easing achieved through the lowering of the policy
interest rate. The new regime will be phased in gradually and should be fully in place by
March 2011. This much-needed reform is at the same time a complex policy change, and we
will have to continuously monitor monetary conditions to achieve our inflation targets and
prevent excessive volatility of the exchange rate.
19.
We will also continue to strengthen our inflation targeting framework. In December
2009, to improve the functioning of the money market, we reduced the number of repo
auctions from two to one per week; and we are assessing the case for further simplifying the
auction system. We have also taken steps to improve coordination between the government
and the NBS regarding plans for regulated price adjustments. To this effect, we have recently

60
set up a working group comprising technical experts from the NBS, Ministry of Finance, and
other relevant ministries and agencies.
Financial Sector Policies
20.
Serbia’s level of euroization is high, even by regional standards, and it constrains
the effectiveness of monetary policy while imposing financial stability risks. A precondition
for any successful de-euroization strategy will be to achieve a lower and more stable inflation
rate. Moreover, we will continue to use our prudential and supervisory framework to
discourage unhedged currency risks. In addition, we will focus on market-based measures
that would work through incentives, instead of coercive measures that could result in serious
market distortions and increased costs of doing business. Specifically, we plan to: (i)
introduce benchmark dinar securities, which may in part be issued by international financial
institutions; (ii) foster a secondary market for T-bills; and (iii) encourage the development of
hedging instruments.
21.
The Financial Sector Support Program (FSSP) has proved a vital and innovative
tool for safeguarding financial stability. As planned, we finished in December 2009 the
onsite diagnostic studies and stress tests for all 31 banks. This comprehensive exercise
confirmed that, following the recapitalization of one large domestic bank, our banking
system is liquid and well capitalized, even after the most extreme scenario employed in the
exercise. Given the easing of financial sector tensions since the peak of the crisis in early2009, we have also agreed with participants in the Bank Coordination Imitative during a
review meeting on February 26, 2010, to lower the exposure floor vis-à-vis Serbia of foreign
parent banks from 100 to 80 percent, effective April 2010. Furthermore, we have amended
our strict asset classification rules, and we are studying the scope for narrowing the
provisioning ranges. Our cooperation with foreign home supervisors has strengthened
appreciably, including through our participation in supervisory colleges, and we hope to
finalize bilateral memoranda of understandings with Austria, France, and Germany in due
course.
22.
We have made progress on the framework for debt collection and restructuring. In
December 2009, parliament approved the revised Bankruptcy Law. The new law stipulates
the automatic initiation of bankruptcy procedures for companies whose accounts have been
blocked for more than three years, and supports accelerated reorganizations using
prepackaged plans. To address excessive blockages of bank accounts on the basis of
promissory notes, the NBS has prepared draft amendments to the Law on Payment
Transactions, including registration of all promissory notes in a single database—to increase
transparency and reduce their excessive issuance—and modifications to the payout procedure
from blocked accounts—to alleviate the rush-to-block problem. In response to feedback from
market participants and government agencies, further changes are needed to facilitate the
recording of promissory notes and to retain the high efficiency of the present blockage

61
procedure. Drawing on technical assistance, we have also started to explore options to
introduce an out-of-court corporate loan workout framework.
23.
Looking ahead, we plan to further improve the corporate debt restructuring
framework. However, due to the legal complexities of this undertaking and resource
constraints, we have to extend the deadline for submitting new legislation to parliament to
end-September 2010 (structural benchmark). In this regard, we believe that blocked accounts
and out-of-court restructuring mechanisms should be addressed in a coordinated and
comprehensive manner, and incentives for restructuring should be tailored to facilitate
consensual outcomes between creditors and borrowers.
Structural Policies
24.

The following measures should help improve the business climate:



Cutting red tape: A regulatory reform council is reviewing an estimated 7,500 laws,
bylaws, and regulations, about 3,000 of which impact business. The ‘regulatory
guillotine’ project, scheduled to be completed by June 2010, is estimated to cut
Serbian companies’ costs by some 20 billion dinars annually.



Adopting new legislation: With technical assistance from the international financial
institutions, we will draft a new Company Law to strengthen corporate governance
and eliminate all unnecessary requirements for the establishment and operation of
entrepreneurs and companies.



Ensuring property rights: We will strive to resolve, in line with our scarce fiscal
resources, the still pending issues of land ownership and restitution of property seized
from citizens and institutions after World War II. With regard to the latter, we have
opted for compensation mainly in government bonds to avoid complications
connected to restitution in kind, which has been limited by the adoption of the Law on
Urban Development in 2009.



Fighting corruption: A new anti-corruption agency with new expanded powers and
responsibilities became operational as of January 1, 2010.

25.
The following measures should increase the role of the private sector in the
economy:


Privatization: 169 companies are slated for privatization in 2010; additional sales of
assets via forced liquidation and/or bankruptcy will be implemented in 201 existing
cases, and new bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated for 336 nonviable stateowned companies. We hope to privatize the pharmaceutical company Galenika
through a tender offer in 2010. We have recently agreed on the partial privatization of

62
Credy Bank. The new investor acquired more than half of the bank’s stock and the
government expects to divest its remaining shares within the next three years.


Corporatization: All large state enterprises will be corporatized by end-2010. In
several cases, this will be followed by either full or partial privatization, or the
creation of joint ventures and private management contracts.



Corporate restructuring: We have embarked on restructuring the airline company
JAT. The overhaul of the state-owned railway company will also be accelerated with
a view to reducing the need for large-scale subsidies over the medium term.

26.
Following several recent important steps toward closer integration with the EU, and
in line with the national plan for integration into the EU and the conditionality of EU budget
support, we are committed to maintain and develop crucial administrative capacity. In
particular, the Ministry of Finance will create conditions for the decentralized
implementation system necessary to access EU structural funds.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings regarding the definition of indicators
used to monitor developments under the program. To that effect, the authorities will provide
the necessary data to the European Department of the IMF as soon as they are available. As a
general principle, all indicators will be monitored on the basis of the methodologies and
classifications of monetary, financial, and fiscal data in place on October 1, 2008, except as
noted below.
A. Floor for Net Foreign Assets of the NBS
2.
Net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBS consist of foreign reserve assets minus foreign
reserve liabilities, measured at the end of the quarter.
3.
For purposes of the program, foreign reserve assets shall be defined as monetary
gold, holdings of SDRs, the reserve position in the IMF, and NBS holdings of foreign
exchange in convertible currencies. Any such assets shall only be included as foreign
reserve assets if they are under the effective control of, and readily available to, the NBS. In
particular, excluded from foreign reserve assets are: undivided assets of the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), long-term assets, NBS’ claims on resident banks
and nonbanks, as well as subsidiaries or branches of Serbian commercial banks located
abroad, any assets in nonconvertible currencies, encumbered reserve assets (e.g., pledged as
collateral for foreign loans or through forward contracts), and precious metals other than
monetary gold.
4.
For purposes of the program, all foreign currency-related assets will be evaluated in
Euros at program exchange rates as specified below. For the remainder of 2010, the
program exchange rates are those that prevailed on March 11, 2009. Monetary gold will be
valued at the average London fixing market price that prevailed on March 11, 2009.

66

5.
For purposes of the program, foreign reserve liabilities are defined as any foreigncurrency-denominated short-term loan or deposit (with a maturity of up to and including one
year); NBS liabilities to residents and nonresidents associated with swaps (including any
portion of the NBS gold that is collateralized) and forward contracts; IMF purchases; and
loans contracted by the NBS from international capital markets, banks or other financial
institutions located abroad, and foreign governments, irrespective of their maturity.
Undivided foreign exchange liabilities of the SFRY are excluded. Also excluded are the
amounts received under any SDR allocations received after August 20, 2009.
6.
On December 31, 2009 the NBS's net foreign assets, evaluated at program exchange
rates, were €6,597 million; foreign reserve assets amounted to €10,792 million, and foreign
reserve liabilities amounted to €4,196 million.
7.
Adjustors. For program purposes, the NFA target will be adjusted upward pari passu
to the extent that: (i) after December 31, 2009, the NBS has recovered frozen assets of the
FRY, assets of the SFRY, long-term assets, and foreign-exchange-denominated claims on
resident banks and nonbanks, as well as Serbian commercial banks abroad; and (ii) the
restructuring of the banking sector by the Deposit Insurance Agency involves a write-off of
NBS foreign exchange-denominated liabilities to resident banks. The NFA floor will also be
adjusted upward by any privatization revenue in foreign exchange received after December
31, 2009. Privatization receipts are defined in this context as the proceeds from sale or lease
of all or portions of entities and properties held by the public sector that are deposited in
foreign exchange at the NBS, either directly, or through the Treasury.
B. Inflation Consultation Mechanism
8.
Inflation is defined as the change over 12 months of the end-of-period consumer price
index (CPI), as measured and published by the Serbian Statistics Office.
9.
Breaching the inflation consultation band limits at the end of a quarter would trigger
discussions with IMF staff on the reasons for the deviation and the proposed policy
response. A deviation of more than 1 percentage point from either the upper or the lower
band specified in Table 1 would trigger a consultation with the IMF’s Executive Board on
the reasons for the deviation and the proposed policy response before further purchases
could be requested under the SBA.
C. Ceiling on External Debt Service Arrears
10. Definition. External debt-service arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising
in respect of obligations incurred directly or guaranteed by the public sector, except on debt
subject to rescheduling or restructuring. The program requires that no new external arrears
be accumulated at any time under the arrangement on public sector or public sector-

67

guaranteed debts. The authorities are committed to continuing negotiations with creditors to
settle all remaining official external debt-service arrears.
11. Reporting. The accounting of non-reschedulable external arrears by creditor (if any),
with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis, within two weeks of the
end of each month. Data on other arrears, which can be rescheduled, will be provided
separately.
D. Ceilings on External Debt
12. Definitions. The ceilings on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional
external debt by the public sector with original maturity of more than one year and short
term external debt (with maturities up to one year) applies not only to debt as defined in
point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted
on August 24, 2000 (Decision No. 12274-(00/85)) but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this performance criterion
are normal short-term import credits.
13. Excluded from the ceilings are loans from the IMF, EBRD, EIB, EU, IBRD, KfW,
CEB, Eurofima, IFC, and bilateral government creditors, as well as debt contracted in the
context of restructuring agreements. For the purpose of this performance criterion, the
public sector comprises the consolidated general government, the Export Credit and
Insurance Agency (AOFI), the Development Fund, and the Guarantee Fund.
14. For new debt to budgetary users, the day the debt is contracted will be the relevant
date for program purposes. For new debt to non-budgetary users, the day the first guarantee
is signed will be the relevant date. Contracting or guaranteeing of new debt will be
converted into Euros for program purposes at the program cross exchange rates described in
this TMU. Concessionality will be based on a currency-specific discount rate based on the
ten-year average of the OECD’s commercial interest reference rate (CIRR) for loans or
leases with maturities greater than 15 years and on the six-month average CIRR for loans
and leases maturing in less than 15 years. Under this definition of concessionality, only debt
with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the debt limit.
15. Reporting. A debt-by-debt accounting of all new concessional and nonconcessional
debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector, including the original debt
documentation, details on debt service obligations, as well as all relevant supporting
materials, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis, within four weeks of the end of each
quarter.

E. Fiscal Conditionality
16. The general government fiscal balance, on a cash basis, is defined as the difference
between total general government revenue (including grants) and total general government
expenditure (irrespective of the source of financing) as presented in the “GFS classification
table” and including expenditure financed from foreign project loans. For program purposes,
the consolidated general government comprises the Serbian Republican budget (on-budget
and own revenue), local governments, the pension fund (employees, self-employed, and
farmers), the health fund, the National Agency for Employment, and the Road Company
(JP Putevi Srbije) and any of its subsidiaries. Any new extrabudgetary fund or subsidiary
established over the duration of the program would be consolidated into the general
government. Revenues of the Republican budget exclude profit transfers from the NBS.
Expenditures exclude the clearance of arrears of the Road Company accumulated up to end2008.
17. Adjusters. The deficit ceiling will be adjusted upward for the additional expenditure
that may be needed for potential lender-of-last-resort operations under the financial stability
framework, following consultation with IMF staff. It will be increased (respectively
reduced) in 2010 by the amount of project loans disbursed by foreign creditors listed in
TMU ¶13 above to the general government in excess of (respectively, lower than) the
program projections indicated in the table below, in consultation with IMF staff, on the basis
of actual disbursements as jointly reported by the Ministry of Finance and the NBS. This
adjustment does not apply to program loans and general budget support.

18. Government current expenditure of the Republican budget (excluding
expenditure financed by own sources) includes wages, subsidies, goods and services,
interest payments, transfers to local governments and social security funds, social benefits
from the budget, other current expenditure, and net lending. It does not include capital
spending. The ceiling will be adjusted for the additional expenditure that may be needed for
potential lender-of-last-resort operations under the financial stability framework.
19. The large public enterprises monitored under the program include the following
10 enterprises or their successors: JP Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), JP Elektromreza Srbije

69

(EMS), JP Transnafta, JP Srbijagas, JP PTT Srbije, JP Jugoslovenski Aerotransport, JP
Zeleznice Srbije, JP Srbijasume, JP Aerodrom Nikola Tesla Beograd, JVP Srbijavode. This
list excludes JP Putevi Srbije (the Road Company), which is considered part of general
government, JP Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), which is in majority private ownership, and
JP Srbija Telekom, which competes with other telecommunication service providers. Going
forward, the program will include monitoring of the aggregate wage bill of local utilities.
20. Pension law. The new pension draft law should be submitted to Parliament by endMay 2010. This draft law should tighten early retirement rules, including by (i) gradually
increasing the minimum early retirement age from currently 53 years to 58 years for both
men and women by 2020, (ii) restricting retirement before the minimum early retirement
age to only a limited number of occupations; (iii) increasing the minimum service
requirement for retirement for women from 35 to 38 years and gradually phasing out more
than a half extra service credit for women; and (iv) raising the eligibility age for survivor’s
pensions to 58 years for men and to 53 for women. Further, the draft law will impose strict
limits on extra service credits to a limited number of eligible professions. Contribution
collection efficiency would also be strengthened, including by registering of all social
security payers in a single central registry. The draft law will also contain a revised pension
indexation rule, to take effect in April 2011. Any revised rule will be in line with the
medium-term objective of reducing net spending of pension funds to about 10 percent of
GDP by 2015. Two alternatives are under consideration. Under one, the current semi-annual
CPI-based indexation formula would be augmented to include a growth premium if the
previous year’s GDP growth rate exceeded a threshold of 4 percent. The growth premium
will be calculated as the difference between the actual growth rate in the previous year and
the 4 percent threshold. Under the second, pensions would be temporarily—during the 18month period starting in April 2011—linked to public wages. Thereafter, pensions would be
indexed to the CPI (end-May 2010).
21. Fiscal responsibility legislation. The present Budget System Law (BSL) will be
amended to further strengthen fiscal discipline. Amendments should be adopted by the
government and submitted to parliament that: (i) establish a simple and transparent rule that
strengthens control over the medium-term fiscal framework; (ii) strengthen fiscal procedures
of the current BSL; and (iii) establish effective fiscal monitoring and enforcement
mechanisms, potentially including by setting up an independent fiscal council. Further,
binding ceilings on pension and general government wage spending for 2010-12 should be
included in the fiscal responsibility framework (end-May 2010).
22. Tax administration reform. The risk management unit at the tax administration
agency should adopt a fully integrated taxpayer compliance strategy that is based on the
identification of the major risks to revenue and appropriate resource allocation to ensure the
highest impact on collections. The strategy should focus on improving voluntary compliance
and reducing noncompliance (end-July 2010).

70

23. Ceiling on the accumulation of domestic loan guarantees (gross) extended by the
Republican budget, the Guarantee Fund, and the Development Fund. The ceiling also
includes the contracting of any domestic loans by the Development and the Guarantee
Funds. It excludes any guarantees extended under the financial stability framework, unless
such loans or guarantees are extended to entities other than financial sector institutions.
24. Reporting. General government revenue data and the Treasury cash situation table
will be submitted weekly on Wednesday; updated cash flow projections for the Republican
budget for the remainder of the year five days after the end of each month; and the stock of
spending arrears of the Republican budget, the Road company, and the social security funds
15 days after the end of each month. General government comprehensive fiscal data
(including social security funds) would be submitted by the 25th of each month. The large
state-owned enterprises listed in paragraph 19 will submit quarterly accounts and the wage
bill data 45 days after the end of the quarter.
F. Financial Sector Conditionality
25.
Improvements to the framework for debt collection and restructuring will focus on
two areas: account blockages based on promissory notes and out-of-court loan workouts. As
regards the first area, the NBS, in consultation with the government, will finalize amending
the law on payments transactions to introduce registration of promissory notes using a
uniform format—containing essential loan details and blockage conditions—in a single
registry. The Ministry of Economy, together with the NBS, will explore alternatives to the
first-mover advantage in account blockages. As regards out-of-court loan workouts, the
Ministry of Economy and the NBS, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and banks,
shall (i) establish an out-of-court restructuring mechanism working group comprising
representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Economy, NBS, tax authorities and selective
bank representatives by mid-March, 2010; (ii) draft a corporate debt restructuring strategy
note proposing the main features of an out-of-court restructuring mechanism (such as the
form of the framework, coverage of debtors, and role of the NBS) and identify the legal
changes needed to support such a mechanism by end-April 2010; (iii) submit draft legislative
changes for government approval by end-June 2010; and (iv) submit the package of the
legislative changes to Parliament by end-September 2010 (structural benchmark).

Safeguards Assessment:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS)
was subject to an update assessment in March 2009. The update found that the
safeguards framework at the NBS was strengthened since the 2001 safeguards
assessment. The application of international standards resulted in noticeable

3
improvement in the quality of the audited financial statements and internal audit
practices. Staff recommended that further enhancements should focus on the
establishment of an audit committee to provide independent oversight of NBS
operations, and on amending the NBS Law to ensure operational and financial
independence.
X. Exchange Arrangement: Serbia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4, on May 15, 2002, and maintains a system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except with respect to blocked pre-1991
foreign currency savings deposits (IMF Country Report No. 02/105). The de jure
exchange rate arrangement is a floating system since January 1, 2001. According to the
2009 Monetary Policy Program, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) implements a
managed floating exchange rate regime.
XI. Last Article IV Consultation: Concluded on January 28, 2008 (IMF Country Report
No. 08/54).

Annex II. Serbia: World Bank Group Relations
Partnership with Serbia’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been discussing the policy reform agenda with successive
governments, notably since the formation of the coalition government in July 2008. Support
for the government’s development strategy from the World Bank and the IMF follow the
agreed upon division of responsibilities between the two institutions.
2.
The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate) aimed at facilitating sustainable growth, while the Bank takes the lead on structural
policy aimed at medium to long-term adjustment. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the
Bank leads the policy dialogue in: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) pension, health,
and education; (iii) social safety net reform and the monitoring of the impact of the crisis on
the poor; and (iv) legal reforms with a bearing on the business environment, including labor
markets. The Bank and the Fund have jointly led the policy dialogue in the financial sector.
The World Bank
3.
Total IDA credits and grants committed to the Republic of Serbia (Serbia) by the
Bank since 2001 amount to approximately $740 million, with an additional $746,5 million in
IBRD commitments (as of March 2010). The Bank has assisted Serbia to make progress
against key objectives set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY08–11: (i)
encouraging private sector led growth and EU convergence; (ii) providing opportunities and
broadening participation in growth; and (iii) managing environmental and disaster risks.
The Government has advanced on the first two priorities with the support of World Bank
financial and analytical products, though progress has been less substantial on the third
priority owing to electoral and economic developments.
4.
The CPS was discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on
December 13, 2007. The CPS envisages base case IBRD lending of $600 million over the
period FY08–11. A Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPS-PR) assessing
progress in implementing the FY08-FY11 CPS for Serbia, was presented to the Board on
November 19, 2009. At the request of the Government, the original CPS allocation has been
increased by an additional US$300 million. This additional lending will initially be allocated
to development policy lending (to support reform of public expenditures as well as private
and financial sector development), which will help to meet Serbia’s short to medium term
financing needs and complement support under a coordinated assistance package comprising
EU and IMF assistance under the SBA. Moreover nearly two-thirds (US$388 million) of the
original CPS envelope has been reallocated to help complete Corridor X, the major northsouth transport corridor.
5.
As of March 2010, Serbia has a portfolio of 12 Bank-supported projects under
implementation with a total commitment value of $845.8 million (including IDA, IBRD and

6
GEF). Investment support focuses on (i) transport and energy infrastructure aimed at
encouraging regional integration and spurring economic growth; (ii) agricultural,
environment, and irrigation investments to improve production and help Serbia meet EU
standards; (iii) pension, education and health sector reform to strengthen the quality of
service and improve financial sustainability; (iv) strengthened land administration; (v) energy
efficiency; and (vi) regional development in the economically depressed former mining
region of Bor.
6.
The Bank’s flagship analytical work in FY09 was a Public Expenditure Review
(PER), following a request from the Minister of Finance in September 2008 for advice on
where costs could be cut in the budget. The PER has been central to the DPL series and will
be followed-up by FY10 just-in-time assistance to identify structural savings in the public
sector wage bill. Other FY10 just-in-time assistance include work to identify measures that
would: allow the pension system to become financially sustainable while ensuring adequate
benefits into the future. With an eye to the longer-term competiveness agenda the Bank is
providing FY10 TA for Education Reform strengthening Research and Innovation (key
obstacle to successful completion of transition) and to improve efficiency in Municipal
Enterprises. The Bank is coordinating support for better governance in the justice sector
through a multi-donor trust fund. Broader academic and public dialogue is assured through a
series of roundtables and policy notes.
IFC
7.
As of March 2010, the IFC’s committed portfolio in Serbia was US$285 million in
eleven projects, of which 16% consists of equity investments. The financial and food sectors
represent the largest sector exposures on IFC's own account. In addition, in December 2009
IFC made a Euro 40 million preferred share investment in a large bank of systemic
importance through the recently established IFC Bank Capitalization Fund. IFC's investment
portfolio also includes substantial indirect exposure to Serbia through either regional private
equity funds or regional players in the micro-finance and retail sectors.
8.
In the financial sector, since the inception of the global financial crisis IFC injected
liquidity into the Serbian banking system by disbursing existing commitments as well as new
commitments in the total amount of approximately US$90 million to banks. Under the Joint
IFI Action Plan, IFC plans to provide an additional US$200 million in the form of equity and
debt financing to systemic banks that are looking to play a counter-cyclical role by increasing
their SME and corporate portfolio during the current market downturn.
9.
Advisory Services. IFC completed the first phase of the regulatory guillotine review
at sub-national level to improve the business environment and sub-national competitiveness
in four municipalities. In addition, IFC is providing advisory services to several companies
through its corporate governance and international standard programs. IFC has also

7
successfully completed the implementation of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
program.
FIAS
10.
FIAS, a multi-donor service of the World Bank Group administrated by IFC, advises
member countries on improving their investment climate and on methods to attract FDI.
Under a joint World Bank project, FIAS is providing assistance to the government in
improving the quality of regulations affecting the cost and risk of doing business in Serbia by
developing and implementing tools for reviewing the flow of regulation. FIAS is also
implementing several multi-year technical assistance investment generation programs to
support Serbia in its efforts to attract FDI.
MIGA
11.
As of December 2010, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Serbia consisted of 6
contracts of guarantee with total gross exposure of $216 million. MIGA guarantees have
primarily supported the expansion of Serbia's banking and leasing sectors.

Annex III. Serbia: Statistical Issues
1.
Economic statistics in Serbia have faced many challenges in recent years but data
provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The statistical system has been successfully
upgraded in recent years with the assistance of the IMF1 and other bilateral and multilateral
institutions. Although international standards are not yet fully met, official data for all sectors
are sufficiently good to support key economic analysis and surveillance. In many areas,
including monetary, balance of payments, and real sectors, internationally accepted reporting
standards have been introduced. A page for the Republic of Serbia was introduced in the
October 2006 issue of the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
2.
Serbia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
metadata were posted on the IMF Data Dissemination Bulletin Board on May 1, 2009. The
metadata identify plans for improvement, which are being used to guide further progress.
A. Real Sector Statistics
Real sector data are compiled by the Republic of Serbia Statistical Office (RSSO). Annual
current and constant price estimates of GDP by activity and current price GDP by
expenditure are available for 1997–2008. In June 2005, the RSSO started publishing
quarterly constant price estimates of GDP using the production approach. Data are available
from 1997 onward and are disseminated with a lag of three months after the reference
quarter. The RSSO has made commendable efforts to adopt the System of National Accounts
(1993 SNA), but there are still problems with the consistency of the annual GDP estimates
from the production and expenditure sides, and estimates of fixed capital formation. The new
estimates of changes in inventories that comply with international recommendations have not
yet been incorporated in the published data. Data sources are still in need of improvement.
Official statistics do not incorporate estimates of informal activities, which the RSSO
estimated at 16–18 percent of GDP in 2003–05.
3.
The RSSO compiles and disseminates monthly indices for retail and consumer prices,
producer prices, industrial production, as well as unit-value indices for imports and exports.
The CPI, introduced in 2007, appears broadly in line with international standards as do the
producer price and the industrial production indices.
B. Balance of Payments Statistics
4.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS).
The compilation procedures are generally appropriate; however, the source data for
1

Since 2001, STA conducted four technical assistance missions on monetary and financial statistics, four
missions on national accounts, two multi-sector mission, and two balance of payments mission. In addition, the
STA GFS regional resident statistical advisor based in Slovenia visited Belgrade on three occasions and
provided remote assistance.

9
compiling various current account transactions could be further improved. In particular,
additional programs should be developed to collect data to estimate unrecorded trade, travel,
and private transfers (workers’ remittances).
5.
The NBS has improved the source data for estimating transactions relating to direct
investment by conducting direct surveys of direct investment enterprises. However, there is a
backlog of data to be processed and direct investment transactions in the balance of payments
statistics have not been adjusted based on the survey data.
6.
The staff levels are not commensurate with the statistical program and the NBS may
face some difficulty in conducting all the requisite data collection exercises and
implementing the majority of the recommendations if staffing is not increased.
7.
Serbia reports balance of payments statistics to STA for publication in the IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The NBS has made steady progress towards
compiling international investment position statistics, which will be published for the first
time in March.
C. Government Finance Statistics
8.
Government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Finance and reported
on a monthly basis. Principal data sources are the Republican Treasury and budgetary
execution reports of the spending ministries and first-level budget units.
9.
Since 2001, Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in
line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. Full
compliance has yet to be achieved as implementation of the new chart of accounts, generally
consistent with the classifications of the GFSM 2001, has not been completed. The
classification of all expenditure of the “National Investment Plan” as capital is not in line
with international standards. While the data on the clearance of arrears are available on a
monthly basis, information on the accumulation of new arrears is not available. The
reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data is not conducted on a regular basis.
D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
10.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS, broadly following the
methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM), and
meeting the GDDS recommendations with respect to periodicity and timeliness for financial
sector data. Monetary data are reported to the Fund using Standardized Report Forms.
11.
Some improvements could still be made. The coverage of monetary statistics
excludes (i) banks in liquidation (as their data are not available on a timely or comparable,
International Accounting Standard-specified, basis) and (ii) a group of small deposit-taking
institutions that the authorities designate as Other Financial Institutions (OFIs).

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments and policy actions in Serbia since
the issuance of the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
On March 23, the NBS lowered its policy interest rate by 50 basis points to
9 percent, against a backdrop of monthly CPI inflation rates (3.9 percent, y-o-y, in February)
below the NBS’s tolerance band, while one-year ahead inflation expectations of financial
market participants have continued to trend downward.
3.
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) Governor Jelašić has announced his resignation
for personal reasons. The Parliament’s finance committee is expected to formalize the
decision in the next few weeks, and nominate the successor. Mr. Jelašić will continue to
exercise his functions until the new Governor takes office.
4.
The government adopted a new small program of subsidized consumer cash
loans in dinars to support domestic demand. The budget cost of the additional interest
subsidies could amount to up to 0.5 billion dinars, to be financed through existing budget
allocations, while the take-up of the subsidized loans could reach up to 0.3 percent of GDP.
In addition, the government decided that all other subsidized consumer loans will also only
be extended in dinars.
5.
The authorities announced a decision to sell a 40 percent stake in Telekom later
this year through an international tender. The preliminary plan is to channel the
potentially significant proceeds to a special fund, which would finance infrastructure
investment.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Serbia
On [March, 31, 2010], the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Serbia.1
Background
The Serbian economy enjoyed fast-paced GDP growth during the five years leading up to the
global economic downturn, buoyed by strong domestic demand and an externally funded
credit boom. But the economic expansion was strongly tilted towards non-tradable sectors. An
increasingly procyclical fiscal policy added further expansionary impulses to domestic demand,
while structural reforms proceeded only slowly. As a result, external stability risks increased,
reflected in high external deficits, rising private sector external indebtedness, high euroization,
and weak export competitiveness.
The global economic and financial crisis quickly spilled over to Serbia. The squeeze in external
financing led to a sharp contraction of investment, followed by a significant drop in
consumption. The fiscal deficit surged, reflecting higher social spending needs and tax
revenues shortfalls on account of lower trade, incomes, and spending.
The authorities responded to the downturn with a comprehensive policy package to safeguard
macroeconomic and financial stability. The policy response focused on fiscal adjustment;

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

implementation of a Financial Sector Support Program, including financing assurances from
foreign parent banks; and substantial external financing from IMF, World Bank, and the EU. A
structural policy reform program was designed to address the roots of the economy’s low
capacity to produce, save, and export.
The authorities’ adjustment program—supported by the SBA—has contributed to limiting the
fallout of the global crisis on Serbia. While the output slump has been limited relative to
regional peers, the decline in domestic demand has been significant, resulting in a strong
external adjustment. Real GDP contracted by less than 3 percent, and domestic demand by
7½ percent. With the economy’s overall spending shrinking faster than income, the external
current account deficit is estimated at 5¾ percent of GDP, down from 17 percent in 2008.
Capital inflows have remained low but stable over the last few months; as a consequence,
external financing pressures have abated.
The outlook for 2010 points to a slow but balanced recovery. The pick-up in growth will likely
be moderate (2 percent), reflecting slow trading partner recovery, protracted corporate
deleveraging, nominal freezes in public wages and pensions, and lagging labor market
adjustment. The NBS inflation targets for 2010 should be met, but recent disinflation
notwithstanding, inflation expectations remain elevated. The program targets a 2010 deficit of
4 percent of GDP and fiscal consolidation over the medium term. After the sharp external
adjustment in 2009, the current account deficit is expected to widen slightly reflecting a drop in
remittances relative to 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Serbian economy has weathered the global financial crisis
relatively well. The decline in output has been contained, while falling domestic demand has
resulted in significant external adjustment. Going forward, Directors agreed that policies should
shift the economy toward more sustainable growth, with resolute reduction of external and
fiscal imbalances. Against this background, they welcomed the authorities’ focus on
strengthened structural and fiscal policies aimed at raising productivity, exports, and saving.
Directors supported the authorities’ ambitious spending-based adjustment strategy, which
aims at reducing high structural fiscal deficits mainly by restraining the growth of public wages
and pensions, while increasing public investment to address long-standing infrastructure
bottlenecks. They underscored, however, that bold steps are needed to replace these nominal
freezes and other ad hoc fiscal measures by structurally sound spending reforms. Directors
therefore welcomed the agreed package of parametric pension reforms and looked forward to
its early approval by Parliament, while encouraging adoption of an indexation mechanism for
pensions consistent with the authorities’ medium-term target for pension outlays. The
authorities should also speed up additional spending reforms in the education, health, and
administration sectors, while maintaining a well-targeted social safety net. Directors observed
that the credibility of the authorities’ fiscal adjustment strategy hinges on early and determined

3
implementation of these reforms. Fiscal consolidation efforts would also benefit from
improvements in tax administration.
Directors stressed the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline, particularly in light of
pressures for new spending. In this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to draft
fiscal responsibility legislation that could include ceilings on public wages and pensions during
2010-12. Some Directors considered that the authorities should stand ready to take additional
fiscal measures or contingency actions as needed.
Directors supported the authorities’ prudent conduct of monetary policy, as reflected in
continued disinflation. They agreed that further easing should be pursued cautiously in view of
the still elevated inflation expectations. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to streamline
and lower reserve requirements, as well as plans to curtail the high level of euroization, both of
which could help improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the positive assessment reached in the recent Financial Sector
Assessment Program Update. They agreed that adverse spillovers from the global crisis on
the Serbian banking system have been contained. However, supervisory challenges remain,
including streamlining prudential rules and formalizing memoranda of understanding with key
home supervisors. Prudential and supervisory measures should continue to be used to
discourage banks from extending new unhedged foreign exchange loans. Directors welcomed
foreign parent banks’ re-affirmed commitments under the European Bank Coordination
Initiative to keep their subsidiaries liquid and well capitalized. Careful monitoring of possible
regional financial spillovers will be important.
Directors stressed that further progress on structural reform is needed to lift Serbia’s growth
potential and promote the tradable goods sector. They were encouraged by the recent efforts
to streamline business laws and regulations. The authorities need to press ahead with public
enterprise reform and privatization as market conditions permit.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with
Serbia and Approves €360 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Serbia’s economic performance under a program supported by a Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review enables the immediate release of SDR
319.6 million (about €360 million, or US$485.23 million). The Serbian authorities have
indicated that they will draw only 50 percent of the purchase available under this review.
This would bring total disbursements under the program to SDR 1.2 billion (about
€1.3billion, or US$1.8 billion). The Board also completed the financing assurances review.
Serbia’s initial 15-month SBA was approved on January 16, 2009, for SDR 350.8 million
(about €395.13 million, or US$532.6 million). The arrangement was extended by one year
and augmented to SDR 2.6 billion (about €2.9 billion, or US$4 billion on May 15, 2009 (see
Press Release No. 09/169) to support the government's economic program amid a sharper
than expected impact from the global financial crisis.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with Serbia. A Public
Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Serbia, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Serbia continues to perform well under its economic program supported by the Fund’s
Stand-By arrangement. The authorities’ policy response to the global financial crisis has
helped contain its adverse effects on the Serbian economy: the output decline has been
limited, while falling domestic demand has resulted in significant external adjustment.
“Fast-paced GDP growth in Serbia before the crisis came at the cost of growing external and
financial stability risks. As the economy recovers, policies should be geared toward

2

promoting more balanced medium-term growth. There is a need for stronger structural and
fiscal policies to raise productivity, exports, and savings.
“The authorities’ spending-based adjustment strategy aims at reducing high structural fiscal
deficits mainly by restraining the growth of public wages and pensions, while public
investments will be increased to address long-standing infrastructure bottlenecks. Fiscal
adjustment in 2009 was in line with the program, but was largely based on ad hoc measures
that will need to be replaced by more durable spending reforms, such as the planned pension
reform, and structurally sound reforms in the education, health, and administration sectors,
while maintaining a well-targeted social safety net. The adoption of fiscal responsibility
legislation should help maintain spending discipline.
“The Financial Sector Assessment Program Update concluded that the banking sector is well
capitalized and highly liquid, and has successfully weathered the global financial crisis.
However, supervisory challenges remain, including streamlining prudential rules and
formalizing memoranda of understanding with key home supervisors. Foreign parent banks’
commitments under the European Bank Coordination Initiative are welcome, and the recent
agreement to gradually phase out commitments is appropriate against the backdrop of a
considerable easing of external financing pressures.
“To increase Serbia’s growth potential, structural reforms should be implemented, notably in
the areas of public enterprise reform and privatization. Recent efforts to streamline business
laws and regulations are welcome.”

Statement by Mr. Weber and Mr. Antic on Republic of Serbia
March 31, 2010

1.
We thank staff for a comprehensive set of documents, which present an accurate picture
of the economic situation in Serbia. The report candidly delineates the delicate policy
challenges that the authorities are facing in this turbulent period. There are positive signs that
the economy has reached the turning point to a lasting recovery, but the authorities are aware
that this recovery needs to be underpinned by further fiscal and structural reforms. On behalf
of our Serbian authorities, we would like to thank staff for very constructive policy
discussions and valuable advice. As in the past, the authorities will not object the publication
of the current reports, nor request any modification of the documents.
2.
The Stand-By Arrangement with Serbia is on track and all end-December quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets were met, most with a considerable margin. The
structural reform agenda remains politically difficult, but notable progress was made on the
sensitive and complex reform of the pension system, in designing fiscal responsibility rules,
and in facilitating corporate debt collection. Despite some delays, the authorities remain
committed to implementing all the benchmarks agreed with the Fund.
3.
Economic indicators are currently sending mixed signals. The global recovery is
supporting a tentative upturn in industrial output, exports and capital inflows are higher than
expected, and confidence in the banking system has been restored. On the other hand,
corporate insolvency and payment problems are still on the rise and unemployment remains
stubbornly high. Shrinking domestic demand caused a sharp reduction in the current account
deficit, but the decline in imports resulted in a loss of fiscal revenues which, at least in part,
will be permanent. The continued need to adjust external and fiscal imbalances might hold
back the recovery and hamper the economy’s growth potential. The authorities are
nevertheless confident that the gradual economic recovery projected for this year will
materialize.
4.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy is based on expenditure cuts with the exception of
pro-poor spending and public investment in infrastructure, without an increase in the overall
tax burden. A nominal freeze on wages of government employees and public pensions is in
effect until end-2010, while other expenditure categories are being scrutinized for savings.
The fiscal space thus created in the budget will be used for infrastructure investment. With
this approach, fiscal deficits will be gradually reduced over the medium-term. The authorities

2
believe that the achievements on the fiscal front should be preserved and they will submit
fiscal sustainability legislation to parliament by end-May.
5.
Regarding public sector wages, the authorities intend to lower the ratio of general
government wages to GDP to 8 percent by 2015. In addition to the wage freeze, the
workforce in the central and local administrations is to be reduced by 10 percent, together
with the imposition of a strict hiring freeze across all levels of government. Public
employment will be further rationalized through reforms in health and education sectors.
6.
A complex pension reform is under way with the aim to lower net spending by pension
funds to 10 percent of GDP by 2015. With the pensions freeze being a temporary measure,
sustainable longer-term savings are envisaged with parametric adjustments (increase of
minimum retirement age, reduction in service credits for the military and police, tightening of
survivor entitlements, longer contribution period for women). This package of reforms will
be submitted to parliament by end-May. Most importantly from the point of view of fiscal
sustainability, the authorities propose a new but temporary indexation formula after the freeze
on pensions expires. They have proposed to establish a temporary link between pensions and
public wages for 18 months starting in April 2011, with the idea that the burden of fiscal
adjustment during 2011-12 should be equally shared between public wages and pensions.
After the indexation adjustment in April 2012, there will be a shift to CPI indexation. This
indexation agreement will be consistent with the ultimate goal of reducing pension spending
to 10 percent of GDP in 2015.
7.
The authorities expected that inflation will end the year within the target range of the
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) of 4 to 8 percent. The NBS will remain focused on achieving
stable inflation within this target range. In a situation where inflation is currently low and
inflation expectation are declining, although from an elevated level, the NBS continues with
an easing of its monetary stance. The policy rate was recently lowered to 9 percent. Reserve
requirements will be simplified by phasing out most exemptions and only two statutory rates
will be introduced. The new regime will be phased in gradually and should be fully in place
by March 2011.
8.
The NBS will continue with the managed float as the exchange rate regime for the
dinar. Although the exchange rate helped in absorbing external shocks, Serbia’s shallow
foreign-exchange market is prone to excessive volatility. Recent NBS interventions are
geared towards the objective of smoothing such volatility and preserve financial stability.
9.
The Serbian banking system is well capitalized and liquid, as confirmed by the updated
Financial System Stability Assessment. While the banking sector is resilient, the risks of a
loss of confidence in banks due to regional contagion and of unhedged foreign exchange
exposures persist. The authorities agreed with the participants of the Bank Coordination
Initiative (Vienna Initiative) on a gradual exit strategy from the exposure commitments, with
the exposure floor for Serbia reduced to 80 percent of the end-2008 exposure.
10. Although market conditions are not ideal for privatization, the selling of state and
socially owned companies continues. All companies under the Privatization Agency will be

3
offered for sale or will be put under liquidation or bankruptcy procedure. One large
social-owned enterprise has recently entered into a joint venture with a foreign investor,
which is the strategy that the authorities intend to pursue with other large state companies.
The utility sector will be corporatized this year and full or partial privatization should follow.
11. Our Serbian authorities believe that the design of the program has adequately addressed
the economic challenges of the country. They are open to revisiting aspects of the
arrangement, given that its objective is shifting from preserving financial and external
stability to fiscal and structural reforms.
