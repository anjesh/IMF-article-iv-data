•

This report is based on discussions held in Windhoek November 5–16, 2007.
The staff team comprised Mr. Allum (head), Mr. Dwight, Ms. Chen (all AFR), and
Mr. Oppers (MCM). Mr. Uanguta from the Executive Director’s office and
Mr. Burgess from the South Africa resident representative office also attended
meetings.

•

Meetings: Staff met with Finance Minister Kuugongelwa-Amadhila; Bank of
Namibia Governor Alweendo; other senior government officials; and
representatives of Parliament, the private sector, academia, development partners,
and labor unions.

•

Past surveillance: The 2006 Article IV, concluded in January 2007, was
streamlined. Directors commended the authorities for generally prudent
macroeconomic policies, recommended that they accumulate additional
international reserves, and advocated market-based strategies to broaden domestic
investment opportunities. The authorities have been receptive to IMF views on
economic management.

•

Namibia fixes its currency at par to the South African rand, which is also legal

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Namibia’s economic position has been reinforced since the last consultation. Real GDP
growth is in line with regional performance, and a substantial terms of trade improvement
and large receipts from the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) have contributed to
significant external current account and fiscal surpluses. Official reserves have increased to a
comfortable level, and it is expected that public debt will be reduced to less than 25 percent
of GDP this year.
The economic outlook is generally good, despite a projected partial reversal of the terms of
trade gains and prospects for lower SACU receipts relative to GDP. The biggest economic
problems are unemployment and poverty.
Policy discussions
Staff supported the authorities’ strategy of broadening the economic base and reducing
unemployment while preserving a solid fiscal position.
Staff endorsed the authorities’ intent to increase infrastructure spending, using existing fiscal
space and reprioritizing expenditures. There was also agreement on the importance of
reinvigorating domestic revenue administration, given the potential vulnerability of SACU
receipts.
Staff supports Namibia’s intention to ensure that interest rate differentials with South Africa
do not destabilize official reserves or capital flows within the common monetary area
(CMA). The authorities are committed to the CMA.
Notwithstanding increased current account surpluses, there was agreement that there is no
clear evidence of significant currency undervaluation. To build competitiveness in the
nonmining sector, measures to develop skills and enhance labor productivity will be
important.
The banking system is profitable and well-capitalized, and there has been welcome progress
in reinforcing financial sector supervision in line with FSAP recommendations. The
authorities are aware of the risks of tightening domestic investment requirements for the
pension and insurance sectors; staff recommended a careful phase-in, and efforts to broaden
the investment options.
Staff supported Namibia’s efforts to increase employment opportunities in the nonmining
economy by, e.g., making the labor market more flexible. Staff also recommended
continuing liberalization of the trade regime, including through broader free trade
arrangements.

4
I. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL BACKDROP
1.

Namibia is benefiting from a favorable external environment:

•

The terms of trade strengthened by an estimated one-third between 2005 and 2007 on
high mineral export prices. Improved diamond extraction rates and rising SACU
receipts driven by South African import growth also contributed to an external current
account surplus estimated at 16–18 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007 (Figure 1).

•

A fiscal surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP was recorded in 2006/071 because of high
SACU receipts and tight spending policies. For 2007/08, a surplus of 2.6 percent is
projected, which should reduce public debt to 23 percent of GDP (Figure 2).

•

Net international reserves have almost doubled since 2005 as part of the increased
SACU receipts was saved. At end-September 2007 gross reserves of $850 million
matched short-term external debt, were more than three times base money, and
represented 3.0 months of imports of goods and services.

•

Inflation remains modest despite pressures from higher international food prices; it
declined to 6.6 percent in October 2007 from a peak of 7.2 percent in July (Figure 3).
To contain inflationary pass-through, since mid-2006 interest rates have been
increased 3.5 percentage points (to 10.5 percent). Treasury bill yields have edged
below South African rates reflecting a declining supply with the strengthened fiscal
position.

•

The exchange rate has been stable in nominal effective terms in the 12 months
through September 2007, and the real effective exchange rate in the first nine months
of 2007 was in line with the average for the preceding decade (Figure 1).

•

Real GDP growth matches regional peers, and Namibia shares the same challenges
with regard to unemployment and the prevalence of HIV (Figure 4).
II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK

2.

The medium-term outlook is promising:

•

Real GDP growth per capita is projected to approach 4 percent, up from 3 percent a
few years ago. This reflects a continued strengthening of the nonmining economy,
which accounts for 85 percent of GDP. The timing and yields from exploiting the
Kudu natural gas field are uncertain and could boost growth toward 2012.

•

Inflation is projected to decline to 5.5 percent by 2009; tighter monetary policies are
already in place. A small positive differential between Namibian and South African
inflation is projected because productivity in Namibia continues to grow faster, so
inflation is at the upper end rather than the center of South Africa’s 3–6 percent target
range.

The fiscal year is April 1–March 31.

3.
There are risks related to mineral production, diversification into nonmineral
activities, and SACU receipts.
•

Mining sector volatility is such that the terms of trade may decline faster than
projected over the medium term.

•

Business climate and public infrastructure improvements may fall short of what is
needed to support investment and growth projections.

•

Political and social risk: As baseline growth projections would reduce unemployment
and income inequality only marginally at first, they would remain as political and
social concerns.

•

SACU receipts are projected at 11–12 percent of GDP over the medium term,
financing about one-third of public spending. These receipts are vulnerable to
revision of the revenue-sharing formula, an issue already tabled for discussion.

4.
Upside risks relate primarily to the pace of structural reform. Decisive steps to
make the labor market more flexible and eliminate business impediments could accelerate
economic diversification and reduce unemployment more meaningfully.
5.
The authorities concurred with this analysis. Preliminary Bank of Namibia
projections for annual economic growth were up to 0.5 percent lower than those of staff,
based on more cautious assumptions about the capacity to extend diamond extraction through
new discoveries and developments in extraction technology. At the same time, with large
parts of the country unsurveyed, the authorities see new mineral discoveries as a distinct
possibility.

10
III. THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. How Should the Emerging Fiscal Space be Used?
Background
6.

Increased receipts from SACU and the mining sector have created fiscal space.

•

The 25 percent of GDP debt ceiling is likely to be undershot by 2 percentage points
this fiscal year. With a strong primary balance, the budget is well-placed to weather
declines in SACU and mining revenues over the medium term without breaching the
debt ceiling.

•

The emerging fiscal space could be used to keep public debt below the ceiling, reduce
taxes, or accommodate new spending. Given relatively low public debt and credible
fiscal management, the case for maintaining a margin below the debt ceiling is not
persuasive. Reducing taxes is also risky, given SACU receipt vulnerabilities.
Accordingly, the macroeconomic framework developed with the authorities
incorporates a modest expenditure increase, primarily for infrastructure, that amounts
to a cumulative 4½ percent of GDP over five years.

7.
Given uncertainties about future SACU financing, the tax administration effort
must be more ambitious. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) needs a strategic plan
setting out goals and work priorities, supported by stepped-up recruitment and capacity
building. Forensic tax audits are currently contracted to private accounting companies rather
than IRD staff; there is no effective large-taxpayer unit; and VAT refunds are audited in a
comprehensive rather than risk-based manner.

11
8.

The quality of public spending could be improved:

•

Public spending is high by sub-Saharan African standards, and better prioritization
could accelerate poverty reduction and progress toward the Millennium Development
Goals (Figure 5).

•

Program-based budgeting is a first priority. Expenditure data are currently reported
only by line ministry, and a modernized chart of accounts is needed to support
informed discussion of spending priorities.

•

The public wage bill in relation to GDP is one of the highest in Africa. Although it
was reduced from 15 percent of GDP three years ago to 13 percent in 2006/07
(Figure 2), what is needed is a strategy for civil service structure, performance, and
remuneration.

•

State-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to jeopardize the budget. An SOE
Governance Act approved in August 2006 is stalled pending establishment of an
oversight secretariat. Because of public opposition no significant privatizations are
planned.

•

The new medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) offers a basis for prioritizing
spending but could be more effective. Spending decisions should be based on the
revenue outlook beyond potentially temporary SACU, mining, and other receipts.
Budget surpluses and debt reduction in periods of peak income would provide room
to sustain spending when public revenues fall. Although recent fiscal surpluses seem
consistent with this approach, they reflect shortfalls in capital spending and
unexpectedly strong nominal income growth as much as fiscal discipline.

Policy discussions
9.
Ministry of Finance (MoF) officials underlined the importance of firm fiscal
stewardship. They confirmed the central role of the MTEF in ensuring fiscal sustainability
but also noted political challenges in programming fiscal surpluses when revenue is growing
given the country’s unmet social and economic needs. They continue to see the public debt
limit as a central fiscal anchor and will work to ensure that it continues to be respected.
10.
Government officials recognized the need to redouble their efforts to strengthen
tax administration to mobilize domestic revenue. However, they cited poor taxpayer
compliance and recruitment and retention issues in IRD as factors behind the decision to
adopt intensive audits of VAT returns and outsource forensic tax audits. Staff saw the
intention to mobilize more domestic revenue as welcome, compared to the modest decline
relative to GDP projected in the last MTEF. The government intends to seek IMF technical
assistance to review the adequacy of taxation of the mining sector considering increased

mining sector rents and new investments.2 The authorities are also considering staff
recommendations that Namibia subscribe to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative
(EITI).3 Staff noted that proposals to delegate some revenues and expenditures to subnational
authorities should be crafted carefully to avoid undermining fiscal management.
11.
The authorities confirmed the need for better prioritization of spending. They
intend to use the emerging fiscal space to fund growth-promoting infrastructure (notably
roads, rail, and rural electrification) and sectoral programs (tourism and fisheries). They
indicated that program-based budgeting is a high priority and will continue to control the
public wage bill. They also noted that they are considering the use of public-private
partnerships to make public spending more effective. In welcoming these goals, staff
encouraged the authorities to bring the SOE Act into effect. Noting the contributions of the
Global Fund, the United States, and other donors to Namibia’s successful antiretroviral
(ART) drug program, staff also suggested that a progressive increase in Namibia’s own
contribution would help ensure sustainability.4 The authorities responded that while the
budget covered other aspects of the pandemic, provision for antiretrovirals would be
increased as needed.
B. Do Large Current Account Surpluses Signal Currency Undervaluation?
Background
12.
Namibia’s very large current account surpluses reflect a combination of
temporary fiscal tightening and an increase in private savings:5
•

Public savings rose more than 6 percent in 2006, accounting for three-quarters of the
rise in the current account surplus compared to the three preceding years.6

•

Private savings have also risen considerably since 2003. Though not well understood
this trend coincides with a decline in inflation (Figure 6).7

2

This would be consistent with Namibia’s participation as a pilot case for closer Bank-Fund collaboration in
supporting management of natural resource earnings.

3

Namibia is currently a participant in the Kimberley Process diamonds initiative.

4

Namibia’s HIV prevalence rate declined from 22 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2006. A program for public
provision of ART drugs was launched in mid-2003, and now covers about 40,000 patients, or about 70 percent
of those who could benefit from ART treatment.

5

A more detailed discussion of these issues is provided in the accompanying selected issues paper.

6

Recent fiscal revenues from the diamond sector, Namibia’s principal mineral export, have been 1–2 percent of
GDP, compared to an estimated “permanent” fiscal income from diamonds of about 0.4 percent of GDP, taking
into account depletion prospects. This difference is not sufficiently large to merit sustained high public savings
for income smoothing purposes.

7

There is a significant inverse relationship between private savings and inflation for 1990–2006.

•

Mining sector: The increase in private savings in 2006 may reflect increased mining
incomes. Mineral exports rose by 4 percent of GDP in 2006, and although mining
operations are largely foreign-owned, these increased incomes may have boosted
recorded savings pending payment of taxes and remittance of dividends. Absent
corporate income data, this channel is difficult to quantify.

•

Net foreign assets: Much of the additional savings have been invested abroad, and the
medium-term projections for savings-investment balances are consistent with
stabilization of private sector net foreign assets at a higher level.

Yet there is no conclusive evidence of significant undervaluation:

•

Tradables sector performance (aside from mining) is weak, which is at odds with a
possible currency undervaluation. Manufacturing growth has declined since 2003, as
has real GDP growth. There is no evidence of a sustained pick up in nonmineral
exports or a slowing in import demand.

•

Survey-based competitiveness indicators have deteriorated on some measures since
the 1990s; while the trend is not significant, it does not a priori suggest accelerated
supply-side improvements that would lead to currency appreciation.

Behavioral real exchange rate models suggest emerging undervaluation estimated at
about 7–8 percent in 20068 (Figure 7)—but the models also predict that about half of
this undervaluation would pass through to higher inflation differentials within a year.
While inflation has picked up relative to trading partners, the increase has been
modest, consistent with a small undervaluation.

Policy discussions
14.
The authorities underlined their commitment to the common monetary area
(CMA).9 They agreed that there is no clear evidence of significant currency undervaluation.
Indeed (see below), their main concern was the need to make nonmineral exports more
competitive.

Under the CMA, Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland peg their currencies to the South Africa rand, which is also
legal tender in their territories. The CMA provides for free capital mobility. Separate central banks set interest
rates and hold official reserves, which for Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland must equal or exceed domestic
currency issue.

17
15.
Discussions on CMA issues focused on appropriate monetary policies. While
Namibia’s policy interest rate decisions have matched those of South Africa since mid-2004,
the authorities saw macroeconomic conditions as diverging, with more evidence in Namibia
of slowing domestic demand and inflation. Accordingly, the need for continuing to align
Namibia’s policies with South Africa’s was being carefully reviewed (foreshadowing the
decision not to match South Africa’s 50-basis-point repo rate increase early in December).
Staff noted the need to monitor closely the impact on capital outflows and official reserves.
C. What Further Financial Sector Reforms are Needed? 10
Background
16.
The financial sector is strong and increasingly well regulated. However, more
effective intermediation of ample domestic savings to boost domestic investment and growth
would be welcome.
•

The banking system is very profitable, well-capitalized, with few nonperforming loans
(Figure 8); private sector credit is relatively high by international standards,
amounting to 58 percent of GDP in 2006. As the 2006 FSAP found, bank outreach to
poorer households and small and medium-sized enterprises could be better. Banks are
now extending their outreach through a range of innovative savings and credit
products.

•

Namibia’s well-developed life insurance and pension fund sector is required to invest
35 percent of portfolios domestically; the industry typically invests much of the rest
abroad, citing a lack of domestic investment opportunities. The capitalization of local
companies on the domestic stock market is just 6 percent of GDP (only seven local
companies are listed); public debt is low; and volume on the secondary corporate debt
market is low. Pension savings are one factor behind Namibia’s capital outflows;
most middle-income countries have capital inflows.

Issues, and Options.”

•

Tighter regulation of pension and insurance fund domestic investments is being
considered. Specifically, the funds would no longer be able to meet the current
35 percent domestic investment requirement with holdings in foreign companies
dual-listed on the Namibia stock exchange, and would have to dedicate some of their
portfolios to investments in domestic unlisted companies.

•

Financial sector supervision is also being reinforced, as recommended in the 2006
FSAP.11 An overhaul of NAMFISA, which supervises nonbanks, was initiated in
2006 after a new CEO was appointed. Staffing and training have been increased in
both NAMFISA and the Bank of Namibia, the banking regulator; risk-based
supervision has been initiated; both institutions have stepped up on-site visits;
NAMFISA has taken a medium-sized insurance company into curatorship; and a
number of banking regulations have been issued. But collection and analysis of data
from the nonbank financial sector is lagging; a full prudential picture of the sector is
unlikely before mid-2008.

Policy discussions
17.
The authorities emphasized the need for further outreach by the banking
community and more domestic investments by pension and life insurance funds. A
voluntary charter is being drafted under which banks will agree to meet social and economic
benchmarks for personnel management and lending. The authorities noted that tighter
domestic investment requirements were needed to encourage portfolio managers of pension
and insurance companies to look beyond the “easy option” of investing in South Africa’s
deeper markets. Any changes are to be implemented cautiously, monitoring closely the
impact on the industry.
11

Anti-money-laundering policies were strengthened in 2007 with enactment of the Financial Intelligence Act
and establishment of a financial intelligence center within the Bank of Namibia (BoN). Implementing
regulations are being drafted, and training needs and the roles of the respective government agencies are being
analyzed.

20
18.
Staff urged caution in tightening domestic investment requirements. International
experience suggests that pension funds earn higher returns when investment is not restricted.
Moreover, a domestic development mandate leaves funds vulnerable to pressures to finance
nonviable projects. Requirements to invest in unlisted securities pose a particular risk,
because unlisted companies disclose less about their finances. Staff noted that the required
repatriation of funds, which could amount to 10 percent of GDP or more, could exceed the
economy’s ability to absorb it. There are also uncertainties about enforceability. Pension and
insurance funds could probably side-step the regulations by investing in local banks, which
would still be free to invest in South African bonds. This would result in no real increase in
domestic financing while lowering returns through (a) a likely shift from equity to fixedincome returns favored by banks and (b) intermediation fees paid to banks.
19.
The authorities discounted concerns about investment opportunities. They
believe portfolio managers will find considerable unmet domestic demand for financing. The
authorities concurred, however, on the merits of broadening the range of investment options
through, e.g., bond issues by solid public agencies (following the precedent of NamPower)
and indicated they would look into international experience with securitization of mortgages
(which make up 40 percent of banks' loan portfolios), and factoring and leasing.
D. How to Reduce Unemployment?
Background
20.

Unemployment is a major problem:

•

Unemployment generally was 22 percent in 2004, not counting those not seeking work,
and was 44 percent for urban 20- to 24-year olds.

•

Job creation is needed. The mining sector provides few jobs; employment in agriculture
is likely to continue to decline; and fiscal considerations preclude further expansion of
public sector employment. Private nonfarm, nonmining employment (currently 192,000)
would need to rise by almost 60 percent to absorb the 108,000 unemployed.

21.
A superior business climate would compensate for difficult geographic
conditions:
•

Namibia’s economic geography complicates diversification. The domestic market is
limited, and the population is small and widely dispersed. Limited water resources
and distances from advanced economies are a further challenge.

•

Infrastructure is fairly well-developed, with business access to rail, port, and air
facilities viewed as superior to the average for lower-middle-income countries.

•

Economic governance is ranked in most surveys below Botswana and South Africa,
but is above average for a lower-middle-income country. The decline in government
effectiveness and control of corruption indicators over the past decade, while not
statistically significant, is nevertheless indicative.12 However, an Anti-Corruption
Commission became effective in 2006.

22.

Skills gaps and inflexible labor markets are obstacles to job growth:

•

Education and skills: At independence, Namibia inherited a poor education system.
The probability of employment is little higher for students with education up to
grade 10 than for the uneducated, but an education and skills reform program has
been launched with support from development partners.

The differences between Namibia and other lower-middle-income countries is significant at the 90 percent
level, as are differences with Botswana and South Africa for government effectiveness, and with Botswana for
control of corruption.

22
•

Labor market functioning: Workforce management is complicated by lengthy and
contentious challenges to worker dismissals in district labor courts. The pending
Labor Law would increase annual leave eligibility to 24 days (plus 5 days’
compassionate leave), substantially above many middle-income country peers.13

23.
Staff recommended continuing liberalization of the trade regime, including
through broader free trade arrangements. A wider free trade area across SADC would
increase market access for Namibia but is unlikely to be achieved by the 2008 target date
because non-SACU members are progressing slowly. Namibia signed an interim Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union in mid-December. This will preserve
Namibia’s access to the EU market and lower tariffs over time.
Policy discussions
24.
The authorities agreed that reducing unemployment is a top priority, and will
depend on building labor productivity and skills. Accordingly, a new Productivity Center is
being launched in the Ministry of Labor, and the planned opening in 2009 of a National
Institute of Public Administration and Management should make the civil service more
effective. Meanwhile, staff urged that the work permit process be streamlined for hard-to-fill
occupations. Reforms are being discussed, but the authorities underlined the need for
employers to do more to recruit Namibian workers.
25.
The authorities recognized the arguments for more flexible labor markets but
pointed to the importance of improving working conditions since independence. The
authorities envisage considerable improvements in the labor market under the pending Labor
Law, which will promote conciliation and arbitration as an alternative to legal challenges to
worker dismissals. They also considered that labor relations would benefit from
industry-level voluntary charters for the empowerment of the previously disadvantaged. Staff
noted that non-wage labor costs might rise as a result of the expanded leave provisions in the
new law and recommended that employers be permitted to establish lower leave standards
for new hires, with subsequent increases based on job seniority.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Achievements: Namibia’s economic position is strong. Economic growth is robust,
and inflation has declined since peaking in mid-2007. National savings have reduced public
indebtedness, built official reserves to a healthy level, and financed new private investments
at home and abroad. The banking system is profitable and well-capitalized.
27.
Vulnerabilities: Volatility in the mining sector and declines in SACU receipts
remain risks. Political support for economic reforms is strong but would be reinforced by
success in tackling unemployment and income inequality.
13

Statutory annual leave is 15 days in Botswana, Chile, and South Africa; 8-16 days in Malaysia (depending on
service); and 6 days in Thailand.

28.
Currency valuation: Namibia’s large current account surplus partly reflects a tight
fiscal position that is projected to ease over the medium term. While there is considerable
uncertainty about the cause of the recent increase in private saving, there is little evidence of
any significant currency undervaluation. Consistent with the authorities’ commitment to the
CMA, interest rate differentials with South Africa should be limited to levels that do not
destabilize capital flows or official reserves.
29.
Fiscal policy: Using a good part of the recent surge in SACU transfers and mineral
revenues to reduce public debt was appropriate. The emerging fiscal space and
reprioritization of expenditures provide scope for modest increases for infrastructure and
other programs.
30.
Expenditure management: To help prioritize and monitor expenditures, adoption of
a program classification for budget execution and reporting should be a priority. Because the
public wage bill is high, new hires and remuneration should be strictly limited, but adequate
salaries for critical staff should be ensured. To reduce risks to the budget from SOEs, the
SOE Governance Act needs to be implemented.
31.
Revenue policies: Tax administration should be strengthened in case SACU receipts
fall. Domestic revenue reforms have been hampered by recruitment and retention issues and
poor taxpayer compliance; efforts to strengthen the strategic and operational functions of the
Inland Revenue Department should be redoubled.
32.
Financial policies: Financial sector management is being enhanced consistent with
the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP. The authorities should continue to explore the scope
for fostering competition in the banking sector. Caution is needed in modifying domestic
investment requirements for pension and insurance companies—especially minimum
investments in unlisted securities—to avoid raising industry risk and deteriorating returns.
33.
Structural reforms: Fostering employment growth in the nonmining economy to
reduce unemployment is a central challenge. It will require forceful efforts to build skills and
labor productivity, especially through greater labor market flexibility. The business climate
also needs to be improved. Given Namibia’s daunting economic geography, it must build on
its comparatively strong economic institutions and tackle bureaucratic obstacles. Further
liberalization of the trade regime remains a priority.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange rate arrangement
The Namibia dollar is pegged at par to the South African rand, and both currencies are legal
tender in Namibia. Namibia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement as of September 20, 1996, and maintains an
exchange rate system free of restrictions in the making of transfers and payments of current
account transactions.
Article IV consultations
Namibia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle; the last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 5, 2007.
During the Executive Board meeting, Directors commended Namibia’s record of
macroeconomic stability and welcomed the recent rise in growth, decline in inflation, and
strengthening of external accounts. They emphasized the need to reduce the fiscal deficit
through expenditure restraint and civil service reform. They observed that the exchange rate
peg had served Namibia well but noted the importance of maintaining adequate international
reserves. Directors also stressed the importance of addressing HIV/AIDS, high
unemployment, and large disparities of income.

APPENDIX II
NAMIBIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 2007)
1.
Namibia joined the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. The Interim Strategy Note, the
first framework for engagement with the Republic of Namibia, was presented to the Board of
Executive Directors in May 2007. The strategy focuses on a flexible, demand-driven business
model in step with the Government’s budget and decision-making processes. Engagement is
envisioned at three levels: (i) continued work on education and environment; (ii) building on
recent fiduciary and analytical work; and (iii) responses to Government requests for
analytical and advisory activities (AAA) based on a collaborative process of setting priorities
through broad-based consultations. Lending is envisaged for two Development Policy Loans
(DPL) in support of the Government’s Education and Training Sector Improvement Program
(ETSIP) in the amount of $15 million over two years.
2.
The Bank is now finalizing a Country Economic Report, prepared jointly with the
Government, to identify binding constraints to achieving sustainable growth and reducing
poverty and inequality. Support also aims to strengthen poverty diagnosis and build macromicro simulation models that could analyze the macroeconomic, structural, and distributional
implications of alternative policies.
3.
As part of its AAA services the Bank carried out several diagnostic studies, including
a Foreign Investment Advisory Services/MIGA Study on Investment Incentives; an
Investment Climate Assessment; and a Financial Sector Assessment Program (jointly with
the Fund). The Bank is supporting Namibia’s endeavors toward good governance and zero
tolerance of corruption by assisting the Anti-Corruption Commission and other law
enforcement agencies through technical assistance and advice on spearheading the roll-out of
e-governance.
4.
A Country Environmental Analysis with a Public Environmental Expenditure Review
(CEA/PEER) now underway aims to help the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET)
review some of the main policy, institutional, and financing challenges it faces. The
CEA/PEER is an outcome of the dialogue between the World Bank and the Government of
Namibia about sustainable environmental management and complements the program funded
by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) comprising two active projects (on Integrated
Community-Based Ecosystem Management and Namibian Coast Conservation and
Management) and a small project being prepared to promote environmental sustainability
through improved land-use planning.
5.
Working in collaboration with the Fund under the Lipsky-Daboub Initiative, the Bank
is consulting with the Namibian authorities to strengthen management of natural resources
income.
6.
An IDF grant of US$499,000 to support the public-private partnership in the fight
against HIV/AIDS will close in March 2009. Further technical assistance is provided by the
Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET) on building the country’s
capacities to monitor and evaluate its interventions.
7.
IFC does not have an active portfolio at present, and no new MIGA projects have
been executed or are planned.

APPENDIX III
NAMIBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
While data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, staff analysis is
hampered by significant lags and revisions of key macroeconomic data. As one of
22 countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project
for Anglophone African Countries, the country has undertaken to use the GDDS as a
framework for the development of their national statistical systems. The country is
participating in the SDDS and the monetary and financial statistics modules of the
Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development
(DFID)). GDDS metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on December 19, 2002. Since then, metadata on central government debt were updated
in November 2003 while metadata for the financial and external sectors were updated in
May 2005.
Real sector
2.
The authorities revised the coverage of national accounts over the last three years, by
incorporating new mining activity and the value-added of companies operating in Export
Processing Zones (EPZs). As a result, real GDP growth in 2002 was revised upward by
4 percentage points, to 6¾ percent, while growth in 2003 remained broadly unchanged. The
authorities are in the process of updating the base year of the national accounts from 1995 to
2004. Such estimates will benefit from the 2004 Household Income and Expenditure Survey
(HIES), though there remains a paucity of reliable annual and quarterly source data. A
regional real sector expert covering Botswana, Mauritius and, Namibia was posted in
October 2007 for one year.
3.
In February 2005, the government introduced a nation-wide consumer price index to
replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of Windhoek. The new index is
available from January 2002.
4.
Data on the labor market, including labor force, employment, and wages are not
systematically collected, which impedes the analysis of labor market developments. The last
labor market survey was conducted in 2004.
Government finance
5.
Annual fiscal data on budgetary central government through 2003 are reported to
STA for publication in the 2007 GFS Yearbook and in IFS. The data, which are reported on a
cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some gaps in terms of
details. No data on outstanding debt are reported. The area department receives actual fiscal
data several months after the end of the fiscal year. No data on budget implementation during
the fiscal year are provided.

7

6.
Expenditure data of line ministries are not available in a timely manner after the end
of the fiscal year, and are also subject to frequent revisions; however, preliminary general
ledger data related to the 2005/06 fiscal year were received by the area department relatively
quickly following the end of the fiscal year, contrary to past practice. Overall, the system for
providing expenditure information needs to be strengthened, and preliminary information on
cash expenditures of ministries should be made available on a regular basis and more
quickly. In addition, the reconciliation of above-the-line fiscal data with financing data
should be conducted on a regular basis and more frequently.
Monetary accounts
7.
Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN) and the other depository
corporations (ODCs) are reported on a timely basis. Beginning in April 2002, data are based
on standardized report forms which accord with the concepts and definitions of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Although the consistency in inter-ODCs positions
as well as between the ODCs and BoN has improved substantially, the BoN continues
working on eliminating any remaining inconsistency. The October 2007 STA technical
assistance mission assisted BoN to expand monetary and financial statistics to cover the
Other Financial Corporations (OFCs).
External sector statistics
8.
Since 2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly
basis with a lag of one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial revisions. The
methodology underlying the balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual and is well documented. The international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled annually, but dissemination is subject to significant lags.
Through a series of three missions between January 2003 and May 2004, the Bank of
Namibia received Fund TA to improve the compilation of the capital and financial
transactions and IIP statistics. However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the
IIP and restate the IIP in a format that will allow for comparison with the balance of
payments statistics and also reporting to STA.

APPENDIX IV
Namibia: Fiscal Debt Sustainability

1.
Namibia’s public debt is low due to substantial fiscal consolidation over the last three
years. On a calendar-year basis, in 2006 public debt fell approximately 3¼ percentage points,
to 28½ percent of GDP, due in part to receipts from privatization of a telecommunications
firm. This decrease followed a 1¼ percentage point fall in 2005. On current projections, the
debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to 22½ percent in 2008 before rising gradually to the authorities’
target of 25 percent by 2012, as capital spending rises.
2.
The first panel of Table 1 corresponds to the baseline scenario underlying the
macroeconomic framework. It assumes the central government budget balance has a surplus
of 2¾ percent of GDP in 2007 before declining gradually to a 1¼ percent deficit by 2012.
Revenues decline by approximately 2½ percent of GDP over the period as customs union
(SACU) revenues decline. Declines in mining income are offset by increases in personal
income and VAT taxes. On the expenditure side, an increase of 1 percent of GDP in capital
spending in 2009 and 2010 and increased expenditures on goods and services causes total
expenditures to rise to 35 percent of GDP before falling back to 34½ percent by 2012. As a
result, public debt declines to 22½ percent of GDP in 2008 before stabilizing at the
authorities’ 25 percent target. Robust nominal GDP growth (projected to average 9 percent
over the period) also helps to keep the public debt-to-GDP ratio stable.
3.
Table 1 shows two additional scenarios. The first shows the fiscal outcome if real
GDP growth, real interest rates, and the primary balance are maintained at their historical
averages. In this case, because Namibia had substantial deficits in past years, the public debt
ratio would rise to approximately 33 percent of GDP by 2012. The second scenario shows the
outcome if the government maintains the 5 percent of GDP primary surplus estimated for
2007. In this case the public debt ratio rapidly declines to less than 5 percent of GDP by the
end of the forecast period.
4.
The bounds tests illustrate the vulnerability of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The results show that even with a half standard deviation shock to interest rates,
growth, or the exchange rate, the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain at or below 31 percent of
GDP.
5.
To date the authorities have shown thorough commitment to fiscal prudence and to
achieving their target public debt ratio of 25 percent of GDP. They have been helped in these
efforts by positive shocks to both SACU revenues and diamond production. At the same
time, they have been able to contain expenditures on personnel and goods and service and
public debt appears robust to most economic shocks.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On January 18, 2008 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Namibia.1
Background
Namibia’s real GDP has remained robust, broadly matching regional peers. For 2007, a modest
strengthening of real GDP growth in part reflects buoyant diamond production. Namibia’s
external current account surplus has risen to high levels in 2006 and 2007, reflecting strong
diamond exports, high global prices for other mineral exports, and large receipts from the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Namibia’s strengthened balance of payments
position has accommodated a doubling of its international reserves since 2005. Portfolio and
other capital investments abroad have also remained at high levels.
Inflation pressures intensified through the first half of 2007, reflecting increases in global food
prices. After rising 7.2 percent in the year to July 2007, inflation declined to 6.6 percent in the
year through October 2007. Consistent with Namibia’s currency peg to the rand, the Bank of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the January 18, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

Namibia has, except for the rate increase in December 2007, matched interest rate increases
by the South African Reserve Bank, with an increase of 350 basis points since early 2006.
Namibia’s exchange rate was broadly stable, in nominal effective terms, in 2007.
The fiscal balance moved into surplus in the fiscal year 2006/07 (ending March 31, 2007),
reflecting tight expenditure management and strong SACU receipts. Based on a further fiscal
surplus projected for 2007/08, public debt should fall below the government’s target ceiling of 25
percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management, which,
together with a favorable external environment, has led to robust economic growth, subdued
inflation, large current account surpluses, and a strengthened foreign reserve position. Directors
also welcomed the progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, while noting
that much remains to be done to lower the high unemployment and poverty rates and the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks.
Directors noted that the overall outlook for Namibia is positive. Potential downside risks arise
mainly from uncertainties regarding the global environment and slow progress in economic
diversification. In particular, the key mining sector is vulnerable to a deterioration in the terms of
trade. Directors also stressed that reforms to accelerate growth in the non-mineral sectors of the
economy will be crucial to reduce unemployment and poverty. They emphasized the importance
of further progress in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Directors encouraged the authorities
to take advantage of the current favorable economic climate to build the necessary political
support for key pending reforms.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg to the South African rand remains appropriate.
They stressed the importance for policy interest rate differentials with South Africa to be limited
to levels that do not destabilize capital flows or official reserves. Directors were of the view that,
despite large current account surpluses, there is no evidence of significant currency undervaluation.
Directors commended the authorities for their continuing sound fiscal policies. They welcomed
the decision to use part of the recent strong receipts from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) to reduce public debt through fiscal surpluses. Directors agreed that Namibia’s
strengthened fiscal position and the projected decline in public debt creates fiscal space for
additional expenditure to upgrade infrastructure. Directors stressed, however, that improved
expenditure prioritization is needed within the context of the new medium-term expenditure
framework. They noted that personnel expenditure remains high by regional standards, and
should be reduced in the context of a comprehensive reform of the civil service. Directors

3

underlined the importance of reducing risks to the budget through strengthened oversight of
public enterprises, and commended the approval of the State-Owned Enterprise Act while
urging quick action to bring the Act into effect.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen tax administration and increase
revenue collection from the non-mining sectors, noting the importance of maintaining fiscal
sustainability in light of the projected decline in SACU receipts over the medium term. Directors
attached high priority to strengthening the Inland Revenue Department, including by building its
audit capacity, establishing a large-taxpayers’ office, and improving administration of the value
added tax.
Directors welcomed the favorable performance of the financial sector and the progress in
strengthening regulatory oversight in line with FSAP recommendations. They encouraged
efforts to foster competition in the banking sector. Directors noted that the authorities’ intention
to require higher levels of domestic investment by the pension and insurance industries should
be carried out in a way that ensures that financial institutions can continue to invest safely and
productively in order to generate favorable returns for savers. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to implement any reforms to the regulatory regime cautiously, and to closely monitor
the financial sector impact while working to broaden the range of domestic investment options.
Directors placed particular emphasis on reforms to reduce unemployment and poverty. They
welcomed steps to strengthen labor relations through arbitration and conciliation services, and
the plans to promote labor productivity and upgrade civil service skills. They encouraged the
authorities to consider also further initiatives to liberalize the trade regime, improve the business
environment, and speed up education reform to rapidly narrow the skills gap. Directors
emphasized the importance of improving governance, and encouraged the authorities to join the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Namibia
and Ebson Uanguta, Advisor to Executive Director
January 18, 2008

The Namibian authorities appreciate the Fund’s engagement and support for their economic
program. They value the candid exchange of views with staff during the 2007 Article IV
Consultation. They find the staff report informative, well balanced and containing useful
analyses and advice on the country’s economic policies, challenges, and prospects.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS
The Namibian authorities have continued to maintain sound macroeconomic management,
which coupled with favorable external conditions, has sustained the economic growth in line
with that of its CMA/SACU regional partners. The economy recorded robust growth,
moderate inflation and strong external surpluses in 2006. Real GDP grew by 4.1 percent in
2006 led by growth in diamond, telecommunications, retail trade and financial sectors. GDP
in 2007 is projected to grow by around 4.0 percent, and is expected to hover around
4.5-5 percent in the medium-term, underpinned by continued strengthening of the nonmining sector, including tourism initiatives. Notwithstanding the good performance, key
downside risks to the economy include the possibility of a more rapid decline in onshore
diamond mining than projected and weather–related shocks to agricultural production.
Nevertheless, the authorities are ready to take suitable measures to address these challenges.
While inflation moderated at 5.1 percent during 2006, it increased in the beginning of the
first quarter of 2007 mainly due to high food prices. However, it declined to 6.6 percent in
October 2007 from a peak of 7.2 percent reached in July 2007, and is expected to moderate
to 6 percent in 2008, due in part to sustained tightening of monetary policy.
The external current account surplus rose to 15.9 percent of GDP in 2006 from 5.5 percent in
2005, due to strong export performance supported by high commodity prices, and significant
increase in SACU revenue inflows. The exchange rate has been stable in nominal effective
terms in the 12 months through September 2007, and real effective exchange rate in the first
nine months of 2007 was in line with the average for the preceding decade.
FISCAL POLICY
The country’s fiscal stance continues to remain prudent. Total revenue as a percent of GDP
rose from 31.5 percent in 2005 to 36.3 percent in 2007. Enhanced revenue is attributed to
mineral export taxes and SACU receipts that contributed to a fiscal surplus of 2.1 percent of
GDP in 2006/07. However, the fiscal surplus is projected to decline to about 1.1 percent of
GDP in 2007/08 fiscal year because of increased public spending to revamp key

2
infrastructure and reduce public debt. In this respect, public debt would be reduced to an
estimated 23 percent of GDP by mid-2008 from 28 percent in 2006/07. The authorities are
committed to improving spending priorities, increasing fiscal space, and further reducing
public debt.
The Namibian authorities are also committed to strengthening revenue collection. SACU
currently accounts for more than one-third of total revenue. Given the temporary nature of
SACU windfall/receipts, the authorities consider that a broad-based and effective domestic
tax system capable of generating increased revenue needs further consolidation.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are taking advantage of the favorable fiscal situation
to implement public expenditure reforms, aimed at accelerating growth and poverty
reduction. The authorities recognize that state-owned enterprises continue to drain budgetary
resources. In this regard, the adoption of the new SOE Governance Act, aimed at
strengthening corporate governance in these enterprises, is an important development in the
right direction. This would further strengthen SOE’s performance, reduce quasi-fiscal
activities and risks to the budget, and create more fiscal space. It is also important to note that
the wage bill has declined to 13 percent of GDP in 2006/07 from 15 percent three years ago.
MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
The authorities continue to be committed to the CMA arrangement as an appropriate
monetary framework. Within the CMA, the Namibian currency is pegged to the Rand (1:1),
and inflation and interest rates are aligned. While the country’s macroeconomic conditions
have been diverging in some instances from those of South Africa, the authorities still
consider CMA as an appropriate framework for ensuring medium to long run price stability.
The country’s level of reserves has reached a robust level, covers adequately short-term
external debt, and represents more than 3 months of imports cover. This is a significant
achievement for the country, thanks to improved export performance, better than expected
SACU receipts and the authorities’ strong commitment to fiscal consolidation.
FINANCIAL SECTOR
The financial sector is profitable and well capitalized. In line with the FSAP
recommendations, the authorities have taken steps to strengthen both banking and non-banks
financial institutions. Though the sector is well regulated, a number of refinements have been
issued recently, including amendments to the Banking Act mandating consolidated
supervision which is expected to be promulgated by mid-2008. Furthermore, progress has
been made towards risk-based supervision, with priority being given to on-site visits to
potentially higher risk financial institutions to strengthen the sector.
While access to Namibia financial system remains limited, significant progress has been
made over the past years to widen and deepen financial intermediation. To this end, banks

3
and other financial institutions are making efforts to reach out to poorer households and small
and medium-sized enterprises, including through innovative products like mobile banking,
merchant–serviced ATMs, smart cards, lower-fee savings accounts, and micro-lending
products that do not require collateral. Banks are also extending services to rural areas in the
wake of road and power infrastructure connections. One of the local commercial banks
established a smart partnership with the Post Savings Bank, which has widespread network in
the rural areas, as a strategy to improving access to banking services by rural households.
The preparation of the country’s financial sector charter that is under way and which is to be
launched in the first half of 2008, is expected to add more impetus to access and
intermediation efforts.
The authorities have strengthened anti-money laundering policies and enacted Financial
Intelligence Act in 2007. A financial intelligence center has been established within the
Central Bank of Namibia, and appropriate regulations would be finalized in due course. The
authorities are now at the level of identifying and analyzing training needs and the roles of
the respective government agencies in this undertaking.
STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES AND RISKS
The regulatory measures on domestic asset requirements, considered by the authorities, are
aimed at reducing the 35 percent of domestic qualifying assets for dual-listed companies
gradually over a five-year period. Even though Namibia has one of the highest gross national
savings rate in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of pension funds and long term insurance, the
country has not been able to fully benefit and utilize this capital for the much needed and
broad-based economic development. The funds continue to flow out of the country, via duallisted companies. In this regard, the regulatory measures being contemplated would tighten
domestic investment requirements for the dual-listed companies, with the view to
encouraging retention of these resources for domestic investment. The authorities, aware of
possible distortionary effect of the intended measures, have already started conducting
research on possible investment instruments, and are encouraging the development of
appropriate market based instruments. They are considering developing a framework for
monitoring the likely impact on financial sector risk and returns. As a strategy to broadening
the range of investment options, the authorities have been actively encouraging SOE with
financial soundness to consider issuing bonds in the local market.
Fostering employment growth in the non-mining sectors to reduce unemployment remains a
key priority of the Namibian authorities, who view economic diversification from the mineral
sector to non-mineral manufacturing, tourism and other services as a significant step in
reducing high unemployment. In this regard, they are committed to continue to create a
conducive environment and putting in place measures to increase competitiveness, through
improved skills and labor productivity. The government efforts of diversification have started

4
bearing fruits as reflected by a growing number of diamond cutting and polishing companies
established over the past 3 years.
Strengthening the health sector, in particular the fight against HIV/Aids pandemic, continues
to remain a priority of government. The decline in Namibia’s HIV prevalence rate from
22 percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2006, has largely been attributed to the National
Awareness Campaign run jointly by the government, private sector and international
agencies. The program of public provision of antiretroviral (ART) drugs launched in 2003
currently covers about 40,000 patients or about 70 percent of those who could benefit from
ART treatment. The improved fiscal space has enabled the authorities to allocate adequate
resources to this priority area.
The Namibian authorities continue to put in place measures to strengthen business
environment, including effective public services delivery. The World Bank’s Doing Business
2008 survey ranked Namibia 43 out of 178 countries, with the country rated positively by
business in a number of areas, including licensing framework and enforcing contracts. To
improve effectiveness and skill levels in the civil service, the authorities will be launching a
National Institute of Public Administration and Management in 2009. Measures to improve
the overall quality of education under the Government Education Sector Improvement
Programme (ETSIP), have been put in place.
The authorities have launched a Third National Development Plan, which serves as a key
framework for implementing the country’s development policies for sustained growth and
poverty reduction. They are also of the view that criteria for concessional borrowing
eligibility should be revisited to enable countries with high income inequality and widespread
poverty better access to these facilities. In the new NDP3, efforts are under way to implement
program-based budgeting to help improve accountability and help prioritize government
expenditures.
CONCLUSION
The Namibian authorities remain committed to implementing prudent and sound policies,
which they consider as key for accelerating growth, reducing unemployment and poverty.
The authorities appreciate and continue to rely on the Fund’s advice on areas of interest to
the country’s policy challenges, including better utilization of retained capital under
Regulation 28 and 151 to promote domestic investment. They also trust that the Fund and the
international community would support their request to be considered for concessional
borrowing, given the country’s high income inequality and widespread poverty.
1

Regulation 28 and 15 are provisions that allow Namibia to retain part of the Pension and Long term Insurance
Funds to be invested in the domestic assets.
