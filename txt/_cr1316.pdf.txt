STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 20, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Economic Environment. The economy continued to expand last year, albeit at a slower
pace than in previous years. Growth in FY2012 is estimated at 1.4 percent, down from 2–
2½ percent for FY2010–11 as recent construction projects are winding down. A modest
fiscal surplus of 1¼ percent is expected in FY2012 thanks to high fishing fee revenue.
Outlook and Risks. Economic growth will likely slow in the near term, as the private
sector falls short of offsetting a decline in public sector demand from scheduled Compact
grant reductions. While the fishery sector is expected to continue its healthy expansion,
lackluster wholesale and retail activities will remain a drag on private sector growth. Risks
to the outlook are on the downside, with spillovers from possible further deterioration of
global growth prospects and commodity price shocks outweighing upside risks from the
U.S. military base upgrading projects in Guam and an accelerated release of delayed
infrastructure grants.
Fiscal Sustainability. Achieving long-term budgetary self-reliance is becoming more
urgent as FY2023 approaches when the annual Compact grants are set to expire. Closing
the revenue gap would require a fiscal adjustment by 5–6½ percent of GDP over the
medium term, depending on the pace of adjustment. Planned comprehensive tax reforms
and expenditure cuts focusing on public wages would be major contributors to the
necessary adjustment. Public sector financial management should be strengthened in
tandem to safeguard benefits of fiscal reforms.
Private Sector Development. Weak private sector development continues to hold back
sustainable economic growth. Reforms to ease the cost of doing business are key to
boost potential growth and generate employment. The priorities should include further
liberalizing land use and lease, and streamlining procedures related to investment
permits both at national and state levels. The government should devise a nation-wide
development plan to guide these efforts, building on the momentum created by the first
Development Partners Forum held in the fall of 2012.
Financial Sector. The banking sector remains liquid, but contributes little to economic
growth. Given the recent pickup in consumer lending, credit quality should be carefully
monitored. The FSM Development Bank should be put under appropriate supervision
and re-directed to its intrinsic role of providing capital funds to viable start-ups rather
than directly competing with private banks over consumer loans.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a small Pacific Island country highly
dependent on external aid, mainly from the United States.1 A new Compact of Free Association
Agreement with the United States (“Compact”) effective since FY20042 continues to provide funding
for infrastructure expenditure and administrative expenses, but transfers to the FSM are steadily
declining and ceasing in FY2023. Thereafter, the FSM is expected to complement its domestic
revenues with income from its Compact Trust Fund (CTF) and other savings.
2.
The amended Compact has tightened rules on reporting, auditing, and the use of
grants, which were initially difficult for the national and state governments to meet. Although
infrastructure projects started to be implemented more smoothly in FY2009 as government agencies
adapted themselves to the new rules, about $44 million (15 percent of GDP) in infrastructure grants
remains unused, even excluding another $28 million (10 percent of GDP) that was returned to the
pool of funds after once approved either due to cancellation or less than estimated costs (Box 1). The
U.S. dollar is the official legal tender.
3.
The Article IV discussions focused on policies to ensure long-term sustainability
through strengthening fiscal management and promoting the private sector growth. The
scheduled expiry of Compact grants in FY2023 poses a major challenge to continuation of public
services at the current level. On the other hand, remoteness from major markets and the small scale
of the economy makes it difficult to attract foreign investors and retain skilled workers. Outward
migration continues to the United States where FSM citizens can work without a visa. In the absence
of monetary policy and given the large fiscal adjustment needed over the medium term, the
authorities have limited policy space to respond to external shocks. The government therefore needs
to proceed with fiscal and structural reforms to secure fiscal sustainability, boost potential growth of
the economy, and create sufficient policy space to dampen the effects of unforeseen developments.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Since the last Article IV consultation, the economy continued on a steady growth path.
Following a recession in FY2006–08 due to delays in Compact grants utilization as well as high fuel
and food prices, the FSM economy grew by 2–2½ percent for FY2010 and FY2011. The expansion
was driven by new construction activities, such as the airport renewal projects funded by the U.S.
Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), and by growth of the fishery sector helped by good fishing
conditions and high prices. The economy remains dependent on the large public sector (40 percent
of GDP, including public enterprises), although there are signs of a further growth pick up in the
fisheries and agriculture sectors. Inflation moderated from its FY2009 peak, and fluctuations are
1

The FSM (with a population of about 102,000) has four states—Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap, each with its
own executive and legislative bodies. Authority is highly decentralized, with state governments significantly
larger than the national authority.

The fiscal year runs from October to September (for example, FY2012 covers October 2011 to
September 2012).

largely driven by commodity prices (Box 2). After reaching 7.8 percent in FY2009, inflation has
declined to 4.6 percent in FY2011. However, the last quarter of 2011 recorded a 6.5 percent increase
(year-on-year) reflecting the rise in international food and fuel prices, which compose about
46 percent of the consumption basket. Increasing availability of consumer loans may have also
contributed to a pick-up in inflation in recent years (see paragraph 34).

5.
The overall fiscal balance of the consolidated government recorded modest surpluses
for three straight years through FY2011, with an uneven distribution of outcomes across
states. In FY2011, the overall consolidated fiscal balance was $1.9 million (0.6 percent of GDP) in
surplus, helped by economic growth and stabilizing public wages. While Chuuk and Yap turned in a
surplus in FY2011 with better revenue administration, Kosrae and Pohnpei each recorded deficits
equivalent to about 1 percent of state GDP.
6.
Public debt remains at a relatively low level, but underfunding in the CTF assets and
declining balance of the social security fund pose long-term challenges. Gross public debt is
relatively low at $87.1 million (below 30 percent of GDP) in FY2011, mostly owed to the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) on concessional terms. The size of public financial assets held in the CTF is
substantial at $257 million (83 percent of GDP) as of end-FY2012. However, asset accumulation in the
CTF is insufficient for the long-term budget self-reliance (see Appendix II). In addition, net assets of
the social security fund declined from $42.4 million in 2010 to $40.4 million in 2011 with benefit
payments still exceeding contribution revenue, continuing to raise concerns over the viability of the
system (see paragraph 21).
7.
Despite some deterioration of the current account balance (from -12 percent of GDP
for FY2006–8 to -18 percent for FY2009–11 on average), external balance is sustained by
a stable flow of official transfers. The majority of the overall current account deficit (18 percent of
GDP for FY2009–11) is financed through capital transfers from official sources (12 percent of GDP).
Given their contractual nature, they can be considered a stable source of funding. Similarly,
imbalances within the current account balance (a trade and services deficit of 61 percent of GDP) are
largely offset by a stable surplus in the income and transfer balances from Compact current grants
and remittances (43 percent of GDP). Given the dedicated official funding sources, the level of gross
international reserves (about 3½ months of imports) is not as much a critical indicator for the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

external sustainability as in other countries. The current account deficit widened in FY2011, with an
increase in exports (mainly fish) more than offset by that in imports driven by construction materials
and fuels. Visitor arrivals declined significantly in FY2011 to 20 percent below the FY2009 peak, while
higher inflation than in trading partners has kept the real effective exchange rate at an appreciated
level.
8.
Financial conditions have remained tight. There are large spreads between deposit rates
(around 1 percent) and loan rates (about 14 percent for consumer loans, about 7 percent for
commercial loans), partly reflecting high risks involved in lending in the FSM, given limited
availability of land as collateral. Commercial loan growth has been stagnant in recent years, while
consumer loans saw some pick up. The ratio of consumer loans to household income is relatively
high (about 24 percent in 2011).
9.
Economic growth will likely slow in the near term, as the private sector falls short of
offsetting the declining public sector demand from Compact grants reduction. Growth in
FY2012 is estimated at 1.4 percent as recent construction projects financed through FAA grants are
winding down. A modest consolidated fiscal surplus of 1¼ percent of GDP is expected in FY2012,
mainly due to a sharp increase in fishing access fee revenue by $7.6 million (2½ percent of GDP).
While the fishery sector is expected to continue its healthy expansion, lackluster wholesale and retail
activities will remain a drag on the private sector growth.
10.
Beyond the near-term, growth is weighed down by the scheduled reduction in
Compact grants. In addition, the 2010 census shows that the population has been shrinking, and
significant outward migration continues despite the reasonably good economic performance in
recent years. Staff expects growth to stay low at about ½ percent over the medium term, with limited
private sector growth failing to offset the effects of a decline in Compact sector grants ($0.8 million
per annum before adjusting for inflation).
11.
Risks to the outlook are on the downside (see Appendix I, Figures and Tables). While
there are certain upside risks from the U.S. military base upgrading projects in Guam (more demand
for the FSM workers, goods and services) and possible acceleration in release of delayed
infrastructure grants, larger risks are that further deterioration in the external environment and
volatile commodity prices hold back growth, leading to further delays in fiscal adjustment, and thus
elevating concerns over fiscal sustainability. Long-term risks include failure to fully prepare for the
expiry of the Compact grants, continued outward migration of working age population, and climate
change and the associated shore erosion of limited farmland. In order to better prepare for growth
shock, strengthening the fiscal policy space should be explored (see paragraph 17). In the event
exogenous shocks materialized, fiscal adjustment toward self-sufficiency could be temporarily eased
or suspended as long as the medium-term target is maintained. To mitigate the impact of
commodity price shock, possible long term measures to be considered include promoting domestic
food supply through commercial farming (see Box 2).
Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities generally agreed with staff projections for the FSM economy. They
shared the view that medium–term growth prospects are diminished as a result of declining

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

Compact grants, and the private sector does not have enough strength to compensate for it. They
also agreed that risks to the outlook are on the downside, citing among others the vulnerability of
the economy to commodity price shocks.
13.
On fishing activities, the authorities acknowledged that, while fishing fees provide
a valuable source of additional revenue for the public finance, it does not generate sufficient
employment and income for the private sector in the FSM.

adjustment.
15.
A new high-level initiative on achieving long-term sustainability provides an
opportunity to thoroughly review the direction of policies. President Mori announced in March
2012 his intention to establish the “2023 Planning Committee” (the Committee) to undertake an
assessment of the financial situation of the FSM in FY2024 onwards and develop a realistic action
plan for addressing the looming budgetary shortfall, though it is unclear when Congress will approve
the appropriation of budget for the establishment of the committee. In the draft FY2013 budget, the
President proposed to contribute $1 million to the CTF, but Congress did not approve such
allocation.
16.
There is considerable risk that the CTF would not reach the necessary level for selfsufficiency. Both the national and states government should agree to realistic plans of reform and
start implementing them as soon as possible. In this light, approval of the budget for establishment
of the 2023 Planning Committee is urgently needed.
17.
The following four points should serve as the guiding principles for the Committee to
meet its objectives of developing a credible long-term fiscal strategy.
 Develop a realistic macroeconomic framework. Budget documents should cover the general
government (include contingent liabilities from public enterprises or social security fund), and
long-term fiscal projections should use conservative assumptions on growth and asset returns
while providing an appropriate expenditure trajectory. The IMF stands ready to share its long-

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

term fiscal projection framework to assist the government in preparation of their own
projections.
 Devise a balanced fiscal adjustment path. The adjustment path should strike an appropriate
balance between the need to preserve assets for future generation, current developments needs
(for instance for infrastructure), and short-term growth implications of fiscal reforms.
Based on a 6 percent rate of return assumed in an earlier GAO study, achieving budgetary selfsufficiency requires financial assets in the CTF of $1.1 billion in FY2023 (in FY2011 prices). This
level could be achieved by increasing fiscal surplus to about 6.4 percent of GDP by FY2016, and
then maintaining the surplus at that level until FY2023. Alternatively, to soften the growth impact
the government could accumulate fiscal surpluses more gradually over a longer period; but this
would require a higher overall fiscal surplus target and leave a shorter time to re-adjust the fiscal
trajectory in the event of setbacks (see Appendix II); the longer adjustment would also pose
a higher risk of reform fatigue. Regardless of the chosen path, the considerable growth impact of
fiscal consolidation would need to be partly offset by accelerating structural reforms (see section
C below).
 Build in policy buffers. Given the long implementation period, the absence of monetary policy,
and the susceptibility of the economy and the poor to external shocks, the FSM needs to build
fiscal policy space for the resilience of its medium-term plan. Possible policy actions include
allocating part of expenditures to fund an emergency transfer program. In designing these
arrangements, however, care should be taken that they do not undermine the long-term fiscal
consolidation efforts, possibly by requiring that the amount should be recovered by other
savings within a limited length of years once the temporary shocks subsided.
 Secure buy-in of the public and state governments. The long-term fiscal consolidation cannot be
carried out and sustained without broad public support. In addition, given the significant size of
state governments in the FSM, their contributions to the fiscal adjustment are essential. It is thus
imperative for the national government to engage these stakeholders into the discussion of
needed fiscal reforms. From this viewpoint, the continuous enhancement of audits and the
reflection of their results in fiscal management are also important.
Approval of a long-term fiscal reform plan should be the key deliverable of the Committee.

fully comparable and drastic cuts in public wages may risk accelerating outward migration, regional
comparison of public wages (see text chart) suggests that there is room for reducing them as share
of GDP without having too negative effect on the economy. Governance control by the government
over compensation of public enterprises should be strengthened to ensure their wage level is
justifiable from the viewpoint of job requirement.
19.
In parallel, the planned comprehensive tax reform should be swiftly implemented.
Enhancing revenue is imperative to put public finances on a more sustainable path. A set of bills to
create the Unified Revenue Authority (URA) and to introduce a net profits tax (effective October
2013) and a value added tax (effective October 2014) in lieu of gross revenue and state sales taxes
were approved by the national government as well as two out of the four state governments, but will
not take effect until they are approved by all states. This reform will remove the bias against
industries with relatively high fixed costs and distortions from different tax rates across goods and
services, making the FSM tax system more efficient. Given the urgency of the tax reform, the national
government should step up its efforts to engage state governments and the general public for swift
consideration of the tax reform bill in the remaining states. Further efforts to strengthen the tax
administration through staff training and upgrading of the IT system will also be necessary.
20.
To complement and safeguard the benefits of expenditure and tax reforms, it is
essential to improve public sector financial management. Ongoing efforts to strengthen financial
management with support from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) should be
accelerated in this respect: budget documents should reflect activities of the general government
financed by domestic revenues and foreign grants as well as those of state governments. The
mission also encourages the authorities to devise a fiscal rule requiring fiscal surpluses to be
transferred to the CTF. Under the current system, fiscal surpluses in one year can be appropriated to
finance next year’s expenditure. Given the nature of the FSM as federated states, the long-term fiscal
consolidation also requires strengthening the fiscal discipline at state level to contain expenditures,
including through tighter fiscal rules on their use of the expenditure carry-over between annual
budgets.
21.
The social security system of the FSM remains in a challenging financial situation. It is
financed by employer/employee contributions at a rate of 7 percent each paid to the system and
funds benefit payments for the old-age, surviving

system into long-term sustainability. Given that it will take time to carry out comprehensive reforms,
contributions from the general budget will likely be needed to protect the value of the social security
fund.
22.
Public enterprises pose another important fiscal risk. They have significant economic
presence accounting for 8.6 percent of GDP. Though budget transfers to public enterprises are
currently limited, utilities and other public service providers pose considerable contingent liabilities
for public finances in the event of a deterioration of their financial positions. It is therefore critical to
strengthen the oversight and accountability of public enterprises, in particular in electricity and
telecommunication, which are critical services for private sector development.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities did not specify a preferred pace of fiscal adjustment, partly because it
did not want to preempt discussions in the 2023 Planning Committee. The government is
currently considering expenditure cuts of 6 percent every three years, totaling around 20 percent, to
accommodate the scheduled reduction in Compact grants. However, the authorities were willing to
also review the staff’s fiscal adjustment plan at the Committee including a more comprehensive
reforms, not least because it appears difficult to protect critical public services in areas, such as
health and education, under the current expenditure cut plan.
24.
The authorities agreed on the need to contain the growth of wage expenditure.
However, they noted that public and private sector wages are not necessarily comparable given
different levels of competence and skill that are required. Staff reiterated that the aggregate public
sector wages in the FSM are notably high as share of GDP among the regional peers.
25.
Regarding policy buffer against external shocks, the authorities pointed out that they
have a separate trust fund from the CTF whose assets are accumulated against the risk of natural
disasters. They admitted, however, that use of those assets was limited to the purpose of disaster
relief and available other funds were not sufficient to mitigate other costs, such as commodity price
shocks.
26.
The authorities agreed on the need for social security reform. With an increase in the
contribution rate (from 7 percent to 7.5 percent) scheduled in January 2013, however, there are no
immediate plans for improving the social security fund balance. For the time being, they will explore
options for comprehensive reforms while continuing support from the general budget.
27.
On public enterprises, the authorities pointed to the fact that operational subsidies
from the government to public enterprises have been significantly reduced over the past several
years. While there remain some capital subsidies, they argued, those are primarily used to support
provision of essential services by public enterprises.

29.
Despite the real appreciation, the risks to external stability are currently limited. The
large current account deficit is financed through foreign assistance. Compact-related financial flows
are the main determinant of external balances and will continue to provide a stable source of
funding over the next decade, while external debt is expected to decline in terms of GDP. It should
be kept in mind, however, that fiscal and structural reforms are essential for securing external
stability after the expiry of Compact grants. The use of the U.S. dollar as the official currency is
appropriate given the small size of the economy and its close financial and trade linkages with the
United States.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment on the external stability and the real
exchange rate. They highlighted, however, the tendency of the price level in the FSM to keep
elevated even after international food and fuel prices have stabilized. They also highlighted the
limited policy options available to respond to such price shocks while agreeing that use of the U.S.
dollar as the domestic currency remains appropriate for the FSM given its limited administrative
capacity for independent monetary and exchange rate policies.

C. Private Sector
31.
Sustainable growth will require a vibrant private sector. The structure of the FSM
economy has changed little over the last decade—the share of the public sector stands at
38 percent, the private sector at 22 percent, and the household at 31 percent. The key bottlenecks
for private sector development include difficulties in obtaining secure long-term land leases, reliance
on a single carrier operating high-priced flights, poor infrastructure, and lack of skilled labor.
Moreover, some public enterprises crowd out precious financial and human resources from other
sectors of the country, and constrain productivity growth of the entire economy through inefficient
or costly services. While some key infrastructure projects are underway, the government could
further support private sector growth by accelerating infrastructure investments and providing a
more business-friendly environment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

32.
Reforms to attract inward FDI could have an immediate impact on activity as part of an
overall development strategy. Given the FSM’s competitive advantage in some niche tourism
markets, a more focused approach on improving inward FDI in these areas could generate
immediate benefits. In particular, addressing issues regarding obtaining longer-term land leases and
burdensome procedures of approval for foreign investment would help facilitate tourism FDI. Other
measures to improve business environment include: committing long-term government support for
the College of the FSM in training future workers; keeping public wages in check to reduce the large
public-private sector wage gap; and advancing the public enterprises reform to encourage new
entrants for more competition in the provision of infrastructure services including through increasing
private sector participation in public enterprises, where feasible. The FSM’s first Development
Partners Forum, held in early November to discuss economic and development challenges for the
FSM, provided an excellent opportunity for representatives from national and local governments,
private sector, civil society and international partners to sit together and explore possible paths to
the future growth. It is essential to keep the momentum going and ensure the forum is followed by
concrete action plans with strong engagement by stakeholders.

The authorities shared the staff’s view that the FSM business environment remains very
challenging. They cited land issue as the most difficult impediment to investment from outside, as it
is so intricately connected to people’s perception of inheritance and community. Also, some foreign
investors do not appear to appreciate the size and culture of local economy and tend to plan
unrealistically large projects, only to trigger strong oppositions and concerns from traditional
communities and civil societies. Nonetheless, the authorities see potential in areas, such as fisheries,
agriculture (niche tropical products) and eco-tourism, and are striving to improve transportation
access to and from other Pacific countries as well as more populous countries in Asia. They stressed
the importance of advancing these efforts in tandem with upgrading the core infrastructure.

D. Financial Sector
34.
The banking sector is well capitalized and with sufficient liquidity, but renders little
support to the private sector with a low loan-to-deposit ratio (33 percent at end-FY2011).
While deposits are steadily increasing over the past three years, majority of them are invested by
banks in safe financial assets overseas rather than being lent to the private sector, apparently due to
lack of bankable projects. The introduction of the Secured Transactions Act in 2006 has facilitated
taking movable property as collateral and did help banks to extend loans to those customers they
would not have been able to lend to before, but it has not so far led to boosting commercial lending.
Further legislative measures to facilitate taking immovable property as collateral are necessary to
increase commercial lending. Increasing availability of consumer loans may have contributed to
a pick-up in inflation in recent years, and while NPLs remain relatively low at just over 3½ percent,
careful monitoring of credit quality is warranted.
35.
The FSM Development Bank continues to be engaged in consumer lending. While the
main focus of the bank stipulated in the law is to provide loans for high priority projects, it continues
to provide consumer loans in direct competition with private banks. The Development Bank should

strengthening the regulatory and supervisory

Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities confirmed that staff’s assessment of financial sector stability is
consistent with their own views. In order to strengthen its supervision of the broader financial
sector, the FSM banking commission is preparing a draft bill on regulation and supervision of credit
unions. While they generally support placing the FSM Development Bank under appropriate
supervision, they cautioned that it would call for significant political decision to realize such policy
change.

E. Other Issues
37.
Improving the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of economic statistics would better
guide policies. Staff notes ongoing efforts by the Office of Statistics, Budget and Economic
Management, Overseas Development Assistance, and Compact Management (SBOC) to improve
data collection and management, including efforts to release quarterly CPI data and upgrade its
website. The authorities are encouraged to further enrich statistics and use them for policy-making.
In particular, it is crucial to collect and consolidate fiscal data across national and state governments
in a timely manner.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Medium-term growth prospects in the FSM remain weak as sluggish private sector
growth is insufficient to offset the scheduled decline in Compact grants. While ongoing
construction projects and a further expansion of the fisheries sector will render some support to
growth in the near term, risks to the outlook are on the downside. Medium-term prospects are
weighed down by the reduction of Compact grants and weak private sector.
39.
Risks to external stability are currently limited. The external balance is sustained by
a stable flow of official transfers. It should be noted, however, that failure to address challenge of
Compact grants expiry in FY2023 would cause difficulty in financing external deficit as well. The use

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

of the U.S. dollar as the official currency remains appropriate given the small size of the economy
and its close financial and trade linkages with the United States.
40.
There is considerable risk that the CTF would not reach the necessary level for selfsufficiency. Both the national and states government should agree to realistic plans of reform and
start implementing them as soon as possible. In this light, approval of the budget for establishment
of the 2023 Planning Committee is urgently needed.
41.
The government needs to prepare and adopt a credible fiscal strategy to deal with the
looming revenue gap in FY2023. The guiding principles should be: (i) a realistic macroeconomic
framework; (ii) a balanced fiscal adjustment path; (iii) policy buffers to guard against possible shocks;
and, (iv) broad buy-in by the public and state governments.
42.
To secure fiscal sustainability substantial fiscal reforms are needed. Passage of the
planned comprehensive tax reform should be accelerated with increasing efforts of engaging state
governments and the general public to garner their support. In addition to savings from improved
operational efficiency of overall government expenditure, public sector wage growth should be
curtailed.
43.
Public sector financial management should be strengthened to complement and
safeguard the benefits of fiscal reforms. Staff encourages the authorities to devise a fiscal rule
requiring fiscal surpluses to be transferred to the CTF.
44.
Underfunding of the social security fund poses another sustainability concern. While
recognizing the recent efforts to reduce the imbalance through increasing the social security tax
rates, the authorities are urged to prepare further comprehensive measures including on the system
design to protect the value of the social security fund.
45.
Advancing structural reforms to facilitate investment by both domestic and foreign
investors is critical in order to minimize the possible growth impact from expected fiscal
reforms. In addition to further liberalizing land use and lease, streamlining procedures related to
investment permits both at the national and state level will help. Reforming of public enterprises
should also contribute to higher productivity through better use of financial and human resources.
These structural reforms should be pursued through setting a clear nation-wide development plan in
line with the Development Strategy adopted in the first Development Partners Forum.
46.
The financial system is stable, but should lend more support to private sector
development. Though the banking sector remains well capitalized and sufficiently liquid, its credit
quality warrants careful monitoring as consumer loans increase. The FSM Development Bank should
be brought under appropriate supervision and redirected to help financing the viable start-ups
rather than directly competing with private banks over consumer loans.
47.

It recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24 month cycle.

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

Box 1. Micronesia: Fiscal Arrangements and Operational Challenges in
Compact Grants Utilization1
1. Overview of the FSM fiscal structure.
Most of service delivery functions (for example, health and education) are assigned to the State
Governments, and they are financed through a combination of fiscal transfers from the National
Government and the States’ share in domestically generated revenue. Unit costing data that would allow for
an assessment of the link between functional assignments and financing arrangements are not available.
The key sources of these fiscal transfers to the state governments are the Compact Sector Grants, the
Compact Infrastructure Grant, the Compact Supplemental Education Grant, and grants made available
through the Federal Program, all of which are made available by the United States. At the aggregate level,
these grants make up for over 60 percent of total allocations; the balance is made up mainly by the FSM
General Fund (comprising domestic tax and non-tax revenue). The majority of the Compact sector grants
(85 percent) and the Compact Infrastructure Grant (75 percent) is earmarked for operational and investment
support for the education and health sectors.
Over 90 percent of the Compact Funds are allocated to the State Governments, while the National
Government receives 67 percent of the Domestic Funds and roughly half of the U.S. Federal Grants and
other external assistance. The table below provides an overview of submitted budget allocations for FY2013,
broken down by type of transfer or revenue sharing arrangement.
2. Challenges in Compact grants utilization.
There are several possible causes for delay in Compact grants utilization:
a. Mismatches in budget calendar
Information on the Compact grants available for the next fiscal year is typically conveyed to state
governments 4–5 months into the current fiscal year. State legislatures typically approve the state
budgets in September (end of FY), leaving little time for coordination with national and other state
governments.
b. Weak monitoring and management of projects
Infrastructure projects are centrally managed at Project Management Unit of the national government,
but it is often a challenge to keep most updated information about prospects, estimated costs, and
progress of individual projects in all four states.
c. Lack of timely data available on fiscal activities of national and state governments
Data on fiscal activities of national and state governments in the ongoing year are not available in a
timely manner, making it hard to grasp the current status of consolidated government activities.
Although the financial statements of the national government are submitted for audit within 6 months
from the end of fiscal year, coordination and reallocation between national and state governments
during the fiscal year is very difficult.
d. Coordination problems on the allocation of infrastructure grants across state governments
As the cost of infrastructure projects in individual states, such as the building of roads or power stations
are large relative to the size of the state, reaching agreement on the allocation of funds is politically
difficult given the limited economic spillovers to other states due to the large geographic distance
between the states.
The opportunity costs associated with delay and under-utilization of Compact grants are substantial, and
overcoming these impediments could lead to significant economic and efficiency gains.

Box 2. Micronesia: The Challenge of Commodity Price Volatility on Inflation
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), as many other Pacific Islands countries, relies heavily on imports to
support domestic consumption. The country imported goods equivalent to 60 percent of GDP in 2011, with combined
share of food and fuels just slightly below half of total imports. The share of imported goods and services in FSM’s CPI

During the first wave of world commodity price increases
during 2005–08, domestic inflation remained relatively muted
between 4–5 percent, compared to 3–4 percent in the United
States, thanks to limited impact of fuel prices on inflation and
switching to lower-quality imports. However, inflation rose
sharply to above 10 percent starting late 2008 after a shock in
world prices of rice, the main staple food in the country, before
subsiding at the end of 2009. Domestic prices started to edge
up again in early 2010 as world commodity prices resumed
upward trend and domestic demand improved.

1999q4

Changes in global food and oil prices are passed through at
different speeds and patterns. Based on a VAR analysis of
world oil and food prices on FSM’s price index, we find that
changes on global commodity prices, with some lags, have
direct short-term impacts on domestic inflation. Oil prices
shocks are only partially passed-through with a lag of one
quarter. Due to the retail pricing scheme of FSM Petroleum

Looking forward, as the world commodity prices are expected to remain elevated and volatile, direct pass-through
would potentially worsen the external positions and real incomes of the poor.1 In order to better prepare against large
commodity prices shocks, long-term measures to mitigate the price volatility impacts should be considered, including
promoting domestic food supply through commercial farming, redesigning utility price scheme for slower fuel price passthough while avoiding undue burden on public finance, and allowing more competition in importing businesses.

According to a recent study by Sheridan, Tumbarello and Wu (IMF Working Paper WP/12/154 – June 2012), real oil price shocks
also have a large impact on Micronesia GDP in the short term, as 10-percent increase in oil prices lowering GDP growth by
0.08 percent.

APPENDIX II. MICRONESIA—LONG-TERM FISCAL
SUSTAINABILITY
This appendix assesses the FSM’s long-term fiscal sustainability, updating the estimates in the
2010 Article IV consultation. The analysis considers implications of the expected expiry of annual
Compact grants on the fiscal sustainability of the FSM and possible policy options to address the
challenge. Fiscal sustainability is considered achieved if the government’s financial asset level at
end-FY2023 would generate an investment income large enough to replace expiring Compact
grants without significantly disrupting public services and eroding the value of the Compact Trust
Fund (CTF).1
The CTF has exhibited a volatile investment performance over FY2008–12. For FY2008–09, net
return on assets was negative by a cumulative 17 percent, substantially eroding the market value of
the CTF. Over the period of FY2010–12, the average annual rate of return improved to about
7½ percent in line with improved financial market conditions, bringing the value of the CTF to
$257 million as of end-FY2012. As of end-FY2012, financial assets of the CTF are invested into U.S.
equity (30 percent), non-U.S. equity (30 percent), fixed income investment (22 percent), real estate
(7 percent), hedge fund (4 percent), and private equity (8 percent).
Prospects for achieving long-term fiscal sustainability are assessed by presenting several
adjustment scenarios against the baseline. The baseline scenario features limited fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms, while alternative scenarios consider comprehensive reforms,
including implementation of tax and expenditure reforms as well as structural reforms. Throughout
all scenarios, net investment returns on the CTF assets are assumed to be 6 percent, in line with an
earlier GAO study.
1.

Baseline Scenario

The baseline scenario assumes that small medium-term fiscal surplus (around ½ percent of GDP),
similar to those in recent years, will continue over the medium term, as expenditure adjusts to the
declining Compact grants. Medium-term real growth is expected to be low at about ½ percent,
reflecting sluggish investment, continued outmigration, and low productivity growth.
Under the baseline, the CTF would not generate sufficient investment income to replace the
annual Compact grants expiring in FY2023. By end-FY2023, the stock of financial assets would be
about $840 million (in FY2011 dollars), of which $770 million would be in the CTF and about
$70 million in other funds.23 During the drawdown phase beginning FY2024, investment income
would be about $50 million per year compared to $66 million of expiring Compact grants in FY2024,

1

The Compact Trust Fund for the FSM was created to contribute to the long-term budgetary self-reliance of the FSM
and to provide the FSM government with an ongoing source of revenue after FY2023. The amended Compacts and
their subsidiary agreements contain no commitments, either express or implied, regarding the level of the revenue
that will be generated by the trust fund, nor is there any commitment regarding the degree to which the revenue will
contribute to the long-term budgetary self-reliance of the FSM.

All the amounts in this appendix are based on FY2011 prices, unless otherwise stated.

Government reserves in various funds are assumed to be invested and contribute to closing the revenue gap.

leaving a shortfall of about 5 percent of FY2011 GDP.4 With no firm commitment of grants beyond
FY2023 and lack of vibrant private sector activity, the government would be forced to either sharply
tighten the budget or rapidly deplete its accumulated savings.
Higher investment returns could narrow the shortfall, but simply relying on high returns over
a long horizon is not recommended. To generate sufficient investment income to offset the
expiring Compact grants, the net investment returns would need to remain at 7.2 percent per year
until FY2023. While the CTF has recorded high investment returns in several years, given the high
volatility in its performance, it is not advisable to expect as the baseline continuation of such high
investment returns over a long period.
2.

Policy Adjustment Scenarios

Fiscal sustainability can be achieved through significant fiscal adjustments and structural
reforms to promote private-sector growth. In policy adjustment scenarios, the government would
accumulate savings by fortifying the recent fiscal surplus through comprehensive tax reform and
cuts in wasteful current expenditures. According to the PFTAC preliminary estimates, the planned tax
reform could improve tax revenue by about 4 percent of GDP. In parallel, it is assumed as in the
previous report that structural reforms (e.g., improved education, and other development needs)
and accelerated utilization of infrastructure grants will boost potential growth to about 2½ percent
in the medium term despite fiscal consolidation.
i)

Swift adjustment scenario

Model simulations indicate that long-term
fiscal sustainability would be achieved by
gradually increasing fiscal surpluses by about
1¼ percent of GDP per annum for four years
to reach 6.4 percent of GDP in FY2016, and
maintaining that level until FY2023. The budget
would need to run a surplus sufficient to keep
the real value of the fund after FY2023.

stock of government assets (including
cumulative earnings from these fiscal surpluses) would reach about $1.1 billion by the end of the
Compact period in FY2023, thus generating sufficient income to offset the expiring Compact grants.
The required fiscal adjustment is higher than that in the 2010 Article IV Staff Report by about
½ percent of GDP, which reflects a shorter accumulation period until FY2023 (see text charts).
Given the federated system of the FSM, where fiscal surplus of each state belongs to itself, all
states need to accumulate their own fiscal surpluses and contribute to closing the revenue gap.

The shortfall would be even larger at about 10 percent of GDP if the Supplemental Education Grants (SEG) is
discontinued after FY2023.

Gradual Adjustment Scenario

Alternatively, the government could accumulate fiscal surpluses more gradually over a longer
period than the swift adjustment scenario. A higher overall level of fiscal surplus would however be
required given the slower accumulation process of assets until FY2023. To illustrate this point the
scenario assumes an adjustment over eight years rather than four years. Fiscal surpluses would need
to be increased by 0.8 percent of GDP per annum until they reach 7.8 percent of GDP in FY2020, and
then maintained at that level until FY2023. The expected amount of the CTF assets in FY2023 is the
same as under the swift adjustment scenario.

Risk Analysis

Delays in implementing fiscal reforms would
increase the required adjustments. If the
implementation of fiscal reforms under the swift
adjustment scenario is delayed by one year, the
medium term fiscal surplus required to achieve the
sustainability would be 7.0 percent of GDP, higher
by 0.6 percentage points, thus requiring even more
challenging adjustments (see text chart).

In addition, if the growth is assumed to be 1½ percent, rather than 2½ percent, the required
fiscal surplus in FY2016 under the swift adjustment scenario would be 6.7 percent of GDP, higher by
0.3 percentage points. If the net investment return is assumed to be 5 percent, rather than 6 percent,
the required fiscal surplus in FY2016 under the swift adjustment scenario would be 12.0 percent of
GDP, bringing the total adjustment needed to about twice that under the initial assumption. These
sensitivity analyses underline the importance of swiftly implementing reforms and building policy
buffers.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
GROUP (OR BANK-FUND COLLABORATION)
The Bank and the Fund country teams maintain a close working relationship and have an ongoing
dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
The teams agreed that FSM’s main macroeconomic challenges are to increase budgetary selfreliance—as Compact support is due to expire in FY2023, while enhancing the prospects for private
sector development. To achieve these goals, FSM needs to undertake sustainable fiscal reform, while
improving the overall business environment.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural reform areas as
macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and sustained growth:
(i)
Comprehensive revenue reform. Sales and income taxes collected by the FSM government are
below that of other Pacific Island countries. Enhancing revenues is one avenue towards achieving
a more sustainable path for public finance. Although progress has been made over the past 2 years,
the government’s tax reform package - which includes the introduction of a VAT and a net profits
tax, and establishment of the Unified Revenue Authority (URA) - has yet to pass the Congress. The
successful tax reform would also benefit the private sector by improving efficiency. Reform of the
public financial management should proceed in tandem to complement and protect the benefits of
fiscal reforms.
(ii)
Reform of the public enterprises. Public enterprises pose a burden on FSM’s budget, while
possibly crowding out private firms. They pay higher wages than in the private sector and in
government agencies, receive subsidized government loans, and are not subject to the gross
revenue tax. The government has taken some steps, including the shutdown of insolvent enterprises
such as the National Fisheries Corporation, but more could be done.
(iii)
Financial sector reform. Commercial banks are cautious to lend to local businesses despite
their ample liquidity. Part of the reason is the inherent risk of start-up lending, the high fixed costs
associated with small loans, and the difficulties in collecting on collateral. Moreover, the FSM
Development Bank continues to lend to well-established firms and consumers, rather than
supporting start-ups. To improve access to credit, it is necessary to redirect the focus of the FSM
Development Bank, expand micro-credit through credit unions and micro-credit agencies while
ensuring their supervision, and improve the functioning of the secured transaction framework.
(iv)
Reform of the statistical system. Limited domestic capacity to produce economic data
prevents understanding of the contribution to the economy of sectors as tourism, fisheries and
agriculture, making difficult timely policy response to any shocks to those sectors. Strengthening the
statistical capacity is macro-critical, because timely and reliable provision of data is required to assess
the economic conditions appropriately and to make necessary policy decisions accordingly.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Appendix I details the specific
activities planned by the two country teams over the period October 2012 – September 2013 along
with their expected deliveries. The Bank has reclassified FSM from an IBRD to an IDA-eligible country
in 2011. This reclassification will have implications for the Bank’s potential lending program and the
relevant outcomes of discussions with the government will be shared with the Fund team.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (ASDB)
The Federated States of Micronesia became a member of the AsDB in 1990, and has received
a substantial amount of assistance since that time. As at December 2011, the FSM has received eight
1
loans, 1 grant, and 43 TA grants.
The AsDB has assisted the FSM by (i) supporting infrastructure development; (ii) supporting public
sector management, with a particular focus on economic management and accountability;
(iii) ensuring inclusive social development; and (iv) promoting sustained private sector-led economic
growth. The approach of the ADB has been to focus on a few key constraints: careful analysis of the
political economy; a preparedness to closely manage and support operations; a move away from
complex federally administered and state delivered multistate and multi-sector projects; adoption of
home grown solutions; and simple and realistic project outcomes.
Under AsDB’s country operations business plan for 2013-2015, which is currently under discussion
with the authorities, support will be formulated in the context of the “Action Plan 2023” and the
“Development Framework”, as presented at the recent FSM Development Partners Forum. Attention
will be given to supporting infrastructure development, especially power sector development and
transport. Key pipeline initiatives include the Yap Renewable Energy Project, the Pohnpei Energy
Sector project and the Pohnpei Port Development project. AsDB will also support a long term, and
well-coordinated approach to strengthening public financial management, including through
a recently approved technical assistance to develop capacity for sector investment planning in
infrastructure. Further, AsDB will provide capacity development support to the education sector, in
close coordination with the financial support provided from Compact. Finally, AsDB is discussing
a “binding constraints assessment” in the tourism sector.
Currently there are two active loans. The Omnibus Infrastructure Development project loans (totaling
$19m), approved in 2004, are designed to enhance public health, environmental quality, and surface
water quality through improved wastewater infrastructure and management for Pohnpei and
improved delivery of water services and expanded water supply systems for Yap and Kosrae; and
improved management and provision of power in Chuuk.
AsDB’s non-lending program has focused on improving public sector efficiency, effectiveness, and
accountability, as well as raising public awareness through community consultation and participation
programs, particularly in Chuuk and Kosrae. Further Technical assistance will be provided to provide
for capacity building in project management and procurement processes to support infrastructure
development.

The eight loans are for: (i) fisheries development; (ii) law, economic management and public policy;
(ii) water supply and sanitation; (iv) basic social services; and (v) private sector development. No loans to
FSM in 2008–10.

ANNEX IV. RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)—COUNTRY
STRATEGY 2012–14
Background
FSM has rebounded well from the global economic crisis but needs to take continued action to
safeguard long term fiscal sustainability. The economic recovery is expected to continue in the
near term supported by ongoing construction activities and expansion of the fisheries sector, but
faces headwinds over the medium-term from the scheduled declines in Compact sector grants.
Continued efforts to advance tax reforms, targeted expenditure cuts, and structural reforms to
nourish private sector growth are essential to secure long-term fiscal and economic sustainability.
FSM has been a moderate user of PFTAC Technical Assistance (TA). The most significant input
has been in the revenue area where PFTAC has supported the design of revenue policy and
administration reforms, including the drafting of legislation that awaits approval. There has also been
input in PFM, most recently through support for a PEFA assessment, and financial sector supervision.
Strategy 2012–14
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for current PFTAC funding cycle.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities continue to move towards long-term fiscal
sustainability. Activities will focus on assisting the authorities achieve tangible results from the
foundations laid with previous PFTAC assistance, and will include strategic support in the PFM area
and continued input on revenue, in coordination with AusAID. Financial sector work will also
continue, with a possible expansion into the insurance sector.
In the Public Financial Management area, the focus will be on completing the PEFA assessment
(1.1) and supporting the authorities develop a PFM roadmap (1.2). Activities to support the
roadmap’s implementation will be planned in coordination with other partners, in particular the ADB,
but are expected to include strengthened cash management (1.6).
In the revenue area, the nature of assistance will be dependent on the approval of tax reforms
designed with PFTAC-assistance (2.1). PFTAC will coordinate closely with and support an AusAIDfunded resident advisor who will be responsible for day to day support to the tax administration.
Assuming the reforms go ahead, PFTAC will also deliver support on specific technical areas, including
further development and implementation of an IT strategy (2.3), additional legislative drafting (2.1)
and in the more medium-term corporate planning (2,2) and compliance improvement strategies
(2.6).
FSM’s economic statistics are mainly produced by Compact-funded projects and input is
therefore expected to be relatively limited in this area in the short-term. Provided adequate
staffing remains available in the statistics office, PFTAC will look to support enhancements in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

range of national accounts aggregates that are produced (4.3) and provide hands-on training in
compilation methods while IMF HQ will offer support on balance of payments development (4.7).
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC will focus on assisting the Banking Commission to
modernize the Banking Act (3.8) and to strengthen off-site reporting through the adoption of
enhanced prudential returns and better, more-automated analysis (3.1, 3.2, 3.3). Strengthening of the
ability to assess banks on a CAMELS basis (3.4) will also continue. PFTAC will coordinate with IMF HQ
and other TA providers to ensure that the newly-formed insurance commission has access to suitable
capacity building but is unlikely to be able to devote significant resources to this area given resource
constraints and that insurance does not feature in Phase IV’s results framework.
In macroeconomics, no direct input is currently anticipated. However, support to forecasting
of long-term economic scenarios may be provided in late 2013.

ANNEX V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 10, 2012
ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most serious in
government finance and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: External consultants funded by the U.S. Department of Interior have prepared the national
income accounts from FY1995 to FY2011. Some shortcomings remain, for instance, no unemployment and
investment/savings indicators are available.
Price statistics: A quarterly consumer price index (CPI) –rebased to Q2 2008 and utilizing expenditure weights
derived from an earlier household survey– is published for the Federated State of Micronesia (FSM) as a whole and
for each state. However, the data releases suffer from considerable lags, which prevent an accurate and timely
evaluation of domestic price movements. For instance, the FY2012 consumer price index has not yet been finalized.
Government finance statistics: The national and the state governments and public sector enterprises publish
annual audit reports detailing their fiscal operations; consultants put these data in a GFS format with a lag of about
one year. The accuracy of the tax revenue data compiled by the authorities needs improvement as they are
sometimes different from the audit reports. Further improvements in the quality and timeliness of the fiscal data
depend on greater cooperation between the national and state governments. Micronesia does not present fiscal
data using the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) format.
Monetary statistics: The Banking Commissioner reports monthly monetary data to STA with a two- to threemonth lag. The data comprise interest rates, the accounts of the monetary authorities, commercial banks, and the
FSM Development Bank. The Commissioner has taken the view that the banking law prevents the sharing of this
information outside the Banking Board, hampering domestic surveillance.
Balance of payments: The Office of Statistics, Budget & Economic Management, Overseas Development
Assistance and Compact Management (SBOC) publishes annual estimates of the balance of payments and external
debt statistics. The data on workers’ remittances are highly incomplete. Delays of data release impart a high
degree of uncertainty to analysis of external sector developments. The SBOC aims to produce quarterly balance of
payments statistics and to introduce new data sources, such as surveys. Micronesia participates in the JSA Project
on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in the APD region.
DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Micronesia does not participate in the IMF’s General

No data ROSC is available.

Data Dissemination System.
REPORTING TO STA (OPTIONAL)
Only international liquidity and monetary statistics are currently reported to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). Micronesia does not submit balance of payments data to STA for publication in the IFS or
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 17, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Federated States of Micronesia
On January 14, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). 1
Background
The FSM’s economy is highly dependent on external aid, and private activity contributes little to
growth. A new Compact of Free Association agreement (“Compact”) with the United States,
effective since Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, steadily lowers transfers to the FSM through FY2023 and
has stricter rules on the use of grants. After FY2023, the FSM is expected to complement its
domestic revenues with income from its Compact Trust Fund (CTF) and other savings.
Since the last Article IV consultation, the economy continued on a steady growth path.
Following a recession in FY2006-2008 due to delay in Compact grants utilization as well as high
fuel and food prices, the FSM economy grew by 2–2½ percent for FY2010 and FY2011. The
expansion was driven by new construction activities and growth of the fishery sector. Inflation
has declined to 4.6 percent in FY2011, after reaching its recent peak of 7.8 percent in FY2009.
The overall fiscal balance of the consolidated government recorded modest surpluses for three
straight years through FY2011, with an uneven distribution of outcomes across states. Public
debt remains at a relatively low level (below 30 percent of GDP), but underfunding in the CTF
assets and a declining balance of the social security fund pose long-term challenges.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
Despite some deterioration of the current account balance, external balance is sustained by a
stable flow of official transfers. The majority of the overall current account deficit is financed
through capital transfers from official sources.
Economic growth will likely slow in the near term, as the private sector falls short of offsetting
the declining public sector demand from Compact grants reduction. Growth in FY2012 is
estimated at 1.4 percent as recent construction projects are winding down. A modest
consolidated fiscal surplus of 1¼ percent of GDP is expected in FY2012, mainly due to a sharp
increase in fishing access fee revenue by $7.6 million. While the fishery sector is expected to
continue its healthy expansion, lackluster wholesale and retail activities will remain a drag on
the private sector growth. Beyond the near-term, growth is weighed down by the scheduled
reduction in Compact grants. Medium-term growth is estimated to stay low at about ½ percent,
with limited private sector growth failing to offset the effects of a decline in Compact grants.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the FSM economy continued to grow last year, driven by
construction and fishery. Nonetheless, the economy faces important risks, including from a
potential deterioration in the external environment and, over the longer term, the scheduled
expiration of Compact grants and the continued outmigration of the working age population. In
this context, Directors underscored the need to begin addressing the fiscal gap to create fiscal
buffers and ensure sustainable public finances, and to accelerate reforms to boost potential
growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement a credible fiscal strategy based on a realistic
macroeconomic framework and balanced fiscal adjustment. They stressed the importance of
swift passage of the comprehensive tax reform bill to enhance revenue, and the need to contain
current expenditures, in particular public wages. It will also be essential to improve public
financial management to complement tax and expenditure reforms.
Directors cautioned that underfunding of the Compact Trust Fund and a declining balance of the
social security fund pose long-term challenges. With the Compact grants scheduled to expire in
FY2023, Directors underlined the importance of improving FSM’s capacity to fully utilize the
remaining grants. They encouraged the authorities to prepare for the grants’ expiration by
developing realistic reform plans with broad support from the state governments and the
general public. In this regard, they looked forward to swift approval of the budget to establish
the 2023 Planning Committee.
Directors emphasized the importance of advancing investment-friendly reforms to catalyze
growth and support fiscal consolidation. In this context, further liberalizing land use and lease
and streamlining investment licensing procedures at the national and state levels are important
priorities.
Directors noted that the financial system is well capitalized and liquid, but urged careful
monitoring of credit quality given the increase in consumer loans in recent years. They
welcomed efforts to address issues in loan collateral, which could help unlock commercial

3
lending. Directors agreed that the FSM Development Bank should be brought under appropriate
supervision and its activities redirected to helping finance start-ups.
Directors encouraged the authorities to step up production of high quality economic statistics,
especially in the fiscal area, to strengthen monitoring and policy analysis.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for the Federated States of Micronesia, and
Branan Karae, Government-Provided, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 14, 2012

Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) authorities thank staff for the constructive policy dialogue and
useful advice that was provided during the 2012 Article IV Consultation.
FSM is a small Pacific island country with a population of approximately 112,000 people and
consisting of four island states, namely Yap, Chuck, Pohnpei and Kosrae, located across the Western
Pacific Ocean.1 As a small island nation, the country has relied heavily on the US grants accounting
for about a third of its GDP. The Compact grant, however, is on the decline and scheduled to end in
2023. The reduction in the Compact assistance presents the biggest challenge for the future outlook.
Given FSM’s high dependency on public sector and the difficulties of the private sector to offset a
decline in public sector demand from the scheduled reductions in Compact grant, achieving longterm self reliance of budget is becoming an urgent matter.
Despite the stepped up efforts in recent years, a number of challenges remain with more to be
accomplished. The authorities broadly agree with staff recommendations on the way forward and
reaffirmed their commitment to working with the Fund and development partners, in order to
facilitate economic growth and reduce its dependency on external aid support beyond 2023.
Economic Developments and Outlook
Economic activities have been slow, with 2012 growth being forecast to drop to 1.4 per cent from 2.1
per cent in FY2011. Despite a pick up in the fisheries and agriculture sectors, the near-term outlook
seems cloudy given the declining public sector demand due to Compact grant reduction. Inflationary
pressure has been alleviated, but would remain volatile, being subject to fluctuations in the
international commodities prices.
The consolidated government balance continued to record modest surplus at around 1 per cent of
GDP. The results were uneven across the four states with two states recording deficits equivalent to 1
per cent of state GDP. Public debt remains relatively low at below 30 per cent of GDP, which can be
compared against the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) assets amounting to 83 per cent of GDP. However,
the insufficiency of the CTF assets to support budget self reliance beyond 2023 and aggravating
social security balances will be putting increasing pressure on the budget over the longer term.
On the financial sector, commercial banks - the main financial players in the system - are well
capitalized with sufficient liquidity. The level of non-performing loan is low but lending opportunities

FSM has 607 islands, occupying a land mass of around 700 km2. FSM gained its independence in 1986 under a
Compact of Free Association with the United States.

within the domestic market remain limited with foreign banks placing most of their funds and
investments offshore.
Medium-term Challenge and Fiscal Policy Response
Over the longer term, the reduction in the compact grants disbursement, decreasing population due
to continued outward migration and weak private sector growth will pose grave challenges on
growth outlook and the public finance.
The FSM authorities agree with the staff recommendations on the strategy to reduce the revenue
gap in line with the decline in the annual Compact grant support. They agree with the need to make
significant fiscal adjustments over the medium term, as suggested by staff, while the pace of
adjustments will be determined based on detailed assessments. In this context, the authorities set up
the 2023 Planning Committee under the leadership of President Mori, whose task is to come up with
a realistic action plan to address the looming budgetary shortfalls beyond 2023. They agree with the
staff recommendation on the need for the government to quickly strengthen the capacity of the
Committee by approving its budget.
Headway has been made in garnering broad support from state governments, business sector and
the general public on the national government’s reform agenda. The authorities have recently
conducted the very first conference with its stakeholders and development partners, hosting of
which is seen as a breakthrough after many failed attempts. The conference provided a good starting
point for the national government to discuss the seriousness of the challenges. The authorities
welcomed the favorable outcome of the meeting, in particular the support received from the
development partners group that confirmed their willingness to work with the authorities in moving
forward the reform agenda. The authorities will keep the momentum to ensure that the forum is
followed by concrete action plans with strong engagement from the stakeholders.
On the fiscal front, tax reform initiatives, aimed at enhancing revenue to put public finance on a
sustainable level, continued in 2012. A Unified Revenue Authority (URA) has been set up to introduce
a net profit tax that will come into effect in October 2013 and a value added tax that will become
effective in October 2014. The URA will take over from the national and state revenues authorities.
This reform is a big step forward and the national government is working hard with the state
governments to establish consensus in adopting the new arrangement. So far, two out of the four
states have agreed to the new tax regime. The new arrangement will come into force once all four
states sign and agree to adopt the new arrangement. In line with that, the authorities will continue
their efforts in strengthening tax administration through staff training and upgrading of IT system.
On the expenditure side, the authorities advise that they will continue their efforts in improving the
operational efficiency of current and capital expenditure through better planning and coordination
between the national and state governments. On wage spending, the authorities broadly agree that
the public wage rates are high compared to some of the regional peers and thus reducing the rates
would allow for fiscal savings. Nevertheless, they believe that it is also essential to balance the need

to provide for appropriate compensation package as part of the efforts to address the challenge of
outmigration of skilled workforce offshore. The authorities are also making their efforts to improve
social security balance, which include the amendment to Social Security Act regarding adjusting the
retirement age to Age 60 and allowing only 50 per cent of benefits until Age 65.
The authorities agree on the need to strengthen public financial management and to safeguard the
benefits of fiscal reforms. They will continue to work with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Center (PFTAC) in strengthening and accelerating the reform work in this area.
Financial Sector
On banking, the authorities will continue to focus their attention on addressing constraints related to
collaterals in lending. The outcome of the enactment of the Secured Transaction Act in 2006 has
been a step forward in the right direction. As there is a strong need for the long-term loan financing,
the authorities will continue to address the land collateral issue.
The Development Bank of FSM provides financing to those sectors supported under the government
development priorities and more generally those sectors that are essential but fall outside of the
radar of the commercial banks’ lending policies. The authorities are well aware of the need to
strengthen supervisory oversight over the development bank’s operations and will make constant
efforts to ensure soundness of the Development Bank.
Private Sector growth
The private sector development is weak and needs to be strengthened to allow it to support the
country’s economic growth as the US Compact grant slowly winds down. While noting the small size
and remoteness of the country from international markets, the FSM presents a number of
competitive advantages in some niche tourism markets, for which the authorities agree on the need
to promote and attract inward FDIs.
There are signs of FDI interest in the tourism sector. A recent interest received includes a huge
project proposal that presents challenges for the country to accommodate - particularly in the area
of land tenure protection rights. An alternative approach would be to attract small-scale FDIs that will
generate immediate benefits as it works towards strengthening the country’s capacity to attract and
support bigger FDIs. Another sector of the economy that has potential is the agriculture sector. The
increase in FDIs in the future would highlight the need for locally grown food to be produced to
mitigate high volatility of imported food prices. Fisheries sector has also room to grow further,
providing greater employment opportunities domestically.
The government will continue its efforts to improve the business environment – particularly reform
to ease the cost of doing business. The authorities are committed to devising a nation-wide
development plan, building on the momentum created by the first development Partners Forum held
in the fall of 2012. An Investors’ and Bankers’ symposium is now planned for mid-Spring to harness
support from both domestic and international lenders for financing of priority development projects.

Conclusion
Future prospects look challenging, given the unfavorable global market conditions and the winding
down of the US Compact support on which the economy is heavily dependent. Nevertheless, the
FSM authorities have been making positive strides in moving forward the much needed reform. The
key is in fortifying the support from the state governments and the general public. The authorities
reaffirm their strong commitment to the reform agenda, particularly strengthening the public finance
and savings towards the 2023 deadline and fostering the private sector to support sustainable
economic growth. The FSM authorities will continue to work closely with the Fund in this regard.
