IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia

On November 20, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Bolivia.
Benefiting from the commodity boom, Bolivia has achieved strong economic performance and
poverty reduction over the past decade. Real GDP growth has averaged about 5 percent since
2006, and the poverty ratio has declined by 16 percentage points. However, given Bolivia’s
dependence on commodities, lower commodity prices pose significant challenges to deliver the
objectives in the Patriotic Agenda 2025, while maintaining debt and external sustainability.
Real GDP growth is projected to stay relatively strong at 4.1 percent in 2015, despite the sharp
decline in oil prices that is starting to have an impact. A sizable public investment budget, strong
credit growth to the private sector, and robust private consumption are expected to support
activity. Growth is expected to decelerate to 3.5 percent over the medium term, as the full impact
of the new commodity price normal is felt and given impediments to enhancing private
investment. The fiscal deficit is projected to widen and the current account balance to swing into
deficit in 2015, and twin deficits are expected to persist over the medium term. The authorities
are finalizing a 5-year development plan (Plan Quinquenal), including public investment projects
in a number of areas to catalyze growth.
While headline financial indicators are solid, the 2013 Financial Services Law is affecting the
allocation of credit flows. Minimum credit quotas to productive and social housing sectors have
accelerated loans to those sectors.
Key external risks include a slowdown in key trading partners, additional softness in oil prices,
and further dollar strength. Bolivia-specific risks center on uncertainties related to natural gas
reserves and long-term export contracts, and large credit cycles under the new financial services
law.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Bolivian authorities for a prudent macroeconomic
management which has supported strong non-inflationary GDP growth and greatly improved
social outcomes over the past decade. Looking ahead, Directors agreed that the likelihood of a
protracted period of depressed export prices poses challenges to the outlook and risks are tilted to
the downside. They noted, however, that the sizable policy buffers built during the commodity
upcycle allow for a gradual approach in adjusting to a less favorable external environment, and
provide a strong base for further structural and institutional reforms.
Directors concurred that prospective budgetary deficits in the context of slower growth and
tighter global financial conditions may have an adverse impact on Bolivia’s fiscal position.
Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to improve the non-hydrocarbons fiscal balance
through a variety of tax and expenditure measures. A better articulated medium-term fiscal
framework centered on a clear fiscal anchor would enhance the credibility of the authorities’
fiscal plans. In this regard, Directors also recommended a more comprehensive system for
monitoring the quasi-fiscal activities of state enterprises to better manage fiscal risks.
Directors welcomed the effectiveness of the authorities in anchoring inflation expectations and
promoting de-dollarization. They shared the view that progress on these fronts would be
cemented by granting greater operational independence to the central bank in the new law under
preparation. The credibility of monetary policy would also be boosted by relegating direct
lending to a separate sovereign wealth fund with transparent investment rules and strong
governance. Directors generally saw merit in creating conditions for a move toward greater
exchange rate flexibility at an appropriate time to facilitate adjustment to large external shocks
and enhance competitiveness.
While noting the overall soundness of Bolivia’s financial sector, Directors pointed to risks
stemming from some regulations set under the Financial Services Law, particularly credit quotas
and interest rate caps. They encouraged the authorities to closely monitor developments and
modify the regulations appropriately if financial imbalances emerge. In this context, compilation
of a real estate price index would greatly aid policy evaluation and design.
Directors agreed that increasing private investment is essential to support growth both in the near
and the longer term. In this regard, they welcomed progress in strengthening the legal framework
and recommended further efforts in this area. Directors also encouraged the authorities to address

long-standing structural impediments to private investment, notably inflexible labor markets and
pervasive state-intervention in product markets.
Directors commended the authorities for the significant declines in inequality and poverty
achieved over the past decade. In order to preserve these gains under an expected tighter fiscal
envelope, they recommended well-targeted social transfers with a focus on the quality of
education and healthcare.

KEY ISSUES
Context. Facilitated by prudent macroeconomic management in the context of a
commodity boom, Bolivia has achieved strong macroeconomic performance and poverty
reduction over the past decade. However, given Bolivia’s large dependence on
commodities, the collapse of commodity prices poses significant challenges to the
authorities’ capacity to deliver on the objectives laid out in the Patriotic Agenda 2025,
while maintaining debt and external sustainability. These objectives include eradication
of extreme poverty, better access to health and education, and state-led
industrialization.
Outlook and risks. Real GDP growth is projected to stay relatively strong at 4.1 percent
in 2015, supported by twin deficits, and expected to decelerate to 3.5 percent over the
medium term given the new commodity price normal and lingering impediments to
private investment. Risks are titled to the downside. Key external risks include a sharp
slowdown in key trading partners, additional softness in oil prices, and further dollar
strength. Bolivia-specific risks center on uncertainties related to natural gas reserves and
long-term export contracts, and excessively large credit cycles under the new financial
services law.
Policy recommendations. With the end of the commodity boom, a rethink of policies
to anchor strong and durable growth is needed. Two overarching imperatives are to
improve the non-hydrocarbons primary balance and allow greater exchange rate
flexibility. Given large buffers, the authorities can take a measured approach to meeting
these objectives. It will also be important to: adopt a credible medium-term fiscal
framework, strengthen the monetary policy framework to uphold the central bank’s
operational independence and credibility, clarify commodity-related investment regimes,
and improve the business climate. Regarding the financial sector, key provisions of the
regulations—the credit quotas and interest rate caps—may need to be modified if
material risks build up.

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
After a decade of admirable macroeconomic
performance and poverty reduction, Bolivia’s policies are
being challenged by the end of the commodity boom.
Facilitated by prudent macroeconomic management, in the
context of a commodity boom, Bolivia has registered average
annual real GDP growth of about 5 percent since 2006, when
President Evo Morales and his party (Movimiento al
Socialismo—MAS) took power. The poverty ratio has also
declined by 16 percentage points. However, given Bolivia’s large
dependence on commodities (among the highest in the region,
text chart), the end of the commodity boom poses significant
challenges.1 The key one will be to deliver on the government’s
policy objectives laid out in the Patriotic Agenda 2025—
including eradication of extreme poverty, better access to health
and education, and state-controlled industrialization—while
maintaining debt and external sustainability.
2.
Although President Morales has a strong mandate, a
referendum on his ability to be reelected is looming on the
horizon. President Morales was sworn in for a third term in
January 2015 with a two-thirds majority in both houses of
Congress. A national referendum on a constitutional change
allowing him to run for the Presidency again is slated for
February 2016.

Real GDP growth has remained robust and high relative to
the rest of Latin America. Economic activity decelerated but
remained strong at 5.5 percent in 2014 (chart). The
momentum was maintained in 2015, with a growth rate of
4.8 percent through Q2. There are some recent signs of
deceleration, however, with economic activity indicators
growing only 2.4 percent and 3.9 percent in July and August,
respectively (Figure 1).



Inflationary pressures have subsided. Abstracting from seasonal patterns, monetary conditions
started to loosen in the 1st half of 2014 as liquidity declined and the inflation rate fell (Figure 2).
By September 2015, inflation had declined to 4.1 percent y/y, in part also helped by declines in
import prices given the relative strengthening of the Boliviano against the neighboring
currencies (chart, Box 1).



The fiscal balance has swung into deficit and the
non-hydrocarbons balance continues to worsen. The
fiscal deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2014 partially
reflected record-high capital expenditure coinciding
with general elections that year and regional elections
in March 2015 (Figure 3). The non-hydrocarbons
primary balance has also deteriorated by
9.1 percentage points of GDP since 2006
(to -12.3 percent of GDP in 2014) as the hydrocarbons
revenue bonanza led to a major ramp up of public
spending (chart). So far in 2015, the fiscal balance has
stayed in surplus (1.8 percent of GDP through August),
similar to the situation in 2014. The increase in tax
collections, especially of corporate income tax, has
offset the decline in hydrocarbon-related revenues.

Having been in significant surplus since 2003, the
current account surplus declined to 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2014 and slipped into a deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP
in 2015Q1 (chart). Lower international oil prices started
to feed into gas export prices in the 1st half of 2015
(export prices were down 34.2 percent y/y), while real
import growth remained robust given the continued
economic expansion and real currency appreciation.

Box 1. Monetary Policy and Inflation in Bolivia1/
Inflation has remained low and stable in the last few years, anchored by a stable exchange rate and
central bank intervention in money markets to control the level of liquidity. Open market operations
(OMOs) are the main operational instrument. The central bank monitors the growth rate of monetary
aggregates; mainly net domestic credit of the central bank and excess reserves of the banking sector. It also
intervenes in the foreign exchange market through daily auctions at a set U.S. dollar exchange rate, within a
narrow buy-sell spread band. This exchange rate at the central bank window has remained virtually
unchanged since 2008, with a de-facto stabilized regime since 2011. Central bank policies have so far been
effective in managing inflation, especially given ample liquidity related to the significant increase in public
investment spending. This is associated with the nationalization of hydrocarbons in 2006 and the
subsequent boom in oil prices.

Staff estimates indicate that the central bank has been able to control about 30 percent of consumer
inflation variability with timely monetary policy reactions affecting money markets and bank lending
activities. These estimates are based on an empirical model including (a) the central bank’s monetary policy
instruments; (b) the exchange rate and base money as long-term nominal anchors; (c) the interbank interest
rate and banks lending rate and credit as monetary policy transmission channels; and (d) consumer and core
prices, the economic activity index and the real effective exchange rate as ultimate indicators of the effects
on the real economy.

capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.7 percent in June 2015, with all major banks above the regulatory
minimum of 10 percent, and the aggregate leverage ratio is around 8 percent. Profitability continues
to decline, although it remains adequate with the return-on-equity at 13.8 percent as of June 2015.
NPLs remain among the lowest in the region (around two percent). Dollarization of deposits
continues to decrease, standing at about 20 percent as of August. However, while credit growth to
the private sector has moderated somewhat to around 15 percent (y/y), the credit-to-GDP ratio has
picked up considerably. It stood at above 45 percent of GDP in June 2015, 3½ percentage points
more than a year ago and suggestive of potential vulnerabilities on the rise.
6.
The Financial Services Law appears to be altering the allocation of credit flows, and
could pose risks to financial stability and inclusion (Box 2). For 2015, the minimum credit quotas
to productive and social housing sectors are being met by most financial institutions. Meeting the
quotas, however, has required a sharp acceleration of loans to the productive sector and for social
housing (growth of 26 percent since December 2014), and a reduction in credit growth to the
service and commerce sectors (chart). The interest rate caps seem to be having a material effect on
microfinance institutions, which have increased loan sizes above trend to reduce operational costs
while the number of borrowers has declined (chart).

Box 2. The Impact of the Financial Services Law1/
The Financial Services Law aims to promote financial inclusion, preserve financial stability, and
enhance credit to housing and productive sectors. Productive sectors are defined broadly as non-service
sectors, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Supreme Decrees issued in 2013 and 2014 set the
floor on deposits rates and ceilings on lending rates for social housing (5.5–6.5 percent), for corporate and
SME loans to productive sectors (6–7 percent), and microfinance loans (11.5 percent). Full service banks are
also required to direct at least 60 percent (50 percent for SME banks) of their loan portfolios to social
housing and productive sectors within five years, guided by intermediate annual targets. Guarantee funds
were created from a 6 percent tax on banks’ 2014 profits to finance down payments for productive sector
and social housing loans.
Looking ahead, achieving the 60/40 target by 2018 could imply rapid credit growth, raising concerns
about concentration risks, compromised asset quality, and over-indebtedness in the productive
sector. If the share of non-productive sector credit to GDP were to remain constant, total credit growth
needs to be around 18 percent with productive sector credit growth (including for social housing) of
33 percent (“Non-productive Credit-to-GDP Scenario”). If credit growth for non-productive sectors continues
at the rates seen in 2014, the 60/40 target by 2018 implies annual overall credit growth of about 25 percent
and productive sector credit growth of 42 percent (“Credit Growth Trend Scenario”). In each scenario, the
credit to GDP gap, a measure of whether credit growth is excessive or not, is high, indicating the buildup of
financial stability risks. An alternative scenario would be to meet the credit quotas by balance sheet
reduction, implying a credit crunch in the non-productive sector as banks reduce lending to it.
A July 2015 modification to expand the scope of the “productive sector” helps address the credit
growth pressure but may lead to other risks. This change allows the inclusion of the tourism sector and
intellectual property. The risks, however, could simply be shifted to loan quality and the supervisory burden
given increasing complexity and scope for circumvention.

7.
The authorities are finalizing a 5-year development plan (Plan Quinquenal) centered
on sizable public investments playing a catalytic role in the growth process. These will be in a
vast number of areas, including public infrastructure, productive activities, health, education, and
technology. Key commodity related projects cover discovery/exploration of gas and oil reserves,
petro-chemical plants, thermo- and hydro- electricity plants, and large iron ore and lithium mines.
While details are still being finalized, fiscal and external deficits will likely persist under the plan, with
a sizable share of external financing expected.
8.
Policies implemented in recent years have been partially in line with previous Fund
advice (Table 2). Pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus has been avoided, and the authorities have taken some
important steps towards adopting a medium-term fiscal framework. Inflation pressures have also
been contained and there have been significant increases in public infrastructure spending.
Recommendations to improve the non-hydrocarbons fiscal balance, discontinue central bank
lending to public enterprises, and gradually allow greater exchange rate flexibility have gained less
traction.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Against the background of a sober global outlook and a new commodity price normal,
economic momentum in 2015 is being maintained at the cost of twin deficits. Given the lags in
the adjustment of gas prices in the export contracts to Brazil and Argentina, the full impact of the oil
price decline on gas exports and hydrocarbon revenues will be felt in the second half of 2015.
Nonetheless, with a sizable public investment budget, strong credit growth to the private sector
(13 percent y/y), and robust private consumption, growth is projected at 4.1 percent in 2015—
relatively high for the region but still below the authorities’ forecast of around 5 percent. Fiscal and
current account balances are expected to deteriorate significantly, registering deficits of 5.3 and
4.5 percent of GDP respectively.
10.
The outlook for Bolivia is increasingly challenging in the medium term. In the staff
baseline, which assumes significant public investment and credit growth (average annual growth of
around 10 percent y/y), GDP growth is forecast to remain robust at about 3.5 percent in 2016 and
beyond.2 This is in line with potential growth, which has been revised down from 5 percent to
3½ percent, reflecting the lower commodity price normal and a reassessment of prospects for
private investment and total factor productivity (TFP) growth.3 Given oil prices are currently forecast

2

The credit growth assumption is consistent with financial institutions trying to meet the credit quotas under the
financial services law in part by allowing the ratio of nonproductive credit to GDP to gradually decline.
3

One-third of the downgrade is because of lower private and public investment, but there has also been a more
general reassessment of TFP growth. This is consistent with the findings of the October 2015 World Economic
Outlook on the impact of commodity price cycles on growth and potential growth, which points out that commodity
booms can raise TFP through faster adoption of technology and higher spending on research and development. The
Bolivia Selected Issues Paper (2013) also suggests that the estimated strong TFP growth since 2006 could reflect the

to recover only moderately over the medium term, the fiscal and external accounts are projected to
remain in significant deficits, leading to a drawdown of international reserves, although they should
remain adequate (14 percent of GDP and 6 months of imports in 2020). Financing the fiscal deficits
will also likely involve recourse to existing public sector deposits and direct lending from the central
bank.
11.
In line with the global context, risks for Bolivia are tilted to the downside. These
include: (i) a sharper slowdown in Brazil; (ii) further dollar appreciation, which would exacerbate the
overvaluation of the Boliviano given the de-facto stabilized exchange rate against the dollar; (iii) U.S.
interest rate normalization, which may lead to rising NPLs given many bank loans are indexed to a
variable reference interest rate;4 (iv) the combination of credit quotas and interest rate caps under
the Financial Services Law leading to a credit crunch in the nonproductive sectors and/or excessive
credit growth in the productive sector and for social housing; and (v) additional softness in energy
prices over the medium-term. There could also be a perfect storm where Bolivia’s large buffers
disappear steadily if a failure to discover and explore significant new hydrocarbons reserves and/or
renew the Brazil gas contract in 2019 is combined with a weakening of the fiscal position and an
undermining of central bank credibility.
12.
There are, however, important upside risks. A quicker and larger than expected recovery
in international oil prices would improve the fiscal and external accounts, and could result in greater
foreign investment to discover new hydrocarbons reserves if combined with a more attractive
investment regime. Various commodity-related projects could also pay off more than expected in
the staff baseline. And the ramp up in infrastructure spending could have a significant impact on
potential growth if used efficiently.

impact of the commodity price boom on the hydrocarbon sector that is not captured fully in the stock of physical
and human capital. Moreover, estimated TFP growth in the 25 years before 2006 was much lower than subsequently.
4

The 2011 FSAP stress testing exercise didn’t have sufficient data to carry out an interest rate risk stress test. It did
argue, however, that duration mismatch was not likely to be a problem given both assets and liabilities are mostly of
short duration. Any rise in interest rates may also be somewhat mitigated given limited external funding to the
banking sector.

baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
“Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Changes to the global outlook and the lower commodity price normal necessitate a
rethink of policies to anchor strong and durable growth. Two overarching imperatives are
to improve the non-hydrocarbons primary balance and allow more exchange rate
flexibility. Given large buffers, the authorities can take a measured approach to meeting
these objectives. Many of the recommendations of previous Article IV Consultations
remain valid (Table 2).

A. Anchoring Fiscal Sustainability and Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
13.
An incomplete adjustment to the new commodity price normal would raise concerns
about Bolivia’s debt sustainability. Preserving fiscal sustainability is critical for the achievement of
the governments’ development objectives. Under a passive scenario of no policy change and
assuming public investment to GDP remains at 2014 levels, the overall fiscal deficit could widen to
about 10 percent of GDP and public debt could reach 70 percent of GDP by 2020. This is above the
threshold marking a high risk of debt distress for LICs (Annex III).5
14.
Improving the non-hydrocarbons fiscal balance is essential, but a gradual approach
can be taken given large buffers and development needs. The non-hydrocarbons primary deficit
has widened from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to a whopping 12.3 percent of GDP in 2014 (text
table). In addition to the short horizon of Bolivia’s current proven gas reserves, lower international
oil prices and uncertainties related to the long-term export contract with Brazil add to the urgency

The baseline projection builds on a moderate consolidation of the non-hydrocarbons
primary deficit over the medium term. In 2015, the consolidation is based on a capital budget
execution rate of around 80 percent, consistent with outturns in years before 2014 (an election year).

Thereafter, public investment continues to decline and stabilizes at around 9¼ percent of GDP by
2020. This reflects capacity constraints, more conservative expectations regarding official financing,
and lower hydrocarbons revenues. The non-hydrocarbons primary deficit shrinks by 4½ percent of
GDP to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2020, with public debt stabilizing at around 50 percent of GDP.
16.
Staff, however, recommends a more ambitious consolidation to build fiscal buffers.
The baseline scenario projects a relatively high level of debt in the medium term for a low income
country like Bolivia. An active policy scenario targets a more ambitious but still gradual reduction of
the non-hydrocarbons primary deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2020, with debt declining to
32½ percent of GDP. If credibly implemented, automatic stabilizers could be allowed some play
around this path. Measures to adjust the non-hydrocarbons primary balance by an additional
5½ percent of GDP could include:


Revenue. Introducing a progressive personal income
tax (PIT) or reforming RC-IVA (the complementary
VAT regime), as well as establishing rules to deal
with transfer pricing practices and preparing the tax
administration to control them. A fully fledged PIT
could bring additional revenue of around 1 percent
of GDP and improve the equity and efficiency of the
tax system, in addition to rendering the tax system
more progressive. While it may have a negative
revenue impact in the short term, ensuring
transparent and incentive compatible hydrocarbons
and mining fiscal regimes is essential to discovering
new reserves/deposits and generating commodityrelated revenues in the longer term.

Expenditure. Public investment has scope to decline further and still remain above the average
level in 2006–12 (chart). Prioritization should be based on economy-wide returns, with a focus
on the quality of investment. Reducing energy subsidies could yield over 1 percent of GDP.
There is also scope to reduce the wage bill, which is high by low-income country standards, and
rationalize goods and services expenditures to pre-2014 levels.

17.
Staff reiterates the importance of introducing a medium-term fiscal framework. The
Ministry of Finance has taken some welcome steps in this regard, including creating a Macro-Fiscal
unit that produces fiscal projections, enhancing coordination with the Central Bank regarding the
overall macroeconomic framework, and instructing public enterprises to prepare multi-annual
budgets during the formulation of the 2015 Budget.7 These steps should be built on to implement a
fully fledged medium-term fiscal framework. Key aspects of this are a multi-year budget and setting

BOLIVIA

a fiscal target for the non-hydrocarbons primary balance that is consistent with long-term debt
sustainability, taking into account the state of the business cycle and oil price volatility.
18.
State-owned enterprises and their quasi-fiscal activities pose additional fiscal risks,
requiring a credible monitoring framework to assess their financial health. (Annex IV. I.) There
exist some important quasi-fiscal activities conducted through subsidiaries of strategic public
enterprises which are currently classified as outside the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS). In
addition, the Plan Quinquenal will likely have further significant investments in manufacturing
activities and the creation of more SOEs. To manage these contingent risks, the authorities should
start monitoring and publishing SOEs’ financial operations and balance sheets as a first step to
including them in the fiscal accounts of the NFPS. More broadly, the legal requirement that SOEs
should “generate surpluses”, or otherwise be subject to closure, should make sure that surpluses
more than offset capital depreciation.

B. Improving Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies
19.
Creating conditions for greater exchange rate flexibility is critical. This would help
facilitate adjustment to the large terms of trade shock and to future external shocks. And it is
especially important given the assessed overvaluation of the Boliviano and potential for further
dollar appreciation. In staff’s view, the tremendous progress in de-dollarizing the economy is one
important pre-condition for an orderly transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime. Country
experiences also suggest that cementing de-dollarization usually requires migration to an exchange
rate regime that allows for two-way flexibility. This helps internalize exchange rate risks and reduce
incentives for dollarization (Annex IV. II.). Any transition would need to be carefully crafted, however,
including credibly anchoring inflation expectations and ensuring that the appropriate monetary
policy instruments and money markets’ infrastructure are in place.
20.
An effective monetary policy framework which anchors inflation expectations will
require central bank credibility and fiscal sustainability. The new central bank law under
preparation should maintain the bank’s operational independence and preserve its capital base. To
this end, the practice of direct lending by the central bank to public corporations or trust funds for
development objectives should be discontinued. The direct lending, started in 2009, has expanded
to US$2.9 billion (equivalent to 8.4 percent of GDP) as of mid-2015, of which about 60 percent are
directed to YPFB (the state oil and gas company). In addition, the “Fondo para la Revolución
Industrial Productiva (FINPRO)” was established in 2012, with lending and grants from the central
bank totaling US$1.2 billion. Staff recommends that lending activities are stripped from the central
bank balance sheet and consolidated in a separate fund for development. This fund would need
transparent investment rules, a strong governance structure, and a clearly-stated development
mandate. This separation would contribute to enhancing central bank credibility by eliminating the
possibility of conflicting objectives: price stability should be clearly stated as the central bank’s first
priority. An effective monetary policy transmission would also benefit from a revision of the targets
in the Financial Services Law that distort interest rates and credit allocation.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

C. Ensuring Financial Sector Stability and Enhancing Financial Inclusion
21.
The Financial Services Law includes several reforms recommended in the FSAP. The
setting up of a deposit insurance scheme and a credit registry are welcome steps, as are the
implementation of some Basel II and III principles (such as adding market risk to capital
requirements and completing the guidance on operational and interest rate risk). The creation of a
Financial Stability Council―which met for the first time in August 2015—is another important step.
Developing a framework to monitor systemic risks and a macroprudential toolkit will further
strengthen financial sector surveillance. The recent advances in AML/CFT are expected to culminate
in the publication of a national strategy in late 2015.
22.
The Law, however, could pose risks to financial stability and reduce financial inclusion.
While meeting the 2015 credit quotas appears manageable, trying to reach the medium-term
targets could lead to excessive credit growth in productive sectors (including social housing) and/or
a credit crunch in nonproductive sectors. And staff VAR analysis suggests that credit dynamics have
a significant impact on growth, with a 1 p.p. increase in real credit growth raising GDP growth by
0.2 p.p. the following year. Overall, scenario analysis points to credit growth rates potentially in
excess of 30 percent for the productive sectors to meet the 5-year credit quotas (Box 2). This could
lead to deterioration in asset quality and rising NPLs. Stress tests suggest a doubling of NPLs is
manageable for most banks but a spike to peak levels reached over the last decade would cause
many banks to be significantly below regulatory capital thresholds (chart).8 The above-trend increase
in the average loan size of microfinance institutions and the declining number of borrowers point to
adverse effects of the interest rate caps on financial inclusion. This may also result in increased
activity of unregulated lenders as they attract the non-productive sectors and small borrowers no
longer serviced by microfinance institutions.

The stress tests also adjust provisioning levels to international standards given that the 2011 FSSA highlighted this
as an important issue (the “standard provision” test). For the higher NPL test, the increase in NPLs is provisioned at
50 percent, which is reflected fully in risk-weighted assets and capital.

23.
Key provisions of the regulations should be modified if material risks build up, and
greater financial inclusion could be achieved by relying primarily on market-based signals. The
interest rate caps and credit quotas were set by decrees and hence can also be modified as needed,
although clear and transparent rules regarding changes are critical to avoid creating regulatory
uncertainty. Indeed, the recent expansion of the definition of productive sectors likely increases the
scope for circumvention of the quotas, effectively watering them down but also increasing the
supervisory burden to police them effectively. Staff strongly recommends the creation of a real
estate price index to have a better idea of risks building up in the real estate sector. This is especially
important given the inclusion of social housing in the credit quotas and the associated lack of need
for a down payment. Staff also reiterates that financial inclusion could be better attained by more
limited and carefully-designed state intervention, such as further use of partial credit guarantees.

D. Increasing Potential Growth and Inclusiveness



Regulatory uncertainty. There has been important progress in
adapting the legal framework to the new Constitution
(including the Investment Promotion Law in April 2014, the
Mining Law in May 2014, and the Arbitration Law in June
2015). Some of these laws, however, do not fully resolve
regulatory uncertainty. For example, the Arbitration Law
exempts many key sectors, while the right of the Bolivian
state to ultimately accept or reject the verdicts of external
tribunals could weaken the purpose of the law. More
generally, important aspects of the legal framework are left to
decrees, many of which are still pending or can be modified.
Finally, a few key laws are still pending, such as the

Increasing private investment is central to mediumterm prospects. The share of private investment to GDP has long
been one of the lowest in the region, and is currently around
8 percent (chart). Bolivia also ranks among the lowest in Latin
America and the Caribbean in terms of economic diversification
and complexity.9 Indeed, raising Bolivia’s complexity score—
reflecting how knowledge intensive or sophisticated its exports
are—to the average in Latin America and the Caribbean would
increase growth by about 0.4 p.p. (chart). Addressing the key
impediments listed below will be essential to ensuring the
complementarity between public and private investment, and
enhancing diversification (Annex IV. III.).

hydrocarbons and labor laws, a new tax code, and sectoral incentive laws. This creates
uncertainty.


Other impediments. Competitiveness is being further crimped by high real wage growth and
other mandated bonuses, which have led to real income growth exceeding productivity growth.
Meanwhile, labor market inflexibility and pervasive informality continue to undermine
productivity and SME financial access. Importantly, the government’s increasing incursion into
product markets through price controls and public enterprises crowds out private investment,
given that public enterprises are less bound by competitive forces and efficiency levels needed
in the private sector.

25.
Bolivia has registered some of the largest declines in inequality and poverty in the
region over the last decade, but further progress will be challenged by the end of the
commodity boom (charts). Social transfers to the elderly, pregnant and school kids benefit about
30 percent of population, and have helped improve primary schooling, maternal health, and reduce
extreme poverty especially in rural areas. However, most of the reduction in poverty and inequality is
explained by declining wage inequality as the skills premium has fallen, and not larger transfers
(Box 3). Importantly, labor market policies have played a role through sustained minimum wage
increases and salary caps in the public sector. The skills premium could well increase as the spillovers
to low skill workers from the commodity boom go into reverse. Given a tighter revenue envelope, it
is essential to ensure that the social transfers are well designed and targeted and there is a focus on
the quality of education and healthcare.

Box 3. Inequality and Poverty Reduction1/
The tremendous inequality and poverty reduction in Bolivia over the last decade has a few potential
explanations: i) changes in the levels of average labor income, which are explained by sustained economic
growth fueled by favorable terms of trade and high levels of
Bolivia: Renta Dignidad, Bono Juancito and
public investment; and ii) changes in the distribution of total
Bono Juana Azurduy 1/
income, which in turn respond to changes in the skills premium,

such as the sustained increase in the real minimum wage.
Transfer as % of GDP (RHS)
Targeted public policies have played an important role.
Redistributive policies hinged on transfers to specific population
groups: school age kids (Bono Juancito Pinto), elderly people
(Renta Dignidad) and pregnant women and newborns
(Bono Juana Azurduy). Together, these three programs benefited
just under 30 percent of the total population, and totaled
1.5 percent of GDP in 2014.
A closer analysis suggests that fast growth was the main
driver behind poverty reduction; while a declining skills
premium drove down inequality. During 2007–2013, nearly
70 percent of the decline in extreme poverty is explained GDP
growth, while the remaining 30 percent is associated with
changes in the distribution of income. Moreover, real labor
income increased rapidly for low skilled workers, while it
declined for high skilled workers (this was something also seen
in Ecuador and Peru, although Bolivia had the highest decline
for high skilled workers). This declining skills premium was the
main factor behind the drop in the Gini coefficient, while the
effect of changes in non-labor income (transfers) was limited,
notwithstanding an important impact for some groups such as
for the elderly poor after the introduction of Renta Dignidad.

E. Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities strongly disagreed with staff’s growth outlook for the short and
medium term, and rejected staff’s proposed consolidation of the non-hydrocarbons primary
deficit. They expect growth to be around 5 percent in 2015 and that high public investment in
productive sectors will pay off and lead to growth averaging about 5¾ percent during 2015–20,
significantly above staff’s growth forecasts for 2015 and beyond. They also forecast a fiscal deficit
of about 4 percent of GDP in 2015. They indicated, however, that the deficit target would be lower
for 2016. The authorities did not see the need for cutting back on public investment as they believe
that revenues—both non-hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons related—will pick up in the coming years.
27.
The authorities disagreed with the need for greater exchange rate flexibility at this
juncture or for operational independence of the central bank. They argued that greater
exchange rate flexibility would not help competitiveness given that export volumes of hydrocarbons
and mining sectors are largely supply-determined, and also given the limited response of
nontraditional exports to exchange rate dynamics. Moreover, they argued that the majority of
imports were capital goods needed for development. The authorities were of the view that central
bank independence was not needed in the case of Bolivia, given the existing coordination between
the Ministry of Finance and central bank to ensure macroeconomic stability and the political
consensus on the importance of a low inflation rate. They indicated that the central bank should
play an important development role, and therefore direct lending to public corporations will remain
an important financing source for public investment.
28.
The authorities agreed that financial regulations can be adapted as needed, but
disagreed about the potentially adverse impact of the credit quotas and interest rate caps. The
authorities argued that banks will achieve the 60 percent share of productive loans to total loans
without the risk of excessive credit growth. They explained that the credit quotas have so far proved
effective in redirecting flows away from bank profits and towards productive loans, while NPLs
remained the lowest in the region. They emphasized that banks remain profitable and that the
decreasing number of microfinance borrowers did not reflect reduced financial inclusion, but a
reclassification within the financial sector, with some of these borrowers now classified as bank
customers. The authorities concurred on the necessity to construct a house price index and to
modify the credit quotas and interest rate caps if systemic risks build up.
29.
The authorities agreed on the need to increase private investment going forward, but
did not share staff’s analysis regarding the impediments . They emphasized progress made in
aligning key laws to the new Constitution, and pointed to the investment projects in the pipeline. In
particular, they argued that the Investment Promotion and Arbitration Laws contributed to
improving the business environment and effectively modernized the framework governing
investment in Bolivia. The authorities expected that foreign private investment will play a greater
role in the coming years. They highlighted the recent rapprochement with the domestic private
sector. The authorities further rejected the need for labor market reforms, arguing that their labor
policies are an important tool for redistribution and have contributed to reducing poverty and
inequality. The authorities are convinced of the public sector’s catalytic role in increasing the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

productive capacity of the economy and facilitating the functioning of markets through direct
intervention.
30.
The authorities expect to build on the tremendous inequality and poverty reduction
registered over the last 15 years. They highlighted the role of Renta Dignidad as an effective
redistributive policy, as well as other pro-poor policies such as the large and sustained increase in
the minimum wage. They also stressed that while other conditional transfers, such as Bono Juancito
Pinto and Bono Juana Azurduy have positive effects on inequality and poverty, their main aim is to
improve human capital. The authorities disagreed with the conclusion that the inequality decline
partially reflected declining wages for skilled workers given that wages increased across the board.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Following a decade of strong macroeconomic performance, poverty reduction, and
de-dollarization, the Bolivian economy is at a point of inflexion. Bolivia has recorded strong
economic growth and built up significant fiscal and external buffers over the past decade, supported
by prudent macroeconomic management in the context of a commodity boom. It has also achieved
some of the largest declines in poverty and inequality in the region. The global outlook has
changed, however, and Bolivia faces a challenge of adjusting to the new commodity price normal
while preserving and building on the economic and social gains achieved in recent years. The
authorities can pursue a measured approach to this adjustment given sizable buffers.
32.
The impact of the commodity price declines is already being felt, with the outlook
becoming increasingly challenging in the medium term. Growth for 2015 is projected to remain
relatively high, at 4.1 percent, supported by a sizable public investment program and strong credit
growth to the private sector. The outlook for 2016 and beyond, however, is increasingly challenging,
as the full impact of lower international oil prices is expected to widen fiscal and external deficits
further, absent an adjustment. Moreover, the short horizon of current proven reserves of natural gas
adds to the urgency to implement measures to improve competitiveness and promote the
development of non-commodity sectors.
33.
Key policy imperatives are to improve the non-hydrocarbons primary balance and
allow greater exchange rate flexibility. The latter would help facilitate adjustment to the large
terms of trade shock and to future external shocks. It will also be important to adopt a credible
medium-term fiscal framework which includes activities of SOEs more systematically, and strengthen
the monetary policy framework to uphold the central bank’s operational independence and
credibility. If and when it does take place, any transition to greater exchange rate flexibility needs to
be carefully crafted to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and to preserve the
de-dollarization achieved so far. Important conditions to make the transition an orderly process
include central bank credibility and its primary focus on price stability, and fiscal sustainability.
Regarding the financial sector, key provisions of the regulations—the credit quotas and interest rate
caps—should be modified via decrees if material risks build up.

34.
Increasing private investment is central to medium-term prospects, while preserving
the reduction in inequality will be challenging given the end of the commodity boom.
Measures to increase private investment include resolving remaining legal and regulatory
uncertainty, ensuring transparent and incentive compatible hydrocarbons and mining fiscal regimes,
reducing government incursions into product markets, and reducing labor costs and increasing
labor market flexibility. Regarding maintaining the inclusiveness of growth, given a tighter fiscal
envelope, it is essential to ensure that social transfers are well designed and targeted, and that there
is a focus on the quality of education and healthcare.
35.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, although has some shortcomings.
Notable progress has been made to further strengthen the quality and timeliness of statistics,
including working towards full subscription of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Improving data on quasi-fiscal activities of subsidiaries of SOEs outside the fiscal accounts, and the
creation of a real estate price index would be further important steps.
36.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bolivia be held on the standard

12-month cycle.

Status
Partially implemented. The overall fiscal balance swung into
deficit for the first time in nine years in 2014.
Not implemented.
In progress. The authorities are drafting a five-year
development plan and are making progress with the preparation
of medium-term fiscal projections and outlooks for key public
enterprises.
Implemented. The inflationary pressures were succesfully
contained in mid-2014 through monetary policy tightening and
agreements with food producers.
Not implemented. The central bank lending to public
corporations has continued.
Not implemented . There has been a stable exchange rate vis-àvis U.S. dollar since November 2011.
Partially implemented. Credit registry coverage was expanded
and the depositor protection fund was created. Regulatory
requirements were strengthened, including the inclusion of
market risks to capital requirements, increase in the primary
capital requirement (from 5 percent to 7 percent of riskweighted assets and contingencies), and the guidance on
operational and interest risks was issued. The Financial Stability
Council has met for the first time in August 2015.
Not implemented. Supreme decrees were issued to regulate
interest rates and set credit quotas for the lending to the
productive sector and social housing. Financial insitutions were
given five years to comply, with intermediate annual targets to
guide the progress.
Some progress made. The Law on Investment Promotion was
enacted in April 2014 and the Arbitration law in June 2015. Some
of the laws, however, do not fully resolve regulatory
uncertainty.
Partially implemented. Significant increases in public
infrastructure spending.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
Having appreciated by over 40 percent since 2010, Bolivia’s real exchange rate is assessed
to be stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies as of
2015. The sharp decline in oil prices since late 2014, the dollar’s appreciation, and
neighboring countries’ currency depreciation have weakened Bolivia’s external position.
The current account is expected to swing into a sizable deficit in 2015, which will only
moderate gradually over the medium term. Reserves remain more than adequate by any
metric but are expected to start declining. Bolivia ranks poorly in terms of
competitiveness and measures of diversification and complexity. To the extent that lower
gas export revenues and a more appreciated dollar will persist, Bolivia will need to regain
competitiveness through facilitating relative wage and price adjustments and enhancing
productivity.

Current Account
1.
The drop in oil prices is negatively impacting Bolivia’s current account. The current
account is projected to post a 4.5 percent deficit in 2015 after dropping to balance in 2014 following
a decade of surpluses. This is largely due to the drop in the value of natural gas exports to Brazil and
Argentina, while imports remain significantly above levels seen earlier in the 2000s as the economic
expansion continues. Income outflows from foreign investment in Bolivia have grown significantly
during the economic expansion, while income from foreign reserves has weakened given low
interest rates. Service imports, including those related to investment projects, have increased
significantly over the last five years.
2.
The current account deficit appears larger
than warranted by fundamentals and desirable
policies.1 The EBA-lite methodology tailored to resource
rich countries indicates a need for current account
adjustment of about 2.6 percent of GDP if the large need
for investment in infrastructure is considered for the case
of a low-income country such as Bolivia. This translates
into a real currency overvaluation of 15.6 percent. The
main factors explaining the large current account gap
when comparing with previous estimates are the
deterioration of the current account and fiscal balances

Following Bems and Carvalho (2009), we include only oil and gas exporting countries in the sample, given the
differences inherent in commodity exporters. The EBA-Lite CA model is estimated as a function of changes of fiscal
balance, changes in reserves, capital account openness, the private credit to GDP ratio, net foreign assets, relative
output per worker, the oil and gas trade balance, the dependency ratio, the GDP growth forecast, a measure of the
institutional and political environment, the aid and remittances to GDP ratio, and the output gap. Further details can
be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/eba/data.htm.

as a result of the substantive deterioration of the terms of trade.
3.
Looking ahead, the current account deficit is expected to gradually decline, although
downside risks related to hydrocarbons prospects loom large. The current account deficit is
expected to fall to near 3 percent of GDP by 2020, based on a modest recovery in oil prices, a small
increase in the volume of gas exports to Brazil and Argentina, and a modest adjustment of domestic
demand and government spending. However, further declines in export commodity prices remain a
key vulnerability given the significant dependence of commodity exports (gas, mining, and soybeans
account for 85 percent of total exports). Investment in exploration of hydrocarbon reserves is critical
in the long term, as known reserves are expected to deplete before 2030 at current extraction rates.

Exchange Rate, Relative Prices, and Competitiveness
4.
The CPI based real effective exchange rate has been appreciating since 2010 and is
now stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Given the
de facto stabilized regime against the U.S. dollar combined with dollar appreciation, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by more than 40 percent since 2010. The
appreciation has been especially sharp recently since the 2nd half of 2014 given the significant
depreciations of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso against the dollar (21 percent overall,
43 percent against the real, and 13 percent against the peso, respectively during
July 2014–September 2015). Brazil and Argentina are Bolivia’s most important trading partners.
Overall, the EBA-lite IREER model points to about 25 percent overvaluation of the exchange rate in
2015, but is judged to be less robust than the CA approach given huge residuals. These residuals are
likely related to significant structural changes in the Bolivian economy in recent years that are not
well captured by the models used.

non-traditional and re-export sectors did not increase
their share in the economy during the last 12 years.
6.
Bolivia’s share of global exports has risen over the past decade but largely due to
increasing gas export prices. The share has increased from about 0.02 percent in 2000 to about
0.05 percent in 2014. This marked upward trend has been driven by favorable price dynamics in
Bolivia’s main traditional export products (minerals and gas), and in its main non-traditional export
product (soy). That said, Bolivia has just maintained its share of global export markets at constant
2005 U.S. dollar prices. A closer analysis of Bolivia’s trade balance confirms that the trade surpluses
after 2011 would have been much smaller or even deficits when valued at constant 2005 U.S. dollar
prices.

Minimum and average wage growth has
been fast, outpacing productivity growth. Bolivia’s
minimum wage is still the lowest in the region as
measured in real U.S. dollars (US$57 in 2000 and
US$127 in 2015), however it grew nearly 80 percent
during 2000–2013, just surpassed in Brazil (about
100 percent) and in Uruguay (over 150 percent) over
the same period. While this had important positive
effects on poverty, it has also increased labor costs of
non-commodity exports and led to wage growth
outpacing productivity growth over the last decade.
This has adversely affected the competitiveness of
the country. The distribution of wage growth seems
to favor low-skill workers; indeed, annualized real
wage growth for high-skill workers was negative
during 2000–2012 (-2 percent).

Other structural indicators of competitiveness point to a weak position with respect to
other countries in the region. The only category where Bolivia is in the top half of the Global
Competitiveness indicators is Macroeconomic Environment. The major constraints for
competitiveness seem to be Goods Markets Efficiency and Labor Market Efficiency, where Bolivia
ranks in the positions 132 and 129 out of 140 countries, respectively. Addressing longstanding
weaknesses in logistic performance would also help boost trade and competitiveness. In the 2014
Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank, Bolivia ranked 121 out of 160 countries; well below
neighboring countries. Transport infrastructure; ease of arranging shipments; logistics services
quality; tracking and tracing; and timeliness all scored below regional peers.

Recent research by the IMF indicates that Bolivia
ranks poorly in terms of economic diversification and
complexity. More specifically, the range of produced
goods is narrow, and their level of sophistication remains
low, two factors that have been found important for
long-term growth. Bolivia ranks low also relative to its
regional neighbors in terms of product concentration.
Infrastructure, education, and market openness are keys to
inducing greater sophistication.

10.
The capital account registered a small surplus
in 2014 and is expected to remain in surplus in the
medium term. Bolivia attracted sizable foreign direct
investment and official financing in 2014. Portfolio
outflows have been driven by commercial bank’s required
liquid asset (RAL) abroad. Other capital outflows (private)
have also significantly increased in 2013 and 2014.
Looking ahead, the capital account is projected to register
small surpluses given a continuation of these trends.

International Reserves remain well above
various metrics of reserve adequacy, providing ample buffers, although they are expected to
decline in the medium term. Reserve coverage is equivalent to 14 months of imports and is
substantially above the adequacy threshold suggested by short-term debt or broad money.
Substantial accumulated assets represent both savings of the exhaustible resource revenues and
protection against vulnerabilities from oil price volatility. Looking ahead, staff expects reserves to
decline to around US$6¾ billion by 2020 given current account deficits and decreased net capital
flows. This should still be reasonably adequate level, although in terms of broad money it will fall to
20 percent. The net international investment position has remained positive since 2008, standing at
13.7 of GDP at end-2014, with external assets are dominated by international reserves.

Financial Soundness Indicators suggest vulnerabilities have increased to “medium” in
the first half of 2015, driven by an increasing credit-to-GDP ratio. However, banks’ balance
sheets remain healthy with low balance sheet structural risks and strong buffers. The deposit-to-loan
ratio remains high, while foreign exchange exposure is limited given low deposit and credit
dollarization. The leverage ratio and profitability remain at acceptable levels, and non-performing
loans are low. Looking ahead, the financial services law may lead to new risks building up, and
vigilance regarding asset quality and the speed of credit growth needs to be maintained.

Bolivia’s financial stability map does not show a significant increase in risks when
compared with the period before the introduction of the financial services law in 2013. Inward
spillover risks have increased marginally, reflecting the external vulnerability related to the
commodity price decline and a high concentration of exports. Credit risks have also increased,
mainly because of a slight increase in non-performing loans and a decrease in banks’ profitability.
The level of overall macro-economic risks for Bolivia is lower than the level of global risks reported
in the April 2015 Global Financial Stability Report.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Bolivia shows low risk of debt distress for total and external public debt under the current
baseline scenario. Under the baseline scenario, debt ratios remain below the respective
risk thresholds even under extreme shocks. However, debt sustainability depends on the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts in response to lower hydrocarbon revenues.
Moreover, there are downside risks related to uncertainty surrounding hydrocarbons
production and discovery of natural gas reserves. An alternative scenario, which assumes
no augmentation of current proven natural gas reserves and a shorter resource horizon
up to the mid-2020s, indicates higher risk of debt distress, with total public sector debt
breaching the debt distress threshold by 2025.

BACKGROUND
1.
The decline in Bolivia’s gross public debt stalled in 2014, and the ratio is projected to
continue rising as the drop in international oil prices reduces hydrocarbon revenues
significantly. Bolivia has successfully reduced its public debt as a share of GDP from 95.7 percent in
2003 to 32.5 percent in 2013, supported by MDRI debt relief, consecutive fiscal surpluses, and strong
economic growth. The trend reversed in 2014 as Bolivia recorded the first fiscal deficit in nine years,
with the debt increasing slightly to 33.0 percent of GDP. The increase is projected to continue while
the authorities undergo gradual fiscal adjustments, and total public debt is estimated to stabilize at
around 48 percent of GDP by 2020. External debt has declined significantly to 17.3 percent in 2014
from 65.0 percent in 2003, and the share of foreign currency debt in domestic debt declined to
10.8 percent from 82.5 percent over the same period. The commodity price boom and a limited
capacity to execute capital expenditure have lead to a sizable accumulation of public sector deposits
at the central bank, providing some buffers.

BASELINE SCENARIO
2.

The main assumptions of the baseline scenario for the period of 2015–2035 are:



Annual real GDP growth: 4.1 percent in 2015 and 3.5 percent thereafter through 2020 (staff’s
estimate of potential growth). Output growth is assumed to continue to decelerate to a little
above 3 percent by 2035, reflecting slowing population growth and more moderate capital
accumulation.



Inflation (CPI, period average): 4.3 percent in 2015, 4.9 percent in 2016, and 5 percent in
2017–2035.

1

While remittances are an important source of foreign exchange, their contribution is not high enough to require
their inclusion in the DSA.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

BOLIVIA



External sector: in line with the staff’s medium-term projections through 2020, and based on
stable import and export ratios to GDP over the long term. Net FDI is assumed to remain stable
at around 3 percent of GDP.



Fiscal assumptions and financing strategy: in line with the staff’s medium-term projection
through 2020. For 2021–35, a primary deficit of around 2 percent of GDP is assumed on average,
on the basis of a stable path of international oil prices and gradual adjustments in nonhydrocarbons fiscal balances in response to persistently low oil prices. External financing is
assumed to account for about 25 percent of financing needs, with CAF expected to remain the
largest external lender.



Average concessionality of public external debt: around 20 percent in the long term, based
on projected disbursements of official loans and concessional financing conditions.

3.
Under the baseline scenario, Bolivia’s public and external debt are expected to remain
stable throughout the projection period. Bolivia is classified as medium performer in terms of its
policy and institutional capacity, measured by the three year average of the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores. The gross non-financial sector public debt is
projected to increase to 46.2 percent of GDP in PV terms by 2020 and to a peak of 48.4 percent in
2028, before declining to 45.5 percent in 2035, remaining below the threshold of 56 percent. Total
external debt (including private) is projected to peak at 18.9 percent of GDP in PV terms in 2021, and
then decline to 13.8 percent by 2035. All the debt burden indicators for Bolivia are below the specific
indicative thresholds for medium performers.
4.
Standard stress tests on the baseline scenario suggest that Bolivia’s low public and
external indebtedness is resilient to the majority of shocks. Under the most extreme stress test
to external debt—a onetime 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2016—the
ratio of the PV of debt to GDP deteriorates by around 6¾ percentage points on impact, and the gap
remains in large part in the medium to long term. All the external debt indicators remain well below
the threshold in the extreme stress scenarios. For public debt, the PV of debt to GDP breaches the
threshold under the scenario in which the primary balance is assumed to remain in a deficit of
4.2 percent from 2015 onwards. The stress tests, however, indicate that debt ratios remain below
indicative thresholds even for the extreme shock of an increase in other debt-creating flows in 2016
equivalent to 10 percent of GDP.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO
5.
Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low under the baseline scenario but there are downside
risks related to uncertainty surrounding hydrocarbons production. Based on the analysis under
the baseline and the most extreme stress test, staff believes that Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low,
and its debt is expected to be sustainable over the medium and long term. Nevertheless, it should
be noted that debt sustainability will depend on the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts in
response to lower hydrocarbon revenues, and investment for exploration and successful discovery of
natural gas reserves.
6.
To assess the impact of the exhaustion of natural gas reserves, the following
assumptions are made under an alternative scenario with a shorter resource horizon:


Natural gas resource horizon: Given the uncertainty and length of time natural gas exploration
takes, an alternative scenario assesses the debt sustainability implications of a shorter resource
horizon only based on current proven reserves. Current reserves are expected to last only
through 2025, based on staff’s medium-term production assumptions under the baseline
scenario. The alternative scenario, therefore, assumes that the long-term export contract with
Brazil will not be renewed after 2019 and the production volume will drop in 2020, resulting in a
continued production for Argentina (until the end of current contract in 2027) and domestic use
until 2033. The authorities have increased efforts to explore natural gas reserves, including
through drafting decrees setting investment regimes for the hydrocarbons sector, and this
scenario could be viewed as the upper bound for the debt sustainability risks.



Fiscal assumptions: With the assumed loss of hydrocarbons related revenues, the primary
deficit of the non-financial public sector is assumed to average around 5¾ percent of GDP in
2020–35.

7.
Under the shorter resource horizon scenario, the debt trajectory starts to worsen from
mid-2020s, reflecting the assumed exhaustion of current proven gas reserves. The PV of the
public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to breach the threshold in 2025 and continue to rise, reflecting
primary deficits. The public debt-to-GDP ratio, in nominal terms, could reach around 85 percent of
GDP by 2035.

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in
the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Annex IV. Background Analytical Work
I. Fiscal Balances and the Public Sector Balance Sheet1
A.

Adjusted Fiscal Balances

1.
Investment by public enterprises is expected to increase further in the coming years,
as natural gas-related exploration starts to pick up. Despite the greater role played by stateowned enterprises, roughly ¼ of total state investment is excluded from the fiscal accounts. This
investment is made by 25 subsidiaries of the SOEs YPFB (hydrocarbons), ENDE (electricity) and by
ENTEL (nationalized telecom company). These companies could pose increasing contingent fiscal
risks and a closer look at their financial states is merited.

Adjusted overall balances are slightly
higher than the unadjusted fiscal balances
reported by the authorities. The balance
worsens by 2.1 percent of GDP on average for
2006–14 with the inclusion of capital
expenditure by the relevant subsidiaries. On the
other hand, estimated current balances based
on the available information improve the overall
balance by 4.2 percent of GDP. The adjusted
balance is projected to be similar to the
unadjusted one during 2015–2016.

B.

Public Sector Balance Sheet

3.
Aggregate public sector net worth masks complex intra-governmental transactions.
Overall, public sector financial and physical net worth has increased dramatically since 2007.
Increasing public investment on the back of strong hydrocarbon fiscal revenues contributed to the
accumulation of physical assets, while resulting in accumulation of international reserves at the
central bank and deposits for sub national governments. But this has been at the cost of depletion
of the physical asset (hydrocarbons reserves). SOEs’ net worth is close to zero, as the accumulation
of assets from natural resource revenues is matched by the increase in direct lending from the
central bank (around 8.4 percent of GDP as of mid-2015, with the current lending limit up to 18
percent of GDP). Central government net worth has remained consistently in deficit over the years.
Sub national governments net worth has increased steadily, benefitting from natural gas revenue
sharing, but declined in 2014 as the capacity to execute capital expenditure projects improved.

II. Entrenching a Durable De-Dollarization in Bolivia2
5.
Financial dollarization has declined significantly since 2006 in the context of
macroeconomic stability and given prudential measures. The share of deposits denominated in
U.S. dollars declined from nearly 85 percent at endDe-dollarization
2005 to about 20 percent by mid-2015, while share
14
Credit (RHS, in U.S. dollars)
of credit denominated in U.S. dollars declined to
6.3 percent. During this period, the exchange rate

Given its success so far, Bolivia could refocus its policies from further reducing
dollarization toward maintaining a durable de-dollarization. Apart from maintaining
macroeconomic and political stability, this will require: (i) increasing economic diversification,
(ii) further strengthening institutional quality and credibility, (iii) deepening capital markets, and
(iv) allowing greater exchange rate flexibility.
7.
An orderly transition to greater exchange rate flexibility should not necessarily reverse
the de-dollarization trend significantly. This is a legitimate concern of the authorities. There is
evidence, however, to suggest that making de-dollarization durable at low levels of dollarization—as
in the case of Bolivia—requires gradual moves toward two-way exchange rate flexibility. This is in
addition to credible macroeconomic policies and prudential frameworks that internalize the risks of
balance sheet dollarization (Kokenyne et al., 2010).

Bolivia appears to be well placed to make a transition to greater exchange rate
flexibility. Country cases in which the transition was relatively smooth suggests that it takes time
(e.g., Israel 1985–2005, Chile 1984–99, and Poland 1990–2000). However, Bolivia meets many of the
preconditions needed for a successful transition (table), only lacking derivatives markets to help
manage exchange rate risk and an alternative monetary policy framework.

III. Strengthening Private Investment3
9.
Bolivia’s impressive growth performance partly reflects a public investment boom,
while private investment has remained lackluster. In the past five years alone, investment
contributed about 2 percent to growth each year, compared to 1 percent in the region. In particular,
public investment has increased significantly since 2005, driven by large investments in the
transport, hydrocarbons, and construction sectors. Private investment, however, lags behind regional
averages.

Bolivia needs to address key impediments to realize
the important complementarities between the public and
the private sector. These include:

300

250



Transportation infrastructure. Bolivia ranks 121 out of 160
countries in the World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance
Index. The substantial internal distances, combined with a
difficult terrain (mountains, valleys and plateaus) pose
important challenges to reaching domestic and foreign
markets. And less than 10 percent of its roads are paved
compared to a regional average of 22 percent.



Wage costs. These have risen significantly, with the minimum
wage increasing nearly 4-fold and private sector wages growing by 8 percent on average over
the last 10 years (while inflation averaged 6 percent). Other mandatory wage costs (including but
not limited to the double-Christmas bonus if growth exceeds 4.5 percent) have further increased
costs.



Labor regulations and informality. A dated labor legislation and lack of judicial efficiency have
reduced formal job creation and led to a boom in one-person companies, which operate at the
margin of formality. And surveys link informality to reduced incentives for formal private
investment, especially in the face of smuggling and other illegal activities.



Price controls and regulatory uncertainty. The government’s policy to protect consumers and
curb inflation by intervening in markets and controlling prices for a variety of goods (up to ¼ of
the CPI basket: mainly food, but also inputs such as cement) increases uncertainty over revenues
and weighs negatively on investment decisions. In addition, firms have noticed a significant
increase in the regulatory burden, including frequent supervisory and tax audits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

BOLIVIA



Export uncertainty. The new Constitution determines that goods may only be exported once
domestic demand has been satisfied. In the case of soy-beans, for example, where international
prices are significantly higher than the (regulated) domestic prices, uncertainty over the
availability of export permits reduces the incentives for farmers to invest in increasing
production capacity.



Legal uncertainty. The process of adapting the legal framework to the new 2009 New
Constitution remains incomplete, which creates legal uncertainties that are particularly relevant
for large, foreign investors. While some important laws have been approved recently many lack
regulating decrees or omit important aspects (e.g., the mining law does not specify the tax
regime).

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of
Bolivia (CBB) was subject to an assessment with respect to the April 2, 2003 Stand-by Arrangement
(SBA). A safeguards assessment was completed on June 27, 2003, and while no systemic risks with
the CBB’s safeguards were identified, uncertainties were expressed about the de facto lack of
operational independence and program monetary data. An update assessment was completed on
September 27, 2004 in conjunction with an augmentation of the SBA. This assessment confirmed
that measures had been implemented to address all previously identified vulnerabilities, except for
those requiring a change in the central bank law. Currently, CBB is not subject to the policy.

Exchange Arrangement: The Bolivian currency is the Boliviano and the de jure exchange rate
regime is crawling peg to the U.S. dollar. Within the scope of the official crawling peg exchange rate
regime, in an external environment characterized by market exchange rate volatility and decreasing
external inflation, the sliding rate was set to zero to anchor the public expectations. Consequently,
the boliviano stabilized against the U.S. dollar since November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a
crawling peg, effective November 2, 2011. The exchange regime is free of restrictions and multiple
currency practices.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
The upcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the fiscal period 2016–2020 will
provide the umbrella for World Bank Group (WBG) support to Bolivia. The CPF will be
discussed by the Board of Executive Directors in December 2015. The program under the CPF is
aimed at maximizing the impact of WBG interventions on poverty reduction and the promotion
of shared prosperity, the WBG Twin Goals. Three selectivity filters were used to frame the
program: (a) broad consistency with the priority constraints identified in the WBG Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD); (b) alignment with the Government’s development plans and demands;
and (c) the WBG comparative advantage in sustaining Bolivia’s progress in moving toward the Twin
Goals. Despite the filters, the WBG engagement in Bolivia will remain flexible with respect to the
evolution of the country’s growth trajectory and new demands that may arise from the authorities.
The WBG program under the CPF is comprised of two pillars and five objectives that will
provide general direction to the WBG’s engagement. The CPF has the following two pillars:
(1) promote broad-based and inclusive growth; and (2) support environmental and fiscal
sustainability, and resilience to climate change and economic shocks. Within each pillar, the
following inter-linked objectives will guide the WBG’s engagement: (i) reduce transport costs and
increase connectivity of isolated and vulnerable communities to the national road network;
(ii) increase access to selected quality basic services for the poorest rural and urban communities;
(iii) improve opportunities for income generation, market access and sustainable intensification
(Pillar 1); (iv) strengthen capacity to manage climate change and reduce vulnerability to natural
disasters; and (v) strengthen institutional capacity to improve public resource management and the
business environment (Pillar 2). The formulation of the pillars and objectives aims at both reflecting
the current portfolio but also allowing space for nascent government demands.
The WBG program during the CPF period will see the transition to International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)-only country. The existing trend of a steady state
number of projects (about 11–13) is expected to continue. In addition, the policy dialogue is
expected to increase in response to financing demands from Government, underpinned by a solid
unfolding policy agenda in the areas of climate change and possibly investment climate and fiscal
management. During FY2015, the WBG delivered the first Development Policy Financing (DPF) for
Bolivia on Disaster Risk Management that included also the first IBRD loan for the country in recent
years.. The Program will encompass an indicative allocation from the International Development
Association (IDA) for FY2015–2017 of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 148.0 million (US$208 million
equivalent) and a transition to IBRD-only financing by the end of the current IDA17 cycle at the end
of FY2017.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

BOLIVIA

The WBG’s engagement is defined for the first year of the CPF, but less so for subsequent
years to allow for flexibility in responding to emerging priorities. The World Bank’s portfolio of
operations for FY2016 is based on the sustained dialogue with the Bolivian authorities. New lending
operations in FY2016 include an additional financing for a rural community-driven development
project, two operations in the transport sector, and a potential DPF on climate change. For FY2017
and beyond, the pipeline is open, with the exception of possible additional financings in some
successful projects, to allow the WBG to meet emerging needs in Bolivia and reflect the findings of a
Performance and Learning Review (PLR) that is planned for early FY2018. The PLR will offer a critical
stocktaking exercise and allow the WBG to adjust course as necessary.
The CPF takes into account the existing portfolio as much of the impact on the CPF objectives
will be derived from these legacy portfolio. This will also ensure a degree of continuity between
the previous FY2012–2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the current CPF. The current
portfolio is focused on disaster risk management and climate change, rural development and
agriculture, transport, strengthening of statistical capacity, energy, urban development and
employment. The World Bank’s portfolio comprises 11 lending operations totaling US$752 million,
of which US$353 million remain undisbursed (Table 1). Looking forward, the priorities will be to:
(i) consolidate the portfolio in traditional areas, and expand it to capture emerging demands from
Government, including greater attention to human capital; and (ii) address the main challenges in
implementation, especially those related to institutional capacity and governance and fiduciary
standards. New operations in FY2016 worth US$605 million.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue supporting opportunities for private
sector development under the CPF. As part of IFC’s commitment to reengage in Bolivia, it has
recently approved the first long-term financing operation in the Bolivia’s banking sector in over a
decade. This credit facility will exclusively finance local Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In
addition, two other operations were approved in the agribusiness and hospitality sectors. As for
Advisory Services (AS), the IFC is implementing projects in strategic sectors to maximize
employment, simplify business creation and income generation in low-income populations, as well
as minimize impacts on the environment. In addition, dialogue with partners in new sectors is
underway. As for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), in the absence of any
immediate pipeline projects in the country, it remains open to supporting foreign direct investments
via its political risk insurance products.
In addition, the World Bank will continue providing Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA).
In the next years ASAs will focus on those areas where the World Bank can provide value added,
respond to Government needs and in alignment with the knowledge gaps identified in the SCD.

B. IMF Relations with the World Bank under JMAP
The following priorities were identified for the coordinated work-plan on Bolivia:


Strengthening of the fiscal framework, multi-annual budgeting and the link with the planning
process remains a challenge. The public sector has to strengthen capacity in public sector
management, procurement and public investment, including at the subnational level.



Improving the business climate to bolster investment. Bolivia’s private investment rate
remains significantly below the levels observed in the past decade and well below the regional
average.



Reducing poverty. Significant challenges remain in poverty reduction and inequality. Also,
access to basic services, particularly in rural areas, remains a challenge. Social services, including
access to quality basic education, health, water and sanitation and employability of low income
youth and social protection network is in the agenda.

It was agreed that the teams continue with the following division of labor:


Multi-annual budget and planning framework. The Bank is supporting the Ministry of
Development Planning in setting up the basis for multiannual planning and the link with the
budget process. The Bank is also supporting the strengthening of capacities for public
investment, including at the sub-national level.



Debt management. The Bank continues open to a Government requirement to develop an
action plan based on the last DeMPA report.



Poverty and social protection. The Bank has been providing technical assistance on poverty
measurement, including monetary poverty and multidimensional well-being indicators. This
complements the support provided to generate high quality statistical information through a
STATCAP project. These tools would help both diagnosis and targeting of population that fails
to reach minimum standards of multidimensional welfare, and on building capacity on the
measurement of poverty including on gender issues. Also, the Bank will continue assisting the
Government in the areas of youth employment, health and early child development.



Private sector development. The IFC is providing credit lines to financial institutions to lend to
SMEs. The Bank will continue advancing the preparation of a DPL focused on investment climate
enhancement.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
As of September 30, 2015, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) had approved loans
to Bolivia amounting to US$6.05 billion, with disbursements totaling US$4.63 billion. Bolivia’s
outstanding debt to the IDB was approximately US$1,666.7 million with undisbursed approved
funds for US$1,067.25 million. During the year net cash flows to the country were positive for a
seventh year in a row, a trend expected to continue in the base scenario to 2016. At the end of 2007,
the IDB unilaterally joined the IMF-WB MDRI initiative, by writing off a total of US$741.1 million in
principal payments and US$307.3 million of future interest payments, generating an estimated
annual fiscal space of more than US$18.0 million on average.
After the last round of debt relief, the IDB has implemented new criteria of allocation of
concessional lending which is consistent with the application of the Debt Sustainability
Framework. The IDB lending to Bolivia follows the operational guidelines for concessional funds
under the Fund of Special Operations (FSO) performance-based allocation system. Parallel lending
operations, modality that blends ordinary and concessional funding, will be the preferred lending
instrument up to 2020.
The IDB and Bolivia have a country strategy covering the period 2011–2015. Under the
country strategy, the IDB has decided to increase financial flows to Bolivia. While in 2011, the
approval of new loans was US$252 million, it will reach US$475.1 million in 2015 and
US$633.4 million in 2016.
Under the Bank’s country strategy with Bolivia, the government and the IDB have agreed on
making sustainable growth and poverty-inequality reduction as main objectives of their
strategic engagement. In pursuit of this objective, the Bank aligned its actions with those on
Bolivia’s National Development Plan. The country strategy targets its interventions in the following
sectors: (i) Transport; (ii) Water and sanitation; (iii) Energy; (iv) Early Childhood Development (ECD);
(v) Health; (vi) Education; and (vii) Institutional and Sustainability Strengthening. As overarching
sectors, the IDB focuses on climate change and indigenous population/diversity issues. A new
Country Strategy is currently being developed.
As of September 30, 2015 the portfolio of executing sovereign guaranteed operations in
Bolivia consists of 31 operations, totaling US$1.77 billion, of which 37.2 percent has already
been disbursed. The current executing portfolio supports mostly transport, water and sanitation
and energy infrastructure interventions. The non-sovereign guaranteed executing portfolio consists
of 16 loans ascending to US$40.9 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 15, 2015)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff
welcomes the progress made by the authorities to further strengthen the quality and timeliness of
statistics, which includes updating the base of the national accounts, implementing the agricultural
and economic census, a plan to reinstate the employment survey, and working towards full
subscription of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
National Accounts: The National Institute of Statistics (INE) is working on updating of the base year
of the national accounts (from 1990 to 2007) which includes the implementation of the System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and some of the most relevant recommendations of the SNA
2008. INE’s plans to release preliminary results (year 2007–2012) and definitive series in 2014 have
been delayed.
Labor market: The quality of the household and employment surveys has declined in the last few
years, due mainly to financial constraints. The quarterly employment survey was discontinued in
2003, leading to a lack of quarterly information on unemployment, employment and wages. Yearly
information on wages is still compiled by INE.
Prices statistics: Industrial producer price indices (PPI) and external trade unit values are compiled
by INE, but are in need of revision as regards concepts and definitions consistent with SNA 1993, as
well as treatment of seasonal products, missing items, quality changes, and introduction of new
products. A PPI TA is planned for November 2015.
Government finance statistics: Annual data on the operations of the consolidated central
government do not cover all operations of decentralized agencies and operations channeled
through special funds. The ongoing implementation of a comprehensive financial management
system, with funding from the IADB/WB, will help ensure proper monitoring of public sector
financial operations including subnational fiscal operations, debt and social spending. It will also be
important to improve on the reporting of the operations and debt of public enterprises.
Balance of payments: Sources of information for both balance of payments and international
investment position (IIP) are considered sound, but the classification of units by institutional sector
and the classification of external assets and liabilities by functional categories and instruments need
to be enhanced. Some institutions that shall be considered Other Deposit-Taking Corporations and
a fund that should be considered part of the General Government sector and held sizable amounts
of external assets and are currently included under the Other Sectors; the assets of several sizable
funds are classified under Portfolio Investment or Other Investment regardless of the real nature of

10

the assets; valuation changes of relevant Bolivian external assets are not identified and they are
included in transactions. Securities issued internationally by the Bolivian government held by
resident investors are identified in the data sources but they are treated as external liabilities in the
external sector statistics (ESS). Investigations with reporters in order to delimitate services (mainly
construction or other business services) and direct investment are needed, and the method to
estimate the amounts of goods for processing services related to the exports by Bolivia shall be
updated. Consistency within ESS needs also to be enhanced. During a September 2015 TA mission
on ESS, an implementation plan for the compilation of ESS on a BMP6 basis was agreed. SDDS
requirements regarding ESS are currently met.

Statement by Mr. Chodos and Mr. De la Barra on Bolivia
November 20, 2015

Background
Despite a regional context of economic slowdown, Bolivia’s economic growth was
outstanding in 2014 (5.5 percent) and will be similar in 2015 (estimated 5 percent)
registering the highest growth rate in South America, driven mainly by the dynamism of
internal demand. The ample public investment of the Bolivian authorities in recent years will
allow the continuation of such trend from 2016 onwards. During 2015 all economic activities
have contributed this performance with the exception of crude oil and natural gas. Bolivia’s
exceptional macroeconomic performance was corroborated by major credit risk rating
agencies in their positive evaluations, which translated into a continuous increase of the
country risk rate in recent years. As a matter of fact, Fitch Ratings upgraded Bolivia's longterm foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) in 2015 based on Bolivia’s
improvement in fiscal revenue, domestic investment and regulatory framework, as well as its
robust external buffers and ample fiscal policy space that render its economy better-placed to
absorb adverse shocks and adopt counter-cyclical policies.
The staff report presents a pessimistic view of the Bolivian economic outlook and it does not
take into account the country’s medium-term economic objectives and policies, including
contingency plans to face shocks. Moreover, the authorities regret that staff has not given the
necessary attention to the authorities’ claims regarding the effect that IMF surveillance
reports may have on expectations, especially regarding growth, the exchange rate, financial
inclusion, financial strength and economic stability. The Bolivian authorities have repeatedly
expressed that economic agents are very sensitive in Bolivia, as they do not internalize
projections appropriately, due to the manipulation and mishandling of information by media
and political opposition.
Growth Outlook and Potential Growth
The staff once again puts unnecessary emphasis on Bolivia’s commodity dependence and the
challenges that the new commodity cycle would mean for the country. The staff’s statements
are not accompanied by technical and empirical support that demonstrates how the change in
commodity price cycle significantly affects Bolivia’s economic growth. The authorities
reiterate the importance to strike the right balance between the importance of commodity

2
prices and the country’s overall economic performance. The staff must acknowledge that
domestic demand is the main engine of growth in Bolivia. Furthermore, the government’s
economic policy is fundamental for a better performance of the economy, not only for the
current juncture but also for the long-term development strategy. The authorities reiterate that
the Bolivian economy is not decelerating given its resiliency, which will keep the strong
growth tendency.
Growth momentum for 2015 does not have the "cost" of twin deficits as indicated by the staff
since all components of domestic demand are staying positive. The Bolivian authorities are
projecting a growth rate of about 5 percent for 2015. Given that until June 2015 a cumulative
growth of 4.7 percent was already recorded, the growth rate of 4.1 percent for 2015—
projected by the staff—would imply only growing 3.5 percent the rest of the year, which is
highly unlikely given the envisaged acceleration of public investment in the second half of
2015, the starting up of the liquid hydrocarbon separation plant, better performance of the
financial sector due to the expansionary monetary policy, a solid performance of the
agricultural sector registered as of June 2015, and expansion in electricity and construction
sectors.
In 2014 the staff had estimated Bolivia’s potential output to be around 5 percent. The
estimate now has been changed to 3.5 percent which is not justified and appears
unreasonable from a technical or theoretical point of view, taking into account the continuous
increase in domestic private consumption, investment (public and private, that both recorded
peaks in recent years), capital, and employment in the economy. The Bolivian government
has estimated (through a wide range of methodologies) that the potential output for Bolivia
remains at 5 percent.
Also, the staff underestimates the GDP growth by 2.2 percentage points on average for 20152020, because new projects, such as electricity generation or hydrocarbons industrialization,
among others, are not considered. These projects not only diversify the economy, but
increase its complexity and reduce the vulnerability to external shocks.
On the other hand, a 4.7 percent growth as of June 2015—reported by the General Index for
Economic Activity (IGAE)—would already be exceeding the re-estimated potential GDP and
the country would start experiencing inflationary pressures, which is not the case as inflation
is under control.
While the fall in terms of trade could, in theory, affect public investment, it is important to
note that Bolivia is in a strong position to face a fall in exports revenue, since the country has
enjoyed several years with twin surplus, which provides greater space compared to even
advanced economies. In addition, controlled inflation and the Central Bank of Bolivia
(CBB)’s liability level due to monetary regulation operations give ample space for a more
expansionary monetary stance to complement fiscal policy in stimulating the dynamism of
economic activity.
It is important to note that according to the World Economic Outlook (WEO), countries that
have a less pro-cyclical fiscal policy and have high levels of credit, such as Bolivia, are less

3
likely to face large variations in their growth. Moreover, the WEO states that countries with
heavy investments in sectors favored by the boom are more vulnerable to shocks.
Nevertheless, this is not the case for Bolivia, given that between 2006 and 2014,
hydrocarbons and mining investment represented only 13.8 percent of public investment.
Therefore, it is contradictory for IMF staff to reduce Bolivia’s potential growth.
The staff forecasts assume that Bolivia has a short horizon for its proven gas reserves
omitting the exploration plans that will be carried out by the national oil company (YPFB).
We must say that the gas reserves are increasing and there are enough assurances that the
contract with Brazil will be renewed and expanded. Exploration by YPFB has produced
important outcomes, such as the discovery of a new well (Margarita 7) that allows
incorporating a new reservoir of gas (increasing 0.8 trillion cubic feet in gas reserves). An
additional reservoir of crude oil in Santa Cruz has also been found, which provides 28
million barrels of oil (MMBbl) and nearly triples the reserves of crude oil in the country,
from 16 to 44 MMBbl. Furthermore, Bolivia is already able to sell gas to other countries.
Higher diversification of the Bolivian economy is expected once the new development plan
(under preparation) starts being implemented.
The exploration schedules include investments amounting to US$ 4,308 million between
2015 and 2019, of which 22 percent will be made by foreign companies (Repsol and
Petrobras). Also recently, Total and British Gas (foreign corporations) committed to invest
around US$1,500 million in exploration until 2019. The government is highly committed to
oil and gas exploration. As a matter of fact, it has decided to carry out exploration even in
unconventional areas and, for that matter, licensing procedures are being streamlined and the
Supreme Decree 2366 has been approved (May 2015) allowing exploration in protected
areas.
Private Investment and Foreign Direct Investment
The staff’s superficial knowledge about the country is evidenced once again when it comes to
analyze investment on the private sector. The IMF staff repeatedly discusses Bolivia’s low
levels of private investment compared to Latin America, without mentioning that private
investors have scarce capital and low risk appetite. However, the staff has to acknowledge
that in the last decade private investment has presented a growing trend. In fact, private
investment as a percentage of GDP has continuously increased from 5.4 percent in 2004 to
8.6 percent in 2014.
During the 20 years of neoliberal period, Bolivia never had a strong private sector despite the
favorable environment offered to private investors. The staff should not insist on asking for a
larger share of private investment because this sector lacks capacity and entrepreneurial
vision. Neither wage policy nor the exchange rate level are the cause of low private
investment, but the low productivity.
The regulatory framework has been improved in order to increase private investment. The
Investment Protection Law and the Conciliation and Arbitration Law recently approved
represent a significant step forward for legal security for national and foreign investment.

4
These laws are a result of consensus with the private sector and international cooperations,
and also provide investment incentives.
The Bolivian government is highly committed to facilitate private investment, both domestic
and foreign, and last month organized in New York the Investing in Bolivia Summit, which
attracted the interest of more than 200 investors. Consequently, the Ministry of Development
Planning will create an exclusive office for dealing with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
flows. In the same vein, President Morales on his recent visit to Germany, Italy, Ireland, and
France strengthened business and economic ties with these countries. Another expression of
such commitment is the Development Promotion of National Industry bill submitted by the
Ministry of Productive Development and Plural Economy to the National Assembly.
The IMF staff does not consider that political, social, and economic stability in Bolivia play
an important role in assuring an appropriate investment climate. Maintaining a stable
exchange rate has allowed more certitude for families and firms positively supporting
investment climate and maintain the strength and stability of the financial system.
FDI flows have continuously entered the country reflecting investors’ high level of certainty
and confidence in the national economy. In fact, during recent years Bolivia was one of three
countries in the region with the highest cumulative index of FDI (along with Brazil and
Paraguay). In addition, Bolivia shows low levels of volatility in these flows, which
eventually translate into attenuated economic cycles.
Fiscal Policy
Public finance continued to evolve sufficiently in 2014; in fact, the tax burden (excluding
hydrocarbon tax - IDH), increased from 21.7 percent in 2013 to 22.3 percent in 2014.
According to the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), Bolivia has the largest
tax-to-GDP ratio increase over the past 23 years in the whole of Latin America. Expenses
were greater than revenues due to the record level of public investment, mainly executed by
sub-national entities (governorates and municipalities). There were also unforeseen
expenditures because of the rehabilitation of the economy of the Amazon region—impacted
by natural disasters—and payments made to nationalized companies. Consequently, the
overall balance recorded a healthy deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2014.
The fiscal deficit in 2015 is set to be around 4.1 percent of GDP, below the level projected by
the staff report (5.3 percent). This projection is highly distorting given the precedent
discipline that Bolivia has applied in managing public finances. The fiscal deficit in 2015
will be in line with the Financial Fiscal Program agreed between the CBB and the Ministry of
Economy and Public Finance (MEPF) since there will be no extraordinary expenses. Also, it
is expected that spending on goods and services will decrease because of—among others—
lower hydrocarbons subsidies, a lower tin price for Vinto Metallurgical Company and lower
wheat imports. Transfers linked to oil prices will also decline. On the income side, the tax
revenue increase will partly compensate for the fall on oil prices. Even though the authorities
are engaged in pursuing an ambitious investment program for 2016, macroeconomic stability
is paramount for the country and the authorities do not intend to put it in danger.

5

The staff emphasizes the importance of reducing the non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit.
However, this should not be a policy target. The reason is that the calculation methodology is
not standard; hence the results cannot be contrasted with the authorities’ own estimations.
The pessimistic medium-term fiscal deficit forecasts do not include higher revenues from the
productive diversification envisaged in the government´s development plan—especially from
energy and mining projects.
Bolivia’s external debt stock is one of the lowest in the region and the world, and is below
the thresholds established by international organizations. The assumptions to assess Bolivia’s
debt sustainability are distorting, such as low growth forecasts and zero probability of finding
new gas reserves, which obviously imply higher debt-to-GDP ratios. Consequently, the debt
levels forecasted by the IMF staff, which reach up to 85 percent of GDP, are not realistic.
Although Bolivia does not have a medium-term fiscal framework according to the IMF
methodology, the development plan in preparation includes long-term fiscal projections that
give consistency to macroeconomic and development policies. The technical assistance
report “Progress in the implementation of the Fiscal framework of medium-term” (February
2015) acknowledges that the MEFP has been making efforts to implement a medium-term
fiscal framework, and it has prompted reforms to strengthen such process. Directives of the
2015 Budget establish that public institutions have to elaborate annual and multi-annual
budgets, spanning five years.
Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy
There are several alternative methodologies that indicate that the Bolivian currency is not
overvalued. Indeed, econometric models estimated by the CBB reflect that the behavior of
the real exchange rate has been consistent with movements of economic fundamentals.
Furthermore, during recent years there were no persistent misalignments of the real exchange
rate from its equilibrium level.
It is worth mentioning that any methodology for assessing equilibrium exchange rates
involves conceptual simplifications and could generate different quantitative estimations,
which highlight the high degree of sensibility to different assumptions, for example the
period of analysis.
The staff’s conclusion regarding a high overvaluation of the domestic currency in the specific
case of Bolivia could cause an overreaction within the country and unintentionally lead to an
attack to the domestic currency. The Bolivian authorities provided ample explanation to staff
on the exchange rate policy, its objectives and internal consistency with the objectives of the
overall economic policy. They have also repeatedly remarked that any assertion—like the
one included in the staff report regarding overvaluation—could dangerously exacerbate
expectations of agents, which may cause financial disintermediation, dollarization and a loss
of net international reserves (NIR).

6
The policy of exchange rate stability allowed the proper management of both external price
shocks and exchange rates adjustments in neighboring countries; the exchange rate is
consistent with the decline in international prices and it has not affected external
competitiveness, since persistent real exchange rate misalignments were not generated.
It must also be stressed that a depreciation of the Bolivian currency may generate inflationary
pressures, such as those observed in the region. In fact, during 2015 several countries with an
inflation-targeting regime and flexible exchange rates experienced higher inflation
(persistently above target bands) driven by the pass-through effect from the depreciation to
inflation (Figure 1) worsened by a higher exchange rate volatility.
Figure 1

(Percentage, Year to year)

Source: Bloomberg
An extremely relevant fact of the Bolivian economy, is that a sudden devaluation without
preparation for the public may be contractive, generating a decline in domestic economic
activity. As discussed in the literature, there are several mechanisms through which
devaluation may affect output. First of all, its effects on the real exchange rate may be rapidly
offset by an increasing inflation. Furthermore, devaluation may generate a redistribution of
income from groups with a high marginal propensity to consume, to those with a high
marginal propensity to save, resulting in a decline in aggregate demand and output.
Moreover, in the short run the productive structure is very rigid and, therefore, real
devaluation does not necessarily produce an increase in tradable output. Technical analysis
demonstrates that the Marshall Lerner condition (excluding hydrocarbons) has not been met,
given the low sensitivity of exports and imports combined to exchange rate variations. This
implies that the competitiveness of Bolivian exports is related to other variables, for example,
the competitiveness of the private sector, so that depreciation alone would fail to stimulate
them.

7

Moreover, ECLAC data shows that the average real wage in Bolivia is the lowest in South
America and that it has remained stable in recent years, which improves competitiveness
with respect to neighboring countries. More importantly, public investment was strongly
aimed at improving energy infrastructure, transport and communications in the country,
which reduced costs for the private sector and, at the same time, contributed to enhancing
competitiveness. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the nominal exchange rate is no
longer considered as one of the determinants of external competitiveness (the World
Economic Forum no longer takes into account the exchange rate at the time of evaluating
competitiveness of economies).
The recommendation for a more flexible exchange rate policy is a traditional and worn off
one and staff should be aware that it cannot always be applied to all countries because
economic conditions and development stages are different among countries, and
idiosyncratic vulnerabilities are in place.
Regarding the NIR, they have decreased mainly due to extraordinary operations and changes
in foreign currency and gold valuations. The observed loss during the first months of the year
does not represent a risk to macroeconomic stability since the authorities have envisaged it
within the 2015 financial program projections. In this regard, projecting a NIR fall of more
than 65 percent of GDP by 2020 appears speculative.
The current account deficit recorded recently is in accordance with what is happening in the
region, although it must be noted that the deficit observed in Bolivia is among the smallest,
given that the trade balance was not affected significantly. The current account deficit would
be lower than the 4.5 percent projected by the staff, as a result of remittances and a moderate
fall in non-traditional exports. Furthermore, CBB studies conclude that the current account
will converge to its equilibrium level faster than in other countries of the region. In addition,
imports have registered a low decline: as of the third quarter of 2015 it is less than in similar
period in 2014.
The last financial crisis highlighted the need for monetary policy through almost zero interest
rates; therefore, central banks had to apply non-conventional monetary policies reflecting a
lack of efficacy of the traditional monetary policy, which is not the case in Bolivia. On the
contrary, during recent years several policy instruments have been introduced that have
strengthened the monetary policy transmission channels and improved its effectiveness. In
addition, Bolivia’s current monetary policy was analyzed by the staff, concluding that it was
effective and useful.
As for inflation, it is projected that the 2015 end-of-period inflation would be below the 5.5
percent target, and even less than in the previous year (5.2 percent). Such lower inflation
would provide enough space to continue implementing monetary impulses to contribute to
the dynamism of the real sector. In addition, the Bolivian government is ready to adopt shortterm policy measures to control inflation.

8
By mandate of the Constitution, the CBB`s main objective is to maintain the internal
purchasing power of the currency, to contribute to economic and social development;
therefore, loans to strategic national public companies (EPNE) are part of this mandate. It is
worth mentioning that these loans follow the guidelines of the annual Financial Program
signed by the CBB and MEPF, in which growth and inflation targets are set (consistent with
a prudent macroeconomic management). In addition, these credits are monitored and
controlled by the Superior and Strategic Council for Public Enterprises. Policy coordination
between the CBB and the Executive Branch has demonstrated a high effectiveness in
achieving macroeconomic objectives in terms of inflation and economic growth.
The Financial System
The staff argues that the Financial Services Law (FSL) is altering the composition of credit
flows and posing risks to financial stability. Such statement has neither technical nor
empirical support (no risk indicator worsened because of the law) and therefore is subjective
and mere speculation.
The law has not relaxed the rules on the process of credit evaluation. The government’s
financial policy focuses on increasing productive credit and social housing as part of the
goals of the Bolivian Economic Model to support economic development and improve living
conditions with more affordable housing for the people.
The financial system in Bolivia is not a cause for concern because it shows positive and
strong indicators. The credit-to-GDP ratio is one of the lowest in the region and there is space
to grow without posing risks. Non-performing loans (NPL) represent 1.7 percent as of
September 2015. To reign on risks and detect vulnerabilities in the financial system the
Financial Stability Council was created to take care of and monitor macro-prudential issues.
In addition, in 2015 the financial system remains very liquid, and new loans continue to flow
while their quality has not been affected. Up to September 2015, the financial system’s loan
portfolio is US$1,654 million higher than in December 2014, registering a new record. Banks
will achieve the 60 percent productive loans quota without causing excessive credit growth.
Credit quotas have so far proved effective in redirecting credit towards productive loans
which enhance the output capacity of the economy, while NPLs remained the lowest in the
region. Banks remain profitable and the decreasing number of microfinance borrowers did
not reflect reduced financial inclusion, but a reclassification within the financial sector,
economic growth and strategic alliances between banks and micro financial institutions.
There appears to be no support to say that financial disintermediation may occur because of
greater loan size.
FSL include additional provisions and the possibility to increase the capital requirements.
These prudential measures have resulted in a less vulnerable financial system to adverse
scenarios.
The staff, without merit, emphasizes risks that microfinance institutions will face because of
the FSL. On the contrary, all financial institutions (including the formal microfinance

9
institutions outside ASFI regulation) continue to grow steadily and their profitability
continues to be positive. Interest rate caps for loans have not negatively affected
microfinance institutions.
Bolivian microfinance institutions are recognized and are seen as an example throughout the
world. These institutions know how to deal with non-traditional guarantees and have proven
able to adapt to changing conditions. Different studies in the region remark on the quantity
and the quality of services provided. Resources that were lent to borrowers traditionally
excluded by banks have had exceptional growth with a very low NPL ratio. All studies reach
the same conclusion: the success of Bolivia’s microfinance. For example, the CGAP
Microfinance Gateway mentions Bolivia as the second country with the best conditions for
the development of microfinance worldwide, because it has the lowest interest rates for
customers and the lowest levels of NPLs. Another study by the IDB’s Multilateral
Investment Fund published in 2015, mentions Bolivia as the country with the highest level of
microcredit penetration. Microcredit portfolio in terms of GDP amounted to 12 percent.
Mentioning a "perfect storm" for Bolivia is pure speculation, not based on any empirical
model. Bolivia has had buffers for many years (Figure 2). Countries like Bolivia were using
the fiscal space to build such buffers and applying growth-enhancing and social policies
aimed to tackle poverty and inequality; however, if external conditions deteriorate Bolivia
will be forced to use its accumulated buffers but growth-policy cannot be abandoned at a cost
of reverting poverty to prior levels. The CBB’s credibility cannot be lost for none of the
reasons that the staff mentions. The staff’s statements, as such, can cause damage to
expectations of domestic and foreign economic agents and, therefore, the Bolivian economy.

The staff claims that financial entities would have difficulties reaching the credit quotas
established by the FSL based on calculations of portfolio growth. However, as previously
mentioned, the financial system has high liquidity ratios and enough capital to sustain credit
growth. In addition, staff does not consider social housing credits for their estimates in quota

10
calculation, which represents, up until September 2015, around 20 percent of the productive
portfolio. Partial credit guarantees recommended by the staff, are not an innovation since
they have already been applied since 2011.
The staff’s assertion that financial inclusion may improve with market-based mechanisms
has no technical support. Moreover, in the neoliberal period, when banking supervision was
low, more than 12 large financial entities (such as Banco Sur, Cochabamba, BIDESA,
Progreso, BBA, Potosi, Minero, and Agricola) failed between 1985 and 2000. Moreover,
financial intermediation during this period was smaller than 2006 onwards. In the past, loans
were mostly directed to consumption and services. At the same time, dollarization reached 97
percent in loans and 93 percent in deposits, which resulted in a very vulnerable financial
system in which the CBB’s role as lender of last resort was very limited and expensive.
Policy Recommendations
The Bolivian government does not agree with the IMF´s policy recommendations. Between
1986 and 2005 the six agreements with conditionality signed with the IMF did not solve
Bolivia´s economic problems, expressed in twin deficits, important foreign reserve losses,
high levels of foreign debt and a large financial dependence. On the contrary, since 2006,
Bolivia has implemented its economic policies with sovereignty and will not follow any IMF
policy recipe.
