EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•
Chile’s adherence to a sound and consistent policy framework has helped foster
macroeconomic stability and economic growth. In recent years, this policy framework has
been based on prudent fiscal policies in the context of the structural surplus rule, a successful
inflation targeting framework, and trade and financial openness.
•
The government is firmly committed to the structural surplus rule. The accounts of
the central government are projected to register an overall surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP in
2005, to be used mostly to prepay debt. The 2006 budget, to be approved by year-end by the
current administration, will continue to abide by the fiscal rule. The authorities intend to
introduce draft legislation in congress to further entrench fiscal responsibility.
•
Inflation expectations are well anchored near the middle of the target range. The
core inflation rate has risen in recent months, reflecting the gradual closing of the output gap
and the second-round effects of higher energy prices. Headline CPI inflation is projected to
be at the middle of the target range in 2005.
•
The central bank plans to continue gradually withdrawing monetary stimulus. It
has appropriately started to raise interest rates, and further increases will likely be needed,
depending on developments in inflation and the closing of the output gap.
•
The central bank is moving ahead with plans to reduce its yearly deficits. The joint
retirement of dollar-linked debt and reduction in foreign reserves will go some way toward
reducing the yearly deficits. The central bank and the central government are also working
together toward an agreement on a methodology for the government to cover the central
bank’s yearly deficits.
•
In the financial sector, progress in reforms awaits the approval of the Capital
Markets Reform II draft law by Congress. This approval remains critical to help ensure a
well-sequenced implementation of the FSAP recommendations.
•
The authorities and staff agreed that structural policies should focus on a
comprehensive approach to ensure strong and sustained medium term growth. This will
require further increasing human capital, while simultaneously continuing to improve income
distribution. Significant progress has been made toward achieving Chile’s Millennium
Development Goals.
•
All the main candidates in the December 2005 presidential elections broadly
support maintaining the current macroeconomic framework. The new government is
scheduled to take office in March 2006.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Chile’s adherence to a sound and consistent policy framework over the past two
decades has helped foster macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. This policy
framework has been based on prudent fiscal policies, a gradual move to inflation targeting,
and trade openness. During the 15-year period that ended in 1997, Chile’s rate of economic
growth averaged 6½ percent a year, per capita income more than doubled, and poverty rates
were cut in half. While economic growth slowed significantly during 1998–2003, to
2¾ percent a year on average, reflecting in part the regional financial crisis, the sharp
improvement in the terms of trade that started in mid-2003 contributed to a strong economic
rebound in 2004. The economic recovery has continued into 2005.
2.
Upon taking office in 2000, the current administration introduced a key fiscal
innovation—the structural surplus rule, while the central bank completed the transition to
a full-fledged inflation-targeting framework. Under the rule, fiscal policy is, for the first
time, anchored to a target—a cyclically-adjusted surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the accounts
of the central government. The rule has worked well, in very different macroeconomic
environments, providing effective countercyclical stimulus to the economy over the cycle.
The inflation targeting framework has been successful at keeping inflation low—2¾ percent
a year on average during 2000–04, while allowing the peso to float freely.
3.
Progress has been made in several areas since the last Article IV consultation, in
line with the views of Executive Directors. The fiscal stance has remained prudent; higher
revenue from the increase in copper prices has been sterilized; and the overall surplus of the
government used to selectively prepay debt. Also, the proposal to introduce a royalty in the
mining sector was modified and care was taken to ensure that the recently-introduced mining
fee does not negatively impact foreign investment. In the financial sector area, steps have
been taken to further improve risk management in the banking system and reduce risks in the
insurance industry, but the recapitalization of the central bank still has not taken place.
Prompt passage of the Capital Market II draft law by Congress would help ensure progress in
the reforms aimed at strengthening regulation and supervision of the securities industry.
4.
Congressional and presidential elections are scheduled for December 2005, with a
new administration taking office in March 2006. Political consensus in Chile on the
macroeconomic framework remains very strong. All the main candidates have reaffirmed
their commitment to fiscal prudence, inflation targeting, and trade openness. Policies to
maintain strong economic growth and further reduce income inequality are expected to
dominate the political debate, with emphasis on the issues of health, education, and support
to small and medium-sized enterprises.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
A strong external environment has
helped spur Chile’s economic growth in
2004 and early 2005 (Box 1). Robust
growth in the global economy, including
Asia―which absorbs one third of Chile’s
total exports, has helped boost mineral
export prices, particularly copper, Chile’s
main export commodity.1 During 2004 and
in early 2005, Chile’s year-on-year rate of
economic growth has been around 6 percent,
with a strong recovery in private investment,
particularly in mining, telecommunication,
transportation, and construction. In recent
months, the recovery has also been
supported by an increase in consumption,
driven by improved labor market prospects
and continued strength in consumer
borrowing. The rebound in the terms of
trade, a mining export boom (16 percent in
volume terms), and a strong performance of
nontraditional exports have resulted in a
current account surplus of 1½ percent of
GDP in 2004—an improvement of
3 percentage points from 2003.2
6.
Monetary policy has remained
supportive, with low pressure on inflation
during most of 2004. The Chilean peso has
continued to float freely and, reflecting the
improvement in Chile’s terms of trade, it has
appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar
since mid-2003. This has contributed to low
inflation, with the 12-month rate of increase
in the CPI remaining below the 2–4 percent

Chile is the world’s largest copper producer, with one third of global supply. Copper accounts for 10 percent of its
GDP and 35–45 percent of exports of goods.

The contribution of net exports to real GDP growth in the most recent quarters has been negative, however,
reflecting a sharp increase in imports in volume terms.

BOX 1. DEVELOPMENTS IN 2004 AND EARLY 2005
GDP growth. Real GDP grew by 6.1 percent in 2004. After
registering a strong rise during the last quarter of 2004
(7¼ percent on a year-on-year basis), the rate of economic
growth is estimated to have moderated to just over 6 percent
during January–May 2005.

Inflation. The 12-month headline inflation rate was
2.4 percent in December 2004, edging up to 2.7 percent by
June (with 12-month core inflation at 2.4 percent). Wage
growth moderated in recent years, averaging 3½ percent in
2004, but has recently inched up slightly, to 4¾ percent in
May.
Employment. Employment grew by 3.3 percent during 2004
and by 4.3 percent during the 12-month period ended in May
2005. Although strong economic growth encouraged more
workers to return to the labor market, the unemployment rate
has declined from 9.2 percent in May 2004 (seasonally
adjusted) to 8.1 percent in May 2005.
Current account balance. Boosted by improved terms of
trade, the current account registered a surplus of 1½ percent
in 2004. Copper prices have hovered at around US$1.50 a
pound in the first half of 2005, up from US$1.30 in 2004 and
US$0.81 in 2003. Nonmining exports also performed strongly
in 2004, rising by 11½ percent in volume terms.
Gross international reserves. At end-June 2005, reserves
amounted to US$16¾ billion (16½ percent of GDP and over
120 percent of short-term external debt).
Public sector accounts. The overall balance of the central
government registered a surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP in
2004. The quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank narrowed
slightly, from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2003 to 0.7 percent in
2004.
Exchange rate. During 2004, the Chilean peso appreciated
against the U.S. dollar in the first half of the year, but
reversed this change in the second half. So far in 2005, it has
remained broadly stable.

inflation target band of the central bank during most of 2004. In the context of a still weak
economic recovery, the monetary authorities eased their policy stance in late 2003 and early
2004. Later in the year, with the economic recovery well under way and with inflation
forecasts moving above the center of the target band, the central bank initiated a tightening
cycle. Since September 2004, it has raised its policy rate on seven occasions, by a total of
175 basis points, to 3½ percent in mid-July 2005. Nevertheless, monetary conditions still
remain supportive, with the policy rate only moderately positive in real terms.
7.
Consistent with the structural surplus rule, the position of the central government
improved sharply in 2004, and is expected to remain strong in 2005. The overall balance of
the central government shifted from a deficit of ½ percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of
2¼ percent in 2004. The government used most of the surplus to prepay debt—a total of
US$2 billion in 2004 and early 2005, including US$½ billion to multilaterals and
US$1¼ billion on a central bank loan extended at the time of the 1980s banking crisis.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Chile’s return to a strong macroeconomic performance testifies to the importance
of consistent policy frameworks and solid institutions. There was full agreement between
the staff and the authorities that the overall policy framework had contributed to the return of
sustained economic growth. Macroeconomic policy implementation has centered on wellestablished rules and institutions, reinforced in recent years by strict adherence to the
structural surplus rule, the sound implementation of the inflation targeting framework, and a
floating exchange rate regime. These policies, in the context of increasing trade integration
and a robust financial system, have helped provide counter-cyclical stimulus to the economy
while ensuring effective resilience to external shocks. There was agreement also that one of
the main tasks ahead would be to continue to improve the efficiency of the economy in order
to sustain high rates of economic growth and reduce poverty further.
A. Short-Term Economic Outlook
9.
The authorities and staff
concurred that the short-term outlook
remained very positive. Sentiment in the
business community was generally
bullish, with many participants
considering that the long-anticipated
economic recovery was wellentrenched. The authorities estimated
that, in the context of a favorable global
environment, real GDP growth would be
in the range of 5¼–6¼ percent in 2005

and 5½ percent in 2006—broadly in line with the staff forecast and that, on that basis, the
output gap would close in 2007. They considered that the pick-up in domestic demand,
particularly investment, would help support economic activity in 2005, while the impact of
net foreign demand would tail off. Domestic investment was projected to rise by
½ percentage point of GDP, to 22¼ percent of GDP, while consumption would also pick up,
boosted by higher incomes, an increase in employment, and strong consumer lending. A
possible source of weakness was a build-up in inventories observed over the preceding three
quarters, which could signal a somewhat weaker-than-anticipated growth in domestic
demand in the second half of this year.
10.
There was agreement also that, although some external risks could weigh
negatively on growth, these were limited in 2005. There was the risk that high oil prices
could lead to a slowdown in global demand and in Chilean exports. Existing global
imbalances could also lead to disorderly adjustments that would affect negatively the world
economy. However, in the short run, strong copper demand from Asia was likely to keep
prices at a high level, or perhaps even higher than projected at the time of the mission.3 The
authorities thought that the risks from regional political or economic instability would pose
few difficulties, as past experience had shown that Chile was able to attract foreign
investment even when unfavorable sentiment prevailed in some countries of the region.
11.
A source of concern was the supply of regional gas, including from Argentina.
During the first five months of 2005, actual exports of gas from Argentina to Chile fell to
about 75 percent of contractual levels, with significant and unpredictable daily variations.
However, the authorities noted that about three fourths of Chilean firms that use gas in the
production process had already converted their plants to use alternative sources of energy
when needed. In addition, new hydroelectric plants have come into production or are under
construction. Therefore, the direct impact of gas cuts on domestic output was expected to be
small—amounting at most to ¼ percent of GDP in 2005. However, there were also indirect
effects on production costs in the economy, associated with the shift from gas to more costly
alternatives.
12.
Chile has built important safeguards against potential vulnerabilities. Total public
debt (including central bank debt) has declined from 41½ percent of GDP in 2001 to
35 percent in 2004, and public external debt has dropped to about 10 percent. Private
external debt has also fallen significantly as a share of GDP in recent years, from about
48 percent in 2001–02 to 36 percent at end-2004.4 Although external debt is mostly
denominated in foreign currencies, net exposures to exchange rate fluctuations remain
limited, with about 40 percent of private external debt originating in the tradable good

Copper prices have further increased in recent weeks, from US$1.45 a pound in late May to around US$1.65 a
pound in late June, with world copper inventories reportedly at a 31-year low.

sectors. Moreover, in the nontradable good sectors, financial hedging against currency risks
has increased in recent years and is available at relatively moderate costs. The central bank
has built important buffers against external risks, with gross official reserves amounting to
US$16 billion at end-2004, equivalent to 17 percent of GDP and covering more than
110 percent of debt maturing during the year.
B. Fiscal Policy under the Structural Surplus Rule
The authorities and staff agreed that the structural rule, in place since 2000, has
served Chile well. The rule aims at maintaining a cyclically-adjusted surplus of 1 percent of
GDP in the accounts of the central government. Under the rule, the government saves all
copper revenues from the state copper company CODELCO above a long-term reference price
for copper. Other central government revenue is smoothed over the business cycle, using an
estimate of potential output. With the help of two independent panels of experts, the
government estimates structural revenue adjusted for the long-term price of copper and
potential GDP (Box 2). Central government expenditures are set in the budget law, so that the
difference between structural revenue and actual expenditure is equal to 1 percent of GDP.
13.

BOX 2: THE ROLE OF THE TWO INDEPENDENT PANELS OF EXPERTS
•

Composition. Each year, the Finance Ministry assembles two independent panels of
experts. Each panel is composed of 12–14 members who are widely regarded as experts in
their fields. The Finance Ministry has been careful to ensure that the panels have a
balanced representation, particularly the potential output panel, where there is generally a
wide dispersion of views.

•

Consultation. The panels are consulted each year prior to the preparation of the budget. To
ensure transparency, the information requested from the panels is specific, and all
information is published on the website of the Budget Office immediately after the panels
have met.

•

Copper price panel. The Finance Ministry asks this panel to provide a ten-year forecast of
copper prices, and the reference price is set as the arithmetic average of the forecasts
(excluding two most extreme estimates). For 2005, the long-term reference copper price
was set at US$0.93 a pound.

•

Potential output panel. From the panel, the ministry requests growth forecasts of: (i) labor
force; (ii) real investment; and (iii) total factor productivity. Officials compute an average
of these forecasts (excluding the two most extreme values) and use them to estimate the
output gap from a production function. At the suggestion of the expert panel, officials have
made successive improvements to the production function estimates.

- 11 -

14.
The structural surplus rule constitutes a useful tool for policy making in terms of
budget preparation, benchmark for spending and revenue targets, and transparency
(Box 3). In recent years, this rule has served as the primary pillar of fiscal policy. The rule
allows the government to run deficits when economic growth is below trend—during
2000-03, the deficit averaged ⅔ percent of GDP a year—and to accumulate surpluses when
the external environment is favorable and economic growth strong. In 2004, the central
government registered an overall surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP, and it is projected to register
surpluses averaging 13 ⁄4 percent of GDP in 2005–06.
BOX 3. THE FISCAL RULE, A USEFUL TOOL FOR POLICIES
•

Budget preparation. At the time of the budget preparation, the rule provides useful ex-ante
guidance for setting spending plans. Revenue projections are based on the long-run copper price
and projected output levels, with reliance on the two panels of experts.

•

Benchmark for spending and revenue targets. During the year, the spending target is actively
used to constrain fiscal policy. In January and June, the Budget Office updates revenue and
spending forecasts and, if needed, takes steps to raise revenue or cut spending.

•

Spending adjustments. The rule includes few adjustments, which aids in transparency but makes
it stricter. For example, there are no adjustments for changes in inflation or exchange rates.
However, some flexibility exists to shift the savings under one expenditure line to other lines. The
rule also includes a small contingency fund (¼ percent of GDP) to expand emergency
employment programs or increase capital expenditure by up to 10 percent over budgetary
allocations, while remaining within the 1 percent structural surplus limit.

•

Transparency. The fiscal rule has helped promote fiscal transparency and compliance with
international standards. In particular, in recent years the authorities have brought greater
transparency and discipline to military spending—including spending previously treated in offbudget accounts. At present, most government operations, including extra-budgetary operations,
are treated according to the 2001 Government Financial Statistics Manual.

15.
The authorities were planning to introduce a draft law in congress to formalize
some aspects of the rule, including with respect to future pension liabilities. The initiative
would seek the creation of two funds to be included in the structural surplus rule: (i) one to
allow for employment spending during periods of high unemployment; and (ii) another one
to build resources for future pension payments. Regarding future pension payments, the
authorities agreed with the staff that the coverage of the pension system had fallen short of
the original goals of the reform. In particular, many workers are not participating in the
pension system long enough to qualify for a minimum pension.5 As a result, they are running
5

See the accompanying Selected Issues Papers on “Addressing the Long-run Shortfalls of the Chilean Pension
System”. To qualify for a minimum pension, workers must contribute at least twenty years.

the risk that they will reach old age with insufficient savings to fund an adequate pension.
The authorities’ objective would thus be to pre-fund a government account that would
gradually help mitigate the future costs of old-age programs. Staff encouraged the authorities
to design this mechanism in such a way that it does not discourage workers from contributing
to their own retirement accounts. The draft law would also aim at strengthening the internal
audit of the government and require future governments to publish an annual estimate of the
structural budget balance.
16.
Based on their experience with the fiscal rule, the authorities thought that some
adjustments could be made in the future to strengthen counter-cyclical policies. They
noted that it was conceivable that the 1 percent of GDP level of the structural surplus could
be changed at some point in the future, particularly if the definition of the fiscal accounts
were to be broadened to include the quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank. The authorities
also noted that there was still a pro-cyclical bias in revenue and spending because the
estimates of structural revenue used to establish the expenditure level did not seem to fully
smooth out the swings in income tax and VAT collections over the business cycle. They
noted that, by capturing the cyclicality of revenue better, they would be able to follow the
practice in several OECD countries, under which expenditure is allowed to rise during
economic downturns, in part to make room for unemployment benefit payments. Such a
change would help provide an additional component to existing counter-cyclical policies.
Staff also suggested that the definition of copper-related operations in the copper price
adjustor could be broadened to include, inter alia, corporate tax payments by private mining
companies and the proceeds from the recently-introduced fee on mining activity.6
17.
Fiscal projections point to a
central government surplus equivalent to
2¼ percent of GDP in 2005.7 Revenue
projections take into account the steady
increase in tax collections registered in
recent months, particularly income taxes
and VAT receipts, reflecting higher
corporate profits, a sharp increase in
domestic demand, and improvements in
tax administration. As a percent of GDP,
expenditure has been declining in recent
years, from 22½ percent in 1999–2000 to
20¼ percent in 2004, despite increases in

The law, approved by congress in May 2005, introduces a 3–5 percent fee on the operating profits of large
mining companies, with expected annual proceeds of US$100–$150 million. This fee does not apply to
investments undertaken under the preferential tax treatment for foreign investors (D.L. 600).

In line with WEO projections, the staff’s fiscal projections assume an average price of copper of US$1.41 a
pound in 2005.

social spending averaging 4 percent a year in real terms (Figure 4). The mission took the
view that, in 2005, it would be important to avoid permanent increases in spending and to
keep the rate of expenditure growth to a moderate level (the budget already assumes a
5½ percent increase in expenditure in real terms). It thus strongly encouraged the authorities
to save any excess tax revenue. The authorities expected the preparation of the budget for
2006 to be finalized by September, and indicated that it would be consistent with the fiscal
rule, even though it would be implemented by the next administration. On the basis of
projected WEO copper prices, the balance of the central government would show a surplus of
around 1½ percent of GDP in 2006.
18.
The authorities intend to use the strength of the fiscal position to consolidate their
debt management strategy. They plan to continue using the forthcoming surpluses to retire
debt and replenish the Copper Stabilization Fund (the Debt Sustainability Analysis is
presented in Appendix IV). The Finance Ministry has been coordinating the issuance of new
public debt with the central bank, with a view to establishing government benchmarks in the
long-term segment of the market while the central bank focuses on short- and medium-term
issues. During the remainder of 2005, the government does not plan to issue new bonds in
the international markets, but it is considering placing a ten-year peso-denominated issue
locally. It also plans to participate in the Euroclear trading system, with a view to facilitating
the access of international investors to the domestic market.
C. A Sound and Credible Monetary Policy Framework
19.
Implementation of the inflation targeting framework has been successful in
reducing inflation and anchoring expectations. Under this framework, the central bank
aims at keeping expected CPI inflation within the 2–4 percent target range over a
12-24 month horizon. Although the 12-month rate of headline inflation trailed below the
lower end of the central bank’s target range during most of 2004, it has returned well within
the target range since end-2004. In recent months, core inflation has also returned within the
target band and inflation expectations have been close to the mid-range of the target band.
20.
The staff enquired whether the
below-target inflation outturn in 2004
reflected an undershooting bias in policy
decisions. The authorities stressed their
commitment to a symmetric treatment of the
lower and upper ends of the target range and
observed that, in recent years, the monetary
policy response has been broadly
appropriate. Specifically, they noted that, in
the face of downward pressures on prices in
late 2003-early 2004, the central bank had
decisively cut its policy rate by a total of
100 basis points. They attributed the sharp

bank began gradually raising its policy
rate. By that time, the pick up in economic activity also justified withdrawing monetary
stimulus. These actions have helped keep inflation expectations well anchored near the middle
of the 2–4 percent target range.
21.
There was agreement that the gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus should
continue. The monetary authorities noted that the policy rate remained below its neutral level
and indicated that they planned to continue reducing the stimulus gradually. They recognized
that there was some uncertainty about the actual level of the neutral rate, but interpreted the
recent increase in underlying inflation as an indication that a neutral policy stance would
require further tightening. The staff noted that the still benign price pressures, firmly
anchored expectations, and high credibility of the central bank suggested a measured
approach to tightening, particularly given the uncertainties about the level of the neutral rate.
The authorities generally agreed and stressed that the next moves in interest rates would
depend on developments in inflation and the closing of the output gap.
22.
Staff shared the central bank’s view that the inflation target band of 2–4 percent
remained appropriate. Staff enquired whether the low rates of inflation registered during
2004 warranted consideration of a lower target range. Central bank officials thought that the
2-4 percent target range was appropriate for Chile, for a series of reasons. First, in emerging
market countries, there tends to be a relatively high upward measurement bias in price
indices because, typically, large relative price changes result in pronounced variations in the
composition of the consumption baskets. Second, the target range provides a buffer for
adjustments in relative prices, given the downward rigidity in nominal wages associated in
part with still-widespread wage indexation. Third, setting the target at too low a level carries
risks of entering into deflation. The authorities also noted that changing the target range
could undermine the credibility of the central bank and weaken the nominal anchor value of
the target. The staff fully agreed with the central bank that the inflation target range should
be kept at the 2–4 percent level. Central bank officials are in the process of developing a fullfledged dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to complement their current
set of macro-econometric forecasting models. Staff welcomed the central bank’s efforts

- 15 -

toward further enhancing its forecasting framework and, in that context, its plans to deepen
its understanding of the transmission mechanism.
23.
The central bank is moving ahead with its plan to reduce its yearly deficits. Since
November 2003, after a comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and costs of holding
international liquidity, it has embarked on a program to gradually redeem its stock of dollardenominated bonds while simultaneously reducing its stock of gross international reserves.8
The U.S. dollar debt stock has been cut by about US$1 billion, to US$5 billion, and the
central bank plans to reduce it further by US$2½ billion during the remainder of 2005. The
joint retirement of dollar-linked debt and reduction in foreign reserves is projected to help
narrow further the deficit of central bank to about ½ percent of GDP in 2005. The authorities
were confident that the associated reduction in gross international reserves was well
anticipated by the market and would therefore have no adverse impact on financial stability.
24.
The gradual recapitalization of the central bank awaits finalization of an
agreement on a new methodology with the government. While previously the authorities
had envisaged that the government would recapitalize the central bank upfront, the
government now plans to cover the central bank’s yearly deficits. To this end, discussions are
ongoing between the central bank and the government on a definition of these deficits and on
a mechanism to compensate for them. Staff stressed that an appropriate mechanism should
help ensure that the annual payments are transparently registered in the fiscal accounts and
do not impair the institutional independence of the central bank while gradually helping
rebuild its capital.
25.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to a flexible exchange rate.
They noted that, since the Chilean peso has
been floating freely, it has displayed more
volatility than in the past, reflecting in part
developments in the external terms of trade
and in the major currencies. However, the
economy had adapted well to this new
situation and the market for financial
hedges had grown rapidly. Furthermore,
upward pressures on the peso had
moderated in the course of the past year,
reflecting in part high public sector saving

(effectively sterilizing part of the improvement in the terms of trade), an increase in the
foreign assets of pension funds, and financial intermediaries’ investments abroad to take
advantage of arbitrage opportunities. In real effective terms, the peso has appreciated by
about 10 percent since mid-2003, following a depreciation of close to 29 percent from early
1998 to mid-2003—suggesting that competitiveness remains appropriate. In addition, wage
increases in the industrial sector have been moderate in recent years, averaging 1¼ percent a
year in real terms over the past three years. In the authorities’ view, a stronger increase in
nominal wages in recent months and the reduction in official working hours (from 48 hours
to 45 hours) that became effective in early 2005 have been accompanied by large
productivity gains, leaving unit labor costs broadly unchanged. However, they recognized
that the recent pick up in nominal wage increases would need to be kept under close scrutiny,
to ensure that it does not lead to pressure on inflation.
D. Financial Sector Issues
26.
The Chilean banking sector is robust, with strong profits and a low level of
impaired assets. Capital adequacy is 13½ percent and the ratio of nonperforming loans to
total loans has remained low, at 1¼ percent in May 2005, with a provisioning rate of over
160 percent. Consumer lending has begun to moderate, with the 12-month rate of growth
down from 37 percent in December 2004 to 23 percent in May 2005. Despite this relatively
rapid increase in consumer lending, bank supervisors were confident that the risk
classification and provisioning procedures remained adequate. They also noted that the
increase registered during 2004–05 was taking place after several years of virtually flat
consumer lending, and from a low base. The growth of this high-margin market contributed
to an increase in banks’ return on equity to 19 percent in the 12-month period ended in
April 2005.
27.
Although competition in the banking sector has intensified with the entrance of
niche players, staff analysis suggests that there is further room for competition in the
sector.9 Cross-country comparisons show that the profitability of Chilean banks is above
what can be explained by macroeconomic and banking sector characteristics in Chile.
Although regulatory barriers to entry are low, competition from other non-bank financial
intermediaries still plays a small role and the restrictions on the investments of private
pension funds (the largest institutional depositors) remain in place, both of which appear to
have contributed to high bank profitability.
28.
Progress in the implementation of the 2004 FSAP recommendations awaits the
approval of the Capital Market Reform II draft law by Congress. The FSAP stressed the
need for greater competition in financial services, modernization of the securities markets
infrastructure, and reforms of the segmented financial oversight organization to enhance
efficiency and risk management. The recent change in regulations that allow banks and
9

- 17 -

corporates to trade call and put options is a further step toward implementing the FSAP
recommendations. Many FSAP recommendations, including netting arrangements for
derivatives, and institutionalizing the Committee of Superintendents, are to be addressed in
the comprehensive Capital Markets Reform II law (CMII). However, this draft law has so far
stalled in Congress, in part because of the difficulty to secure consensus on technically
complex financial issues. The mission noted that prompt approval of the draft law was
critical to help ensure a well-sequenced implementation of FSAP recommendations. The
authorities reiterated their hope that the law could be approved in the coming months.
29.
In the pension and insurance sectors, progress on further reforms has been limited.
In late 2004, the authorities prepared proposals aimed at introducing more competition
among private pension funds and a risk-based approach in the management of their
investments. The debate on these issues is still ongoing, and the authorities noted that they
needed more time to build consensus. In the insurance sector, the annuities market plays a
unique role in Chile as the natural continuation of the pension fund system during retirement.
To help minimize the contingent liabilities of the government associated with the guarantees
that it provides on the minimum annuity performance, the mission called for vigilant
supervision of the insurance market. The officials noted that the update in mortality tables to
fully reflect higher life expectancies and the associated increase in provisioning requirements
are expected to help reduce default risks, but that improvements to credit risk regulations
were still pending.
30.
Domestic capital market activity is buoyant, with new bond issues of US$2–3 billion
a year. Chilean long-term interest rates are broadly in line with long-term rates in mature
markets, at around 2½ percent for 10-year inflation-adjusted bonds. The market for financial
hedges has grown rapidly in recent years, enhanced by an increase in the supply of foreign
exchange rate hedges by pension funds.10 To further enhance the development of the
financial market, the staff suggested to gradually phase out the stamp tax and the retention
tax on lending by non-residents. The authorities agreed that these taxes introduced
distortions, but did not see room to reduce them in the near future because of the large
associated tax collections.
31.
In the area of AML/CFT, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) became fully
operational in May 2005. In November 2004, it was accepted as an Egmont member and, in
April 2005, MFD provided training to its staff. New legislation, enhancing the ability of the
FIU to obtain information, is expected to be approved by Congress during 2005. GAFISUD
is in the process of assessing the regulatory oversight of its members for cash remittances,
and the mission encouraged the authorities to participate in this project.

10

Pension funds are required to hedge a proportion of their assets abroad, above a certain threshold. At end2004, about 55 percent of their assets abroad were covered by forward contracts.

- 18 -

E. Laying the Ground for Strong and Equitable Medium-Term Growth
32.
The authorities and staff agreed that structural policies should focus on a
comprehensive approach to medium-term growth. The mission noted that implementation
of the government’s Pro-Growth Agenda had helped deepen the reform efforts and promote
total factor productivity growth. The authorities, as well as most players in the political
spectrum, recognized that it would only be possible to sustain strong long-term growth by
further increasing human capital, while simultaneously continuing to improve income
distribution. Significant progress has been made toward achieving Chile’s Millennium
Development Goals (Table 9).
Income distribution, Education, and Health
33.
Chile has significantly reduced
poverty in the past two decades. Reflecting
the impact of high economic growth and the
implementation of well-targeted social
programs, poverty rates have been reduced
from 38½ percent in 1990 to 19 percent in
2003. The government has introduced a series
of programs aimed at supporting the poor,
including Chile Solidario, a program to
support the most vulnerable groups, with
transfers to beneficiaries tied to clearly
articulated, step-by-step, self-help programs.
The program has already incorporated about
160,000 families (the target is to reach
225,000 families) with a success rate of
70 percent in achieving individual program
targets. However, income distribution remains
highly concentrated. In 2003, the richest
20 percent of the population accounted for
56½ percent of all factor income received by
households, or 14½ times more than the
lowest quintile.11 According to official data,
this figure is reduced by about half (to
7½ times) once the value of all government
transfers is accounted for.

importance of improving education as a key step toward equitable growth, and highlighted
the recent reforms in this area. The government is seeking to improve pre-school coverage
for low income groups by extending the voucher subsidies to the most vulnerable 40 percent
of the population in 2005. With respect to access to primary and secondary education,
sizeable improvements have been made over the last decade, but the quality of education
remains uneven and relatively low, as shown by international assessments of student
knowledge. To give better-performing schools an incentive to take on low-income students
and reduce socio-economic stratification, the government plans to substantially increase the
value of vouchers for students from vulnerable groups. The authorities agreed with the staff
that there was a need also to improve incentives to teachers, including by allowing greater
pay differentiation according to performance. The government is taking steps to improve
access to tertiary education for low income families. Although such access has improved
over the last decade, only around 15 percent of students from low income families go to the
university, less than half the national average. In 2005, the government introduced a new
student loan program targeted at 9,000 low income students attending public and private
universities.
35.
The government is also pressing ahead with reforms in the health care sector. To
help improve targeting and better match payments with the severity of illnesses, the
government introduced the AUGE plan in 2001. Under this plan, the authorities provide an
incentive structure to encourage doctors to treat priority diseases that have the largest impact
on patients and their families. At present, 25 conditions are covered, and this number will
rise gradually to 56 in 2007. Over the long-term, the reform establishes a cap on total
spending, to limit pressures to expand the program. Officials forecast that, by 2007, the
AUGE plan would cost the equivalent of ¾ percent of GDP (up from ¼ percent in 2005), but
they also anticipate that some of these costs will be offset by saving from improvements in
care and incentives to treat those diseases that are the most costly to society.
Business Environment, Research and Development, and Labor Markets
Chile provides a stable institutional and legal environment for business, but there is
room to increase innovation efforts as a way to diversify the economy. The authorities
noted that investment in R&D is equivalent to about ½ percent of GDP, while developed
countries spend over 2 percent of GDP on average (and innovative countries over 3 percent
of GDP). A recent report of Congress has shown that there is little coordination between the
private sector and the scientific community, research activities are generally biased toward
basic research, and private sector participation in financing and conducting R&D is low.12
Also, in comparison with other Latin American countries, Chile’s share of high-technology
exports as a percent of total manufacturing exports is relatively low (Figure 10). The
authorities planned to send a draft law to Congress to create a special fund to finance
36.

innovation activities with the proceeds
from the recently-introduced fee on
mining activity.13 This would increase
the public resources devoted to R&D by
about 50 percent. In addition, the draft
law envisages the creation of a National
Innovation Council, formed by the
government, members of the scientific
community, and the corporate sector, to
design a strategy and mechanisms for
allocating the resources of the fund.

The staff took the view that

Chile could benefit from further
standardization and streamlining of businesses procedures and a more flexible labor
market. Administrative procedures for business creation generally remain cumbersome,
particularly at the municipal level, and information about applicable regulations varies across
jurisdictions and is not easily available. The authorities noted that the central government
had initiated a voluntary pilot program (“Ventanilla de Tramites Municipales”) providing
technical support to municipalities to improve administrative procedures. Also, the
bankruptcy law was revised in 2004 to help improve liquidation procedures and reduce
liquidation costs, and the Senate is currently discussing proposals to introduce outside
arbitration between firms and creditors to avoid costly liquidation processes. In the labor
area, several studies have shown that Chile exhibits significant labor market inflexibility, in
part as a result of still widespread practices of inflation-indexed wage contracts, binding
minimum wages for low-skilled workers, high severance payments, and cumbersome rules
for worker dismissal. However, the authorities were not considering any new specific
initiatives in this area in the near future.
Electricity Regulation
38.
To help address the impact of gas cuts from Argentina, the government has
introduced a series of reforms aimed at securing uninterrupted energy supply in the
coming years. Electricity tariffs for regulated consumers were increased by 12–15 percent in
June 2005, following increases in generation prices (node prices) of about 30 percent. The
authorities explained that a recently-approved revised energy law (Ley Corta II) introduces
significant changes to the regulatory framework to provide incentives for investment and
diversification by: (i) establishing bidding mechanisms for long-term supply contracts
between electricity-generating and distributing companies that set fixed long-term prices,
13

To smooth out spending by the newly created fund, government transfers to this fund would be computed on
the basis of long-term copper prices.

- 21 -

reducing uncertainty for investments in generation; (ii) excluding gas supply cuts from the
conditions that can be invoked as “force majeure”, thus providing incentives for generating
companies to seek alternative sources of energy; (iii) widening the band around unregulated
prices, to allow a faster reaction of regulated prices to large shocks and to increase the passthrough of generation costs, reducing risks to electricity-generating companies; and
(iv) allowing the introduction of price incentives to consumers for reducing electricity
consumption during peak periods.
Trade Policy
39.
The mission commended the authorities for their continued progress toward trade
liberalization. Beside their active participation in the Doha round, the authorities have
finalized several bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) in recent years, including with the
United States, the European Union, and Korea. At end-2004, Chile’s external tariff rates
averaged only 2.1 percent, with half of total exports and over one third of imports realized
with countries with which it had signed an FTA. In June 2004, a “trans-Pacific” trade pact
was agreed upon with Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei, which will effectively eliminate
tariffs on 90 percent of the goods traded between the countries. In recent weeks, a second
round of negotiations on a bilateral free-trade agreement took place with China, and a second
round of negotiations is also expected to take place in the near future with India.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The Chilean authorities are to be commended for their skilled management of the
economy. Sound macroeconomic policies have helped entrench low inflation and sustained
growth, while contributing to a significant reduction in poverty, and Chile plays a regional
leadership role in terms of political stability and economic reform. The authorities are taking
advantage of the favorable global environment to strengthen the fiscal position and further
open the economy, while gradually removing monetary stimulus. On the basis of current
projections for the global economy, the Chilean outlook remains strong for 2005 and 2006,
with internal demand gradually replacing the impulse from net exports.
41.
The authorities’ strict adherence to the structural surplus rule, as well as the
decision to use most of the fiscal surpluses to prepay debt, are commendable. Staff
considers that the structural surplus rule has served Chile well, and the authorities’ strong
commitment to the rule in times of high copper prices has helped entrench the rule further.
Staff would recommend that the authorities save any tax collections in excess of budgetary
projections in 2005.
42.
In the future, it will be important to preserve the main aspects of the rule, while
accumulating resources to cover future liabilities. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to
establish a fund to prepare for future social programs and encourages the authorities to
design it in a way that does not deter workers from contributing to their own retirement
accounts. With respect to the plans to address the yearly deficits of the central bank, it will be

- 22 -

important to define the coverage of these deficits appropriately, to ensure a gradual
recapitalization of the bank.
43.
With the high credibility of the central bank, Chile’s inflation-targeting framework
has been effective in bringing inflation down to low levels. In recent months, the central
bank has appropriately been taking steps toward gradually removing monetary stimulus and
has reaffirmed its intention to continue tightening as needed. Despite the closing of the
output gap, cost pressures have generally remained limited, reflecting in part the still high
unemployment rate. However, the recent increase in nominal wages will have to be kept
under close scrutiny to ensure that it does not lead to pressure on inflation.
44.
The financial sector is strong, but delays have been registered in the adoption of
reforms. Prompt approval of the Capital Market II draft law by Congress would help make
headway in several areas which are key to the further development of the financial market. It
will be important also to implement the reforms needed in the areas of insurance supervision
and the pension regime and, over time, to phase out the stamp and retention taxes.
45.
Chile has taken prompt action to address the issues raised by shortages in the
supply of gas. A revised energy law was recently approved, aimed at adjusting electricity
prices, promoting a steady flow of investments into the sector, and encouraging energy
savings. The staff commends the authorities and Congress for taking immediate action to
adjust electricity prices and reorient electricity generation.
46.
Chile is benefiting from its sustained emphasis on free trade. Tariff rates have fallen
to very low levels, including with the signing of free trade agreements with the European
Union, the United States, and Korea in recent years. Further steps are now being taken with
several countries, including in Asia, toward new free trade agreements.
47.
The authorities’ emphasis on promoting strong medium-term growth and reducing
income inequality is well advised. The government recognizes that the synergies between
income redistribution and growth are strongest in the area of education. To that effect, it is
promoting pre-schooling on a universal basis, providing education subsidies to low-income
households, and enhancing financing for tertiary education. The authorities’ intention to
increase funding for research and development is welcome, provided appropriate
mechanisms are designed to ensure an efficient allocation of resources.
48.
A still relatively high unemployment rate remains a challenge. In recent months,
employment has grown steadily and unemployment has declined, but it remains relatively
high. The authorities’ programs have gone some way toward reducing unemployment, and it
is expected that continued economic growth will help ensure a more pronounced reduction in
the unemployment rate. Introducing more flexibility in the labor market in the medium term
would be important to ensure a sustained reduction in unemployment.

49.
Chile’s medium term outlook remains favorable. Public debt ratios are low, and
private external debt has declined significantly as a share of GDP in recent years. The level
of this debt does not give rise to concern because it is at relatively long terms and financial
hedging is available. Maturing debt is more than covered by the stock of gross foreign
reserves.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Chile be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Chile—Financial Relations with the World Bank
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Chile, covering Fiscal Years
2002-06, was discussed by the Executive Board of the Bank in February 2002. The CAS
calls for selectively focusing on areas in which the government felt that the Bank could be
instrumental in ensuring the successful implementation of its initiatives. To that aim, the
strategy proposed to diversify the forms of financial assistance by providing direct financing
through regular investment and policy-based lending, as well as contingent financing. A new
CAS is planned for the fourth quarter of FY06.
The CAS reflects efforts by the current administration to address persistent social
challenges through improvements in human capital. Support in the area of human capital
development has been provided through the Science for Knowledge Economy Project
(FY03), which fosters the development of an effective innovation system and aims at
improving the stock of human capital in the Chilean science and technology sector.
Additional support in this area has been provided through the Lifelong Learning and
Training Project (FY02), with the participation of the private sector.
The CAS also reflects the current administration’s focus on improving the inclusion of
rural populations and vulnerable groups and the social safety net. In line with this
objective, in FY05 the Bank approved the Infrastructure for Rural Development Project,
which aims at improving the access of rural communities to infrastructure services. Support
in the area of social protection has been provided under the Social Protection Adjustment
Loan DDO (FY04) and the accompanying TA loan, which aims at increasing access to social
services for the neediest households. This loan also supports Chile Solidario.
The IFC provides support for private infrastructure, small and medium enterprises,
specialized financing in housing, and the social sector. The IFC considers that other
countries, both within and outside the Latin America region, can learn form the Chilean
experience. In addition, the IFC provides support to Chilean companies in their efforts to
grow abroad. MIGA’s support is expected to facilitate foreign direct investment in Chile.
There are currently six investment loans in Chile’s operations portfolio, totaling
US$330.7 million in commitments. One of these loans, the Higher Education Project
(FY99), had already been approved when the present CAS was discussed. The remaining five
loans, in support of Public Expenditure Management (FY02), Lifelong Learning (FY02),
Science for the Knowledge Economy (FY03), Social Protection TA Loan (FY04), and
Infrastructure for Territorial Development (FY05) are covered by the current CAS. A Social
Protection Adjustment Loan DDO in the amount of US$200 million, also approved in FY04,
has been fully disbursed. The FY06 program includes the first of two Programmatic
Development Policy Loans for the Santiago Urban Transport (DPL1) and the accompanying
TA loan, and the Tertiary Education Finance for Results Project. These loans were approved
by the Executive Board of the Bank on July 5, 2005.

APPENDIX III

Chile—Statistical Issues
Chile’s economic and financial data are of good quality, timely, and adequate for
surveillance purposes. Chile has subscribed to the SDDS in May 1996 and met all
specifications by end-March 2000.
Monetary and real sectors
The central bank publishes comprehensive statistics on the real and monetary sectors on a
bi-weekly basis. Following technical assistance from STA, new and more comprehensive GDP
series were published by the central bank in March 2005. Also, STA has recently helped to
improve the classification and sectorization, and to expand the institutional coverage of the
monetary accounts. The improved monetary statistics were published starting with the July 2003
issue of International Financial Statistics; and revised time series based on the new
methodology are now available for the period since December 1997.
Without prior notice, the National Statistical Institute (INE) changed the CPI weightings of
the telecommunications sector in April, resulting in a downward revision to core CPI. In
response to criticism, INE announced that it would submit any future proposed changes to the
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, seeking approval.
Government finances
Following agreements reached with the Fund in 2002, the authorities have made
substantial progress in implementing the GFSM 2001. They made significant
improvements regarding coverage, classification, and consolidation. The authorities have
developed a statement of central government operations with consolidation of extrabudgetary
central government units, and the reclassification of budgetary revenue and spending. A new
functional classification of total outlays for the central government aligned with international
standards has been disseminated. In addition separate sets of accounts were compiled for
municipalities and for public corporations. A detailed description of the methodologies,
institutional tables on coverage, and data for the entire public sector were made available in
the October 2004 publication Estadísticas de las Finanzas Públicas 1987–2003.
More progress is expected by end-2005. The authorities expect to produce estimates for the
consumption of fixed capital and apply accrual and cash accounting using the System of
Information for the Financial Management of the Public Sector. This will permit the
compilation of opening and closing balance sheets covering the central government,
municipalities and public corporations.
Following 2004 FAD recommendations to reinforce fiscal transparency, the Ministry of
Finance included in the October 2004 Public Finance Report on the Budget Law Project
a set of complementary information. It includes debt liabilities and financial assets of the

- 37 -

APPENDIX III

central government, contingent liabilities (especially government guarantees and
concessions), and tax expenditures.
However, further improvements are needed. The most urgent are: disaggregating
subsidies and grants by level of government; disseminating more detailed data on functional
outlays by the level of government; disseminating data on military debt; and reconciling the
recording of interest across liabilities, especially with regard to dollar-denominated bonds
versus dollar-indexed bonds.
Balance of payments and external debt
The central bank compiles balance of payments and external debt statistics on a
quarterly basis, and publishes selected statistics on the external sector on a weekly
basis. Beginning in 2002, the central bank has been publishing the International Investment
Position consistent with the balance of payments.
However, the coverage of the military sector in the external statistics is not complete. In
particular, the accuracy of data on military imports needs to be verified, as imports that do
not go through customs are estimated by the central bank. Also, if the military receives
external credits, information on this may not be available to the central bank; therefore, such
financing may not appear in the balance of payments or external debt statistics. Published
data on military expenditure are outdated.

APPENDIX IV

Chile—Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
1.
This appendix assesses Chile’s gross debt sustainability. Public debt appears
sustainable under the stress test scenarios, but private external debt remains sensitive to
foreign exchange rate shocks. However, the presence of natural hedges in the export sector
and access to financial hedges in the nontradable sector mitigates the risks to external debt
sustainability.
2.
Most external vulnerability indicators have improved in 2004, reflecting strong
economic growth and favorable external conditions. Strong economic activity, together
with the strengthening of the Chilean peso against the U.S. dollar have helped reduce
external debt from 58¾ percent of GDP at end-2003 to 46½ percent at end-2004. Over the
same period, total public debt has been reduced from 40 percent of GDP to 35 percent. Debt
prepayments by the central government has also helped reduce the external public debt-toGDP ratio by over 2 percentage points, to 10½ percent at end-2004. Private external debt
ratios have also improved significantly, at 36 percent of GDP at end-2004 (down from
46 percent at end-2003).
3.
Under the medium-term baseline scenario, the fiscal prudence—as embedded in
the structural surplus rule—would lead to a further decline in the already low government
debt-to-GDP ratio.1 Reflecting the

stock of central government debt would
be eliminated between 2012 and 2030. In
most of the bounds tests, which assume significant shocks, the debt stock would remain low
and not exceed 20 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the current forecast of the overall balance
remains comfortably above any level needed to stabilize the debt ratios (Table 1).

1

A small amount of the debt of the armed forces, estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP, is not published, and
therefore not included in the stock of public debt. The stock of the recognition bonds issued by the government
in recognition of the pension liabilities incurred under the old public pension regime was equivalent to
13¾ percent of GDP by end-2004. The recognition bonds are not included in the debt stock, but their
amortization is included.

- 40 -

APPENDIX IV

4.
At end-2004, the stock of central bank debt was equivalent to 23¾ percent of GDP.
This stock, held entirely by domestic residents, is broadly offset by international reserves
(the net debt of the central bank was equivalent to only 1½ percent of GDP). Computations
including the debt of the central bank show that total public debt would decline from
35 percent of GDP in 2004 to just under 29 percent in 2010.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt would remain contained over the
medium-term, but it remains sensitive to large swings in the foreign exchange rate. Under
the baseline scenario, the external debt ratio would fall slightly, from 46¼ percent of GDP in
2005 to 41½ percent in 2010 (Figure 2).

40 percent of the private sector external
debt is held in the tradable goods sector
where revenue is naturally hedged; another 25 percent is held by financial institutions, where
regulations have ensured careful management of exposures to currency movements; and
there is increasing use of financial hedges in the non-tradable goods sectors.

12/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Gross debt of the central government. The forecast for the debt stock implicitly includes the effect of the redemption of recognition bonds (amortizations amount to around 1¼ percent of GDP annually in the forecast horizon). The recognition bonds are converted to debt,
if the fiscal surplus is not large enough to cover the entire financing needs for the year.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation
(measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On July 29, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
Over the past two decades, Chile has adhered to a sound and consistent policy framework.
Its policy mix has been based on fiscal prudence, a successful monetary policy based on an
inflation targeting framework with a floating exchange rate, free trade, and an open capital
account, within a sound financial regulatory and supervisory framework.
Since 2000, the current administration has been adhering closely to the structural surplus
rule, a key fiscal innovation. The fiscal rule, which requires a cyclically adjusted central
government overall surplus of 1 percent of GDP, has proven to be an effective
counter-cyclical tool. During 2000–03, when output growth was below its long-run trend, the
actual overall balance of the central government registered deficits of just below 1 percent of
GDP a year on average, and in 2004 the balance shifted to a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP,
consistent with the strong economic recovery and high copper prices. The transition to a fullfledged inflation targeting framework has been completed in 2000. The framework has been
successful at keeping inflation very close to the mid-point of the target band of 2–4 percent—
2.8 percent a year on average during 2000–04, while allowing the peso to float freely.
A strong external environment and an expansionary monetary policy has helped spur Chile’s
economic growth in 2004 and in early 2005. Robust growth in the global economy, including
Asia—which absorbs one-third of Chile’s total exports—has helped boost mineral export prices,
particularly copper, Chile’s main export commodity. Chile has also benefited from low world
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2interest rates. Reflecting these developments, real GDP grew by 6.1 percent in 2004, the
strongest rate of growth in 7 years. Despite steady employment growth, the unemployment rate
is still relatively high, at about 8 percent, as strong economic growth has encouraged more
workers to return to the labor market.
In the context of a still weak economic recovery and downward pressure on domestic prices, the
monetary authorities eased their policy stance in late 2003 and in early 2004. Later in the year,
when it was clear the economic recovery was well under way, and the forecast inflation has
returned above the center of the target range, the central bank initiated a tightening cycle
toward a neutral stance. It has raised its policy rate on seven occasions since September 2004,
by a total of 175 basis points to 3.5 percent in mid-July 2005.
External conditions faced by the Chilean economy remain broadly favorable but increases in
petroleum prices could lead to a slowdown in global demand and in Chilean exports.
The authorities have taken steps to protect the economy from sudden cuts in natural gas
imports and to encourage a switch in electricity generation from relatively cheap natural gas to
alternative sources.
In the period ahead, the economy is expected to continue its robust growth, and GDP is
projected to grow by 5.5–6 percent in 2005. Reflecting a supportive external environment, and a
still expansionary monetary policy, strong investment growth is expected to continue in 2005.
Domestic consumption would also pick up, boosted by higher incomes, an increase in
employment, and strong consumer lending. Consistent with strong growth and high copper
prices, the fiscal balance is projected to register a surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2005.
The current account surplus is projected to narrow to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2005, reflecting a
higher import bill, including on oil and capital good imports.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Chilean authorities for their consistent and skillful
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, which have helped entrench low inflation and
sustain economic growth while contributing to a significant reduction in poverty. Directors
observed that Chile’s macroeconomic policies, centered on well-established rules and
institutions, have been reinforced in recent years by strict adherence to the structural fiscal
surplus rule and a highly regarded inflation targeting framework. Supported by increasing trade
and financial integration and a robust financial system, these policies have paid considerable
dividends, providing counter-cyclical support to the economy, strengthening its resilience to
external shocks, and leading to favorable market ratings and sustained economic growth. Chile
remains a model reformer and Directors looked forward to its continued leadership role in
building a strong political consensus in favor of a robust macroeconomic policy framework in the
period ahead.
Directors noted that Chile’s short-term outlook appears bright. A favorable global environment,
continued strength of mineral prices, the ongoing rebound in private investment, and the pick up
in domestic consumption are expected to contribute to strong economic growth in 2005 and
2006. Existing risks to the outlook appear manageable, and Directors commended the
authorities for their prompt action to mitigate the impact of disruptions in the supply of gas from
the region.

-3Directors welcomed the authorities’ strict adherence to the structural fiscal surplus rule, which
calls for a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the overall balance of the central government. While
further entrenching Chile’s commitment to a prudent fiscal policy, this rule has also been
effective in providing counter-cyclical support to the economy since its adoption in 2000.
Directors commended the authorities for restraining spending, despite higher revenues from the
surge in copper prices. Going forward, Directors advised continued commitment to fiscal
discipline. They welcomed plans to require future budgets to accumulate resources to cover
potential future contingent liabilities and to include a measure of the structural fiscal position.
Directors called for progress on the introduction of an appropriate and transparent mechanism
by the government to cover the annual deficits of the central bank, with a view to working
toward its recapitalization while preserving its institutional independence.
Directors supported the thrust of the government’s debt management strategy, including the
authorities’ decision to selectively prepay debt and replenish the Copper Stabilization Fund.
They also welcomed the rapid growth of exchange rate hedges, and supported efforts to
deepen the domestic financial market, including the development of a market for long-term
peso-denominated bonds.
Directors recognized that Chile’s inflation targeting framework has gained a high degree of
credibility and successfully helped anchor inflation expectations. They considered that the
monetary stance in 2004 had been appropriate, with inflation gradually returning to the midpoint of the 2–4 percent target band. Directors also supported the gradual tightening of
monetary policy under way, which is consistent with the inflation objective and the closing of the
output gap.
Directors observed that the floating exchange rate regime has benefited the economy and
allowed it to adjust smoothly to external shocks. They commended the central bank’s
transparent policy framework, with no intervention in the foreign exchange market. Together
with fiscal prudence, this framework has helped support competitiveness, as evidenced by the
strong growth in nontraditional exports.
While the Chilean banking sector is robust, Directors saw room for further progress on
improving the financial system’s efficiency and oversight consistent with the recommendations
of the 2004 Financial System Stability Assessment. Early approval of the Capital Markets II draft
law would be an important step in this regard. Directors welcomed the strengthening of market
risk regulations in the banking sector. They looked forward to further improvements in the
supervision of the insurance sector and steps to foster competition among private pension
funds. While private pension funds are generally well run, Directors felt that a judicious
liberalization of restrictions on the investment of these funds would encourage a risk-based
approach in the management of their investments. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to
revise Chile’s Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
legislation to enhance the ability of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to obtain information.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to accord a high priority to reforms aimed at
promoting sustained growth and further reducing income inequality and high unemployment
over the medium term. To sustain the ongoing diversification of exports, they supported efforts
to boost research and development and improve further the business environment. They also
welcomed reforms to improve pre-school coverage for low income groups, provide education
subsidies to low-income households, and enhance funding for tertiary education. Directors

-4stressed that further improvements in labor market flexibility would also be important to expand
employment opportunities.
Directors underscored Chile’s leadership role in opening markets through comprehensive and
sustained trade and financial market liberalization. They welcomed the implementation of recent
bilateral trade agreements and encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts in supporting
multilateral trade liberalization.

Key Points
•

Improved overall global conditions for the Chilean economy and a supportive policy
stance have contributed to the cyclical upturn since early 2004. The risks to short-term
growth, either from an unbalanced pattern of expansion or energy scarcity have been
mitigated, while capital formation is still growing strongly. Underlying inflationary
pressures and unit labor costs remain subdued, while some propagation of current oil
price hikes is to be expected. The Central Bank of Chile (CBCh) has been gradually
withdrawing monetary policy stimulus, while fiscal policy remains within the structural
surplus rule. Overall, macroeconomic policies remain supportive of the current upturn in
growth.

•

Chile's economic policy framework is geared to sustaining strong economic growth and
to strengthening the economy’s resilience to external and internal shocks. It is
characterized by a strong commitment to macroeconomic and financial stability,
surveillance and regulatory framework pursuing microeconomic efficiency, and policies
promoting social equity.

•

The challenges ahead consist of balancing the continuity of policies and institutions
supporting the current strengths of the economy, further increasing productivity growth,
and improving income distribution.

INTRODUCTION
1.
On behalf of our authorities we thank the staff for their insightful report and set of
papers. They reflect well the open and frank discussion held in this Article IV Consultation.
They are also the result of the broad scope of the mission’s enquiry, which included meetings
with government officials, private sector representatives, think tanks, and the economic
teams of the presidential candidates.
2.
The gradual development of sound monetary and fiscal policies over the years
has resulted in a very robust macroeconomic policy framework since 2000. The fiscal
policy framework is based on a solid commitment to a structural fiscal budget surplus of 1
percent of GDP. The monetary and financial policy framework is characterized by inflation
targeting, floating exchange rate, open capital account, sound financial regulation and
supervision, and the maintenance of prudent levels of international reserves. The adoption of
this framework has allowed macroeconomic policy to be more efficient in smoothing the
effects of internal and external shocks on output, and in controlling inflation. At the same
time, significant progress has been made in microeconomic policy, institution building, and
structural reforms.

-23.
While these developments have contributed to build up significantly the resilience of
the economy, a casual or uninformed reading of the Staff Report could suggest that GDP
evolution is mainly driven by fluctuations in the price of copper, and the domestic inflation
rate by movements in the foreign exchange rate. In sharp contrast with such an
interpretation, the fact is that the performance of the Chilean economy since the adoption
of its current policy framework in 2000 has been very successful at administrating and
smoothing out, in a sustainable way, fluctuations of the global economic conditions,
changes in commodity prices, external and internal negative energy shocks, regional
economic and financial turbulence, and the political cycle. During this period, the
amplitude of the business cycle has been substantially lower than under similar conditions in
the past, and annual inflation has been maintained around the target range set by the CBCh
between 2 and 4 percent. The CBCh utilizes an inflation targeting framework and in this
framework the evolution of the exchange rate is one among many determinants of the
inflation dynamics. Furthermore, the pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to CPI
inflation has been reduced significantly in recent years.
DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
4.
During the nineties, Chile was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,
to a large extent due to gains in efficiency. In the past 15 years, the per capita income gap
in Chile has diminished compared to high-income countries by around 25 percent. High
growth and focalization of social expenditure have resulted in major advances in social
indicators and poverty alleviation.
5.
After the slowdown in 1998-2003, favorable global and domestic economic
conditions have contributed to higher economic growth. Fifteen years of continued high
expansion averaging around 6½ percent growth per year was slowed down by the onset of
the Asian crisis and by global and regional turbulence in 1998-2003. Appropriate and timely
monetary and fiscal policies were able to smooth the fluctuations, ending up with an average
GDP growth of 2¾ percent a year. Robust world economic growth, high commodity prices,
and a stronger expansion of the most important trade partners such as the Asian economies
and the U.S., have been at the background of a 6 percent GDP growth during 2004 and 2005.
This higher growth rate also has been decisively supported by an expansionary monetary
policy.
6.
The pick-up in economic activity has gradually become more broad-based across
sectors and aggregate demand components. Both tradable and non-tradable sectors have
contributed to the over 6 percent GDP growth rate in 2004 and the first five months of 2005.
The value added in the energy sector has recovered, thanks to the improvement in
hydrological conditions and the reduction in natural gas cuts. Fixed capital formation
remains brisk, whereas exports have decelerated somewhat their year-on-year expansion.
Consumption has gradually gained strength, while the pace of inventory accumulation has
not accelerated further. Even though the main negative risks to the short-term outlook have
tended to dissipate, the positive risk linked to a persistently favorable evolution of capital
formation has become more apparent.

-37.
These very favorable growth developments have not yet translated into higher
underlying inflationary pressures. Most, if not all news in the short-term inflationary
outlook have been linked to the direct effect of higher oil prices and the related incidence in
the regulated services tariffs. Although some propagation of these shocks to core inflation is
expected in the next quarters, its magnitude remains very uncertain. Meanwhile, unit labor
costs do not yet exhibit year-on-year positive increases, in spite of higher nominal wage
growth and the reduction in the legal workweek, thanks to the sharp pace of labor
productivity growth.
8.
Macroeconomic policies have remained supportive of the current cyclical
upturn. Monetary policy conditions remain clearly expansionary in spite of the 175 basis
point increase, from 1.75 percent to 3.5 percent, in the monetary policy rate since September
2004. Credit and monetary aggregates still show high growth rates, and domestic interest
rates remain low, while the real exchange rate has not shown an additional appreciation in the
face of improving fundamentals. Fiscal expenditures in 2004 and 2005 have been in line
with the structural budget surplus rule, resulting in a large increase in the current surplus
thanks to surprisingly high tax receipts and copper returns. Fiscal policy will likely provide a
bit more aggregate demand push in 2006 after the upward revision in the assumptions for the
long-term price of copper and trend GDP growth.
9.
There are some external and domestic risks to the near-term economic
prospects. The main external risk factor appears to be the persistence of high oil prices.
Also important are the widening regional imbalances between public and private savings and
investment within and between the main economic zones, and the effect that sudden
adjustments in interest rate and currencies might have on financial markets uncertainty and
global activity. Particularly relevant is the U.S. monetary normalization and its effect on the
sovereign spread conditions. On the domestic side, the risks are related to the evolution of
private consumption, against the backdrop of a weakening in several negatively contributing
factors such as energy shortages related to the supply of gas and hydrological conditions, and
the accumulation of inventories. Also, there is still uncertainty on how will the reduction in
the legal working-week weigh on the economy.
KEY GOALS OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK: MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
STABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SOCIAL EQUITY
10.
The effectiveness and credibility of Chile’s economic policy framework rely on three
key aspects:
•

A strong commitment to macroeconomic and financial stability reflected in
well-specified targets for fiscal and monetary policies operating under a floating
exchange rate regime, a fully open capital account, and sound financial regulation
and supervision.

•

A continuous promotion of microeconomic efficiency by fostering competition
and setting appropriate incentives, and implementing a market-friendly
supervision and regulatory framework.

-4•

A systematic commitment to social equity, embedded in policies targeting
poverty reduction and improved opportunities for low-income groups.

11.
The first two aspects are essential in achieving sustained long-term growth and
strengthening the economy’s resilience to external shocks, while allowing the provision of a
stable flow of resources to implement far-reaching social policies. Putting in place this
policy framework has required considerable efforts in building and strengthening Chile’s
institutions.
COMMITMENT WITH MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY
12.
The fiscal rule operation, explicitly based on a target for the central government
structural surplus of 1 percent of GDP, has contributed to strengthen Chile’s credibility in the
international financial markets, reducing the spread at which residents can borrow abroad,
and allowing monetary policy to be more effective as a result of automatic stabilizers along
the cycle. The commitment of the authorities to the fiscal discipline is not only demonstrated
by their strong adherence to the policy framework, but also by their strengthening of fiscal
transparency and accountability. With that purpose, the government has sent to Congress a
draft law committing future administrations to provide information on the medium-term
projections of public finances, reflecting all macroeconomic and financial implications. Thus
the computation of the structural budget would be incorporated in the draft budget presented
to Congress each year. Furthermore, our authorities’ attention to the long-term fiscal
consolidation is revealed by the proposed creation of a special fund to finance in part future
obligations originated from the government’s guarantees to pay minimum and assistance
pensions. As clearly shown in the Selected Issues Paper, possible future pension liabilities
are limited in scope and are unlikely to give rise to fiscal stress.
13.
An independent central bank with an explicit mandate of achieving price stability sets
its monetary policy on an inflation target framework. This is a symmetric 2-to-4 percent
range centered on 3 percent. The CBCh’s operational aim is to maintain the overnight
nominal interest rate on inter-bank loans equal to the monetary policy interest rate (MPR),
which is met with open-market operations. In turn, the MPR level is determined in such a
way that the 12-24 month inflation forecast is close to 3 percent. Transparency and
accountability of the monetary policy have been continuously strengthened by a timely flow
of information to market participants. In this direction, and following the models of
Australia, Canada, U.K. and Sweden, the CBCh has recently announced that the disclosure
schedule of the minutes of Monetary Policy Meeting will be shortened and that they will
highlight the opinions and arguments of its Board members. Institutionalization of both
monetary and fiscal policy rules has simplified policy coordination between the government
and the CBCh, while preserving the bank’s autonomy.
14.
The monetary policy setting has been complemented with a floating exchange rate
regime to facilitate the adjustment of the real exchange rate in the presence of external
shocks. This regime, together with Chile’s improved creditworthiness, has reduced the
benefits of holding a high level of international reserves, which is expected to be reduced by
redeeming part of the CBCh’s dollar-linked debt with foreign reserves. However, the Central
Bank still considers that maintaining a significant amount is justifiable because it serves as a

-5buffer stock against international liquidity shocks, and permits the authorities to credibly
intervene in the foreign exchange market under exceptional circumstances.
15.
The CBCh and the Ministry of Finance have also been working on ways to strengthen
the bank’s balance sheet, which shows a structural return differential between its assets and
liabilities. This is mainly the consequence of actions taken by the CBCh during the crisis of
1982 in order to prevent the collapse of the domestic financial sector.
16.
The capital account liberalization was completed in 2001 with the abolition of all
remaining capital controls and, therefore, nowadays Chile has a fully open capital account.
17.
On the issue of financial integration with the rest of the world, our authorities
welcome the Selected Issues Paper which analyzes Chilean external debt. The paper makes
the important point that, while Chile’s private external debt is relatively high when using as
benchmark other countries with similar credit risk ratings, its external debt is in fact
consistent with its per capita income, trade openness and size of the economy. The paper
also documents in a systematic way several aspects of the Chilean external debt that make it
less vulnerable to market fluctuations than a first look might suggest.
18.
On the financial sector front, Chile’s sound and resilient financial system, along
with its effective regulation and supervision, is the result of a continuous process of reforms
and updating, both essential to reduce the impact of external shocks in Chile’s increasingly
integrated economy. Currently, Chile’s financial sector is characterized by a sound and
profitable banking industry, an active corporate and CBCh bond market, a significant
availability of security-related instruments ─mortgage-backed securities, mortgage bonds,
short-term commercial papers and structured products─, and a growing foreign exchange
derivatives market. The CBCh has recently taken new actions, which include the
modernization of the payment and settlement systems; the issuance of the Financial Stability
Report, intended to monitor the strengths and vulnerabilities of the internal and external
payments systems; and the review of liquidity and market risk regulation, in coordination
with the Superintendency of Banks.
19.
Despite these developments, Chile’s financial system still faces important challenges,
which the second reform to the Capital Markets Law should address. As the staff rightly
points out, passing this law has been difficult since it includes second-generation financial
reforms, such as funding risky projects through tax exemptions and collateralizations, which
are not easily approved in a pre-electoral environment. Regarding the Selected Issues Paper
on banking competition, despite the staff’s comprehensive and deep analysis, the
fundamental question of whether the authorities should be concerned by a banking industry
operating in a monopolistically competitive environment remain unanswered. A related issue
is which are the regulatory policy implications of this finding.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ORIENTED AT MICROECONOMIC EFFICIENCY
20.
In regards to labor market issues, one of the main concerns of Chile’s administration
has been the slow reduction in unemployment rate, which always lags behind the recovery of
the activity. The slow decline of the unemployment rate is within the range of experience in

-6previous economic recoveries and is explained by the increase in the labor force as the result
of improved expectations on finding a job. Moreover, the increase in the labor force has
resulted from the increased participation of women, which in Chile have a relatively low
participation rate. On a more structural ground, there has been progress in ensuring worker’s
protection by further consolidation of the unemployment insurance scheme, and the expected
approval by Congress of oral labor trials with more expeditious procedures is a step forward
in that direction.
21.
One of the trademarks of the current administration has been the importance given to
the development of public infrastructure. Our authorities agree that there are more areas
that could be strengthened while going forward, and actions are being taken in this direction.
On conflict resolution procedures, the Ministry of Public Works recently established a board
of independent professionals to act as arbitration panels. On the issue of project evaluation,
public sector benchmarks are being developed for some public projects (e.g. prisons,
judiciary buildings in Santiago, and a potential hospital concession). Regarding design and
engineering specifications, changes proposed by contractors are being increasingly accepted,
like the completed Costanera Norte, an urban highway redesigned by a contractor.
22.
In terms of the regulatory framework for utility services, it is worth mentioning the
electricity law recently approved by Congress, which will eliminate long-term price
uncertainty and promote investment in the sector, thus allowing the diversification of energy
sources. Investment in the energy sector is expected to exceed US$ 2 billion in the next
decade.
SOCIAL EQUITY
23.
Chile has registered significant distributive and poverty changes in the last fifteen
years. Thanks to a slight improvement during the first half of the nineties, income
distribution is better than in the eighties, but notably more regressive than during the sixties.
Historical, social, cultural, territorial, racial and gender factors explain the relative rigidity of
income distribution. However, the main achievement in the last 15 years has been the
reduction of poverty in Chile. In fact, poverty incidence has decreased substantially from
45 percent in 1987 to 19 percent in 2003.
24.
The impact of Chile’s well-focalized social policies is evidenced by the fact that,
after considering government transfers, income inequality between the richest and the
poorest quintiles of the population is halved. This sizable impact could be enhanced in the
future thanks to the government’s initiatives in health care, education, and housing. The
government is implementing a health care reform, which reinforces primary health and
prevention, reorganizes the medical public sector, and improves public hospital management.
The government has also launched the AUGE plan, which aims to improve coverage for
critical and expensive illnesses. In education, Congress recently approved the access to
publicly-guaranteed credits to students enrolled in private universities. In housing policy,
the government is carrying out the renegotiation and forgiveness of mortgage debt for the
lowest income groups on publicly-funded dwellings, favoring more than 260 thousand
families.

-7LONG-TERM CHALLENGES
25.
Despite Chile’s progress, our authorities are aware that efforts must be redoubled to
face the remaining challenges, and thereby further narrow the still large income gap with
developed countries. However, in the pursuit of these objectives, special care must be given
to policies and institutions that support growth and macroeconomic stability.
26.
First, it is necessary to take a new leap in productivity that will support a steady
increase in the economy’s growth rate. On technological innovation, policies and institutions
must be modernized in order to (i) improve technological education and increase the degree
of technological adoption and innovation in the overall economy; (ii) expand the access to
new technologies by micro, small and medium-size enterprises; and (iii) to promote greater
interaction between universities, technological centers and enterprises. The recently approved
mining royalty law will generate revenues from the extraction of non-renewable mineral
resources to be used for financing technological innovations, which is a crucial ingredient to
sustaining the country’s growth rate over the medium- and long-term.
27.
Second, to improve income distribution, efforts should be focused on (i) improving
pre-school and high school coverage; (ii) enhancing quality of education at every level, with
emphasis on preschool, elementary, and high school for the two lower-income quintiles; and
(iii) enhancing coverage and delivery mostly by improving management and efficiency in
both the public and private health care sectors.
