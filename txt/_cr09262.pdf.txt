EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
Like other very open economies, Korea was hard hit by the global financial crisis
during the last quarter of 2008. Capital left the country at a rate surpassing even that during
the Asian crisis, resulting in sharply lower asset prices, dislocations in money markets, and a
spike in bank CDS spreads reflecting the sector’s heavy reliance on wholesale funding. This
was followed by the largest export slump on record which quickly spilled over into domestic
demand. Overall, the Korean economy contracted by 5.1 percent quarter/quarter (q/q) (not
annualized) in the last quarter of 2008, among the sharpest contractions worldwide.
The authorities’ speedy and comprehensive response helped stabilize the economy by
early 2009. Generous provision of won and dollar liquidity, including by drawing down
official reserves, led to a quick recovery in money markets and prevented external defaults.
Sizeable monetary and fiscal stimulus boosted confidence and supported economic activity.
And the setup of recapitalization and toxic asset funds preempted the risk of prospective loan
delinquencies turning into major deleveraging on the part of banks. As a result, activity
gathered strength over the course of the first half of 2009.
However, the recent growth momentum is likely to moderate and the recovery will be
drawn out. As the impulse from the front-loaded fiscal stimulus and export gains from the
steep depreciation of the won in early 2009 fade, the pickup in growth is unlikely to be
sustained. Combined with a sluggish recovery in demand from trading partners, and highly
leveraged households and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Korean growth is
projected at -1¾ percent in 2009 and 2.5 percent in 2010. There is a distinct possibility that
weak global exports will weigh on Korean growth well beyond 2010, as Western consumers
permanently increase their savings rates. Other risks to the outlook are another bout of global
risk aversion, rising oil prices, or—on the upside—a stronger than anticipated impact from
stimulus measures in Korea and abroad.
Fiscal policy
The authorities are to be commended for their expansionary fiscal stance, which they
should maintain through 2010. The structural deficit in 2009 is expected to expand by
2¾ percentage points of GDP, well above the G20 average. Stimulus measures are also
appropriately weighted towards the expenditure side, including public investment and
targeted transfers, which should maximize its growth impact, estimated at 1–1½ percentage
points of GDP. Given Korea’s ample fiscal space and little evidence of funding pressures, the
fiscal stance should be maintained in 2010, until a self-sustained recovery takes hold.
However, with abrupt deleveraging avoided and the economy stabilized, a roll back of
the quasi-fiscal support measures targeted at SMEs could be initiated, given their
distortionary character. The authorities raised the amount of available SME credit
guarantees, increased the guarantee coverage to 95 percent for most loans, and 100 percent

4
for some, and guided banks to roll over all SME loans falling due in 2009. These measures
may have had their merits in the early stages of the crisis, but rolling them back would help
ensure that banks have incentives to move ahead with restructuring SMEs, while
conventional fiscal and monetary policies can be relied upon to stabilize output.
Announcement of a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan would assure investors and
boost the impact of the current stimulus. The authorities’ plan to balance the budget
(excluding social security) over the medium term is appropriate and should be underpinned
by revenue raising measures and a streamlining of non-age related expenditures, and further
pension reform. This adjustment would also leave sufficient room to allow for contingent
liabilities associated with recent financial market measures, which should be transparently
reported in the budget.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Monetary policy accommodation should be maintained for now, while concerns about
asset price appreciation are best addressed through prudential regulation. Given the
absence of inflationary pressures and a large projected output gap, the current
accommodative policy stance is appropriate. While asset prices are rightfully on the
authorities’ radar screen, they do not seem out of line with regional trends.
Foreign exchange intervention in the spot market should remain confined to smoothing
operations. The exchange rate has undershot most estimates of its medium-term equilibrium
level, but is likely to return to equilibrium as capital inflows continue to gather strength.
Financial sector policies
Banks are likely to withstand a deterioration in asset quality and schemes to support
their balance sheets could be more unambiguously linked to restructuring efforts. Given
highly leveraged SMEs and households, nonperforming loans are bound to increase in the
current weak economic environment. However, banks are in a position to absorb these losses,
especially after recent capital raising efforts. In this context, access to the recapitalization
fund should no longer be linked to credit extension to SMEs, but be made clearly conditional
on banks’ efforts to restructure SMEs.
While the crisis response framework has performed relatively well during the recent
crisis, there may be scope for further improvement. A more formal framework such as a
Financial Stability Council could help improve financial policy coordination between the
government, the regulator, and the central bank. It would also ensure that the BOK has
sufficient real-time information to better fulfill its lender-of-last-resort mandate.
In light of recent financial sector stresses, the authorities may want to consider some
upgrades to bank supervision and regulation. In the short term, there is scope to improve
stress testing within banks and by the regulator. Over the medium term, the authorities may

5
also want to consider prudential regulation with respect to banks’ wholesale funding, as is
currently being contemplated in Australia and New Zealand, counter-cyclical capital
requirements, and other lessons from the crisis currently being discussed in international fora.
These issues will be further explored during the FSAP update scheduled for 2010–11.
Given the scale of the downturn, the authorities should also take a fresh look at the
bankruptcy regime. In particular, a decriminalization of the personal bankruptcy regime
would ensure that entrepreneurs do not procrastinate on needed restructuring.
Structural policies
The weakness of demand by Western consumers, possibly for years to come, has given
added urgency to a recalibration of Korea’s export-led growth model. As a matter of
priority, tax incentives that favor the export-oriented manufacturing sector over the service
sector should be removed. Moreover, opening up the service sector to competition, including
from abroad, and moving expeditiously on the restructuring of SMEs would narrow the
productivity gap between the tradables and nontradables sector. Finally, reducing
employment protection for regular workers would facilitate a reallocation of labor towards
the nontradables sector. Higher labor participation rates in turn would counter the fall in total
factor productivity associated with the shift of economic activity towards the less productive
nontradables sector.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Korea is facing its biggest economic challenge since the 1997–98 crisis. Korea’s
openness to trade and financial flows––the foundation of its enviable growth record and rapid
recovery after the Asian crisis––left it particularly exposed to the tightening of global
financial conditions and the sharp decline in trade that followed. The authorities have
responded forcefully to the dual onslaught of massive capital outflows and collapsing exports
and, thereby, avoided major tail events so far. However, the downturn is expected to be
protracted.
2.
The current environment also presents an opportunity for Korea to prepare for
a different post-crisis global environment. Few view the current global recession as a
typical cyclical downturn. Following a substantial accumulation of debt, households in key
export destinations will likely need to shore up balance sheets over an extended period,
which could suppress Asian export growth long after the global recovery has taken hold.
Similarly, a more stringent regulatory regime at the global level could lead to a higher cost
and lower volume of credit long after financial institutions’ balance sheets have been restored
to health. These possibilities need to be taken into account when designing the strategy for a
strong and durable economic recovery in Korea, and preparing for the challenges of a rapidly
aging population.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments: Recovering from the Shock
3.
In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Korea experienced the
dual onslaught of a sudden stop in capital flows and collapsing exports.


With the seizure of international money markets in September 2008, Korean domestic
banks and foreign bank branches faced a sharp reduction in their credit lines, and
rollover rates on short-term external bank debt dropped to around 40 percent. As a
result, the capital account deteriorated by over 6 percentage points of GDP, compared
to 5½ percentage points of GDP during the Asian crisis. Both the won and equity
markets declined around 30 percent, severe dollar shortage spilled over into domestic
money markets, and the perceived default risk of Korean banks, which rely heavily
on wholesale funding, increased by more than anywhere else in the region.



Shortly thereafter, Korea suffered its greatest export slump on record. At the low
point in January, exports were down 35 percent year/year (y/y), compared to a fall of
22 percent y/y when the dotcom bubble burst in 2001. Given its openness to trade, the
external shock quickly spilled over to domestic demand: real investment contracted
by 6½ percent q/q and private consumption fell by a striking 4½ percent q/q. Overall,
the Korean economy contracted by 5.1 percent q/q (not annualized) in the last quarter
of 2008, among the sharpest contractions worldwide.

The authorities responded with a timely and comprehensive set of financial
market and macro-stabilization measures. The authorities set aside $55 billion in foreign
exchange reserves to provide as swaps or loans

downturn and prevent major deleveraging.
5.
The steep exchange rate depreciation helped fend off deflationary pressures. The
BOK intervened only exceptionally, confined spot market intervention to smoothing
operations, and secured swap lines from other central banks totaling $90 billion.1 The weak
won redirected domestic demand from imports to domestic production and, in combination
with falling oil prices, turned the current account from a deficit of 3¾ percent of GDP in the
third quarter of 2008 to a surplus of 4½ percent of GDP in the first quarter of this year. As a
result, reserves fell by just $38 billion in the last quarter of 2008 to $200 billion and have
since risen to $232 billion. Moreover, the weak won has sustained core inflation, at
3.5 percent in June, while headline inflation has declined to 2 percent on the back of softer
commodity prices, slightly below the target range of the BOK.
6.
Defaults on banks’ external obligations and a credit crunch have been avoided
and economic activity stabilized in the first quarter of 2009. Bank credit continues to
grow—at 8 percent y/y—and domestic bond issuance in the first five months of 2009
(relative to GDP) is close to an all-time high. In the first quarter of 2009, government
consumption and construction investment rose by 3¾ and 5¼ percent q/q, respectively, as a
direct result of the fiscal stimulus, and private consumption recorded a mild recovery of 0.4
percent q/q. As a result, the economy expanded by 0.1 percent q/q in the first quarter, thereby
avoiding a technical recession. Economic activity continues to improve with exports,
industrial production, and service sector activity well above their end-2008 lows and business
and consumer confidence back in expansionary territory.

Out of this, $16.35 billion was drawn at the peak.

construction investment. Unemployment is
expected to peak only in the third quarter of 2009 and weigh on consumption for an extended
period of time. Moreover, deleveraging by financial institutions is expected to constrain
credit growth. As a result, the economy is projected to contract by 1¾ percent in 2009 and
grow by 2.5 percent in 2010, while inflation is projected to fall to 1½ percent in late 2009,

Box 1. Downside Risk Scenario: Another Bout of Global Risk Aversion
While financial market volatility has come down markedly from the heights of the Lehman collapse,
another sudden stop in capital flows remains a possibility. Excess liquidity has been a global phenomenon
and asset bubbles have built up well beyond the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market. Some of these imbalances
may still unravel and impact the global financial system. One case in point is overextension in Eastern Europe,
where any defaults could quickly spill over to Korea through the common link of Western European banks. The
latter account for 31 percent of Korea’s total external debt according to BIS data as of end-December.
In the event of a large scale reversal of capital flows, Korea would probably avoid the tail event of
external defaults.


Current reserves of $232 billion exceed 2009 and 2010 external financing needs of $201 billion,
defined as external debt amortization net of the current account surplus. Hence, even if roll-over rates
of external debt were to fall to very low levels, reserves would be sufficient to cover debt payments
throughout 2010. As a comparison, during the Asian crisis roll-over rates of short-term external debt
fell to 50 percent.



The default risk of domestic banks seems manageable, despite their reliance on wholesale financing.
Offshore wholesale financing of domestic banks at short maturities amounted to only $45 billion at
end-December, which amounts to an estimated 4 percent of their total funding or 20 percent of official
reserves. Moreover, Korea has very strict bank regulations in terms of maturity and currency
mismatches and so the ratio of short-term foreign

exchange assets to liabilities (due in three months
(In billions of U.S. dollars)
or less) was 104 percent at end-June.



It is unlikely that steep exchange rate devaluation
would trigger defaults. Although foreign currency
open positions by sector are not available, data on
external debt and external assets (as defined by

1/ External assets minus external debt.

However, Korea would still experience a severe tightening of financial conditions with a knock-on effect
on growth.


Faced with falling roll-over rates on their external debt, banks would have to obtain foreign currency
by liquidating assets—denominated both in foreign currency and in won. This would affect credit
growth and could lead to an outright credit contraction.



Falling stock prices would depress private consumption and investment. With foreign participation in
the stock market amounting to about 30 percent, stock prices would fall in response to a global shock.
With Korean households holding 15 percent of their financial assets in stocks, consumption is bound to
fall. Companies would issue fewer shares—indeed, companies issued 70 percent fewer shares in 2008
than in 2007—and cut down on investment.



Rising interest rates would further dampen investment and demand for durable goods. It is estimated
that foreigners (both nonresidents and resident branches of foreign banks) account for 27 percent of all
holdings of outstanding treasury and central bank bonds, which could lead to a spike in interest rates
should external debt flows reverse.

Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities were somewhat more upbeat about growth prospects in the
second half, and expect the economy to contract by 1.5 percent in 2009. They maintained
that the growth impact of front-loaded fiscal spending did not necessarily translate into a
subsequent petering out of fiscal stimulus due to the lag between budgetary execution and
final demand, particularly for transfers and capital expenditure. While the recent won
recovery was likely to have a dampening effect on growth, in their view it was also reflective
of improved sentiment and would support domestic investment by lowering the cost of
imported capital goods. The authorities also felt that the lagged effect of unemployment was
likely to be cushioned by public works programs introduced as part of the fiscal stimulus
package.

13
10.
In 2010, the authorities expect growth to rise to 4 percent, but acknowledged
downside risks from lackluster growth in the G3 countries. The authorities were in broad
agreement with staff’s global growth assumptions, but indicated that Korea was well placed
to profit from solid growth in China and other emerging markets, given its specialization in
advanced manufacturing. Risks from weak demand in the United States and Europe were
acknowledged, but they noted a shift of Korean exports towards the vast pool of consumers
in emerging markets.

Conventional fiscal stimulus has been
a crucial line of defense during the current

about 2 percent of GDP, while the second,
passed in April, amounted to 1.7 percent of
GDP.

The authorities have also undertaken extensive quasi-fiscal measures to boost
bank lending to SMEs, which account for 80-90 percent of employment. They expanded
the available amount of SME loan guarantees, announced automatic rollovers of guarantees
expiring in 2009, and increased the guarantee coverage per loan. In addition, the authorities
injected capital into policy banks, encouraged commercial banks to roll over all SME loans
falling due in 2009 (16 percent of GDP), and established targets for SME loan growth.2

Box 2. Measures to Ensure Adequate Credit Flow: A Cross-Country Perspective
Korea’s support measures for SMEs have been among the most generous in the world after Japan, owing
to the sector’s large share in employment. Public capital injections into banks have been modest by
international standards reflecting Korea’s peripheral role in the current crisis. By the same token, toxic
asset programs have been set up as a contingency measure, and no public money has been spent so far.
SME credit facilitation
Korea’s expansion of SME financial support facilities, already among the most generous in the world
prior to the crisis, is only rivaled by Japan. Credit guarantee schemes for SMEs have been expanded by
1.8 percent of GDP, compared to 5.9 percent of GDP in Japan, 0.8 percent of GDP in the United
Kingdom, and 0.4 percent of GDP in Mexico. Maximum guarantee coverage per loan has been expanded
to 100 percent in both Korea and Japan, compared to 90 percent in Taiwan Province of China, 85 percent
in India, 75 percent in the United Kingdom, and 50 percent in Mexico. Fees for these guarantees are
comparable to other countries—1.2 percent of the outstanding guarantee, compared to 0.5 percent in
Taiwan Province of China, and 2 percent in Mexico and the United Kingdom. Similarly, the expansion
of subsidized lending facilities for SMEs has matched those of other countries—0.2 percent of GDP,
compared to 0.2 percent of GDP in India and Germany, and 2 percent of GDP in Japan.
Bank recapitalization
Public capital injections into Korean banks have been modest by international standards. The
government has injected W 4 trillion into public financial institutions, while commercial banks have
drawn W 4 trillion from the W 20 trillion recapitalization fund. The Korean government’s W 8 trillion,
or $6 billion capital injections, account for less than 1.5 percent of the $470 billion in public capital
injections worldwide. Not surprisingly, Korea’s capital injections pale against the more than $230 billion
provided in the United States or the more than $50 billion made available in the United Kingdom.
However, Korean capital injections also compare favorably to those of China or Russia (each around
$20 billion), which like Korea have been at the periphery of the current crisis. This is due to Korean
banks’ solid capital adequacy ratios at the outset of the crisis—12.3 percent at end-2007—and the
relative ease of raising private capital ($15 billion) after the onset of the crisis.
Toxic asset management
With the W 40 trillion Restructuring Fund—W 462 billion drawn so far—Korea is one of a few
countries worldwide that have established a program to purchase toxic bank assets. Reflecting the
difficulties in valuing toxic assets, Germany and the United States are among the few G20 countries that
have committed public funds to purchases of risky assets. The United States has redesigned its program
midway, seeking to solve the valuation problem through private sector participation. Other countries,
such as Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom have capped bank losses by issuing guarantees on existing
or new bank lending. Korea is confident that it can handle the valuation problem, given the expertise
acquired during the Asian crisis: to date, Korea’s Asset Management Corporation has recovered
110 percent on the toxic assets it bought in the wake of the Asian crisis.

outlays and targeted transfers for liquidity
constrained households, which typically have
the highest immediate growth impact. The tax
cuts are not expected to have a significant shortterm impact on growth, but could support the
recovery once it is under way. Based on modelgenerated multipliers, staff estimates that
discretionary measures could lift growth by 1–
1½ percentage points in 2009.3

Note: The multipliers are derived from simulations using IMF's Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model.

14.
Weighing Korea’s fiscal space against the current economic outlook, it seems too
early to withdraw fiscal stimulus in 2010. This implies that the structural deficit in 2010
should be at least as large as in 2009. Under current policies, government debt (including
government guaranteed debt) would rise to a manageable 40 percent of GDP by end-2009;
and although the yield curve has steepened somewhat in response to the government’s
increased funding needs, this has not offset the effect of lower policy rates.4 Hence, crowding
out of private spending or a Ricardian increase in private saving is not a major policy concern
at this stage.
15.
However, with a credit crunch averted consideration needs to be given to an exit
strategy from distortionary SME support measures. Given the magnitude of the shock
and the risk of abrupt deleveraging, some of the credit facilitation measures for SMEs may
have had their merits. However, credit guarantees that were extended in response to severe
downturns in the past—for example, in 1998 and 2001—persisted long after the downturns
ended, and have been partly blamed for the structural financial problems the SME sector is
facing today. As a high priority, the maximum loan guarantee coverage should be reduced to
the customary 60-80 percent, from 100 percent currently. Moreover, the guidance to
commercial banks to roll over maturing SME debt should not be renewed in 2010. Finally,
the authorities may want to consider committing to a time-bound path for a significant
reduction of SME credit guarantees (and subsidized loans provided by BOK through
commercial banks).

The selected issues paper “Counter-Cyclical Fiscal Policy—Does It Work in Korea’s Open Economy?”
provides additional background on the growth impact of the fiscal stimulus measures.

4

The recent abolition of the withholding tax on interest income and capital gains for foreigners who invest in
Korean Treasury Bonds and Monetary Stabilization Bonds should lead to the inclusion of Korea in the global
bond index and could further counter the steepening of the yield curve. Based on Korea’s prospective weight in
the global bond index, it is estimated that the share of nonresidents in the Korean bond market would rise from
8 percent to around 20 percent.

appropriate and would
require discretionary measures of 3¾ percentage points of GDP. This adjustment path would
lead public debt to peak at 47 percent of GDP in 2011 and also leave sufficient room for
fiscal contingencies related to recent financial sector support measures, which should be
transparently reported in the budget (see DSA Appendix). On the revenue side, the
adjustment could be brought about by broadening the base for personal and corporate income
taxes (by eliminating extensive allowances and incentives, including the temporary
investment tax credit), as well as increases in the VAT rate and social security contributions.
On the expenditure side, there is scope for streamlining non-age-related outlays and further
pension reform, which would help provide room for a needed expansion of the social safety
net.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff that it was too early to exit from conventional
fiscal stimulus measures, and were mindful of medium-term fiscal pressures. Despite a
more optimistic growth outlook for 2010, the authorities agreed that there were downside
risks and, consequently, planned not to withdraw fiscal stimulus until a self-sustained
recovery was firmly established. The authorities plan to announce a fiscal consolidation plan
in October, which will aim for a balanced budget (excluding social security contributions)
over the medium term. However, the detailed measures underlying the medium-term
consolidation strategy are still being worked out.
18.
The authorities are well aware of the disincentives associated with SME financial
support policies and have started to reverse some of the measures introduced at the
height of the crisis. Given the speed of deleveraging in late 2008, generous SME support
was seen as necessary to avert a credit crunch that would have left viable firms without
access to financing. With liquidity conditions back to normal, the authorities acknowledged
that the focus needed to shift towards addressing the structural weaknesses of the sector. As a
first step, they have relaxed the targets for SME loan growth and indicated that the guidance
to roll-over all SME bank loans would be withdrawn in 2010. However, a rollback of SME
support measures to pre-crisis levels was seen as politically difficult at present.

17
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Appropriate for Now
Background
19.
The BOK undertook a wide range of policy measures to ensure the adequate
flow of credit and support the rapidly deteriorating economy. It cut interest rates by a
cumulative 325 basis points between October and February to 2 percent. BOK also
broadened the list of eligible counterparties and collateral in its repo operations and relaxed
banks’ liquidity requirements. BOK further set aside W 5 trillion ($4 billion) to assist
financial institutions to purchase corporate bonds and commercial paper, and increased its
ceiling for subsidized SME lending by W 3½ trillion to W 10 trillion ($8 billion).
20.
As a result, disruptions to the monetary transmission mechanism were short
lived. Short-term interest spreads, which shot up in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman
collapse, returned to pre-crisis levels in late-2008, and lending rates are now at an all time
low. Similarly, bond spreads of high grade issuers Monetary Transmission Mechanism 1/

the current slowdown are also showing up in a significant jump (19 percent y/y in May) in the stock of unsold homes and
steep declines in construction and construction permits.

pressures in selected Seoul neighborhoods, the authorities recently lowered the required loan-to-value ratios for these
areas. This selective approach is appropriate given the absence of nationwide pressures in the housing market, and could
be pursued further if house prices continue to rise in specific areas.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities agreed with the need for an accommodative monetary stance,
but remained concerned about its effect on asset prices. The authorities felt that the
monetary stance was appropriate for now, but in line with their more upbeat assessment of
economic prospects they remained attuned to signs of excess liquidity. Moreover, they took
little comfort from the fact that house prices had fallen until recently, given the upturn in
mortgage-related lending and rising house prices in some localized markets. They agreed that
prudential regulation should be the first line of defense against frothy asset markets, as
evidenced by a recent tightening of loan-to-value ratios in selected Seoul neighborhoods.
However, the authorities did not rule out interest rate hikes should more generalized asset
price rises become a concern.
25.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a freely floating exchange rate.
Prior to 2009, intervention was confined to smoothing operations. So far in 2009, the
authorities abstained completely from exchange market intervention, as evidenced by the

provision has accounted for the recent increase in official reserves.

Background

Corporate and household vulnerabilities are bound to erode banks’ relatively
strong capital positions.



Household debt as a percent of
disposable income has been on an
upward trend since the Asian crisis and
is higher than in the United States and
Japan. Moreover, at 50 percent of GDP,
non-mortgage household debt is much
higher than in comparator countries. As
stock market valuations tumbled, debt
relative to financial assets has spiked
recently, and while well below

creditor losses could reach 4.1 percent

amounting to 3.1 percent of total loans.5

In anticipation of a substantial rise in banks’ NPLs, the authorities are pursuing
a strategy that includes capital injections and purchases of impaired assets. Banks have
since late-2008, under guidance from the supervisor, raised their capital adequacy ratios
(CARs) to 12.9 percent. The authorities have also established a W 20 trillion bank
recapitalization fund (1.6 percent of risk weighted assets) and in the first quarter of 2009,

eight banks drew a total of W 4 trillion from the fund. In addition, the Korea Asset
Management Corporation (KAMCO) stands ready to issue government-guaranteed bonds
totaling W 40 trillion ($30 billion) mainly to purchase NPLs and troubled assets from
financial institutions.6
Staff views
28.
Banks are well positioned to withstand a significant deterioration in asset
quality. According to staff estimates, the NPL ratio could reach 6.4 percent under the
baseline, which would reduce banks’ capital adequacy ratio to 10 percent. Only under a very
extreme scenario—G7 growth of minus 7.8 percent—would the CAR fall below the
regulatory minimum of 8 percent.7
29.
There may be a need to link capital injections and purchases of nonperforming
loans more clearly to progress on bank-led restructuring of SMEs. While less disruptive
than an after-the-fact recapitalization, the current strategy may weaken banks’ incentives to
actively pursue company restructuring. In fact, access to the recapitalization fund has been
explicitly linked to the provision of SME credit and, hence, undermines restructuring efforts.
Similarly, given the time and expertise required to restructure debtor companies, it may be
easier for banks to sell impaired assets to KAMCO rather than engage in costly restructuring.
In this context, capital support to banks and purchases of impaired assets could be more
clearly linked to restructuring efforts.
30.
While the crisis response framework has performed relatively well during the
recent crisis, there may be scope for further improvement. The global liquidity crisis and
the new emphasis on macro-prudential oversight have highlighted the interconnectedness of
financial supervision, monetary policy, and lender-of-last-resort policies. Following the
examples of Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong SAR, a more formal framework such
as a Financial Stability Council could help improve financial policy coordination and
information sharing between supervisors, the central bank, and the government.
31.
In light of recent financial sector stresses, the authorities may want to consider
some upgrades to bank supervision and regulation. As pointed out during last year’s
Article IV consultation, there is scope to improve stress testing within banks and the
regulator and the FSAP update envisaged for late 2010 will follow up further on this issue.
The authorities may also want to consider additional prudential regulation with respect to
banks’ wholesale financing, given its macro stability implications. Counter-cyclical capital

22
requirements and other lessons from the global financial crisis could also be explored in line
with the evolving international debate.
32.
The scale of the downturn gives added urgency to further improvements in
Korea’s corporate and personal bankruptcy regime. In 2006, Korea enacted a new
unified insolvency law, which has greatly reduced uncertainties and streamlined court
procedures. However, there is scope for further improvement, including by introducing an
automatic stay on assets and removing the requirement for prior court approval when
submitting a restructuring plan. Moreover, decriminalizing personal bankruptcies—loan
defaults are treated as a criminal offense—and extending exemptions for personal assets may
induce entrepreneurs to declare bankruptcy early on.
Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities underscored that the recapitalization fund and KAMCO
restructuring fund had fulfilled important functions in the early phase of the crisis, but
acknowledged that there was scope to revisit some of these functions. The funds had been
set up as a contingency measure and were meant to assure investors that the government was
aware of the risks to the banking system. This strategy was seen to have succeeded, as
several banks have been able to tap international capital markets in recent months without
recourse to the government’s guarantee on external debt. The funds had also helped support
the real economy by preempting an excessive degree of deleveraging. With economic
conditions stabilizing, the authorities agreed that the modalities of accessing the
recapitalization fund needed to be more clearly aligned with the broader restructuring
strategy. On the other hand, they did not share the concern that banks would overuse the
KAMCO fund instead of engaging in time consuming restructuring. Recent plans by banks to
set up their own asset purchase vehicle is seen as evidence that KAMCO’s pricing of
impaired assets is perceived as conservative.
34.
The authorities recognize the need for greater coordination among the central
bank and government agencies, but value a clear delineation of supervisory
responsibilities in maintaining the BOK’s independence in the context of the inflation
targeting framework. They acknowledged that BOK needed better access to information to
act as a lender of last resort in times of crisis and noted that a formal agreement to this effect
is being considered. The authorities also saw an increased role for macro-prudential
regulation in line with international consensus on this issue. They pointed out that BOK has
established financial stability as an important policy objective in the conduct of monetary
policy.
35.
Regulators saw scope for improved stress testing and are following with interest
the international dialogue on wholesale funding regulation. The authorities want to
develop stress testing to a stage where it can be used as a basis for regulatory action and are
allocating more resources for this purpose. With respect to banks’ wholesale financing, they

23
pointed out that Korea has one of the strictest regulations in terms of foreign exchange
maturity mismatches, while domestic funding pressures could be addressed through BOK’s
liquidity facilities. Notwithstanding, they were closely following the deliberations of the
Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision with respect to
wholesale funding regulation and other lessons from the crisis.

Korea’s growth relies heavily on the tradables sector, and increasingly so. During
2001–08, net exports and investment—which is heavily geared towards the tradables
sector—accounted for 55 percent of growth, up from 27 percent in the 1990s. This bias
towards the tradables sector is mirrored on the production side. Labor productivity growth in
the services sector has been about 1.2 percent

44 percent in 2007.
Staff views
37.
Putting the SME sector on a sound footing and rebalancing growth towards the
nontradables sector seems key for a lasting recovery. Rebalancing growth will require
removing the bias towards exports and increase service sector productivity. This would
support potential growth in the post-crisis environment when external demand and capital
inflows from advanced countries may prove permanently lower. The three major avenues to
attain these goals are SME restructuring, service sector deregulation, and labor market
reform.
38.
The authorities have launched important initiatives in each of these fields, but
progress remains uneven. The authorities recently stepped up a bank-led restructuring
program begun in 2004, and of 861 SMEs screened since June 2009, 77 have been found to
be in need of restructuring and 36 have been diagnosed unviable. The free-trade agreement
with the United States, whose ratification is pending in both legislatures, takes steps to open
up the service sector in areas such as law, accounting, and finance, but not health and
education. The government has also undertaken some important labor market reforms, but
employment protection of regular workers remains high by international standards.

24
39.
Progress on SME restructuring is contingent on the right incentive structure and
mechanism to address the social adjustment costs. The bank-led approach to SME
restructuring seems appropriate, in principle, given limited court capacity to deal with a large
number of SMEs and the banks’ information advantage. However, extensive loan guarantees
and mandated loan roll-overs have created disincentives on the part of banks and borrowers,
respectively. There are also a large number of small SMEs where the cost of restructuring
outweighs the benefits. Given the underlying structural problems, debt relief or maturity
extension in these cases does not seem a compelling option. Instead, public transfer programs
may be a more effective use of public funds.
40.
Raising service sector productivity through deregulation should support
potential growth and strengthen domestic demand. The historic bias towards an exportled growth strategy could be reduced by eliminating the preferential tax treatment for the
manufacturing sector. Moreover, the service sector could be opened up to more competition,
including from abroad. According to a recent OECD study, a third of service business lines
impose entry barriers, and restrictions on services imports and FDI remain high by
industrialized country standards.
41.
Labor market reform would also support growth both from the supply and
demand side. Past staff advice to reduce employment protection for regular workers and
expand social protection of non-regular workers is still appropriate. More labor market
flexibility would facilitate a reallocation of labor from the tradables to the nontradables
sector, while better social protection would strengthen domestic demand by reducing
precautionary savings. Moreover, increasing labor market participation of women, the old,
and the young would help offset the projected fall in total factor productivity associated with
a shift of economic activity to the less productive nontradables sector.
Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities recognize the need to rebalance growth towards the
nontradables sector and have already taken several initiatives to this effect. The next
phase of the restructuring process, scheduled from July to November 2009, will explicitly
target SMEs, which make up the lion’s share of the service sector. The government
announced further plans to develop the service industry on May 8: Nine service industries
have been chosen on the basis of potential for job creation, value added, and growth and will
be nurtured through streamlined regulation and increased competition. The government has
also signaled its intention to equalize tax treatment between the manufacturing sector and
these service sectors, although by extending preferential tax treatment to selected services. In
the area of labor reform, the government is considering ways to facilitate part time
employment, as it should help to raise the share of women, students, and elderly in the labor
force.

APPENDIX: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Korea’s government debt is sustainable predicated on a resumption of medium-term
fiscal consolidation. In the baseline scenario, the authorities are assumed to resume fiscal
consolidation plans over the medium term, targeting a balanced budget (excluding the
surplus of social security funds) by 2015. To achieve this, staff assumes that the authorities
take measures on the revenue side (CIT and PIT base broadening and, possibly, a hike in
VAT rates) and expenditure side (pension reform and streamlining of non-aging related
expenditures. In this scenario, it is further assumed that the Korean Asset Management
Company (KAMCO) will issue W 30 trillion (around 3 percent of GDP) in government
guaranteed bonds to buy up bad loans and other impaired assets of financial institutions over
a period of two years (partly repaying these through re-sale of assets), which is counted
towards the broader debt measure considered in this exercise. Under these assumptions,
government debt will initially increase quite steeply, mostly due the widening of the primary
deficit (excluding social security funds) led by the discretionary fiscal loosening in response
to the crisis and the cyclical revenue losses during current economic downturn. It will peak at
around 47 percent in 2011, before declining to 41 percent at the end of the forecast horizon as
the structural primary balance flips to a surplus as the consolidation measures kick in,
underscoring their importance. While the debt dynamics are broadly favorable, they remain
vulnerable to shocks, especially a macroeconomic shock or the realization of contingent
liabilities (i.e., if KAMCO has to issue more guaranteed bonds or if contingent liabilities
related to guarantees of SME loans and bank’s external debt are realized). However, even if
it is assumed that 50 percent of the guarantees issued in response to the crisis are called, the
debt dynamics do not become adverse.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Korea’s exchange rate system is classified as “free floating.” Previously, the exchange rate against
the U.S. dollar was allowed to float only within specified margins around the previous day’s
weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market. The margins were widened five times
between March 1990 and November 1997 (most recently to +/-10 percent), and on
December 16, 1997 were eliminated altogether. On July 6, 2009, the exchange rate was
W 1268.5=US$1. Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with
UN Security Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set
forth in Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Korea is on a 12-month consultation cycle. Staff discussions for the 2008 Article IV consultation
were conducted on a mission to Seoul during June 12-24, 2008. The Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on September 8, 2008. In addition, a staff visit took place during
December 4–10, 2008.

IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MCM: The final FSAP mission was conducted during October 2002. The mission completed the
FSAP by assessing the short-term vulnerability of the financial sector to macroeconomic and
sectoral shocks and analyzing overall financial sector soundness and developmental challenges,
including issues arising from the draft standards assessments. A follow-up technical assistance
mission on the supervision of derivatives markets was held in Seoul during January 9–20, 2003. The
Financial System Stability Assessment report has been published (Country Report No. 03/81) and is
available on the web through the following link: http://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a report was
drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report has been published
and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm.
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during April 2001, and a report was drafted and
finalized on November 28, 2001. The report has been published and is available on the web through
the link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03127.pdf.

Technical Assistance:

FAD: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to evaluate current
practices in budgeting and public expenditure management and to provide advice on setting up a
medium-term fiscal framework. A mission visited Seoul during August 31–September 16, 2005 to
provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy and administration.
MCM: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul to provide advice on financial holding company
supervision and derivatives regulation during December 8-17, 2008, on measures to deepen the
money market during December 4-14, 2007, on strengthening the debt management function and
further development of the government securities market during September 20-October 2, 2006, on
the reform and development of the foreign exchange market during March 30-April 13, 2006, and
on macroprudential and derivatives supervision during October 27-November 7, 2005.
STA: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000 to provide
advice on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward improving the
recording of financial derivatives and developing an international investment position statement,
and during November 28-December 11, 2007 on the GFSM 2001 framework.

ANNEX II: KOREA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Korea has been a subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996. During 2007−08, most SDDS
requirements were met. Korea makes use of the timeliness flexibility option for two data
categories: the analytical accounts of the banking sector and public sector operations. Recently,
central government operations data have been disseminated with delays due to temporary
technical capacity constraints. A data ROSC was published in May 2003.
Real Sector Statistics
The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the 1993 System
of National Accounts. Chain-linked (reference year 2005) and nominal GDP estimates are
compiled using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also
compiled using the income approach. After the revision to reference year 2005, the estimation
method for expenditure components has been altered from the commodity flow method to the
direct estimation method, in which each expenditure component is measured directly. The size
of the informal sector has not been measured.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 38 urban areas (about 80 percent of the urban
population) and is defined to exclude farm and fishing households. The CPI could be further
improved by extending coverage to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated every five
years; currently, expenditure weights are derived from the 2005 Family Income and Expenditure
Survey. The geometric mean of price changes should be used as a suitable alternative to the ratio
of arithmetic means of prices.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large segment of
service activity, as well as free trade zones and bonded warehouses. The weights are based
on 2005 revenue shares. The PPI could be improved by making more use of imputing missing
prices using the prices of similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last reported
price. A geometric mean of price relatives should be used rather than an arithmetic mean.
Government Finance Statistics
Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the central government, one
using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized standards. Concepts
and definitions used in the latter generally follow the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986. The data cover the budgetary units of the central
government and certain extra-budgetary funds owned or managed by budgetary units. These
statistics are produced by the Digital Budget and Accounting System (D-Brain), which
integrates the preparation of budget data, accounting reports, and the generation of fiscal
statistics on a monthly basis. The D-Brain provides for automatic crosschecks at different levels
of the compilation process.

5
Consolidated GFS data on the general government are not provided to the IMF for publication
in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial Statistics
(IFS), while the last year for which GFS for the consolidated central government were reported
for publication in the GFSY and the IFS is 2005. Certain fiscal data for general government is
reported on national websites.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Following the recommendations of the 2001 data ROSC mission, revised monetary aggregates
have been compiled since early 2002. These aggregates almost fully comply with the IMF’s
Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual. Data relating to foreign assets and foreign liabilities
are affected by the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) practice of valuing its financial assets and liabilities
at book value (rather than at market value) and revaluing its foreign currency-denominated
assets and liabilities twice yearly (rather than on a monthly basis). The authorities have begun
reporting monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms, but the data show
discrepancies from those reported using the old forms. The authorities have been informed of
the problem, and resolution is pending.
Korea participated in the pilot project—Coordinated Compilation Exercise—for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) conducted by the IMF’s Statistics Department. Indicators as of
end-2005 were submitted along with metadata, which are now available to the public through
the IMF’s website at:
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/fsi/fsicountrycategorylist/?strcode=KOR.
External Sector Statistics
The overall quality of the monthly balance of payments statistics is good. The BOK
implemented the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) in early 1998,
but some deviations remain in the classification and sectorization of certain transactions. There
is also incomplete coverage of transactions via intercompany accounts and noncash transactions.
Data on reinvested earnings on direct investment are not compiled, except for the net
profits/losses of overseas branches of domestic banks. In the financial account, the direct
investment data do not include trade credits or short-term loans with affiliated entities, which
are recorded as part of other investment. The BOK is scheduled to develop the classification and
sectorization, including the compilation of data on reinvested earnings on direct investment, in
the capital and financial account this year
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved since the financial
crisis. In early 2007, the BOK switched from annual to quarterly reporting of the International
Investment Position. Data dissemination on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity generally meets the SDDS specifications. Since April 2006, the authorities have
disseminated foreign reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a month, as had been
done since 1997.

Statement by WKHIMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Korea
August 7, 2009
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. The information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent data point to a rebound in economic activity consistent with staff
projections. Real GDP grew by 2.3 percent (q/q, sa) in the second quarter driven by a pickup
in consumption and exports. Consumption was supported by fiscal stimulus measures
(including PIT cuts, temporary tax relief on car sales and targeted cash transfers) and a
recovery in consumer confidence. Exports continue to benefit from the undervalued
exchange rate, global restocking, and fiscal measures abroad that have supported the sale of
Korean exports such as motor vehicles and flat screen TVs.
3.
July trade data confirm that the export recovery continues, albeit at a slower
pace than in June. Export growth was 4 percent m/m sa, slower than the 15.9 percent m/m,
sa in June and down by 20.1 percent y/y. Imports also showed signs of recovery, recording
positive growth for a second consecutive month (3.2 percent, m/m, sa), mainly due to an uptick in capital goods imports, bringing the y/y decline to 35.8 percent.
4.
Official reserves increased by $5.8 billion to $237.5 billion in July. The increase is
attributed to valuation gains of non-dollar denominated reserves, interest and dividend
income, as well as the unwinding of outstanding dollar swaps and loans.
5.
Inflation continued to decline in July. CPI inflation dropped to 1.6 percent (y/y)
from 2.0 percent in June and core inflation receded to 3.2 percent (y/y) from 3.5 percent,
against the background of the still substantial output gap.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Korea
On August 7, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Korea. 1
Background
Like other very open economies, Korea was hit hard by the global financial crisis towards the
last quarter of 2008. Capital left the country at a faster pace than during the 1997-98 crisis,
resulting in sharply lower asset prices, dislocations in money markets, and a spike in bank CDS
spreads reflecting the sector’s heavy reliance on wholesale funding. This was followed by the
largest export slump on record, which quickly spilled over into domestic demand. Overall, the
Korean economy contracted by 5.1 percent quarter/quarter (not annualized) in the last quarter
of 2008, among the sharpest contractions worldwide.
The authorities responded with a timely and comprehensive set of financial market and macrostabilization measures. The authorities set aside US$55 billion in foreign exchange reserves to
provide swaps or loans to banks and trade-related businesses, effectively substituting for loans
previously provided by foreign creditors. The Bank of Korea (BOK) cut interest rates by a
cumulative 325 basis points between October and February and relaxed conditions for its repo
operations. On the fiscal front, the authorities enacted a 2009 fiscal stimulus package equivalent
to 3.6 percent of GDP and provided generous quasi-fiscal support for ailing small and medium1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
sized enterprises (SMEs), mostly in the form of credit guarantees. Finally, they set up a bank
recapitalization fund and a toxic asset fund to shield the banking sector from the downturn and
prevent major deleveraging.
The steep exchange rate devaluation helped fend off deflationary pressures. The BOK
intervened only exceptionally, confined spot market intervention to smoothing operations and
secured swap lines from other central banks totaling US$90 billion. The weak won redirected
domestic demand from imports to domestic production and, in combination with falling oil prices,
turned the current account into a solid surplus in the first quarter of this year. Reserves declined
by US$38 billion in the last quarter of 2008 to US$200 billion and have since recovered.
Moreover, the weak won has sustained core inflation, at 3.5 percent in June, while headline
inflation has declined to 2 percent on the back of softer commodity prices.
External defaults and a credit crunch have been avoided and economic activity stabilized in the
first quarter of 2009. Bank credit continues to grow at a healthy pace and domestic bond
issuance in the first five months of 2009 (relative to GDP) is close to an all-time high. In the first
quarter of 2009, government consumption, construction investment, and private consumption
rose as a direct result of the fiscal stimulus, and the economy expanded by 0.1 percent q/q.
Economic activity continues to improve with exports, industrial production, and service sector
activity well above their end-2008 lows and business and consumer confidence back in
expansionary territory.
Going forward, the recent growth momentum is likely to moderate during the second half of
2009 and be followed by a drawn-out recovery. As the impulse from the front-loaded fiscal
stimulus and export gains from the steep depreciation of the won in early 2009 fade, the pickup
in growth is unlikely to be sustained at the same pace. Faced with a sluggish recovery in
demand from trading partners, and highly leveraged households and SMEs, Korean growth is
projected at -1¾ percent in 2009 and 2.5 percent in 2010. There is a distinct possibility that
weak global exports will weigh on Korean growth well beyond 2010, as Western consumers
permanently increase their savings rates. Other risks to the outlook are another bout of global
risk aversion, rising oil prices, or—on the upside—a stronger impact from stimulus measures in
Korea and abroad.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, despite strong macroeconomic policies and limited direct
financial sector exposure to subprime assets, Korea was hard hit by the global financial crisis.
The sudden withdrawal of capital and the collapse of external and domestic demand had led to
a sharp contraction in output in late 2008. Directors commended the authorities for their speedy
and comprehensive measures, which have successfully stabilized the economy and the
financial system.
Directors observed that, as domestic demand is constrained by highly leveraged households
and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), Korea’s recovery hinges critically on external
demand and global financial conditions. While a moderate recovery is likely to take hold next

3
year, in line with global growth prospects, the possibility of another bout of global risk aversion
poses a downside risk. Accordingly, Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies should
continue to focus on supporting growth until a self-sustained recovery is firmly established.
Directors supported the sizeable and frontloaded fiscal stimulus package and the intention to
maintain fiscal stimulus in 2010 given the uncertain outlook. Noting the distortionary nature of
quasi-fiscal measures to support SMEs, they welcomed the authorities’ plan to withdraw such
support gradually as conditions permit. Directors looked forward to the announcement of a
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan with concrete revenue and expenditure measures.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. While
vigilant monitoring of monetary conditions continues to be necessary, with their impact on asset
prices taken into account in monetary policy deliberations, concerns about rising house prices
are best addressed through prudential regulations, pending housing market reforms.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the won is undervalued relative to its mediumterm equilibrium level, and expected this trend to be reversed as capital inflows regain
momentum. They endorsed Korea’s free floating exchange rate regime, and emphasized that
foreign exchange intervention should remain limited to smoothing volatility. Some Directors
acknowledged that Korea’s large reserve buffers had helped provide liquidity and confidence to
markets in times of crisis, while a few others pointed to the potential costs of holding excessive
reserves, including from the global perspective.
Directors agreed that the financial system is well-positioned to withstand deterioration in asset
quality associated with the economic downturn. They were encouraged by the success of
preemptive bank recapitalization in preventing a credit crunch, and welcomed the establishment
of a fund to purchase impaired assets. Directors underscored the importance of linking future
capital injections more clearly to progress on bank-led restructuring of SMEs. Given banks’
increased reliance on wholesale funding, consideration should be given to introducing
prudential regulations limiting banks’ wholesale financing, and improving stress testing by banks
and regulators.
Directors observed that the crisis response framework has worked well. They encouraged the
authorities to consider a more formal approach to coordinating financial policies and sharing
information among the government, the financial regulators, and the central bank. They also
recommended further improvements to the insolvency regime, including through decriminalizing
personal bankruptcies.
Directors noted that the current global crisis has highlighted the urgency of rebalancing Korea’s
growth toward the nontradable sector, and welcomed the authorities’ renewed efforts to address
structural weaknesses. This would require, as a matter of priority, eliminating the preferential tax
treatment of the manufacturing sector, deregulating the service sector, and expediting SME
restructuring. Reducing employment protection for regular workers and expanding social
protection for nonregular workers would help improve labor market flexibility.

Statement by Hi-Su Lee, Executive Director for Republic of Korea, and
Suk Kwon Na, Advisor to the Executive Director
August 7, 2009
1.
My authorities greatly appreciate the productive policy dialogue during the Article IV
consultation and the staff’s high-quality papers. Staff’s recommendations and timely
guidance accord with their keen interest in the Korean economy. There is a broad consensus
between the authorities and staff on most aspects of the staff assessment. My authorities will
give due consideration to the staff recommendations, together with strengthened monitoring
and preparedness for the possible developments in the years to come.
Recent Economic Developments and Near-Term Risks
2.
Given the nature of a “once-in-a-century” crisis, Korea’s export-driven economy
experienced an unprecedented reversal of capital flows and a collapse in exports. With
Korean financial institutions facing a sharp reduction in their credit lines and rollover rates
on short-term external bank debt dropping to around 40 percent, the Korean economy
experienced a sharp contraction in the last quarter of 2008.
3.
Placing utmost emphasis on quick resolution of the impending crisis, the authorities
responded with several comprehensive policy packages as well as sectoral policy measures,
in line with the G-20 leaders’ commitment through the global recovery plan. With these
measures bearing fruit, the Korean economy is one of the first to recover from the global
contraction. As economic activity continues to improve, the first quarter growth rate in 2009
marked a positive number at 0.1 percent in qoq terms. More pleasingly, the growth rate in the
second quarter climbed to 2.3 percent, consistent with the increase in monthly industrial
production over the last six consecutive months, which almost recovered to its pre-crisis level
in June 2008. Such recent improvements are consistent with the OECD’s analysis that the
composite leading indicators of Korea are improving at the fastest pace during the current
crisis. The authorities view that stronger-than-expected recovery momentum came not only
from the fiscal stimulus and depreciation of the Korean Won, but also from the relative
strength of financial institutions’ balance sheets and Korea’s well-balanced diversification of
export markets and products. This has contributed to a quick improvement in market
confidence, in particular with the consumer confidence index in July 2009 recording the
highest in the recent seven years and the KOSPI index rising to more than 1,500 from the
1,018 in early March 2009.
4.
The clear thing to be noted is that these promising results have not made the
authorities complacent and they are cognizant of the still-existing risks facing Korea. They
view as major downside risks a more pronounced negative feedback loop between the real
economy and the financial sector, as well as oil price hikes. Moreover, while receding, the
risk of a sudden stop in financial flows still remains. The authorities fully recognize the
implication of Mr. Blanchard’s observation at the WEMD discussion in early July that Asia’s
economic fortunes are inextricably linked to a recovery in advanced economies, and agree

2
with him that the recent pickup in Asia’s exports tends to be based on restocking by
advanced economy importers and increased exports to China.
Macroeconomic Outlook and the Authorities’ Policy Focus
5.
Given the foregoing, the authorities project that the annual growth rate for this year
will amount to around -1.5 percent of GDP, a little bit higher than staff’s -1.8 percent of
GDP. The authorities’ more optimistic forecasts are more distinct from staff’s in terms of the
growth rate for 2010, which they project at around 4 percent, compared to 2.5 percent by
staff. They interpret that a robust growth momentum will be supported next year by the
global recovery and subsequent increase in domestic demand, given Korea’s specialization in
advanced manufacturing and its well-positioning to profit from solid growth in China and
other emerging markets. They agree with staff that inflation is projected to stay low at around
2 percent in the second half of 2009 and increase thereafter following the more evident
recovery and the recent increase in oil prices.
6.
In the beginning of this year, the Korean government has prepared three major
responses to achieve its 2009 Economic Policy Direction: (i) short-term measures to
maintain the current employment level; (ii) measures to prepare for the future; and (iii)
measures to enhance capabilities to revitalize the economy. Entering the second half of 2009,
the authorities consider that the uncertainty regarding the pace and persistence of economic
recovery still remains strong, in that the impact of front-loaded fiscal spending is likely to be
smaller in the second half. In this regard, they stand ready to put more emphasis on pursuing
both (i) the strengthening of the economic recovery momentum through maintaining
expansionary policy for the time being, and (ii) acceleration of structural reforms on which
less attention has been taken in the first half of 2009. In terms of preparing for the postcrisis, the authorities will strive to enhance potential growth, which has been lowered
recently, by increasing R&D investment, seeking an eco-friendly green development as a
new growth engine, and implementing deregulation.
Fiscal Policy
7.
To efficiently counter the economic downturn, the authorities have implemented a
decisive fiscal stimulus package, which includes introducing a supplementary budget
amounting to 28.6 trillion won in April 2009, as well as adopting front-loaded budget
implementation, resulting in 62.5 percent of budget expenditure being implemented at endJune. This notwithstanding, the authorities observed that a self-sustained recovery has not
been fully established, with still-existing room for downside risks. Thus, they agree with staff
that it seems too early to withdraw the fiscal stimulus in 2010.
8.
Another big issue is medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts. As pointed out in
several Article IV discussions in the recent past, it is clear that the success of the current
policy package depends on continued trust in the sustainability of the fiscal position. The
authorities fully recognize that credibility would be enhanced by concrete expenditure and

3
revenue measures to achieve the desired adjustment, and that long-term sustainability would
also be strengthened by structural reforms to limit the rise in aging-related costs. In this
regard, they plan to announce a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan covering 2009
through 2013 in October 2009. This plan will include both revenue and expenditure
measures, along with a detailed examination of their pros and cons. Furthermore, while
accepting that early action in aging-related pension and healthcare costs would help to create
fiscal space, the authorities will do more in the coming months, including by finalizing the
pension-related Acts which are now pending in the National Assembly, such as the
Government Employment Pension Act and the Korea Faculty Pension Act.
9.
Although the generous SME support introduced thus far has worked effectively, the
authorities are well-aware of the disincentives of such measures and will start to devote more
attention to the structural weaknesses of the SME sector. They have already started to
withdraw some support measures, such as reduction of the targets for SME loan growth.
They will take a gradual approach in accordance with the prevailing market situations and
sectoral needs.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
10.
The authorities consider that the risks of disinflation in the economy are low and that
monetary policy should currently focus on mitigating the downturn as well as on enhancing
resilience to any additional shocks. Thus, they are of the view that there is still need for an
accommodative monetary stance. Given the emerging signs of excess liquidity and money
shift to the asset-related market, the authorities are strengthening their close and vigilant
monitoring of the monetary situation and its impact on asset prices, while taking some
precautionary measures focusing on prudential regulation.
11.
Regarding the so-called exit strategy, the authorities view that it is important for
countries to start thinking now about how and when they would manage the exit from loose
monetary policy, considering that exiting from low policy rates too early could snuff out the
recovery. In addition, as the risks of exiting too late are broadly matched by the risks of
exiting early, the authorities fully agree with Mr. Viñals’ call during the WEMD discussion
for a delicate balancing act in terms of choosing the right time to begin tightening of policy.
12.
Foreign reserves are recovering from the low of $200.5 billion at end-November
2008, increasing to 231.7 billion at end-June 2009, ranking Korea as the 6th largest holder in
the world. Indeed, one lesson learnt from the crisis is that countries with large reserve buffers
have typically performed better during the crisis. Therefore, the authorities will maintain the
sufficient buffer of reserves to deal with any further bouts of capital withdrawal. However,
given that reducing global reserve accumulation is critical for the efficiency of investment
and sustainable recovery in global growth, the authorities view that standing bilateral and
multilateral currency swap arrangements should be expanded. On the other hand, they
appreciate the Fund’s efforts to introduce credible alternative to self-insurance, such as the

4
FCL and HAPAs, and look forward to the Fund’s further work, including the general SDR
allocation.
Financial Policies
13.
Although the volume of loans to household and corporate sectors is not bigger than
that in other advanced countries and banks’ NPL ratios have been quite well-managed thus
far, the authorities are fully aware that uncertainties could change the current situation in a
short period of time. As staff pointed out, the center of downside risk to the banking sector in
the period ahead is a negative feedback loop from the real economy. For this reason, the
authorities have paid sustained attention to the growing volume of corporate and household
loans. Being well aware of the positive relation between these loans and banks’ NPLs, the
authorities are dealing with this concern through proactive measures, such as the
establishment of a bank recapitalization fund and a new corporate restructuring fund, totaling
KRW 20 trillion and KRW 40 trillion, respectively. Also, the authorities announced recently
that they will push commercial banks to reduce the NPL ratio, which is currently 1.5%, down
to 1.0% by the end of this year. In fact, access to the foregoing recapitalization fund has been
clearly related to banks’ provision of SME credit thus far and has resulted in undermining
banks’ incentives for restructuring efforts. Reflecting the currently improved financial
situation, the authorities believe that now is the time to shift the focus of such access to the
broader restructuring strategy. Specifically, President Lee recently stressed the importance of
preemptive corporate restructuring and asked the authorities to report monthly on the status
of the restructuring.
14.
The need for strengthened prudential regulation regarding banks’ wholesale financing
is also well-recognized by the authorities. In the interest of remaining vigilant in this area, the
authorities are closely following the discussion at the Financial Stability Board and the Basel
Committee and actively communicate with them.
Structural Policies
15.
The authorities fully agree with staff on the strong need for a rebalanced growth for
years to come. Given the persistent lag in labor productivity in the services and SME sectors,
more tangible efforts will be poured into such areas. We are pleased to note that the
authorities started to accelerate their deregulation efforts in January 2009 by applying the
“Sunset Law” to all types of government regulation, whose application will be automatically
suspended or whose feasibility should be reviewed again on its expiration date.
16.
In the services sector, the authorities are redoubling their efforts to create jobs and
improve growth infrastructure by announcing “Service PROGRESS III” in January 2009,
following “Service PROGRESS II” announced in September 2008. As an implementation
plan, they prepared detailed plans to further develop service industries in May 2009, which
aim to properly regulate the service sector, encourage competition in the sector and correct
any unfair support compared to that provided to the manufacturing industry.

5
17.
The authorities are pursuing free trade agreements (FTAs) with various countries to
promote trade liberalization and to enhance the economy’s competitiveness. As a result of its
continued efforts, Korea has now effective FTAs with 18 countries including Chile, India,
Singapore, EFTA and ASEAN member countries, and is in the process of negotiating
agreements with various countries, such as the EU, Japan, Australia and Canada.
18.
In addition, the authorities set the Korean economy’s longer term vision as “Low
Carbon Green Growth”. They are recognizing environment-conscious growth as a
prerequisite to develop a new economic growth path. In this regard, they announced a
National Framework Plan for Green Growth and its 5-year implementation plan in July 2009.
Global Cooperation and Korea’s Role
19.
At such a crucial time like now, the Korean authorities are committed to actively
participate in global dialogues, such as the G-20 and the IMFC meetings, and strive to give
meaningful input to the standard-setting organizations. In the case of G-20 meetings, as one
of the Troika countries and the next Chairman in year 2010, Korea continues to play a role in
initiating the agenda and specifying the implementation plans. Regarding efforts to ensure
the Fund’s resources, the Korean authorities will do their role in accordance with their
economic weight in the world economy, as demonstrated by the announcement of its $10
billion contribution in May 2009.
Conclusion
20.
While delighted at the encouraging signs of quick recovery in the first half of 2009,
my Korean authorities acknowledge that this is only the start of the long road to sustained
economic prosperity. They thus stand ready to take additional measures, if deemed
appropriate, to accomplish the government’s social and economic objectives. With close
monitoring and crucial examination of the situation when making policy choices, the
authorities will weigh up each measure to determine fully the effects it will have on jobs and
public finances, and grasp the opportunity to overhaul the country’s weakening sectors.
21.
Finally, my Korean authorities wish to express their utmost appreciation to the Fund
and its staff for their continued and appropriate policy advice in addressing the risks facing
the country. They also extend their deepest gratitude to the Fund’s mission chief, Mr. Subir
Lall, and his team, for their hard work and frank and insightful advice in supporting Korea’s
economic plan.
