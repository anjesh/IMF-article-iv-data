Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with the Russian Federation
Approved by Marek Belka and Aasim Husain
July 13, 2009
• Discussions for the 2009 Article IV consultation were held in Moscow during May 21–June 1. The
mission comprised Mr. Thomsen (head), Messrs. Takizawa and Tiffin, Ms. Zakharova (all EUR);
Mr. Goldsworthy (FAD), Mr. Kisinbay, Mr. Tuya (both MCM), Ms. Kozack (RES), and Mr. Brekk
(resident representative). Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director, also participated in the discussions. The mission
met with First Deputy Prime Minister Shuvalov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Kudrin,
Central Bank of Russia (CBR) Governor Ignatiev, other senior officials, and representatives of financial
institutions, corporations, and think tanks.
• Summary. Russia has been hit hard by the dual shocks of declining oil prices and capital flow reversals.
The banking system is under strain from rising overdue loans, and credit to the private sector is contracting.
Despite a substantial fiscal response, economic activity is projected to decline sharply in 2009 and to
recover only tepidly in 2010. Against this background, staff made the following recommendations:
¾

On financial sector policies, staff called for a proactive and comprehensive plan—guided by systemic
stress tests—to restore the health of the banking system and reinvigorate credit growth. It also
underscored the need to develop contingency plans to bolster the authorities’ ability to proactively
address potential future problems in the banking system.

¾

On monetary policy, staff agreed that there was scope to lower interest rates, but suggested that the
authorities proceed cautiously in doing so. Over the medium term, monetary policy should be
refocused on inflation control, in the context of a flexible exchange rate policy.

¾

On fiscal policy, staff questioned the reversibility and effectiveness of the planned relaxation. It noted
that a smaller and better targeted stimulus could have a similar impact on growth, given the larger
fiscal multipliers, but would avoid a permanent change in the budget structure. A smaller non-oil
deficit in 2009 would also create room to maintain the fiscal stimulus next year, if needed. With this
in mind, staff advised the authorities to scale back the stimulus in 2009 and improve its targeting.

• Exchange rate regime. Russia’s exchange rate regime has been reclassified from “stabilized arrangement”
to “other managed arrangement” effective November 1, 2008 to reflect the managed depreciation of the
ruble, and higher day-to-day exchange-rate fluctuations. The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
• It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

I. FROM OVERHEATING TO CRISIS1
A. Deteriorating Macroeconomic Situation
In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Russian economy has been hit hard by dual
shocks—a collapse in oil prices and a sudden reversal of capital flows. Real GDP contracted
sharply in the first quarter, as Russia’s investment boom came to an abrupt end. As a result,
inflation pressures are easing. More recently, although rising oil prices and renewed capital
inflows have provided some support to the ruble, the economy has continued to falter.
1.
Following an extended period of overheating, the Russian economy is now
contracting sharply. Prior to the global financial crisis, large terms-of-trade gains and
surging capital inflows amid accommodative monetary and procyclical fiscal policies had
fueled rapid credit growth and lifted output well above potential by mid-2008. However, the
two key external drivers of Russia’s prolonged boom—rapidly rising oil prices and massive
capital inflows—sharply reversed last summer, triggering an abrupt contraction in domestic
demand. Fixed investment plummeted, shattering the nexus of high growth in investment,
productivity, and real wages that had powered consumption and the economic boom. Real
GDP contracted by 9¾ percent in Q1 2009 (year-over-year), while falling domestic demand
led to a steep drop in imports.

currency first depreciated by about 30 percent over December-January, but has since
recovered. Mirroring the evolution of the nominal rate, the ruble initially depreciated by some
15 percent in real effective terms, before reversing course in February, when it was close to
equilibrium based on CGER analysis. Since then, it has appreciated somewhat, leaving it
5 percent more depreciated than its pre-crisis level. Even now, however, staff analysis
suggests that the ruble remains broadly in equilibrium, as the recent increase in projected
medium-term oil prices has implied a parallel appreciation of the equilibrium real effective
exchange rate (Annex I).

sectors, but particularly the former.
6.
After a period of significant pressure, the balance of payments has stabilized
(Figure 2). Following a tightening of monetary policy and a large one-step devaluation in
January, reserve losses stopped and the ruble began to recover. Rising oil prices have further
strengthened the balance of payments since then.

The sharp economic slowdown in Russia is having an adverse impact on its
regional partners. It is spilling over to neighboring countries through trade, financial, and
remittance channels.2 Although direct trade links with Russia and several countries in Central
Asia and the Caucuses have weakened in recent years, such links remain strong with Belarus,
Finland, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Ukraine. Turkmenistan has also been hit hard, as gas
exports to Russia have declined in response to the fall in European demand for Russian gas.
With respect to financial channels, regional partners appear to have benefited from spillovers
related to Russia’s vast oil-driven external savings earlier this decade, but those benefits have
now been reversed. Some countries (Kazakhstan) have also suffered losses on investments in
Russia. The remittance link is especially strong for countries in Central Asia (Tajikistan and
Kyrgyz Republic) and the Caucasus (Georgia and Armenia) as well as in Belarus, Moldova
and Ukraine. As the crisis has caused a particularly sharp decline in construction—where
employment of foreign migrant workers is very high—it has prompted a large reverse
migration. This has contributed to unemployment pressures and added to the demand for
social services in home countries.

Some of the analysis in this paragraph is based on “How Russia Affects the Neighborhood: Trade, Financial,
and Remittance Channels,” by Fahad Altuki, Jaime Espinosa-Bowen and Nadeem Ilahi, forthcoming IMF
Working Paper. See also Box 5 in April 2009 MCD REO.

10
B. Policy Response to the Crisis
The authorities’ response to the crisis that erupted in the fall was swift and substantial,
reflecting concerns that weaknesses in the banking and corporate sectors could lead to a fullfledged crisis. As a result, policy interventions initially focused on maintaining external and
financial sector stability. However, as reserve losses mounted and capital outflows surged,
the ruble was devalued and monetary policy tightened. The authorities also announced a
large fiscal stimulus aimed at supporting domestic demand.
Monetary and Financial Policies
8.
As the crisis intensified in the fall, the authorities’ policy response was aimed at
avoiding a disorderly exchange rate depreciation and maintaining financial sector
stability. The response was rapid, but was circumscribed by a number of policy-induced
vulnerabilities that built up prior to the crisis. In particular, the authorities’ earlier focus on
exchange-rate stability had encouraged substantial foreign-currency borrowing, and had
contributed to unsustainably high rates of credit growth. Combined with supervisory
shortcomings, this had left Russian banks and corporates particularly vulnerable to a reversal
of inflows. Thus, the sudden change in exchange rate expectations triggered by the collapse
in oil prices led banks and corporates to seek to hedge their foreign currency exposures,
exacerbating pressure on the ruble. With the banking system under added pressure on account
of deposit outflows and some bank failures, the policy response focused on maintaining
stability and occurred in three distinct phases—accommodation, devaluation and tightening,
and gradual easing.

banking system, the authorities also raised the

outflows. By mid-January, the pace of reserve loss had reached over $50 billion per
month, while the total reserve loss since August amounted to over $200 billion.

more market-based levels—at their peak, overnight interbank rates reached
28 percent. Repo interest rates increased by almost 300 bps in February to around
12 percent, while rates on unsecured loans rose by almost 500 bps to around
18 percent. In the event, pressure on the exchange rate eased almost immediately and
reserves leveled off at around $380 billion.

•

Gradual easing. In light of a more stable currency and rising oil prices, monetary
policy has subsequently been gradually eased. Repo rates have come down, reaching
8¾ percent by late June. Moreover, with renewed inflows, local liquidity conditions
and interbank lending have improved, while the stock of uncollateralized loans
provided by the CBR at the height of the crisis is being rapidly repaid ahead of
schedule. As oil prices have risen, the ruble has appreciated in nominal terms against
the dollar-euro basket and reserves have increased. However, banks remain cautious,
preferring to hold deposits at the CBR rather than extend credit.

9.
The sharp economic downturn is testing the resilience of the banking system,
which remains reliant on CBR support and regulatory forbearance. The CBR introduced
regulatory forbearance by easing loan classification and provisioning requirements.
Moreover, the use of non-standard definitions for nonperforming and restructured/renewed
loans has further masked the extent of deterioration in banks’ loan books, particularly given
that evergreened loans are not reported as delinquent.3

3

International best practice requires that loans 90 days past due are reported as nonperforming and placed on
(interest) non-accrual status. By contrast, CBR regulations are more flexible, requiring only that loans classified
in categories IV and V be placed on non-accrual status—a less rigorous standard. Transparency is also reduced
because banks are not required to report as overdue the entire principal outstanding of an overdue loan, but
rather they may choose to report only the amount of the overdue payment.

The CBR has also taken steps to loosen accounting standards to limit banks’ mark-to-market
losses and to expand access to its unsecured loan auctions—with the latter increasing credit
risk to the CBR. Although a number of small- and medium-sized banks have been taken into
receivership, the combination of CBR liquidity provision and regulatory forbearance has
allowed the banking system to weather the early stages of the crisis relatively well.
Fiscal Policy
10.
Fiscal policy was expansionary in the second half of 2008, but the stimulus was
withdrawn in the first quarter of 2009. With budgetary expenditures heavily backloaded—
some 38 percent of expenditures were executed in the fourth quarter—fiscal policy provided
a large demand stimulus toward the end of 2008. However, following the seasonal spending
pattern observed in previous years, considerable retrenchment took place in the first quarter
of 2009. The non-oil deficit of the general government fell from some 6 percent of annual
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008 to roughly ¾ percent of annual projected GDP in the first
quarter of 2009—a withdrawal of over 5 percent of GDP.
11.
In April of 2009, as the economy continued to contract, the government passed a
large supplementary budget to support flagging domestic demand. The budget includes
large discretionary increases in defense and security spending; along with a package of anticrisis measures aimed at stimulating economic activity by reducing taxes, extending support
to strategic sectors, and enhancing social assistance. As result, total expenditure is expected
to increase by some 5 percent of GDP (text table). Excluding budgetary support to the
financial sector, Russia’s announced discretionary fiscal stimulus is one of the highest in the
G-20.

II. NEAR TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The Russian economy is projected to experience a deep recession in 2009, followed by a
sluggish recovery. With the banking system expected to remain under strain, credit growth
would turn negative and impede a robust rebound. Risks around this outlook are to the
downside.
12.
GDP growth is likely to recover only slowly. Going forward, the external
environment is likely to remain challenging, as the subdued outlook for global growth
implies only a gradual recovery in commodity prices. Moreover, global deleveraging by
financial institutions suggests that capital inflows to emerging economies, including Russia,
are unlikely to return to their pre-crisis levels any time soon. Against this background, real
GDP is expected to contract by 6½ percent in 2009, after expanding at an annual rate of 78 percent before the crisis. Growth is projected to recover only slowly over the course
of 2010, despite oil prices that are significantly higher than previously expected.4

4

Since the mission, the IMF’s oil price baseline for 2010 has been revised upward from $62.5 per barrel to
$74.5 per barrel. This led to a slight upward revision of the 2010 growth forecast relative to the April 2009
World Economic Outlook, from ½ percent to 1½ percent.

•

Compared to before the crisis, much lower oil prices and a sharp turn-around in capital
flows are expected to exert a significant drag on domestic demand. In particular, with
capital flows projected to remain limited, the investment-consumption nexus that
underpinned Russia’s impressive economic performance in recent years is likely to be
severed. Fixed investment would remain subdued in the face of heightened uncertainty
and reduced credit availability. With sluggish investment growth dampening labor
productivity, real wages are likely to remain stagnant. While the planned large fiscal
stimulus is expected to provide temporary support for private consumption, weak labor
market conditions would continue to weigh on private consumption well into 2010.

•

The current account surplus would decline in 2009 before improving modestly in 2010.
Imports are projected to fall steeply in 2009, with import growth turning weakly positive
in 2010, in line with domestic demand. This, combined with the expected gradual
recovery of oil prices, would lead to an improvement in the current account balance.
Taking into account the planned large-scale monetization of the fiscal deficit, capital
outflows are expected to remain relatively high at $68 billion. With an overall balance-ofpayments deficit of about $50 billion in 2009, reserves would decline to some
$375 billion by end-year.

•

Uncertainty regarding the state of bank balance sheets, including the extent of bad assets
and the potential capital shortfall, and the impact of the recession on the corporate and
household sectors is expected to significantly increase banks’ liquidity preferences and
limit the expansion of credit. As a result, nominal credit is projected to remain relatively
flat for the rest of the year, implying a drop of some 10 percent in real terms.

•

Inflationary pressures are expected to ease substantially as the output gap widens.
However, headline inflation is expected to decline only slowly during the remainder
of 2009 on account of base effects, falling to 11 percent by year-end. A further decline is
expected in 2010.

17
13.
Risks around this highly uncertain outlook are to the downside. Continuing
uncertainty about the depth and duration of the global financial crisis implies a wide range of
potential outcomes on either side of staff’s baseline projection. The current projection takes
into account the authorities’ strong countercyclical fiscal stance, and assumes a gradual
bottoming-out and a slow recovery in Russia. However, a more protracted global downturn—
and an attendant decline in commodity prices—would result in a delayed recovery and even
lower growth, particularly in 2010. Moreover, the planned fiscal relaxation might fail to
stimulate private consumption in the face of significant uncertainty about future income. In
addition, absent a more determined policy intervention, there is a risk that banks will
continue to struggle to adjust balance sheets, stifling credit expansion and impeding a
recovery. Finally, in the context of large external debt amortization coming due to 2009
and 2010 (text table), a renewed bout of global risk aversion could strain bank liquidity and
add to funding pressures facing corporates, with an attendant risk that growth could be lower.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector Policies
While the regulatory and supervisory framework has improved significantly in recent years,
remaining weaknesses—including the lack of comprehensive consolidated supervisory
powers—have hampered the CBR’s ability to ascertain the full extent of the deterioration in
banks’ portfolios. Overdue loans are expected to rise further as the economy continues to
falter, increasing pressure on banks’ capital adequacy. Thus, a proactive and comprehensive
plan to address the looming overhang of bad assets and associated capital shortfalls is
urgently needed to lay the foundation for a resumption of credit growth.
14.
Despite significant improvements, ongoing limitations in Russia’s regulatory and
supervisory framework are impeding a full assessment of the problems in the banking
system. The CBR’s monitoring of systemic risks has improved in recent years, as it has made
extensive efforts to bolster its financial stability analysis capabilities. Clear progress has also
been made with respect to day-to-day supervision over institutions and the supervisory staff
has been strengthened. That said, generous accounting and provisioning rules continue to
hamper the CBR’s ability to gauge the quality of assets and the adequacy of their loan-loss
reserves, heightening uncertainty about the creditworthiness of Russian banks. Given

18
shortcomings in reporting requirements for consolidated financial statements, there is
significant uncertainty regarding the activities of banks’ off-balance sheet activities—
including the extent to which they are being used to offload bad assets. This weakness is
compounded by the lack of adequate powers afforded to the CBR to monitor and supervise
bank holding companies and sanction bank officers and directors. These issues were
highlighted in the 2008 FSAP update.
15.
Overdue loans are expected to increase sharply over the course of the year,
denting capital adequacy. Although Russian banks appear to be relatively well capitalized,
the need for increasing loan-loss provisions will likely result in sizeable losses to banks’
profits and capital adequacy. The scale and scope of possible capital shortfalls remains
somewhat uncertain, given the flexible restructuring standards and the difficulties in
ascertaining the extent of bad assets. The government has set aside Ruble 500 billion
(1¼ percent of GDP) to support bank recapitalization and the modalities for such support are
in the process of being finalized.
16.
Staff strongly encouraged the CBR to develop a proactive and comprehensive
plan to deal with problem banks, guided by systemic stress tests and contingency plans.
On the basis of such stress tests—which need not be made public—viable banks should be
recapitalized, merged with healthy banks, or restructured. Absent a systematic analysis of
individual banks, it is unclear whether the funds set aside for recapitalization will be
sufficient.
•

Detailed reviews and mandatory systemic stress tests—utilizing similar assumptions and
the same point-in-time balance sheets—should be undertaken for large- and mediumsized banks to contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of banks’ financial health,
including estimates of viability and capital needs. While different options would need to
be considered for recapitalizing viable banks—including the scope for burden sharing
between the private and public sector—it is critical that the authorities move quickly and
convincingly. Moreover, regulatory guidance should be developed to provide banks with
a roadmap of the supervisory actions that the CBR intends to implement as banks’ capital
deteriorates and the level of problem loans increases. This would enable banks to plan
early to either increase capital from private sources or to attempt to find a buyer. Staff
noted that the CBR may require additional resources to undertake labor-intensive stress
tests and to intensify monitoring of systemically important banks.

•

Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to develop contingency plans and
resolution strategies. This would bolster the authorities’ ability to proactively address
potential future problems in the banking system. In light of the potential for a significant
increase in bank resolutions, the DIA should develop plans for the orderly disposition of
large volumes of assets from liquidated banks or from DIA-assisted mergers, as well as a
possible rise in deposit payouts. Moreover, given the CBR’s intention to roll back

19
regulatory forbearance, staff encouraged the development of a communication strategy to
explain how the rollback would be implemented and the procedures that the CBR would
adopt for determining compliance with capital requirements after the rollback.
•

Staff welcomed Russia's participation in international fora—including its membership in
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision—aimed at improving international
coordination in the areas of regulation, resolution, and information sharing. The
authorities’ efforts to coordinate with home-country supervisors might help to avoid an
abrupt unwinding of foreign exposures in Russia, and foster a better understanding of the
potential vulnerabilities in Russian banks’ cross-border positions.

17.
The CBR agreed that the situation in the banking system was deteriorating, but
viewed the problems as manageable. It did not expect a renewed bout of severe stress.
Although CBR officials concurred that the need for increased transparency in bank reporting
and the lack of consolidated supervisory powers hampered their ability to obtain a
comprehensive picture of the situation in the banking system, they believed that emerging
problems could be handled within the existing framework for bank regulation and
supervision. In particular, they did not see the need for systemic stress tests of banks,
underscoring that ad-hoc stress tests were already conducted as part of their regular
supervision activities. Moreover, since August 2008, the CBR has stepped up the intensity of
supervision, including by supplementing the on-site work of its regional branches and by
collecting detailed information from the 34 banks that had received government funds. Draft
legislation is under review within government to expand the CBR’s consolidated supervision
authority and is expected to be presented to Duma later this year.
B. Fiscal Policy
Despite persistent underexecution, fiscal policy had become increasingly pro-cyclical in the
years preceding the crisis. This reflected growing political pressures to spend more of
Russia’s oil wealth on investment and other strategic projects, as well as a failure to curb
current expenditures. In view of these pressures, and considering the importance of saving
much of this wealth in order to avoid excessive real appreciation as private consumption
returns to normal, staff is concerned that the significant planned relaxation will be difficult
to reverse. Thus, while a large fiscal stimulus is justified at this juncture, its size should be
limited and its composition reoriented toward expenditures that are better-targeted and selfreversing.
18.
A large fiscal expansion is underway. The headline balance is expected to swing
from a surplus of 4¼ percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of about 5½ percent in 2009—a
turnaround of nearly 10 percent of GDP. Oil revenues are projected to fall by about
4¼ percent of GDP at current WEO oil prices. The remainder of the decline in the general
government balance reflects a large fiscal stimulus, with expenditures set to rise by over

20
5 percent of GDP in the second half of the year. As a result, the non-oil deficit of the general
government is projected to increase by 5½ percent of GDP—reaching 13¾ percent of GDP.
The deficit will be monetized by drawing down the oil Reserve Fund, except for domestic
borrowing of up to 1 percent of GDP.
19.
The composition and size of the fiscal stimulus raise questions about its
reversibility and effectiveness. In particular, the current expenditure and tax structure could
become entrenched. This would make it difficult to achieve the authorities’ medium-term
fiscal target, implying an eventual return to a highly procyclical fiscal stance with upward
pressures on prices and the real exchange rate.
•

Given the 2009 budget, bringing the non-oil deficit down to the authorities’ 4.7 percent of
GDP medium-term target would require an adjustment in expenditure or non-oil revenues
of some 9 percent of GDP over the next four years. Taking into account budgetary
financing of critical reforms to the pension system (averaging 3 percent of GDP
annually5), as well as costs associated with support to the banking sector, the required
adjustment could exceed 11 percent of GDP. Moreover, looking ahead, staff calculations,
based on a permanent oil income model, suggest that additional adjustment, beyond the
4.7 percent of GDP non-oil deficit limit, may be needed to ensure long-term fiscal
solvency (Annex II). With an already high tax burden, and with non-statutory federal
spending amounting to only 7¼ percent of GDP, fiscal adjustment on this draconian scale
would only be possible with deep and comprehensive public sector reforms.

•

In view of these considerations, staff believes that the change in the non-oil deficit should
be kept to 2–3 percent of GDP in 2009 and its composition improved. A better targeted,
yet smaller, stimulus could have a similar impact on economic activity, given the larger
fiscal multipliers, but would reduce the risk of causing a permanent change in the tax and
expenditure structure. In particular, expenditure savings could be achieved by reducing
support to strategic enterprises and streamlining non-essential defense outlays. Staff also
recommends reorienting the stimulus toward a temporary increase in social transfers
targeted on credit-constrained households, and suggests a frontloading of infrastructure
projects for which preparations are advanced alongside a strengthening of procurement
procedures. This improvement in the composition of fiscal spending would also facilitate
the withdrawal of stimulus once private demand recovers, as many of the measures would
be self-reversing. In this regard, plans for frontloading the pension reform are appropriate,
as long as the additional outlays are accommodated by reducing other, less efficient,
spending.

5

The average cost of bringing the replacement rate to 30 percent from the current 24 percent has been estimated
at 3 percent of GDP annually (see Evsey Gurvich, 2007, “Prospects for the Russian Pension System,” Voprosy
Economiki, No. 9/2007). The required pension transfer would gradually increase from 0.9 percent of GDP in
2009 to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2027, and decline thereafter.

21
•

Looking to 2010, if a smaller non-oil deficit is targeted in 2009, there would be scope to
maintain the fiscal stimulus next year if needed. The desirability of maintaining, rather
than withdrawing, the stimulus in 2010 depends critically on the growth outlook, which is
highly uncertain. Under the current outlook, and assuming the 2009 stimulus is scaled
back and reoriented as described above, maintaining the stimulus next year would provide
important support to domestic demand. However, if the growth outlook improves, some
withdrawal of stimulus (of around 1 percent of GDP) would be appropriate in 2010.

20.
The authorities and staff agreed that it would be difficult to unwind the fiscal
stimulus in 2010 in its current form. Officials at the Ministry of Finance were particularly
concerned that spending pressures would continue next year, especially if the economy did
not recover quickly. They also viewed the composition of the stimulus as suboptimal, noting
that fiscal multipliers were likely to be small. Moreover, given that the stimulus package was
approved only in April, they were concerned that it would be difficult to implement
effectively such a large stimulus in the remaining 6–7 months. As a result, it was possible
that the planned stimulus would be underexecuted in 2009. However, there were no plans to
introduce a supplementary budget aimed at reducing the size of the stimulus. In view of the
exceptionally large uncertainties surrounding the outlook for 2010, the authorities have
decided to delay the submission of the 2010 budget to the Duma until the fall.
21.
To facilitate the large fiscal adjustment needed over the medium term, staff and
the authorities agreed that reinvigoration of public-sector reforms was a matter of
priority.
•

Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to advancing reforms in the health and
education sectors. IMF research suggests that Russia has scope to achieve significant
budgetary savings by improving expenditure efficiency, without compromising the
quality of services.6 Such savings could be particularly large in healthcare and social
protection, but public sector reforms in other areas, including civil service, military, and
education, would also be instrumental in creating the much-needed fiscal space.

•

Staff also supports the authorities’ plan to gradually replace the current revenue-based oil
taxation regime with a profit-based system (Annex III). Such a system would be more
closely tailored to differences in costs over time and across fields, and would better
balance the need to ensure a sufficient oil revenue take by the government against the
desirability of creating strong incentives to invest in oil exploration and production.
However, it was agreed that a necessary precondition for adopting such a system would

Working Paper No. 246.

22
be the introduction of transfer-pricing legislation consistent with OECD guidelines and a
strengthening of enforcement capacity.
C. Monetary Policy
With inflation declining, there is room to ease further the monetary policy stance. However,
given that the large liquidity injections associated with monetization of the fiscal deficit may
create risks to external stability, the CBR should move cautiously in reducing interest rates.
Looking farther ahead, the challenge for monetary policy will be to bring down entrenched
high inflation, with a view to bolstering Russia’s capacity to mobilize domestic savings to
fund much-needed investment.
22.
There is scope for a more accommodative monetary policy stance (Figure 4). Staff
and the authorities agreed that there is room to cut policy interest rates in light of a widening
output gap and declining inflation. However, the direct impact of lower interest rates on
domestic demand would likely be somewhat limited at first. Banks facing mounting overdue
loans and rising credit risk were likely to scale back the supply of credit as they attempted to
build liquidity and strengthen their balance sheets. At the same time, general uncertainty
about the economic situation was likely to reduce the demand for credit. Nonetheless, lower
interest rates should help reduce bank funding costs and support the financial system.
23.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the challenge for monetary policy in the
short run will be to strike the right balance between domestic and external stability.
Monetization of the fiscal deficit by drawing down the oil Reserve Fund would represent a
substantial injection of liquidity—amounting to around 70 percent of base money during the
remainder of 2009, under the assumption that the budget is fully executed. Although the CBR
expects a large portion of this to be sterilized, in part through the repayment of the
uncollateralized loan stock, staff still projects a net liquidity injection of around 35 percent of
base money.7 This is a significant injection into a banking system that is already liquid and
that is likely to continue to have strong liquidity preferences on account of high uncertainty.
This points to the risk that an excessive reduction in interest rates, or renewed expectations of
ruble depreciation in the face of a reversal of the recent oil price increase, might induce banks
and investors to shift out of rubles and into foreign exchange, putting excessive downward
pressures on the exchange rate. In view of this, staff believes that the CBR should move
cautiously in reducing policy rates. For their part, CBR officials noted that they stood ready
to halt the reduction in interest rates as needed to preserve external stability.

7

The gradual unwinding of the uncollateralized loan stock has the added benefit of reducing risks to the CBR’s
financial soundness.

24.
Staff welcomed the CBR’s policy of increased exchange-rate flexibility and
urged the CBR to keep monetary policy focused on reducing inflation.
•

Staff noted that the resumption of short-term capital inflows—most notably the carry
trade—underscored the importance of allowing the ruble to move flexibly, in both
directions, to avoid exacerbating short-term speculative inflows associated with one-way
bets on the currency. Staff acknowledged that an abrupt and dramatic shift in exchange
rate expectations and a reversal of capital inflows—perhaps associated with a rapid
decline in oil prices—could be cushioned by drawing on Russia’s substantial
international reserves. But ultimately, the authorities should stand ready to let the
exchange rate move in line with longer-term fundamentals.

•

Staff urged the CBR to refocus monetary policy on inflation control. It noted that the
crisis has laid bare the cost of orienting monetary policy toward nominal exchange rate
stability, as it has allowed high inflation to remain entrenched, at levels well above those
of G-20 peers. The consequences of this policy may be particularly severe in an
environment of limited external financing which is likely to prevail in the years to come.
In particular, the capacity of Russia’s financial system to mobilize long-term financing to
fund much-needed investment is likely to remain limited as long as inflation stays high,
impeding an expansion of the Russia’s productive capacity. Concerns in this regard are
heightened by the risk of continued procyclicality in fiscal policy even as GDP growth
begins to recover, which could spark renewed upward pressure on the real exchange rate.
This risk makes maintaining exchange rate flexibility particularly important, as it will be
critical that such real exchange rate pressures are not reflected in higher inflation.

25.
The authorities agreed with the importance of reducing inflation and expected to
achieve steady progress in this regard. In particular, they were committed to the
maintaining the higher degree of exchange rate flexibility seen since the beginning of the
year. However, given the importance of primary commodities to the balance of payments and
the volatility of commodity prices, they felt that it was pre-mature to commit to allowing the
exchange rate to fully respond to changing fundamentals at this stage. In this regard, while
much of the technical preparatory work is now in place, the authorities felt that it was too
early to commit to a timetable for moving to inflation targeting.
D. Structural Reforms
Boosting Russia’s long-term growth potential depends critically on advancing structural
reforms, including through accession to the WTO. However, the accession process appears
to be loosing momentum.
26.
Staff inquired about the prospect for reinvigorating reforms that would help
bolster Russia’s investment climate, including membership in the WTO. It noted that

25
Russia continues to score poorly on cross-country comparisons of the investment climate, not
least because of what is perceived to be heavy government interference in the economy.
Moreover, limited competition and lack of new entries are seen to be encouraging rent
seeking. Staff noted that important reforms in this regard appear to have stalled during the
period of high and rising oil prices—not least civil service and public administration
reforms—and it also expressed concern that support for early WTO accession seemed to be
loosing momentum. In this regard, staff noted that, as the scope for catch-up gains in
productivity begins to diminish, long-term growth will become increasingly dependent on
boosting investment, including by improving Russia’s still relatively poor investment climate.
The fact that the labor force is set to decline steadily, because of unfavorable demographical
factors, adds to the urgency of bolstering long-term growth by encouraging investment. Staff
also encouraged the authorities to maintain an open trade regime and avoid protectionist
measures.
27.
The authorities agreed on the need to move ahead with structural reforms. In this
regard, they confirmed that many reform aimed at improving the investment climate and
bolstering institutions were technically relatively well-advanced. However, as far as
implementation is concerned, the focus would be on areas critical to controlling public
spending, notably reforms to the health and education sectors. While stressing that WTO
accession remained an important goal, officials expressed frustration about the prolonged
process, acknowledging that it appeared to have lost some momentum. Indeed, shortly after
the mission, Russia suspended its bilateral bid for WTO membership, seeking instead to join
in partnership with Belarus and Kazakhstan as part of a customs union.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Russian economy has been hard hit by dual shocks as the two key drivers of
its prolonged boom—rapidly rising oil prices and massive capital inflows—have
suddenly reversed. Indeed, the swing in growth has been much stronger in Russia than in its
G-20 peers—despite a much larger fiscal stimulus than in many of these countries—and
prospects for an early recovery also appear less promising, barring an unexpected strong
rebound in the global economy and an attendant rally in commodity prices. The depth of the
crisis, but also the large scope for countercyclical policies, should serve as reminders of longstanding strengths and weaknesses in economic policies.
29.
Financial sector weaknesses and large external exposures have circumscribed
the policy response to the crisis. Faced with bank failures and deposit withdrawals, the
authorities initially provided low-interest rate ruble credits and intervened heavily to slow the
currency’s depreciation. This deliberate policy of cushioning the impact of the crisis likely
prevented a wave of corporate bankruptcies, stabilized the situation in the banking system,
and generally improved prospects by allowing cheap hedging of excessive foreign exposures
against ruble devaluation. But the unsustainable pace of reserve losses eventually forced the

26
authorities to abandon this costly policy—which clearly exacerbated capital outflows—and
prompted a significant tightening of monetary policy and a large depreciation of the ruble.
This policy shift has brought banking sector problems to the fore, revealing and exacerbating
pressures that had begun building with the sharp slowdown in the economy. Thus, banks’
financial situation and loan portfolios are now deteriorating at a notably faster pace. The key
immediate challenge facing the authorities at this time is how to deal with these mounting
problems.
30.
The authorities need to take a more proactive and concerted approach to
tackling the problems in the banking sector. Absent such an approach, there is a notable
risk of a prolonged credit freeze, as uncertainty about counterparty risks continue to linger
and banks become increasingly undercapitalized. A more proactive approach should include
mandatory, bottom-up stress tests of larger banks; a roadmap laying out the likely supervisory
responses as bank’s capital deteriorates and the level of problem loans increases; and a
strengthening of the CBR’s supervisory authority, not least by granting it broader
consolidated powers. Considering the exceptionally large number of small banks—and taking
advantage of the existence of comprehensive deposit insurance—the CBR should, in the view
of staff, be more willing to compel bank closures and consolidation. Importantly, despite the
explosive credit growth in recent years, the banking system is still small with credit-to-GDP
at about 40 percent. This implies that the potential cost of recapitalizing systemically
important institutions is unlikely to pose a major fiscal burden.
31.
The planned fiscal relaxation is excessive. Taking into account the projected cost of
urgently needed pension reforms, the relaxation will increase the non-oil deficit by some 1113 percent of GDP above the level prescribed by the government’s medium-term fiscal
framework. With non-statutory federal spending of only some 7¼ percent of GDP, fiscal
consolidation on this draconian scale will require unprecedented deep public sector reforms.
With little evidence of support for such reforms, and considering the spending pressures that
led to increasingly pro-cyclical policies before the crisis, staff would urge the authorities to
scale back the fiscal stimulus, from 5½ to about 2½ percent of GDP, and reorient its
composition toward measures that are self-reversing. Thus, while there is a case for a strong
discretionary relaxation, there is a need to better balance short-term cyclical considerations
and the medium-term objective of ensuring prudent spending of oil wealth. Without such
rebalancing, there is a risk that fiscal policy will become highly procyclical once private
demand normalizes, causing excessive real appreciation and stifling the diversification of the
economy away from its dependence on primary commodities.
32.
As to monetary policy, there is a case for continuing to reduce policy rates. While
a large-scale monetization of fiscal deficits is in store, staff agrees that the CBR should be
able to manage this by allowing the large stock of maturing uncollateralized credits to expire.
Still, banks will be highly liquid—reflecting a strong liquidity preference on their part in the
current highly uncertain environment—and the reduction in interest rates should proceed

27
slowly, taking into account the impact on ruble. In this regard, staff would also agree that the
CBR should stand ready—in the event that unexpected developments, notably a renewed
drop in oil prices, unsettle exchange rate expectations—to support the ruble, allowing a
further reduction in reserves. However, the increased exchange rate flexibility since the
beginning of the year has helped stabilize the balance of payments, and interventions should
be only temporary.
33.
Looking beyond the immediate policy response to the crisis, recent developments
point to important lessons regarding the macroeconomic policy mix and objectives and
the urgency of structural reforms.
•

The prudent policy of taxing and saving most of the oil revenue windfall during the good
years, and the attendant large buildup of reserves, has left Russia with ample room to
allow for a significant countercyclical fiscal expansion, including a large discretionary
stimulus. It also allowed monetary policy to cushion the initial shock, giving the private
sector time to adjust.

•

But the pre-crisis policy of controlled ruble appreciation, alongside regulatory
shortcomings, encouraged excessive foreign currency borrowing at a time when high oil
prices increased foreign appetite for Russian assets. The result was an oil-price related
surge in capital inflows and an associated credit explosion. Thus, while prudent fiscal
policy did prevent the commodity boom-and-bust through the current account, policy
weakness in other areas in effect allowed it through the capital account.

•

The inflexible exchange rate policy also led to entrenched high inflation as the inevitable
large real appreciation associated with the terms-of-trade gains was taken through price
adjustment. This has severely constrained the availability of long-term ruble financing
and left the financing of long-term investment projects dependent on foreign sources.
Thus, the cost of entrenched inflation is becoming increasingly evident now that access to
foreign financing is likely to be limited for some time as the process of global
deleveraging plays out.

•

Last but not least, the depth of the crisis is in part due to the failure to advance reforms
aimed at improving the investment climate and promoting diversification of the economy.
In particular, during the years of high oil prices, little progress was made in advancing the
many reforms that are important to curtailing the still pervasive government interference
in the economy and to increasing competition and reducing rent-seeking.

34.
Against this background, policy priorities—once the current crisis subsides—
should be geared toward medium- and long-term objectives. These include: refocusing
fiscal policy on the non-oil deficit, which should be credibly anchored on a target that is
sustainable from a long-term perspective; reorienting monetary policy toward controlling

28
inflation, in the context of a fully flexible exchange rate policy; and reinvigorating structural
reforms, notably public administration and civil service reforms, reforms of the judiciary, and
the drive to gain early accession to the WTO.

ANNEX I. RUSSIA’S EXTERNAL STABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS8
Recent Developments
According to the results of the two most-recent CGER exercises, Russia’s real exchange
rate (RER) remains broadly in
CGER Results, 2008–09
equilibrium. The Fall 2008 CGER exercise
(Percent deviation from estimated equilibrium)
suggested that Russia’s RER was in
equilibrium. The Spring 2009 exercise also

found that the RER was still in equilibrium,

(REER) had depreciated by around

12 percent.
These results, combined with additional empirical studies, confirm that the scale of the
Ruble’s real depreciation over December–January was appropriate, given the change in
Russia’s long-term fundamentals. In particular, between the two CGER exercises,
projected long-term oil prices under the WEO had dropped by around 30 percent, from about
$100 per barrel to $73 per barrel. In this context, recent studies of competitiveness in oilexporting countries have suggested that the elasticity of a country’s ERER with respect to the
price of oil is typically around 0.4–0.5 percent.9 Given the drop in projected oil prices, this
implies a 12–15 percent fall of Russia’s ERER, roughly equal to the ruble’s actual REER
depreciation over the same period. Most recently, oil prices and the exchange rate have
reversed course. Projected long-term oil prices increased by 14 percent over March-May to
around $83 per barrel, implying a 5–7 percent appreciation in the equilibrium RER. The
actual REER, on the other hand, has appreciated over the same period by about 10 percent.
Given the uncertainty typically associated with such an exercise, this suggests that Russia’s
exchange rate is still broadly in line with fundamentals.

Further Analysis
Arguably, the original CGER methodology, as outlined in IMF (2008)10, is not ideally
suited to the specific circumstances of an oil-exporting transition country such as Russia.
Specific concerns include:
•

Assessment of the underlying current account: A key assumption of the original CGER
approach is that the RER and current-account balance should return to equilibrium within
a relatively short time frame. This can be problematic for transition countries that have
typically experienced an extended period of trend real appreciation in the context of real
convergence. The assumption also may not hold for oil exporting countries if, for
example, macroeconomic policies are explicitly aimed at smoothing the effects of large
terms-of-trade shocks over an prolonged horizon. In this regard, estimating the underlying
current account by taking staff’s medium-term current-account projection (2014) and then
discounting for the projected real appreciation over this horizon may be misleading.11

•

MB approach. The sample used for estimating the current account norm in the original
IMF (2008) MB regression includes few oil exporters, potentially underestimating the
potential impact of a large change in oil prices for a country such as Russia.

•

ES approach. The traditional ES approach, as outlined in IMF (2008), takes the most
recent NFA as a benchmark of a “sustainable“ net foreign asset (NFA) level, and
calculates the current account level that stabilizes the economy’s NFA at that level. Again,
this assumption may not be wholly appropriate for oil exporting and transition economies.
On the one hand, oil exporting countries such as Russia have exhaustible resources,
suggesting a more dynamic NFA profile, in which foreign assets are accumulated in the
extraction phase to provide income in the future. On the other hand, significant catch-up
productivity gains experience by transition economies imply sharply higher future
incomes, and so may justify the opposite profile. In sum, determining the appropriate
NFA benchmark for a country such as Russia is a challenge, and may require a more
nuanced approach.

•

ERER approach. The IMF (2008) ERER approach uses fixed-effects panel techniques in
estimating the equilibrium relationship between a country’s RER and its fundamentals.
This is necessary, as the dependent variable in the CGER regression is CPI-based index

10

“Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies,” IMF Occasional Paper 261

In this context, much of the projected appreciation may reflect a trend process of productivity growth and
structural change. Rather than representing a drop in competitiveness, therefore, it represents the price impact of
an improvement in competitiveness, and so should not impact the current-account balance in the same manner.

41
and so is not comparable across countries. One potential drawback of this approach,
however, is that it implicitly assumes that the RER in each country has been, on average,
in equilibrium over the sample period. For many countries, especially transition countries
in the process of converging with their Western European neighbors, this assumption is
somewhat heroic—their RERs are likely to have been undervalued initially, as
communist-era prices and wages were often set below market-clearing levels and have
only gradually converged to their full economic value.12
In this context, the CGER exercises for Russia in both Fall 2008 and Spring 2009 have
been modified to account for some of these concerns. The modifications, together with
additional analysis by staff, are outlined below.
•

Underlying current account. To avoid some of the potential issues associated with
estimating the underlying current account based on medium-term projections, the
underlying current account for MB and ES approaches can instead be estimated more
directly by taking the actual 2008 balance and stripping it of all temporary factors.13 In the
case of Russia, this entails correcting the recorded balance of 6.1 percent GDP for: (i)
unusually high oil prices; and (ii) the recent positive output gap. The resulting underlying
balance is 3.9 percent of GDP, somewhat more conservative than the Spring 2009 CGER
estimate of 5.2 percent. In assessing the degree of exchange-rate misalignment in Russia,
this annex relies on the former estimate, implying that much of the analysis presented
below is based on a lower underlying current account balance than that used in the most
recent CGER exercise.

The CGER regression does allow for some transition-specific undervaluation, by including a variable that
captures the role of administered prices, and also allows for temporary off-equilibrium behavior by including a
dummy variable to account for the 1998 Russia crisis. Quantitatively, however, these features may not capture
the full scale of the trend appreciation exhibited by transition countries, which has exceeded 200 percent over
the past decade for many countries in the region.

further regressions, using samples that are more heavily dominated by oil exporting
countries; and replacing the oil balance/GDP variable in the CGER specification with
simple oil prices to avoid introducing potential endogeneity bias.14 The results of the
alternative specifications broadly agree, and indicate that Russia’s underlying current
account balance is generally in line with its fundamentals-based norm, thus confirming
that Russia’s RER is in equilibrium.15

around 220 percent of GDP in 2008 prices, and the annuity value of this wealth ranges
widely from 2–9 percent of GDP.16 The implications for the exchange rate, therefore, also
vary widely—depending on which benchmark is considered most appropriate, the
exchange rate may be substantially overvalued or undervalued. Given that the choice of
one benchmark over another is to some extent arbitrary, this alternative approach is still
somewhat unreliable as a firm indicator to assess Russia’s RER.
•

ERER approach. The IMF (2008) ERER methodology was used in both the Fall 2008
and Spring 2009 CGER exercises. As noted, however, an assumption underlying the
standard ERER approach—that the RER in each country has been, on average, in
equilibrium over the sample period—may not be appropriate in all cases. In light of this
potential concern, staff has considered an additional regression that: (i) uses as a
dependent variable USD wages, which are directly comparable across countries and serve
as a useful cost-based proxy of the real exchange rate; (ii) draws from a wider sample of
countries, and (iii) explicitly allows for the fact that most transition countries will not
have been in equilibrium for most of the sample period. The alternative specification
generally agrees with the conclusions of the CGER regression: it suggests that, following
the recent real depreciation toward the end of 2008, USD wages in Russia were 2 percent
below equilibrium, while the CGER approach suggests an undervaluation of 1 percent.
Both confirm that the RER is now roughly in equilibrium.

ANNEX II. ANCHORING LONG-TERM FISCAL POLICY17
The current crisis has necessitated a large deviation from the medium-term budget
framework, resulting in a fiscal deficit that is not sustainable in the long run. This situation is
further complicated by considerable emerging fiscal risks, including the large additional
outlays associated with the pension reform, rising healthcare costs, and sizable
infrastructure gaps. Against this background, there is a need for a credible fiscal anchor that
would underpin a sustainable exit from the sizable fiscal stimulus currently underway. Longterm fiscal policy would also need to address the sustainable and equitable use of Russia’s
exhaustible oil wealth.
Background
The 2009 crisis necessitated a deviation from the original medium-term budget
framework. In order to accommodate the sizable 2009 stimulus and allow for a realistic
adjustment over the medium term, the authorities temporarily suspended the deficit limits set
in the medium-term budget. In particular, the federal government non-oil deficit limit of
4.7 percent of GDP originally envisaged for 2011 was delayed until 2013. This limit reflects
long-term considerations suggesting that the sustainable consumption of oil wealth is
3.7 percent of GDP and that borrowing should be limited to 1 percent annually.
While a temporary fiscal relaxation is an appropriate response to the crisis, the implied
level of the non-oil deficit cannot be sustained in the long run. Given low public debt
(6½ percent of GDP in 2008) and the sizable savings accumulated in Russia’s oil funds
(estimated at over 16 percent of GDP at the end of 2008), there is ample fiscal room for a
temporary stimulus aimed at mitigating the impact of external shocks. However, the
projected increase in the general government non-oil deficit to 13¾ percent of GDP in 2009
is clearly unsustainable as it results in an explosive debt dynamic (Figure 1).

Establishing a credible long-term fiscal anchor
As the economy recovers post-crisis, it will be important to ensure long-term fiscal
solvency by returning the non-oil deficit on a sustainable path. Russia’s strong initial
fiscal position and the authorities’ prudent past management of the oil wealth allow for a
number of credible adjustment scenarios, including some initial build up of public debt.
However, taking into account a number of potentially serious fiscal risks, a conservative
strategy that aims at preserving the government’s net wealth would be advisable.
•

Considerable fiscal risks render conventional debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
inadequate for assessing long-term fiscal solvency in Russia. Given Russia’s low
initial debt level, a standard DSA could allow for a sizable increase in debt, as long as it
is stabilized at a reasonable level in the long run.18 However, such a strategy is prone to
risk, not least because of the potentially large fiscal costs of the pension reform—
estimated at 3 percent of GDP annually on average over the next 40 years19—and the
long-term spending pressures from rising healthcare costs and sizable infrastructure
gaps.20 Moreover, as in other oil-exporting countries, there is a high degree of uncertainty
regarding the long-term level of oil prices and the size of economically viable oil
reserves.

•

In light of these risks, a more cautious approach to fiscal sustainability would be
advisable. As a conservative alternative to the DSA, a framework based on the
permanent oil income model (POIM) that stabilizes government consumption out of oil
and financial wealth could be used to anchor fiscal policy (Box A1). The POIM is wellsuited for establishing a long-term fiscal policy benchmark for Russia. While this
approach is arguably conservative (e.g., it does not allow for a build up of public debt),
staff believes that it is appropriate for Russia in light of the considerable fiscal risks
discussed above. The sustainable non-oil deficit level implied by the POIM is meant as an
indicative benchmark to anchor fiscal policy over the long run. The framework could
accommodate temporary deviations from the benchmark to respond to shocks, while the
level of the benchmark should be periodically re-assessed in light of changing

18

Recent studies have identified a threshold of 40 percent of public debt to GDP (compared to the current ratio of 6.5 percent
in Russia) to mark the limit where the risk of debt distress significantly increases (www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2003/061003.htm).

46
macroeconomic and structural conditions. In addition, it is useful to carry out sensitivity
analysis with respect to key underlying assumptions, such as the long-term oil price level
and interest and growth rates.
Staff’s calculations, based on the POIM, suggest that a non-oil primary deficit in the
range of 1–2 percent of GDP would be sustainable. The POIM framework assumes a
gradual adjustment in the general government primary non-oil deficit of about 1.9 percent of
GDP per year until 2015 and limits government consumption in each period to the implicit
return on government wealth thereafter. Under baseline projections of oil prices, and the
long-term growth and interest rates, the framework implies a sustainable long-term level of
the non-oil primary deficit of 1½ percent of GDP (Table 1 and Figure 2). 21 It is important to
note, however, that the illustrative adjustment path presented here is one of many
alternatives. For example, ceteris paribus, a more frontloaded consolidation could allow
Russia to run a somewhat higher long-term sustainable level of the deficit. Conversely,
delaying the adjustment by a few years would require a larger, and potentially more painful,
consolidation down the road to an even lower sustainable deficit level.
The POIM framework implies that the 4.7 percent of GDP deficit limit stipulated in the
Budget Code is not sustainable over the long run. While the authorities’ non-oil deficit
target of 4.7 percent of GDP could ensure low levels of public debt for some time, it cannot
be sustained indefinitely. In particular, long-term simulations suggest that, as the country runs
out of oil, public debt starts increasing at an unsustainable pace (Figure 2).
Nevertheless, the 4.7 percent of GDP deficit limit could serve as a useful intermediate
target as the non-oil deficit is gradually reduced to sustainable levels. In this regard, the
forthcoming medium-term budget will be key in signaling the authorities’ commitment to
ensuring long-term fiscal solvency, sustainable consumption of oil wealth, and
intergenerational equity.

21

The baseline scenario assumes June 2009 WEO oil price projections and implies a sustainable non-oil deficit
of about 1.6 percent of GDP. Stress tests based on the long-term real Urals oil prices of US$40 and US$100 per
barrel yield the sustainable non-oil deficits of 1.1 and 1.9 percent of GDP respectively. The results are presented
in relation to total GDP, as opposed to a more conventional measure of the non-oil GDP, due to lack of reliable
non-oil GDP estimates for Russia. The results are broadly consistent with the estimates of sustainable
government consumption in earlier work (Country Report No. 06/430).

47
Annex II. Box 1. The Permanent Oil Income Model
The POIM applies the permanent income hypothesis developed by Friedman (1957) to help to
decide on how to allocate government wealth (including oil in the ground) across generations.
Since natural resources, such as oil, are viewed as an endowment of the country and not a
product of the effort of any given generation, the objective is to preserve the value of
government wealth for future generations. This would require that consumption in each period
is limited to permanent income or the implicit return on government wealth. The basic POIM
yields a constant per capita level of the primary non-oil deficit financed by perpetual income
from oil wealth.
While the POIM has some well documented drawbacks, including not allowing for
intergenerational transfers of the non-oil wealth, it offers a simple and intuitive framework that
could be used to construct a sustainability benchmark to guide fiscal policy over the longer term.
Countries may deviate for some time from such a benchmark, e.g. due to unexpected shocks.
However, a fiscal framework based on the sustainability benchmark would help to evaluate risks
and alternatives for returning to the sustainable path with a view to avoiding a sharp and painful
adjustment.1

ANNEX III: RUSSIA’S OIL TAXATION SYSTEM22
Concerns over low investment, falling production, and the influence that the fiscal regime
may be having on this have prompted a review of the oil taxation system. Some changes have
already been made including providing partial tax holidays for new fields in non-traditional
oil producing regions and reducing rates for heavily depleted fields.23 This report uses a
simulation model to evaluate Russia’s oil taxation system and to suggest additional ways to
make it more supportive of investment while still providing the government with an
appropriate share of oil sector profits.
Background
The current oil taxation system is dominated by revenue-based instruments. Total
revenue from upstream oil activity was 9.5 percent of GDP in 2008, most of which came
from the mineral extraction tax and export duty

(both of which are revenue-based), with the

it needs to adapt to the rising costs of oil
production. Russia’s oil taxation regime has been successful in providing the government
with very large revenue. However, the high tax burden may have contributed to low levels of
investment, with oil production declining in 2008 for the first time in many years. With the
cost of producing oil in Russia likely to increase going forward—owing to maturing oil fields
and the location of additional reserves in smaller, more remote, and more technically
challenging fields—production may continue to decline since the current revenue-based
system is particularly onerous on high cost fields.

22

and Daria Zakharova.
23

As oil fields are depleted, extracting oil from them generally becomes harder and more expensive.

51
Model results
The advantages of a profit-based system can be illustrated using a simulation model.
We use three oil field examples that broadly represent a low cost structure for a traditional
field in West Siberia, a new high cost development in East Siberia, and a very high cost
development on the continental shelf. The field examples are illustrative only. In order to
benchmark the fiscal regime in Russia against international comparators, we evaluated the
effect of imposing other countries’ tax systems on three oil field examples. We also model
the current regime for an oil field eligible for a partial tax holiday, the regime Russia had in
place prior to 2007 (“Russia 2007”), and an alternative profit-based regime (Table 1). We
assume WEO oil prices until 2014 and constant real prices thereafter.

little change in government revenue despite lower pre-tax net cash flows—and is now
above all other countries in the sample. The AETR for the alternative regime is relatively
unchanged due its reliance on profit-based instruments. The very high-cost project (not
shown in the figure) is not economical under WEO oil prices for any of the regimes—the
AETR exceeds 100 percent.
Progressivity. The degree of progressivity of the fiscal regime—the responsiveness of
government revenue to project profitability—is important for both the government and
investors. A more progressive regime allows the government to increase its share of
revenue when the investment is highly profitable, while giving some relief to investors
for projects with low rates of return. For Russia, the government “take” displays the
desired progressivity only if the increase in profits is driven by oil prices (figures below).
As profits rise on account of a fall in costs the government share under the current
Russian system declines slightly (rather than increases) owing to the dominance of
revenue-based instruments as a source of revenue. The alternative regime displays the
desired responsiveness to costs.

Investor risk. The oil price necessary to deliver an after-tax rate of return of
12 percent24—the “hurdle price”—is an indicator of risk as it signifies how far the oil
price can fall before the investor’s after tax rate of return declines to the assumed
required rate. The hurdle price under all regimes increases considerably as project costs
increase (figure). The alternative regime yields a lower hurdle price, particularly for the
very-high cost project. The maximum viable operating cost that would deliver an aftertax rate of return of 12 percent can also be viewed as a measure of risk. Given the
exploration and development costs for the high-cost project, oil fields with operating
costs above $1.80 per barrel 160

Summary of model results. A profit-based regime could: broadly maintain or even
increase the government take from highly profitable projects; expand the range of oil
fields that are viable by reducing the tax burden on marginal projects; and reduce key
measures of risk. In addition, the flexibility of the regime to automatically respond to
changing price and cost conditions will reduce the number of discretionary changes
needed (the current system has had to be amended numerous times), and thus provide
greater certainty for investors.

Transition arrangements
The authorities see merit in moving towards a profit-based regime but they first need to
strengthen their administrative capacity. Transfer pricing rules need to tightened and
brought in line with OECD guidelines, and the administrative capacity to enforce the rules
will need to be strengthened. To further safeguard revenue, the new regime could be applied
to new fields only, maintaining the current system for existing fields. This would require the
strict enforcement of ring fencing rules to prevent a company from transferring profits
between fields operating under the different systems.
Given the time it will take to prepare for a profit-based system, an initial set of minimal
yet important reforms could be implemented sooner. This could include the following:
further lowering tax rates for fields located in frontier regions with higher cost of
development and extraction; using other proxies for costs, in addition to oil field location and
depletion, such as the size of recoverable oil reserves; and exploring whether some costs
could be made deductible against the mineral extraction tax or export duty, as a means of
transitioning to a profit-based regime.

Exchange Arrangements: The de jure arrangement is a managed float with no
pre-determined path for the exchange rate. The Central Bank of the Russian
Federation (CBR) sets and announces the official exchange rates of foreign
currencies against the ruble on a daily basis. These rates are based on ruble quotes
against the dollar on the internal foreign exchange market and on quotes of other
foreign currencies against the dollar on the global exchange market. The CBR
intervenes in both interbank currency exchanges and the over-the-counter
interbank market to limit fluctuations in the exchange rate of the ruble against a
basket of the euro and dollar in the short run. The dollar is the main intervention
currency. As a result of the stability of the ruble against the Euro-dollar basket,
the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as stabilized arrangement
between April 30 and November 1, 2008. Since November 2008, the CBR has
instigated frequent depreciation of the ruble against the Euro/dollar composite,
while also allowing larger day-to-day fluctuations. On February 9, 2009, the CBR

3
established a trading band for the ruble. After stabilizing at the upper edge of the
band, the ruble fluctuated inside the band as a result of the CBR intervention.
Therefore, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed
arrangement effective November 1, 2008. The Russian Federation accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement
with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for currents international
transactions.

ANNEX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
1.
World Bank Group activities in Russia are currently guided by the three-year
Country Partnership Strategy (FY07–09) which was endorsed by the Bank’s Board in
December 2006. This productive and innovative period in the relationship is coming to a
close. The next phase, from FY10–12, will build on many solid achievements. Details of the
engagement are now under discussion with the Russian Federation but are likely to rest on (i)
extension of the existing program, and (ii) possible new Bank support to the Government’s
anti-crisis and broader modernization agenda.
2.
Extending the existing program would entail more intensive use of new instruments
that leverage the World Bank Group’s knowledge, project management skills, private sector
expertise and AAA rating. In particular, the use of guarantees is expected to grow to help
reduce the cost of borrowing in capital markets for public financing of infrastructure. The
Federal Government is also expected to conclude the first text case of the “new modalities.”
These are projects financed under a Russian Federation budget line, together with fee-based
services for project appraisal and implementation or technical assistance operations, at the
federal or sub-national level.
3.
Given pressure on Russia’s fiscal reserves and external position due to the global
financial crisis, the Russian Federation might seek some new financing from the World Bank
to modernize the economy, increase the efficiency of public expenditures, and strengthen the
position of Russia in the post-crisis period. Themes are likely to include the effectiveness of
public expenditures, social programs, support to vulnerable groups, and management of subnational public finance.
4.
Substantial developmental challenges remain in a large number of Russian regions
remain. As in the previous CPS, the federal government has encouraged the Bank Group to
deepen its direct involvement in the regions. Correspondingly, a central theme of the
extended CPS will continue to be in select regions, including economic analysis (growth and
business environment diagnostics), regional development strategies, and related investment
projects. Sub-national borrowing and new fee-for-service arrangements for investment and
policy advice are likely to remain at current levels due to fiscal and liquidity constraints in
the regions. IFC and MIGA operations are in very high demand yet face headroom
constraints (Russia is IFC’s and MIGA’s largest exposure).
5.
The new CPS period will continue to serve the realization of four primary
objectives: (a) diversifying the economy for sustainable development and growth (formerly,
“Sustaining Rapid Growth”, (b) improving public sector management and performance, (c)
improving the delivery of social services, and (d) enhancing Russia’s global role. The first
three pillars correspond closely to the pillars of the previous Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), and channel support directly toward the development challenges and policies
elaborated in the government’s Medium-Term Economic Program, with a particular focus on
the regions. The fourth pillar forms the basis for a new area of assistance, and concerns
Russia’s integration in the world economy and donor community.

5
Major areas of Bank Group activities by CPS strategic pillars
(a) Diversifying the economy for sustainable development and growth
6.
The World Bank Group will assist Russia in various ways in meeting the challenges
of sustaining rapid growth, including participation in macro-policy debates, monitoring the
investment climate, supporting public investment and PPPs for growth and diversification,
working with regions to identify and overcome barriers to growth, supporting investments in
priority areas at the regional level, and providing direct assistance to the private sector:
•

Macroeconomic policy, long-term fiscal sustainability, and the effective management
of Russia’s large external inflows: The Bank will contribute to the macro-policy
debate in Russia through the periodic Russian Economic Reports, on-demand policy
notes and knowledge sharing. In addition, there is strong interest in the Bank’s
technical assistance in advising on alternative uses for the windfall oil revenues,
including the development of an institutional framework for the effective
management of a growing diversified portfolio of foreign assets. The Bank has
finished a study on long-term fiscal risks and fiscal sustainability. In April 2008, the
Bank of Russia and World Bank Treasury formally signed a fee-based services
agreement whereby Treasury will provide technical support in internal investment
management capacity for a period of 3 to 4 years. In addition, the Bank helped
strengthen the financial sector through lending and TA for securities market
regulation, financial sector strategy (government assets and liability management,
including reserves and stabilization funds management), and insurance and banking
sector supervision. On a fee basis, the Bank provided TA to the Central Bank to
support payments system development and monitoring.

•

Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank will continue periodic
business environment and enterprise performance (BEEPS) surveys, regional
investment climate assessments, and administrative barriers studies undertaken by
FIAS for interested regions. The Bank and MIGA can work at the regional level on
capacity building and the development of investment promotion programs for
attracting FDI, similar to the initiative currently underway in Rostov Region. WBI
will continue capacity-building activities related to investment climate assessments.

•

Supporting energy efficiency. The World Bank jointly with the IFC recently
completed a study on energy efficiency that provides senior Russian policymakers
with a comprehensive and practical analysis of energy efficiency issues in Russia, its
potential, benefits, and policy recommendations. At present, the World Bank together
with IFC implement an energy efficiency advisory project in the North-West (NW)
region of Russia. The project objective is to equip four oblasts of the NW region with
methodology and tools to address the regional Energy Efficiency agenda in a
comprehensive strategic manner.

6
•

Supporting Government investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) for
growth and diversification: On-going investment projects support land registration
and the development of a national cadastre for securing property rights and the
development of land markets. In addition, regular and reimbursable TAs are now
being provided to support the development of PPPs across sectors. In particular, the
largest Bank’s fee-for-service portfolio belongs to the City of St. Petersburg and
includes such large scale infrastructure projects as Western High Speed Diameter,
Orlovsky tunnel, NADEX and Pulkovo airport. The Bank would also continue
cooperaration with Russia's Development Bank (VneshEconomBank-VEB) on both
PPP joint activities and on potentially providing a partial credit guarantee of the Bank
to the VEB in support of its efforts to raise funding for infrastructure investments. In
addition, the Bank intends to support efforts of the Higher School of Economics of
Moscow to develop an e-learning program on PPP for the audience including federal
and regional stakeholder, including authorities and business community, in Russia as
well as in several other CIS countries. Another area where the Bank is helping the
Government to prepare an investment program is microfinance sector, with focus on
financial cooperatives and their integration into the financial system of the country.

•

Working with regions to identify engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and
remove barriers to growth and labor mobility: The Bank held two major knowledge
events on regional development strategies in early 2008: an early discussion of World
Development Report on regional disparities and its implications for Russia, and
Regional Development Strategies workshop for Russia’s regional governments and
other stakeholders of regional development. In addition, the Bank has finalized a
Country Economic Memorandum focused on barriers to growth at the sub-national
level and on issues of regional agglomerations. The development of fee-for-service
arrangements with the regions would provide another avenue for supporting
preparation of regional investment strategies and growth analyses, and provision of
other analytical services. Also, the Bank is starting new analytical work on internal
migration in Russia as part of a broader, CIS-wide engagement on migration issues
and policies.

•

Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The IFC/Bank SubNational Development Program will support priority regional public investments. The
government is interested in developing this financing mechanism further, as it
involves direct lending to well-performing regions and municipalities without
sovereign guarantees. Three such sub-national operations have been completed to
date, including two in the Chuvash Republic and one in Petropavlosk municipality
(Kamchatka). In addition, one operation (Mariy El) has been approved by the Board
and a credit agreement signed by the client, and another one (Mytischi) is supposed to
be approved by the Board by the end of this fiscal year. Infrastructure is also an
important area of IFC investments. This concerns primarily transport and logistics,
but also includes municipal infrastructure. MIGA can play a role in supporting
foreign direct investment in infrastructure at the sub-sovereign level, including in the

7
water and solid waste sectors. Regional infrastructure projects supported by the
Subnational Program is another area where the Bank and IFC could partner with VEB
for joint project preparation and support.
•

Providing direct support to the private sector: IFC will continue to support Russia’s
private sector growth agenda through a combination of financial and advisory
services to promote the growth of the private sector and the diversification of the
Russian economy. IFC will finance projects (1) with important spill-over effects to
other companies, such as infrastructure and financial markets, (2) in sectors where
Russia may have a comparative advantage, for example the processing of natural
resources and those that promote the knowledge economy, and (3) those increasing
the range and quality of products and services available in the Russian market,
particularly outside of Moscow. Much of IFC’s activities will remain concentrated in
the financial sector, where priorities will be: (i) building long-term relationships with
medium-sized independent private regional banks, so as to increase competition and
the range of services available to the population. IFC financing, provided in the form
of long-term senior loans and, in selected cases, subordinated loans, will help to
strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, reach new clients (including SMEs), attract
more depositors, and consolidate their position as leading regional banks; (ii)
supporting the introduction of specialized banking products, including mortgage
financing, consumer finance and leasing; (iii) supporting the process of privatization
of state-owned banks, as and when requested by the Russian Government; and (iv)
supporting development and use of new financial instruments, such as partial
guarantees of local currency bonds and securitization.

•

Continuing IFC advisory work through the Private Enterprise Partnership and FIAS:
This technical assistance will address the following objectives: (a) increasing the
development impact of investments through strengthening local suppliers and
engaging in community development work around large investments; (b) building the
capacity of private banks to deliver new product lines, such as mortgage finance and
financing for energy efficiency; and (c) improving corporate governance and
environmental sustainability through work with banks and real sector clients,
including IFC investees. FIAS will continue to work with select regions to improve
the business climate by assisting in implementation of policies/instruments to kickstart functioning markets of land and commercial real estate.

•

MIGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political
risk guarantees: Supporting foreign investment in infrastructure, in close
coordination with the Bank, will remain an important area of MIGA’s activity in
Russia. In the financial sector, the Agency will continue to explore opportunities to
support capital markets transactions, including asset-backed securitizations. MIGA
may also continue to promote the role and assist in the expansion of foreign banks in
the Russian banking sector. Areas for potential further involvement in Russia include
manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.

8
(b) Improving public sector management and performance
7.
Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank will remain
engaged in supporting programs for modernizing selected public sector institutions,
improving government administration, the judiciary, local self-government, and budgetary
management at federal and sub-national levels. The Bank will expand its engagement in
regions in these areas, in accordance with the federal priority for improving public sector
performance at the sub-national level.
•

Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The completion of on-going projects
will contribute to the modernization of public institutions and improved public
services. These include tax modernization, customs development, cadastre and
registration, fiscal federalism, performance-based budgeting, treasury development,
and a statistical development project.

•

Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The Bank will
continue its close engagement with the government in the area of administrative
reform at the federal and sub-national levels, including the coordination and
implementation of substantial donor funds. The primary goal will continue to be
bringing Bank and international expertise to bear on the implementation of the
government’s program for administrative reform, which currently places a strong
emphasis on encouraging initiatives at the sub-national level. So far, the Bank has
concentrated sub-national work in the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the
North-West. A fee-based advisory service supported Khanti-Mansiysk Okrug-Yugra
on administrative streamlining and functional reviews. Similar fee-based advisory
services may also be developed with other regions. Support for public administration
and governance for selected regions which cannot afford fee-based services is being
provided through a DFID Trust Fund which runs from 2007–10.

•

Providing analytical support on effectiveness of public expenditures, transparency
and accountability. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank has started
work on a Public Expenditure Review (PER) focusing on the overall structure and
efficiency of public expenditures with particular focus on the wage bill, education,
and transportation expenditures. This could develop into programmatic exercise in the
following years. Relatedly, and in close coordination, it is pursuing a social
expenditures review focusing on subnational expenditures on education, health and
social assistance.

•

Supporting budgetary reforms: The Bank will continue to respond to the demands of
the federal and some regional governments for assistance in budgetary reform and the
development of performance-based budgeting. In addition, the Bank will remain a
partner to the government in the continued scaling up of the Fiscal Federalism Project
(now financed by the Russian government) and its expansion to the municipal level.

9
•

Promoting the reform of local self-government: The Bank will continue its dialogue
with the government in this area, and in brining international experience to bear on
this vital area of reform in Russia. A study has been launched for monitoring and
assisting the development of local-self government in rural areas in the Perm, Penza,
and Adygeya regions. The Bank will seek to engage directly with regions and
municipalities in this area on the basis of new modalities, including a discussion of
replicating the positive experience of the Fiscal Federalism Project model for building
capacity at the municipal level.

•

Investing in municipal development: On-going and possible future regional projects
have significance for overall municipal development and the quality of municipal
services. This includes the completed Municipal Heating, Municipal Water and
Wastewater projects and on-going Saint Petersburg Economic Development Project,
as well as the Housing and Communal Services project awaiting for government
signature, possible regional subnational projects on water and heating system
upgrades, and a proposed Cultural Heritage II project (FY09) aimed to use the
cultural heritage and the cultural heritage tourism as a resource for economical and
social development in the participating regions. The Stavropol pilot Local Initiatives
Support project improves the quality of settlement level social infrastructure and the
Bank is working with Ministry of Regional Development on scaling up the program
nationally.

•

Stepping up engagement on judicial reform: Assistance on judicial reform also
involves the coordination of donor funds and special cooperation at the regional level.
A recently approved project, which complements the 2007–11 Federal Targeted
Program for judicial modernization, supports judicial reform (FY07) with a focus on
improving the efficiency of dispute resolution and the transparency of judicial
functioning. A complementary grant from the Government of Japan will provide
support to Perm Krai and Leningradskaya Oblast on demand-side justice sector issues
such as legal aid to the poor and juvenile justice. In addition, at the request of the
Chairman of the Supreme Commercial Court the Bank plans to partner with it and the
Ministry of Economic Development to support the drafting of framework legislation
to strengthen administrative resolution of disputes and complaints handling, as well as
individual bankruptcy law.

•

Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent national-level anti-corruption
program may begin to take shape, the Bank may explore avenues of possible
constructive contributions to such anti-corruption initiatives.

(c) Improving the delivery of social and communal services
8.
In addition to continued general cooperation with the federal government, the Bank
will concentrate much of its support for improving social service delivery at the sub-national
level. The Government has prioritized the social sector and social services in its medium-

10
term program. Given that the primary responsibilities and initiatives for reform in these
services will be at the sub-national level, the Bank will concentrate its focus on the regions.
Main activities include the continuation of work in the areas of poverty, education, and health
in cooperation with the regions. Most recent additional activities include monitoring of labor
market developments (at the federal and regional levels), and technical assistance for design
and monitoring of active labor market programs. Monitoring of social trends and project
design for improvement of quality of social services at the local level will be continued in the
Southern Federal Okrug and in other regions under fee-based services arrangements. Another
critical area for improving living standards is provision of housing and communal services.
The government places high importance on improving the performance of the housing and
communal services (HCS) sector and on the delivery of high quality services by communal
enterprises, and closely links service provision with improving the quality of life.
•

Continuation of the poverty work: In addition to continued cooperation with Rosstat
and federal ministries, the emphasis of the Bank poverty work (in cooperation with
DFID) has moved to the regional level. The Bank is working, and will continue to
work, directly with regions on monitoring poverty and improving social assistance
programs aimed at better targeting. Regional social protection strategies for Tver and
some other regions will be developed with Bank assistance. Successful models of
cooperation can be scaled up to similar regions.

•

Improving the health of the population: The Bank will continue its engagement with
the government on adult health, and the development of a national strategy to
improve the health of the population, with the goal of reversing the strongly negative
trends in premature mortality and morbidity. As a follow up to earlier child welfare
efforts and jointly with international donors the Bank will assist in design and
implementation of practical mechanism for family support, preventive social welfare
and child care at federal and regional level. Additional advocacy, public awareness
and information sharing efforts jointly with government leaders, public figures,
private sector and NGOs will be undertaken in support of critically needed
government policies in this area. Another priority is to advise federal and regional
authorities on appropriate risk pooling, insurance, and sustainable health financing.
IFC will continue working with private companies on programs for occupational
health, including HIV-AIDS issues. The Bank will implement on-going projects in
the health sector and offer to scale up or modify existing models at the sub-national
level as a service to regions. The development of public-private partnerships in the
health sector could be supported jointly by TA from the Bank and direct financing by
IFC to PPPs and/or purely private providers. Lessons from the TB/AIDS project
could be applied through more focused interventions in interested regions through
sub-national projects and TA. A few regional projects could be supported for
removing environmental hotspots and addressing other environmental concerns
posing major health risks to population.

11
•

Modernization and improvement of the education system and vocational training:
The Bank will complete current projects in education designed to modernize the
system and improve vocational training. As is the case of health, the Bank will seek
to meet demands of regions for special support at the sub-national level for education
reform. Regional TA and possible projects could focus on improving systems for
professional and vocational education, accompanied by parallel assessments of local
labor markets with an eye to improving the quality of local professional labor supply.
Another focus could be pre-school education and early childhood education. The
recently completed Youth Strategy by the Bank provides recommendations for
improvements in youth policies, with possible applications to Russia for forwarding
the dialogue on youth policies in the area of education and training.

•

Improvement in the provision of housing and communal services: The Bank’s support
in the infrastructure sector will largely focus on improving quality of utility services
and housing. The Bank has a large portfolio focused on improving heating, water,
wastewater, and other municipal services in selected regions. This includes the
recently completed Municipal Heating, Municipal Water and Wastewater projects and
approved by the Board and awaiting for government signature the Housing and
Communal Services project that aims to support reforms and investments in HCS on
grant basis allocated to regions competitively. Also, a large share of sub-national
lending is expected to focus on improving these services.

•

Housing finance and energy efficiency through IFC's PEP program: IFC’s PEP
program is currently focusing its work on two new product platforms in Russia:
housing finance and energy efficiency, both of which are complemented by IFC
investments in this area. The Primary Mortgage Development Project is working to
streamline the mortgage lending process in Russia. IFC's Sustainable Energy
Efficiency Program in Russia combines IFC's advisory and investment capacity. The
project makes credit lines available to banks for on-lending for energy efficiency
projects, and provides technical assistance to banks and private companies in order to
raise the lending volumes available for energy-saving projects. The program has
already disbursed its first credit line to Center Invest Bank in Rostov, and currently
has a US$60 million pipeline of potential deals across all regions of Russia. IFC also
runs a number of additional programs in Russia, including support for corporate
governance in the banking sector, for improvement of forestry management practices
in the Northwest, and for development of local suppliers to the mining sector in the
remote region of Magadan.

(d) Enhancing Russia’s global role
9.
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and
assist the country in fulfilling its global commitments. The Bank will continue cooperation
with the Russian government in support of its emergence as an international donor and active
member of multilateral organizations. In addition, the Bank will assist in establishment of

12
mechanisms and implementation of specific actions arising from Russia’s global
engagements, such as the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions, and pandemic
diseases initiatives. During the CPS period, the Bank will also seek to share with Russian
experts its analysis (and advocacy) that is currently directed towards the traditional DAC
donors. Specific areas for Bank’s engagement in Russia are:
•

Assistance in the formulation of an ODA strategy for Russia as emerging donor: The
Bank will continue to assist Russia as an emerging donor, and will cooperate on the
design of Russia’s development aid strategy and the establishment of a national ODA
system. Specific Bank support includes training/capacity events, information sharing,
and advisory services. This work will be supported by Russia as a Donor Initiative
DFID TF. The Bank will be implementing an “externally funded staff development
program” for building Russian Government capacity for aid policy development and
aid management. The Government counterparts will be involved in policy dialogue
on global food crisis and climate change. Beginning with a high-level Russia-WBOECD Emerging Donor Meeting in April 2006, the Bank is assisting Russia in
organizing development aid seminars and international events. The Bank will
participate in preparation and delivery of Spring 2010 international conference on
Emerging donors jointly with Russia and OECD.

•

Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental
assistance: The Bank will remain engaged with Russia on international policy
initiatives developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’s priority
themes for international assistance—quality of education, improved access to energy
by the vulnerable groups, and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The Bank
will help in preparation of contributions in multilateral TFs such as Global
Emergency Food Facility, the Education-For-All/Fast Track Initiatives, and ensure
effective implementation of Russia supported programs like Malaria control in
Africa, Global Village Energy Partnership, Quality of Basic Education (READ). The
Bank will expand preparation of joint Russia-Bank aid initiatives in support of
economic and human development in Central Asia, including blood banks and labor
migrants support. Following increased Russia’s contributions to IDA15 the Bank will
further work on strengthening ownership of IDA among Russian policy makers.

•

Fulfilling international obligations related to global goods: The Bank will assist
Russia in developing procedures and mechanisms for implementing specific activities
in the framework of the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. TA is
currently being provided on the introduction of low-carbon technologies and climate
change mitigation. If the government moves ahead with the introduction of financial
instruments for low-carbon technologies in Russia, the Bank would be ready to
support the preparation and implementation of a number of carbon-finance projects.
There are three GEF projects in the Bank’s pipeline awaiting the establishment of a
legal and institutional framework for their introduction at the regional level with
federal oversight. Additional projects on biodiversity and climate change could also

13
be prepared. The Bank will continue participation in the Ministerial Conference on
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia.
•

Linking Russian companies to global markets: IFC and MIGA activities are also
relevant to the expansion of Russia’s global role. In keeping with its global strategic
objective to encourage investment across emerging markets (South-South
investment), IFC will continue to actively support strong, reputable Russian clients in
investments elsewhere in emerging markets. Consistent with its strategic objective to
support South-South investments through the provision of guarantees, MIGA will
continue to proactively engage Russian companies planning to invest in emerging
markets.

Focus on Russian regions
10.
The Bank is working with the federal government in identifying a small sub-set of
6–10 regions that may become the target of concentrated work programs with the Bank.
Regions are being chosen from wealthier, middle income, and poorer areas. Important
criteria for the selection of regions for Bank engagement are (i) the willingness and
commitment of the regional administration to work with the Bank; (ii) a past history of
successful cooperation; (iii) the reform-orientation and competence of the regional
administration; (iv) strategic importance of the region for Russian development and the
existence of other similar regions for possible scaling up of successful cooperation; and (v)
the region’s creditworthiness and potential interest in Bank operations (for wealthier or
middle income regions). Following initial engagement of selected regions, the strategic
directions and modalities of cooperation with the Bank will be included in a joint
Memoranda of Understanding, to be signed with the leaders of the focus regions. As noted,
Bank involvement at the regional level would involve a combination of targeted AAA on
diagnostics of the local economy and investment climate, and development of regional
strategies, coupled with selected lending operations to address key challenges.
11.
The World Bank Group will concentrate some work in poorer Russian regions,
which are often in most need of development assistance. The list of priority regions will
include some such poorer regions. IBRD engagement in poorer regions that lack
creditworthiness will depend significantly on opportunities for participation in federal
programs or the coordination of donor funds. IFC will make special efforts to support private
sector activities in poorer areas. For some poorer Russian regions which have achieved
creditworthiness, potential opportunities exist for fee-for-service activities or sub-national
lending without sovereign guarantees. Discussions on the development of new instruments
will give particular attention to facilitating Bank work in poorer areas.

ANNEX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(as of May 2009)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are weaknesses
in government finance statistics, and external debt statistics and in terms of data accuracy.
National Accounts: Source data for the system of national accounts are obtained from surveys of businesses
and households, and are supplemented by administrative data. Inadequate reporting by firms has constrained
improvement of the national accounts. The lack of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle to staff efforts
to analyze balance sheet vulnerabilities. At the request of the authorities, a TA mission visited Moscow in
November 2008 to review the framework for the compilation of national accounts statistics. It noted the Federal
State Statistics Service (Rosstat) in general follows 1993 SNA, but found the imputed rental services of owneroccupied dwellings clearly undervalued. It also noted the need for methodological improvements in the
calculations of volume measures of the production-based GDP estimates, including estimates of the output of
financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM).
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but time series analyses involving detailed CPI
components are difficult to perform because of the lack of accurate time series data on CPI weights. Monthly
CPI and PPI, both Laspeyres indices (2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian Federation. In addition to the
general CPI index, Rosstat also publishes indices for the foodstuffs, non-food products, and services. However,
the weights of the CPI components have been made available since 2006 while PPI components are not
disclosed, rendering time series analysis difficult. Consumer spending data, used to calculate the CPI, are posted
on Rosstat’s website annually. In 2009, the basic structure of household’s consumer expenditures, underlying
the CPI calculations, has been made available on the website. Further efforts to improve the treatment of
seasonal items in the core inflation index and a new household budget survey—which has been under
consideration for some time—could significantly strengthen data quality.
Government finance statistics: The timeliness and quality of the data could be improved. Data on domestic
and external federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made public only in summary form on a quarterly basis.
In addition, there is no unified debt monitoring and reporting system. The published functional classification of
expenditure differs slightly from international standards, while data on the economic classification of
expenditures are available with a considerable lag. The lack of timely data on economic classification makes it
difficult to assess the size of transfers to the general public, and thus to estimate the likely channels though
which government expenditure affects demand components of the national accounts. In the context of a work
program for statistical improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing improvements in the coverage
and quality of government finance statistics; there remains, however, scope for improvement of expenditure
data.
Monetary statistics: At the request of the authorities, a TA mission visited Moscow in April 2007 to assist in
expanding the coverage of monetary and financial statistics to include other (nondepository) financial
corporations and to facilitate the completion of Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The mission recommended
that the authorities reconsider the possibility of compiling data in full accordance with the SRFs framework.
Since July 2008, the Bank of Russia submits to the IMF summarized data on the Central Bank Survey, the Other
Depository Corporations Survey, the Depository Corporations Survey, Other Financial Corporation Survey and
Financial Corporations Survey. In the context of the current global turmoil, analysis of balance sheet effects has
been hindered by a lack of consistent data on the currency and maturity breakdown of banking-sector assets and
liabilities.

15
Balance of payments: While balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance as significant
improvements have been made to enhance data quality, there remains scope to improve the coverage of certain
components of the current, capital, and financial accounts. Improving the detail of supplemental data on the
financial account would facilitate the analysis of relatively complex flows. For example, supplemental data on
gross flows of long-term external debt (i.e., drawings and repayments) have been published for non-financial
enterprises, but similar data for banks are not available, which have hampered staff efforts to analyze
vulnerabilities resulting from external debt. Some data quality issues continue to affect the reliability of data.
While the balance of payments is compiled according to an IMF-developed unified framework fully adequate
for capturing economic transactions between residents and non-residents, the reliance on partial data from a
variety of sources necessitates the use of estimates and adjustments to improve data coverage. In particular, the
CBR makes adjustments to merchandise import data published by the State Customs Service to account for
“shuttle trade,” smuggling, and undervaluation. At the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile
their data with those of partner countries. Some improvements have been made in the coverage and quality of
surveys on direct investment, and the CBR has informed the Fund of its intention to participate in the
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on a
weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional detail on reserves and reserve liabilities
through the central bank balance sheet, but this information is not as comprehensive as the Reserve Template,
which is disseminated with a lag of twenty days.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the Special Data Dissemination Standard

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with the Russian Federation
On July 27, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Russian economy has been hit hard by dual
shocks—a collapse in oil prices and a sudden reversal of capital flows. Fixed investment
plummeted, significantly weakening the nexus of high growth in investment, productivity, and
real wages that had powered consumption and the economic boom prior to the crisis. Against
this background, real GDP contracted sharply in the first quarter, while labor market conditions
eased considerably, dampening growth in real wages. As the output gap widens, inflation
pressures are easing. Following an initial sharp depreciation, a recent modest increase in oil
prices and renewed capital inflows have provided some support to the ruble, which remains
broadly in equilibrium.
The banking system is under increasing strain, and private sector credit is contracting. As the
macroeconomic situation has deteriorated, the level of overdue loans has more than doubled
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
since January, despite regulatory forbearance. Moreover, in an environment of high uncertainty,
banks have exhibited a strong preference for liquidity. Since monetary policy was abruptly
tightened in January, the stock of credit has been falling, for the first time since end-2004.
The authorities’ response to the crisis has been swift and substantial, driven by concerns that
weaknesses in the banking and corporate sectors could lead to a full-fledged crisis. In
particular, the authorities’ pre-crisis focus on exchange-rate stability had encouraged substantial
foreign-currency borrowing, encouraging unsustainably high rates of credit growth. Combined
with supervisory shortcomings, this had left Russian banks and corporates particularly
vulnerable to a reversal of inflows. As a result, policy interventions at first focused on
maintaining external and financial sector stability by providing significant liquidity at low interest
rates while keeping the exchange rate stable to offset the abrupt loss of foreign financing.
However, as reserve losses mounted and capital outflows surged, the ruble was devalued and
monetary policy tightened. More recently, as exchange rate stabilized and oil prices started to
tick up, monetary policy has been gradually eased.
In April 2009, as the economy continued to contract, the government passed a large
supplementary budget to support flagging domestic demand. The budget includes large
discretionary increases in defense and security spending; along with a package of anti-crisis
measures aimed at stimulating economic activity by reducing taxes, extending support to
strategic sectors, and enhancing social assistance. As a result, the non-oil deficit of the general
government is expected to widen by 5½ percent of GDP in 2009—reaching 13¾ percent of
GDP. The deficit will be monetized by drawing down the Oil Reserve Fund, except for domestic
borrowing of up to 1 percent of GDP.
Despite the substantial fiscal stimulus, recovery will be slow in coming with important downside
risks weighing on economic outlook. Going forward, the external environment is likely to remain
challenging, as the subdued outlook for global growth implies only a gradual recovery in
commodity prices. Moreover, global deleveraging by financial institutions suggests that capital
inflows to emerging economies, including Russia, are unlikely to return to their pre-crisis levels
any time soon.
Against this backdrop, real GDP is expected to contract by 6½ percent in 2009, after expanding
at an annual rate of 7—8 percent before the crisis. With the banking system expected to remain
under strain, credit growth would turn negative and impede a robust rebound. As a result, the
economy is projected to recover only slowly over the course of 2010, with inflation gradually
falling. The current account surplus would decline in 2009 before improving modestly in 2010,
reflecting a gradual recovery of oil prices. Taking into account the planned large-scale
monetization of the fiscal deficit, capital outflows are expected to remain relatively high at
$68 billion.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Russia has been hit hard by dual shocks—a collapse in oil prices and a sudden reversal of
capital flows. Directors commended the authorities for a swift and substantial policy response to
these developments, but noted that macroeconomic management has proved challenging with
worsening external circumstances, and economic activity is projected to decline sharply in 2009.
Despite some recent tentative signs that the economy may have reached a turning point, it is
expected to recover only gradually in 2010. The near-term outlook hinges critically on a
sustained rebound in the global economy and commodity prices as well as on the pursuit of
appropriate domestic policies going forward.
Directors noted that Russia’s pre-crisis policies have had important implications for the scope
and effectiveness of the authorities’ response to the adverse external environment. On the one
hand, Russia’s prudent policy of taxing and saving its oil wealth during the good years has
created room for a large fiscal stimulus. On the other hand, the pre-crisis policy of controlled
ruble appreciation—combined with the lack of long-term domestic funding—contributed to
excessive foreign currency borrowing as high oil prices helped inflate investor appetite for
Russian assets, and left Russian banks and corporates vulnerable to a reversal of inflows.
Against this background, Directors saw stabilization of the banking sector as the immediate, but
a complex, challenge facing Russian policymakers. Sizable liquidity injections and heavy
interventions slowed the pace of ruble depreciation early in the crisis and likely prevented
corporate bankruptcies and reduced strains on banks. The ensuing reserve losses, however,
forced the authorities to allow a large depreciation of the ruble and to significantly tighten
monetary policy. Directors noted that the tighter monetary conditions have exacerbated
pressures in the banking sector, with banks’ loan portfolios now deteriorating at a notably faster
pace.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take a more proactive and concerted approach to
tackling the problems in the banking sector. They considered that regulatory forbearance has
made it difficult to assess accurately the state of asset quality and credit risks. Directors
therefore stressed that policy actions should include mandatory, bottom-up stress tests of the
larger banks, embedded in a holistic analysis of the banking sectors’ risk profile. They also
recommended a roadmap laying out the likely supervisory responses in the event that a bank’s
capital deteriorates, and a strengthening of the supervisory authority of the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR).
On fiscal policy, most Directors questioned the size and reversibility of the stimulus currently
underway. Directors expressed concern that the large stimulus may become entrenched,
leading to a renewed bout of excessive real appreciation and lower competitiveness, once the

4
economy recovers. They recommended scaling back the fiscal stimulus and reorienting its
composition toward measures that are self-reversing.
With declining inflation, most Directors saw merit in continuing the more recent easing of
monetary policy. However, they advised that the reduction in interest rates should proceed
cautiously, taking into account the potential impact on the ruble and the intention to transition to
an inflation targeting regime. Directors highlighted the risk that the forthcoming liquidity
injections from the monetized fiscal deficit, combined with lower interest rates, might induce a
shift into foreign exchange, putting excessive downward pressure on the exchange rate. In light
of Russia’s still-substantial international reserves, Directors agreed that the CBR should stand
ready to support the ruble in the event that unexpected developments unsettle exchange rate
expectations. While noting the increased exchange rate flexibility since the beginning of the
year, Directors observed that the interventions should be only temporary and that the exchange
rate should ultimately reflect Russia’s underlying fundamentals. A number of Directors stressed
that greater exchange rate flexibility would help limit speculative capital flows and signal a
credible commitment to price stability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to reinvigorate structural reforms in the health and
education sectors. However, they regretted the delays in implementing other reforms critical to
improving Russia’s investment climate and promoting economic diversification. A few Directors
were concerned that the process for WTO accession appears to be losing momentum.
Looking forward, Directors emphasized that—once the current crisis subsides—policy priorities
should be geared toward medium- and long-term objectives. These would include refocusing
fiscal policy on the non-oil deficit and anchoring it on a target that is sustainable from a longterm perspective; reorienting monetary policy toward controlling inflation, supported by a flexible
exchange rate; and reinvigorating structural reforms.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Russian Federation
July 27, 2009
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on July 14, 2009. It does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Recent Developments
2.
The latest data provide more information on the nature of the output
contraction over the first quarter, and also provide tentative signs that the economy
may have recently reached a turning point. As noted in the staff report, the first quarter
of 2009 saw a dramatic collapse of investment and an abrupt decline in consumption, offset
in part by a parallel drop in imports. A large part of the first-quarter downturn, however,
reflected a sharp drawdown of inventories—accounting for 8½ percentage points of a total
GDP decline of 9¾ percent (y/y). For the second quarter, high-frequency data suggest
continued weakness in activity, despite increased government spending. CPI inflation is also
falling, and is currently 11.9 percent (y/y) in June. Over the near term, it is expected that
firms will start rebuilding inventories, and there are some reports that this process may
already have started. The latest data for June suggest that industrial production and
investment have finally stabilized. The rate of contraction of consumption also appears to be
moderating in June. This confirms staff’s assessment that the economy will experience only a
gradual recovery after the very deep drop in output in the first quarter.
3.
Recent exchange-rate volatility has underlined the need for a cautious approach
to interest-rate policy. In the context of a continuing buildup of bank deposits with the
central bank, the CBR cut policy interest rates by 50 bps on July 13—bringing the cumulative
drop since mid-April to 200 bps. However, the cut also coincided with a fall in world oil
prices, leading to a sudden ruble depreciation (of about 3½ percent) and a loss of reserves of
around $3–4 billion. This occurred despite the CBR’s commendable efforts to improve its
communication strategy on monetary policy by issuing its first ever statement explaining its
decision to reduce interest rates. Oil prices have since improved, and the exchange rate has
strengthened, but the banking system continues to exhibit a strong preference for liquidity
over new lending, and the short-term carry trade remains an important source of foreign
inflows. Thus, concerns about the currency’s fragility persist.
Bank Recapitalization
4.
The authorities are finalizing their plan to recapitalize the banking system. A
law outlining the key points of the recapitalization plan has been signed by the President, but
detailed parameters are still being discussed between the relevant government institutions.

2
The broad plan is to issue government securities (OFZ) equivalent to Rub 150 billion and
Rub 310 billion, in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The OFZs would then be exchanged with
banks in return for preferred shares, and would count as Tier 1 capital. The goal of the plan is
to restore credit growth as soon as possible, and the focus is therefore on banks that are sound
(the state-owned banks, including VTB and Sberbank, are being recapitalized under separate
arrangements). Banks with severe capital shortfalls, on the other hand, will be dealt with
separately via the Deposit Insurance Agency’s (DIA) bank-resolution framework. The DIA
currently has 18 banks under rehabilitation, and still has undisbursed funds available from an
initial Rub 200 billion budget allocation earlier in the year. The authorities therefore do not
expect that the DIA will require further funding for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy
5.
Recent data suggest that the fiscal stimulus came on stream toward the end of
the second quarter. Indeed, the non-oil deficit in the second quarter widened to 3¼ percent
of GDP compared with about 1 percent of GDP during the same period last year. Looking
forward, the authorities are in the process of formulating fiscal policies for 2010 and the
medium term. Additional preliminary information since the mission suggests that they are
likely to base the medium-term budget on lower oil price and growth assumptions—and thus
lower revenues projections—than those used by staff, implying still-high overall and non-oil
deficits. However, this process remains at an early stage, and the macroeconomic
assumptions and revenue and expenditure projections are still being refined.
