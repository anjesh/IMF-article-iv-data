STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIFTH POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Iceland has reached a relatively strong macroeconomic position with good growth
prospects. But crisis legacies are still being unwound, including high debt and a large
balance of payments (BOP) overhang contained by capital controls. Amidst public
pressure for a return to normalcy, policies remain geared towards addressing
vulnerabilities, rebuilding buffers, and further strengthening key institutions.
The monetary policy stance has struck an appropriate balance, but is at a difficult
juncture. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) will need to carefully balance deflationary
pressures evident in goods prices against a closing output gap and potentially large
wage increases in the upcoming bargaining round. The CBI should continue FX
accumulation as conditions permit to smooth eventual BOP outflows. The CBI legislative
framework review needs to support independence, accountability, and policy credibility.
With Iceland on-track to achieve core public finance objectives, fiscal policy is well
positioned for a transition from consolidation to supporting higher potential
growth. The budget is in surplus and public debt is on a downward sustainable path.
The government is appropriately aiming to institutionalize its objectives with a
proposed budget framework law. With crisis-legacy issues gradually subsiding, the
medium-term fiscal policy mix should aim for higher growth, while considering
distributional and external sector impacts.
Banking sector buffers have been rebuilt but gaps remain in bank supervision and
financial safety nets. Faster progress is needed to strengthen deposit insurance, bank
resolution, and emergency liquidity assistance frameworks. A permanent solution is
needed for the loss-making government-owned Housing Financing Fund (HFF).
Progress in these areas will provide supportive conditions for successful capital
account liberalization and external financial reintegration. The authorities expect
significant progress in the coming months in finalizing and implementing an updated
liberalization strategy. The updated strategy should aim to preserve stability and be
backed by supportive macroeconomic and financial sector policies.

BACKGROUND
A. Context
1.
Overall macroeconomic conditions in Iceland are at their best since 2008, but
remaining crisis legacies weigh on prospects. Iceland has used the breathing room under six
years of capital controls to make significant inroads in reducing macroeconomic and financial sector
vulnerabilities. Fiscal and external balances are now in surplus and economic activity will surpass its
pre-crisis peak in 2015. But a number of core macroeconomic indicators remain weak relative to
Iceland’s own past, to peer countries, and to common vulnerability metrics (Box 1).
2.
Amidst improving conditions, there is growing public pressure for a return to
normalcy. The public is increasingly vocal about the costs of capital controls, citing burdensome
regulations, transparency concerns, elevated risk premia, and inability to tap competitive benefits
from outward FDI. Amid low unemployment, wage pressures are building. But communication
among social partners has been difficult heading into the H1 2015 collective wage bargaining round
over recent cuts to some social benefits and a growing sense of inequity following significant wage
hikes to settle several public (health, education) and private (aviation) sector strikes.
3.
In response, the authorities are pursuing a broad policy agenda. The fiscal policy focus is
shifting from consolidation to medium-term (budget-neutral) adjustments in the policy mix to
facilitate potential growth and address distributional issues. Financial sector policies are focused on
maintaining buffers ahead of capital account liberalization while addressing gaps in financial
supervision and the safety net. Institutional and structural reforms are underway, including
modifications to core fiscal and central bank legislation and efforts to enhance productivity. But
some reforms remain bogged down, such as the government’s expensive housing financing policy.
Against this backdrop, the government is overhauling its capital account liberalization strategy, and
expects significant progress in the coming months.

B. Recent Developments
4.
Growth slowed in 2014 as a spike in imports weighed against robust domestic
demand (Figure 1). Real GDP growth slowed in the first three quarters, due to temporary net trade
factors, but is estimated at 1.8 percent for the full year (down from 3½ percent in 2013). Domestic
demand growth was supported by strong private consumption and investment, while the boom in
tourism propelled services exports and helped revive construction. Weighing against this was a
largely temporary spike in imports (airplanes and ships, and services), which subtracted
1.5 percentage points from headline growth. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent and
real wages accelerated to 5.8 percent by the end of last year.
5.
Inflation has fallen rapidly, pulled down by imported deflation and a stronger
exchange rate (Figure 2). CPI inflation dropped from 4.2 percent in 2013 to 0.8 percent y-o-y in
January 2015, remaining below the CBI’s 2.5 percent target for a year. Longer term inflation

expectations have adjusted more slowly. Key driving factors have been disinflation in key trading
partners, particularly the euro area, a slump in oil prices, and an appreciating currency in the context
of high exchange rate pass-through. Domestic goods inflation has also fallen, despite higher wages
and a closing output gap. Housing prices and services have been holding up inflation. Despite rapid
growth in house prices, staff analysis indicates no clear signs of asset bubbles (see Selected Issues
Paper on asset bubbles).

Favorable BOP conditions have supported reserve accumulation (Figure 5). The 2014 current
account surplus reached an estimated 4.7 percent of GDP, underpinned by evidence of rebalancing
(including growing tourism) and improving terms of trade, but dampened somewhat by one-off imports.1
During 2014, the CBI made net purchases of about $0.9 billion (about 5½ percent of GDP) in the context of
regular preannounced and ad hoc purchases of FX, pushing gross reserves to $4.2 billion (25 percent of
GDP). Despite these purchases, the real exchange rate appreciated by 6.7 percent. The CBI prepaid
$0.4 billion of IMF obligations due through early October 2015, as part of its debt management strategy,
leaving IMF credit at just over 200 percent of quota. External debt remains on a downward sustainable
trajectory (Annex III, External DSA). In January, Fitch changed its outlook on Iceland’s sovereign credit
rating to positive, citing progress in capital account liberalization and public finances.

8.
The general government recorded its
first budget surplus in seven years, helped by one-off revenues (Figure 4). The preliminary 2014 fiscal
outturn shows a 1.8 percent of GDP surplus, versus a 1.7 percent of GDP deficit in 2013. The fiscal stance,
measured by the change in the structural primary balance, tightened only 0.2 percent of potential GDP,
reflecting the importance of one-off dividend revenues. Household debt relief became operational, and
more frontloaded to 2014, though the overall fiscal costs are broadly in line with earlier projections.
General government gross debt remains high at 82 percent of GDP, but on a downward, sustainable
trajectory (Annex III, Public DSA).
9.
The financial sector paints a mixed picture (Figures 6–8). Iceland’s three largest commercial
banks are well capitalized (Tier 1 ratio of 25 percent) and have strong liquidity buffers, reflecting a
tightening of macro-prudential rules, including stricter liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs). Nonperforming
loans (NPLs) as a percent of total loans are down to 10 percent, using a more prudent cross-default
definition. But bank lending has been weak outside a few sectors and profitability driven largely by
irregular items. A financial conditions index (FCI) for Iceland reflects this mixed recovery (see Selected
Issues Paper on FCI). Banks’ CPI indexation imbalances are rising and legal challenges to CPI loan
indexation are still unresolved. Following a Basel Core Principles assessment in March 2014, the financial
supervisor (FME) is strengthening supervision. Cross-agency cooperation on financial stability has
improved and important regulations are in the pipeline. However, reform of the troubled government
mortgage institution HFF remains stalled.

C. Outlook and Risks
10.
The outlook for growth is positive. The economy will grow at around 3 percent during
2015–17 under baseline assumptions of large energy-intensive investment projects, robust growth in
private consumption boosted by household debt relief, and further expansion of the tourism sector.
Terms of trade, consumption, and growth in 2015 will benefit from a sharp decline in oil prices.
Investment will be funded by FDI, retained earnings, and, increasingly over time, borrowing. Inflation
is expected to stay below 1 percent this year and rise gradually to target by the end of 2016, as the
effects from imported deflation and currency appreciation dissipate and pressures from wages and a
closing output gap mount.


The authorities have broadly similar views on the medium-term growth outlook, though project
higher growth of over 4 percent this year, showing higher domestic demand. There is agreement
that medium-term growth will be mainly driven by robust domestic demand and tourism.



The CBI expects inflation to be below 1 percent this year and to move closer to the target in 2016
as well, citing external developments (disinflation in Europe, lower oil prices, and the exchange
rate), but highlighted wage discussions as a key risk to stability. The authorities have adjusted
down their estimate of potential output and now believe that slack in the economy has largely
disappeared. They emphasized, however, difficulties in assessing the gap given fluid crossborder labor movements and other factors. They also noted uncertainty about how firmly longterm inflation expectations are anchored.

11.
The external sector outlook is generally positive. The current account surplus is projected
to rise in 2015 boosted by higher terms of trade, including lower oil prices, and then—consistent
with the experience of other post-crisis cases—fall gradually over the medium-term (see Selected
Issues Paper on Savings, Investment and Rebalancing). For Iceland, further medium-term increases
in terms of trade and higher exports—including tourism—will be outpaced by rising import demand
tied to export-oriented investment. The net income deficit is expected to deteriorate somewhat
given a negative net international investment position (NIIP) and rising global interest rates. Staff
baseline BOP projections provide space for release of some of the BOP overhang (16 percent of GDP
over 2015–20) while maintaining minimum adequate reserves, set at the upper band (150 percent)
of the reserve adequacy metric. However, the specific elements and pace of liberalization and
accompanying overhang release will need to be reset in the context of an updated liberalization
strategy now under development, and taking factors discussed below into consideration.


The authorities’ current account projections are more pessimistic, with larger net income deficits
(due to methodological differences in accounting for the old bank estates) but slightly higher
trade surpluses. They view 2014 reserve levels as adequate.

12.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Annex I). Liberalization of the capital account under a
revised strategy could pick up pace, boosting confidence and private investment and raising longterm growth—but missteps could lead to a disorderly unwinding or even prolonged controls. Wage
demands in the upcoming round of collective bargaining could lead to further strikes, and resulting
wage hikes could increase inflation and weaken competitiveness. Government contingent liabilities,
notably relating to HFF, could be partially realized, leading to higher debt and interest costs. Other
domestic risks include legal challenges of financial sector taxation and CPI indexation. On the
external side, risks of lower growth in trading partners, especially Europe, could dampen exports
and—together with falling commodity prices—foreign direct investment. A sharp increase in global
risk premia could worsen Iceland’s access to external financing and raise the costs of large external
repayments in 2016.


The authorities broadly agreed. However, while recognizing downside risks associated with
capital account liberalization, they also noted risks from being too cautious and missing a
window of relative stability in the economy. They expressed deep concerns about the upcoming
collective wage bargaining round and implications for stability. The authorities agreed that legal
risks to financial sector taxation are non-negligible, though noted that recent court rulings have
reduced legal risks to CPI indexation. They noted external risk factors—slowing global demand
and falling commodity prices—to investment, in particular the construction of silicon plants. The
authorities also cited upside risks from possible new investment projects such as the proposed
power interconnector with Scotland.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: RETURNING TO NORMALCY
13.
Discussions centered on sound macroeconomic and financial sector policies to reduce
vulnerabilities and strengthen growth and external prospects and linkages. Monetary policy
8

ICELAND

should remain focused on price stability and building FX reserve buffers. Fiscal policy should pursue
balanced budget and debt reduction objectives (and seek their codification in a new budget
framework law) while revisiting the mix of policies to support higher potential growth, external
prospects, and distributional objectives. Financial sector policies should encourage maintaining bank
buffers while addressing gaps in financial supervision and the safety net. Institutional and structural
reforms, including to core fiscal and central bank legislation and to enhance productivity are also
important. Such policies will help create supportive conditions for successful capital account
liberalization.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: A Difficult Juncture
Background
14.
Monetary policy is facing opposing challenges from external and domestic
developments. On one hand, the CBI has signaled it is considering further policy rate cuts given
inflation well below the 2.5 percent target, falling inflation expectations, and the possibility of
prolonged imported deflation. On the other hand, faced with already rapid wage growth and
disappearing economic slack, the CBI has also

Staff’s exchange rate assessment is giving mixed results, amid uncertainty about the
equilibrium exchange rate (Text box). However, these exercises do not fully capture the impact of
the BOP overhang on uncertainty (and savings and investment), vulnerabilities from a large negative
NIIP, and factors such as the tourism boom. Furthermore, the sizeable real depreciation following
the 2008 crisis appears to have shifted the equilibrium real exchange rate to a new (lower) normal,
as fundamentals also shifted to post-crisis norms (Figure 5). Taking into account these findings and
uncertainties, staff views the exchange rate as slightly overvalued.

Iceland: Exchange Rate Assessment
Regression-based models for exchange rate assessment give mixed results as to whether the
current real exchange rate is consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals. While the
macroeconomic balance (MB) methodology suggests an undervaluation of 23 percent, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) methodology suggests a slight overvaluation of about 5 percent.
However, the former methodology seems to provide a relatively poor fit for Iceland given large
unexplained residual.

While Iceland’s external sector has shown signs of improvement post-2008 crisis, staff is of the
view that the exchange rate is slightly overvalued. The large post-crisis depreciation and reduced
cost of production have increased Iceland’s export competitiveness. However, with the króna
appreciating (albeit still remaining below pre-crisis levels), productivity levels and export shares on a
declining trend, and the need to improve the NIIP, staff is of the view that the exchange rate is slightly
overvalued (see Selected Issues Paper on External Sector Assessment).

Policy Discussions
17.
Staff supported the CBI’s monetary policy stance and efforts to continue FX purchases
to build reserve buffers, as conditions allow, ahead of capital account liberalization.


Staff agreed the monetary policy stance is in line with the central bank’s inflation objective. The
recent interest rate reductions were appropriate given a real tightening amidst falling inflation
and inflation expectations, and somewhat weaker growth. Staff noted that WEO forecasts for
commodity prices have been revised down and that inflation is projected to stay very low for
some time in the euro area, which could push inflation in Iceland even lower this year. Staff
supported the CBI view that future rate actions should carefully weigh deflationary pressures
from the external environment along with still-uncertain wage prospects and a closing output
gap.



Staff supported the CBI’s FX purchase program to build up reserve buffers, as conditions permit,
ahead of capital account liberalization. Staff agreed that the CBI’s FX intervention strategy had
also contributed to a significant reduction in exchange rate volatility.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND



The authorities’ exchange rate assessment was consistent with staff’s REER approach, pointing
towards a slight overvaluation. They view the equilibrium exchange rate as likely shifting to a
post-liberalization new normal.



The mission welcomed the authorities’ efforts to review CBI legislation. Staff stressed the
importance of stability in the CBI, including protecting the existing terms of current top
management. Such stability would underscore commitment to independence, while any
shortcomings identified in the review regarding accountability should be addressed. Done
properly, this would reinforce policy credibility, which in turn would promote economic stability
and growth and ease the path for capital account liberalization. The authorities broadly agreed, but
affirmed they are considering changes to the senior management structure of the CBI.

B. Fiscal Policy: Supporting Higher Potential Growth
Background
18.
For Iceland, 2014–15 marks an important watershed for fiscal policy (Box 2). For the first
time since the crisis, Iceland has recorded a general government budget surplus. The debt ratio,
while high, is on a downward sustainable trajectory. The draft budget framework bill (Organic
Budget Law, “OBL”) now before Parliament would establish strong institutional underpinnings for
Iceland’s fiscal objectives, including a balanced budget and debt ceiling, and greater accountability
and transparency. The authorities have initiated preparations for implementation of the new
framework.
19.
The 2015 budget is consistent with fiscal objectives, but with some weaknesses. The
budget targets a general government surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP and has a broadly neutral fiscal
stance (removing the effect of one-off revenues in 2014). The budget also initiates important reform
of the VAT system. However, the budget maintains public investment below both pre-crisis historical
and cross country average levels and relies on restraint in wages and other current spending that
could come under pressure in the upcoming collective wage bargaining round. To support debt
reduction, the authorities intend to sell a 30 percent stake in Landsbankinn.
20.
The authorities are weighing compositional changes in the budget over the mediumterm to support higher potential growth and address inequality. They are considering budget
neutral tax simplification (PIT, CIT, labor taxes) and higher investment, combined with as-yet
unidentified offsetting measures, while also addressing public concerns about the impact on income
distribution and public services. The Finance Ministry is organizing a workshop with FAD in Iceland
on this topic this spring. There is strong commitment to preserving the Nordic welfare model while
exploring a gradual reduction in the size of government, and to seek a better understanding of the
drivers of recent increases in social benefits.

Policy Discussions
21.
Staff expressed broad support for the government’s medium-term fiscal objectives,
while urging greater specificity.



Staff recommended identifying additional fiscal contingency measures to address risks in
implementation of the 2015 budget, including legal challenges to financial sector taxation, HFF
fiscal contingencies, and reliance on wage compression. The authorities noted that the 2015
budget includes a contingency cushion of around ISK6 billion, but agreed that these funds may
prove insufficient if downside risks are realized. Depending on circumstances, measures could
include debt issuance or, as discussed during Fourth PPM consultations, modifying the extent of
household debt relief.



The mission urged approval of the OBL and welcomed steps underway to facilitate the
challenging task of implementing it. Implementation of this new framework will reinforce
stability and confidence among international investors as Iceland undertakes important changes
in its capital account liberalization strategy. The authorities indicated that the OBL has broad
support and that preparations underway will help mitigate implementation risks.



Staff encouraged the authorities to specify policies to underpin their intention to slow the
growth in wages and goods and services expenditures over the medium-term, and to use future
one-off revenues for debt reduction until debt objectives are met. The authorities agreed, noting
that this will be part of the new budget framework process. There was agreement that continued
fiscal discipline over the medium-term, coupled with strong growth, will help rebuild buffers,
boost confidence, and lower interest rates.



Staff supported medium-term plans to adjust budget composition in support of higher potential
growth and external balances, while carefully assessing distributional consequences (and
guarding against unintended fiscal slippages through maintaining adequate contingency funds).
The mission presented analytical work assessing compositional changes in fiscal policy (see
Selected Issues Paper on fiscal policy and Box 2), highlighting benefits from more investment
and improving the efficiency of the tax system, including a shift from direct to indirect taxation,
and encouraging saving. Staff noted that such polices could also lend support to Iceland’s
external position. The authorities were in broad agreement. Regarding investment, they
identified roads and the public health system as two priority areas. The authorities recently
approved (drawing on a cost-benefit study produced by consultants) construction of a new
national hospital (4 percent of GDP over 5 years), and noted the pick-up in expenditure on this
project in 2016 as a pressing fiscal challenge. They noted that the VAT reforms were an
important though difficult step forward, and any further changes to the VAT regime in this
election cycle would be limited to efficiency gains.

C. Financial Sector: Reinforcing Resilience
Background
22.
Good progress has been made in improving the financial stability framework. The CBI has
extended macro prudential measures to include foreign currency liquidity regulations and adopted an
FX Net Stable Funding Ratio based on Basel III. Improvements in the FME’s risk assessment system are
underway and funding of supervisory activities is for now secured. Legislative amendments have been

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

enacted to enhance supervision of related parties and Basel III capital buffers will be introduced in
2015. The Old Landsbanki (LBI) bond agreement (Annex III, ¶2) has improved Landsbankinn’s funding
profile, thereby enhancing conditions for the removal of capital controls. The authorities are also
assessing the financial sector implications of capital account liberalization options under consideration.
Nonetheless, there are significant potential liquidity implications posed by the capital account
liberalization process. For example, old bank estates’ deposits in commercial banks account for
14 percent of total deposits, with additional deposits held by trapped nonresidents.

Policy Discussions
23.
Staff called for further steps to reinforce the resilience of the financial sector in advance
of capital account liberalization:


Staff and the authorities agreed that the banks’ high capital and liquidity buffers should be
consistent with managing risks surrounding the unwinding of capital controls and legal risks—
including challenges to CPI indexation. Staff emphasized that liquidity needs and available
buffers should be carefully reassessed in parallel with efforts to update the liberalization
strategy. There was agreement that dividend distribution should be prudent and more longterm funding should be sought.



Staff recommended further steps to enhance the financial stability framework. The mission
recommended establishing a framework to deal with time-varying systemic risks (i.e.
differentiated ceilings on loan-to-value and/or debt-service-to-income ratios). To inform the
design and the calibration of such instruments, enriched data collection (i.e. per types of loans,
properties, borrowers, etc.) is warranted. Staff also recommended further improvements in
macro-financial and supervisory stress tests. The authorities were receptive to these
recommendations and underlined that work is pending in both areas.



Staff supported the authorities’ plans to bring financial safety nets, including the deposit
insurance and bank resolution frameworks, in line with international standards. The authorities
should ensure that the deposit insurance system is operationally prepared to carry out its
function. Staff called for an explicit limited deposit guarantee, noting that key market players did
not have a clear understanding of deposit insurance limits—specifically whether the statutory
limit of around EUR 21,000 applies or whether the government blanket guarantee stated during
the peak of the crisis still applied. Good public communication and enhanced depositor analyses
should accompany and inform the reforms. Another priority reform is to ensure that the
resolution framework is comprehensive, and that there are clear policies and operational
guidance for inter-agency crisis preparedness and management. Finally, a clear and transparent
emergency liquidity assistance framework needs to be established with criteria for eligibility,
collateral, and conditionality. Staff emphasized the importance of implementing key reforms in
these areas ahead of full liberalization of the capital account. The authorities shared staff views
on the importance of these reforms and underscored that they plan to submit draft legislation
to the Parliament. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to raise the statutory limit for
banking sector deposit insurance to EUR 100,000, which would put Iceland on equal footing with
peers in Europe.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ICELAND



Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to firmly pursue supervisory reforms. The mission
supported FME efforts to further build the operational infrastructure and knowledge and to
achieve a truly risk-based and intrusive approach. Staff emphasized the importance of
implementing key reforms in these areas ahead of full liberalization of the capital account. Fund
technical support is being provided in these areas.



Staff stressed that HFF should be put into an orderly runoff without delay to minimize fiscal
costs and financial stability risks. To minimize fiscal risks, HFF’s mandate during runoff should be
confined to conducting an orderly dismantling. Staff supported government efforts to refine and
better target the social mortgage lending objective and to carefully delineate state involvement
in line with this objective. The authorities broadly agreed on the need to wind down HFF, though
The Ministry of Welfare stressed that more work is necessary (and is currently underway in the
Ministry) on mechanisms for a successor state program targeting lower income and remote area
groups before a final decision on HFF resolution.

D. Structural Reforms
Background
24.
Labor productivity remains low in Iceland’s non-traditional sectors. Iceland’s sectoral
productivity compares favorably vis-à-vis its Nordic peers in the “traditional” marine products and
energy-intensive exporting sectors, thanks to economies of scale afforded by external markets and
through competition, but lags behind in “non-traditional” industries, including tourism. Increasing
labor productivity in non-traditional sectors is important for growth and BOP prospects. A publicprivate “growth forum” has been assessing various structural reforms, drawing from an influential 2012
McKinsey Consulting report. Proposals include: (i) increasing foreign participation (retail and finance);
(ii) simplifying the customs environment and trade barriers (food and consumer goods); (iii) attracting
higher value tourists and addressing seasonality; and (iv) infrastructure investment (tourism).

Policy Discussions


Staff encouraged the authorities to follow through on previously identified structural reforms
aimed at increasing labor productivity and competitiveness. This could help attract investment,
support growth and external balances, and facilitate the capital account liberalization process.



The authorities agreed on the importance of such reforms and noted an active agenda. In early
2015, they will begin inter-ministerial work on a tourism sector strategy that would assess stress
points in quality assurance and product delivery, aiming to improve the overall tourism
experience and addressing any infrastructure needs. They see room for breaking down barriers
to competition and streamlining regulations, particularly in the services sector, to enhance
productivity, but noted some natural limitations given the small size of Iceland’s economy. The
government is also aiming to simplify the non-food customs regime.

E. Capital Account Liberalization: A Renewed Push
Background
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

25.
In parallel with the macroeconomic and financial sector policies discussed above,
efforts towards further capital account liberalization have picked up pace. The governmentappointed task force on updating Iceland’s liberalization strategy presented its assessment and
recommendations to Government in December. The same month, an agreement was reached to
release 20 percent of GDP in LBI bank estate asset payments to priority creditors (Annex III, ¶2) and
Iceland’s international advisors met with all three old bank estate winding up boards (WuBs). The
authorities indicated they will have an updated strategy in place in the coming months that aims to
accelerate the liberalization process. Staff estimates of the BOP overhang have been revised down to
about 70 percent of GDP, though this figure remains subject to significant uncertainty (Annex III, ¶3).
Staff BOP projections suggest room for some release of the BOP overhang over the medium-term.

Policy Discussions
26.
Staff welcomed recent efforts while calling attention to risks and recommending
strategies to increase the likelihood of a long-term positive impact on the economy.


Staff highlighted risks from missteps in the liberalization process that could lead to reserve
losses and rapid depreciation of the króna, with knock-on effects on public and private sector
debt (via currency mismatches and CPI indexation) and financial stability (e.g., depositor
confidence). Realization (or even elevation) of such risks could undermine international market
access and worsen borrowing prospects. Staff presented analysis of the potential impact of a
liberalization-induced depreciation, including balance sheet effects (see Selected Issues Paper
on capital account liberalization).



The mission recommended that the updated liberalization strategy should: (i) remain conditionsbased to help preserve macroeconomic and financial stability; (ii) be based on credible analysis
(e.g., BOP overhang, liquidity implications, balance sheet implications, and BOP projections); (iii)
give preference to nondiscriminatory measures when possible; (iv) give emphasis to a
cooperative approach, combined with incentives to participate, to help mitigate risks; and (v) be
comprehensive, transparent, well communicated (with a communication strategy), measurable,
and enforceable. More broadly, staff encouraged supportive macroeconomic, financial, and
structural policies to address vulnerabilities. Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to carefully
analyze BOP conditions, public and private balance sheet and liquidity impacts of liberalization
measures, and potential for resident outflows. The mission urged due consideration of Iceland’s
international and domestic obligations.



To support the pace of liberalization, staff urged a greater policy focus on enhancing Iceland’s
BOP. Iceland’s current account received a boost following the sizable depreciation at the onset
of the crisis and subsequent rebalancing towards exports, and also the boom in tourism. These
competitiveness gains, and inward portfolio investment, should be nurtured through supporting
policies to facilitate higher export-oriented investment and savings—including infrastructure
improvements and tax policy measures—and efforts to defuse pressures for wage hikes
significantly in excess of productivity gains.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ICELAND



The authorities were in broad agreement, while emphasizing the importance of bringing closure
to treatment of various elements of the BOP overhang. They are putting strong emphasis on
maintaining stability. They expect tangible progress on an updated liberalization strategy in the
coming months, and noted that a cooperative approach, or process, has been gaining traction.
They agreed that nurturing BOP flows is important, but that it should not come at the expense
of lower purchasing power or higher government FX or net debt exposure. The authorities
requested further dialogue with staff during H1 2015 as they finalize and launch their updated
strategy.



The authorities requested extension of the Fund’s approval of three measures that give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(a) (see
Informational Annex). 2 Staff recommends that the Executive Board approve the retention of the
exchange restrictions for a period of twelve months. The exchange restrictions have been
imposed for balance of payments purposes, are non-discriminatory, and temporary. The
authorities remain committed to lifting the restrictions as soon as macroeconomic and financial
conditions permit and based on a conditions-based capital account liberalization strategy which
is currently being revised to accelerate the process.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
27.
Iceland’s balance of payments prospects and reserve buffers are projected to be at
adequate levels though risks remain. Staff welcomed the early repayment by the authorities, for
debt management reasons, of 2015 Fund repurchases falling due through early October. Staff
projections show FX reserves remaining at adequate levels (after dipping to 120 percent of the
reserve adequacy metric at end-2014). Outstanding Fund credit is now at 201 percent of quota, just
above the standard PPM threshold. The authorities noted this would facilitate ongoing dialogue
with staff as updated plans for capital account liberalization are finalized. Risks are mainly from the
external environment and the uncertainty surrounding capital account liberalization.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Iceland is in a relatively strong macroeconomic position with good growth prospects,
but has lingering vulnerabilities and faces downside risks. The authorities should maintain
policies geared towards preserving stability, addressing vulnerabilities, rebuilding buffers,
strengthening key institutions, and facilitating growth. With sound policies, Iceland can expect
sustained growth, price stability, healthy fiscal and external balances, a robust financial sector,
downward sustainable paths for debt, and external financial reintegration.

2

The retention of the three exchange restrictions was first approved by the Executive Board on April 6, 2012
(Decision No. 15133-(12/35)) and subsequently extended in March 2013 (Decision No. 15335-(13/25) and further in
March 2014 until March 6, 2015 (Decision No. 15552-(14/22).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

29.
Monetary policy has been appropriate. The CBI should stand ready to cut rates further if
imported deflationary pressures persist. However, given that the outcome of wage negotiations is
highly uncertain, the current pause is appropriate. Further large wage increases—amidst a closing
output gap—would call for a rate hike. The central bank should continue FX reserve accumulation to
smooth eventual BOP outflows under liberalization and to reduce appreciation pressures.
Maintaining a de facto and de jure independent central bank is important for policy credibility,
especially ahead of capital account liberalization.
30.
With Iceland on-track to achieve core objectives, fiscal policy is well positioned for a
transition from consolidation to supporting higher potential growth. With the budget near
balance, the authorities are appropriately turning their attention to budget composition and
supporting reforms. More needs to be done in tax policy, including the VAT and the complex
personal income tax. On the expenditure side, the authorities need to boost public investment and
to assess the distributional consequences of reforms.
31.
The core financial sector remains stable with adequate buffers, but gaps in supervision
and financial safety nets must be addressed. Uncertainties surrounding the unwinding of crisis
legacies call for capital and liquidity buffers to be maintained and supervision to be reinforced. The
authorities should strengthen the deposit insurance, bank resolution, and emergency liquidity
assistance frameworks. A permanent solution is needed for the loss-making HFF.
32.
The authorities should follow-through on structural reform plans to support
productivity and competitiveness. Planned steps in the tourism and services sectors are logical
starting points. Steps to facilitate investment would help support growth and external balances.
33.
Sound macroeconomic and financial sector policies will help create conditions for
successful capital account liberalization and external financial reintegration. The updated
liberalization strategy now under development should be conditions-based and aim to maintain
stability, and embed other key characteristics discussed. Greater policy focus on enhancing Iceland’s
BOP prospects would help support the pace of liberalization. Staff supports the authorities’ request
for approval of exchange restrictions.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Iceland be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Iceland’s Recovery: A Report Card
Iceland has used breathing room under six years of capital controls to reduce flow and
stock vulnerabilities, strengthen institutions, and prepare for full capital account
liberalization. Growth is strong, double-digit fiscal and current account deficits have shifted into
surplus, financial sector buffers are high, and institutions have been strengthened. But stock
vulnerabilities remain significant relative to Iceland’s past, to peer countries, and to common
vulnerability metrics.

Box 2. Iceland: The Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
Iceland has achieved a number of important fiscal milestones, but there remain important
structural fiscal challenges to be addressed over the medium term. With the fiscal position
stronger than at any time since the crisis, there is an opportunity to reconsider the medium term
fiscal strategy. The broad objectives should be to improve growth prospects, maintain
momentum in dealing with crisis legacy issues, and ensure adequate protection for vulnerable
social groups. Some important issues (discussed in further detail in the Selected Issues Paper on
fiscal policy) include the following:


The draft budget framework law (OBL) now before parliament would strengthen the
institutional underpinnings of fiscal policy. It would improve fiscal reporting,
transparency and accountability, establish a fiscal council, and set requirements for mediumterm fiscal policy statements. The bill would also establish new fiscal rules that mandate a
balanced general government budget over the medium term—with provisions for countercyclical deficit spending and an escape clause for extraordinary events—and a net debt
ceiling of 45 percent of GDP. If approved, implementation will be challenging—both the
rules but also technical implementation—including shifting consolidated financial accounts
to IPSAS standards, preparing annual statements of fiscal policies, and adjusting roles of
ministries.



The Icelandic indirect tax system (VAT) is comparatively inefficient. The 2015 budget
raises the reduced VAT rate from 7 to 11 percent, lowers the main rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 24 percent, and eliminates exemptions for some tourist activities. But the main VAT
rate remains well above the OECD average, the gap between the main and reduced rates
remains large, and widespread exemptions remain. More will be needed to reverse the
decline in recent years of the share of VAT in total revenues and as a percent of GDP.



The burden of taxation has shifted decisively towards more distortionary direct taxes,
weakening growth prospects. This, in part, reflects design flaws in the personal income tax.
By international standards, the entry tax rate is very high while the highest rate is
comparatively low. Furthermore, the higher tax brackets do not generate significant
revenues. In addition, the tax wedge on labor income has increased over time, which has
tended to put a brake on growth.



Benefit expenditures rose sharply during the crisis. This higher expenditure reflected a
strong commitment and consensus that the costs of the crisis should, to the extent possible,
be shared. With the consequences of the crisis now diminishing, there is a need to return
social expenditures to their pre-crisis levels, in terms of GDP.



Public investment bore the brunt of the post-crisis fiscal adjustment. Investment levels
are low both by international and historical standards. There is a growing list of urgent public
investment projects, particularly in the health and transportation sectors.

1/ Contributions to growth.
2/ In percent of potential output.
3/ In percent of labor force.
4/ Actual data include the income receipts and expenditures of DMBs in winding up proceedings, and accrued
interest payments on intra-company debt held by a large multinational, but estimated and projected data do not.
5/ Includes interest payments due from the financial sector and income receipts to the financial sector.
6/ Excludes old banks’ total liabilities, but includes TIF’s deposit liabilities, and accumulated recovered assets from
both external and domestic sources before being paid out to foreign creditors. Once recovered, these assets are
recorded as short-term debt. Does not reflect impact on external debt from outflows related to liberalization
(impact will be included once a revised liberalization strategy is in place).
7/ Excludes old bank-related debt.
8/ Includes the recovered domestic and foreign assets of the old banks.

1/ This table is in BPM6 format. The previous report (4th PPM staff report) used BPM5 format.
2/ Actual data include the income receipts and expenditures of DMBs in winding up proceedings, and accrued interest payments on intracompany debt held by a large multinational, but estimated and projected data do not.
3/ Baseline projections no longer incorporate the 2011 capital account liberalization strategy. Instead, projections assume a gradual release
of overhang while maintaining minimum reserve adequacy.
4/ Reflects debt service payments on Fund repurchases and Nordic loans.
5/ Reserves and short-term debt exclude old bank-related stocks.
6/ Reserves and short-term debt exclude both old bank-related stocks and offshore liquid krona holdings.

Annex II. Authorities’ Responses to 2013 IMF Article IV
Consultation Recommendations
IMF 2013 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal Policy
Adhere to Iceland’s existing fiscal targets
and improve the quality of the adjustment.
Enact the proposed budget framework law.
Any new household debt relief measures
should be targeted on distressed
households falling through the cracks of
existing programs.

Broadly Consistent
The 2014 surplus exceeded the government’s balanced
budget target, but relied on one-offs and nondurable
measures (dividends, recap bond, bank levy). The 2015
budget enacted an important VAT reform, but further
harmonization of rates is needed to reduce revenue
mobilization inefficiencies, and greater specificity in planned
current spending cuts is needed to achieve durable balanced
budgets. The OBL has been submitted to parliament.
Household debt relief aiming at across-the-board reductions
in household mortgages is operational.

Monetary Policy
Little change in the policy interest rate is
needed to gradually bring inflation to
target.

Consistent
With inflation below target and real policy rates tightening
(reflecting falling inflation and inflation expectations), the
central bank lowered the nominal policy rate.

Capital Controls
Handle winding up of old banks in a
manner consistent with external and
financial stability. Strengthen incentives to
participate in capital account liberalization
mechanisms by publishing a well-defined
strategy with clear timeline. Impose speed
limits on resident outflows.

Broadly Consistent
There is broad agreement between staff and the authorities
that liberalization should be conditions-, not time-based,
aiming to maintain stability. The authorities are now updating
their liberalization strategy which they expect to launch in the
coming months.

Financial Sector
Banks should continue to maintain strong
capital and liquidity buffers. Plans to
strengthen the financial safety net should
be advanced and the proposed interagency framework for tackling systemic
risks should be implemented. HFF should
be reformed.

Broadly Consistent
Banks are liquid and well-capitalized. The authorities are
stepping up efforts to improve banking supervision. The
Systemic Risk Committee, which supports the Financial
Stability Council, has been established. The
intergovernmental working group on housing finance
proposed that HFF be put in a runoff mode, but will require a
political decision.

Structural
Consideration should be given to
improving expenditure efficiency in health
and education.

Progress made
The Ministry of Education has published plans to shorten
secondary education by 1 year to 3 years and improve
student completion ratios and a health care reform plan was
recently announced.

Annex III. Iceland: Debt Sustainability Analyses1
1.
External and public debt ratios are on sustainable downward trajectories over the
medium term, but risks remain elevated. In addition to projected trajectories of macroeconomic
variables and core policies, the large króna-denominated BOP overhang and its release will
significantly influence the path of debt.

A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
2.
The following assumptions for the baseline external debt path are changed from the
Fourth Post Program Monitoring staff report (‘previous report’):


Current account. The medium-term path for the current account, excluding interest
payments, is on average about 1.5 percentage points of GDP higher, mainly reflecting
stronger trade balances and lower primary income deficits. The latter change is due to
updates based on a recently completed comprehensive assessment of income generation by
IIP assets and liabilities, which the authorities shared with staff.



Real GDP growth. Real growth projections have been revised downwards for 2014, and
2017-2020, by about 0.6 percentage point per year on average. The average medium term
GDP deflator growth has also been revised downwards about 2 percentage points. The
exchange rate is also projected to be weaker over the forecast horizon in comparison to the
previous report.



Debt-stabilizing current account. As a result, the non-interest current account needed to
stabilize the external-debt-to-GDP ratio is a smaller deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP compared
to a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP in the previous DSA.



Central government external borrowing. Our rollover assumptions are unchanged from
the previous report. However, unlike the previous report, we no longer assume capital
controls will be lifted according to the 2011 published strategy, which will be updated in the
coming months. In that respect, the government is no longer assumed to issue two longterm Eurobonds in 2014–15 to swap with short-term króna assets held by non-residents.
However, this would have not affected total public debt position (only foreign exchange
exposure) as it would have been just a debt swap. In addition, following the prepayment of
IMF obligations through early October 2015 from reserves, we no longer assume that the
Treasury will issue Eurobonds in the exact amount of CBI debt payments coming due.



Old banks estates. Estimates of the three old banks’ asset recoveries were updated through
2014 Q3 (as before, assets of old banks are not recorded as debt until they are recovered

into liquid form), leading to an slight downward adjustment in the external debt stock for
end-2014. As for payments to foreign creditors, Landsbankinn and LBI reached an agreement
in early December to amend the LBI bond and extend its maturity with final payment
extended by 8 years until 2026. The WuB of LBI received exemptions from the government to
make payments to its priority foreign creditors (UK Government and other holders of deposit
claims), that will allow the British government for instance to recover 85 percent of its total
claims from the collapse of Icesave (the other two WuBs have already paid all priority
creditors). Landsbankinn is expected to refinance the payments in foreign credit markets.
Apart from the LBI agreement, we now assume in our baseline scenario that capital controls
are not lifted and no payouts to specific foreign creditors are made, unlike in the previous
report, which assumed that in year 2017 capital controls could be gradually lifted where the
timing of relaxing the controls and the pace of payouts to foreign creditors each year was
dependent on adequate reserve position of the external sector. This new treatment is due to
current uncertainty on what the new capital controls strategy will be. In addition, we no
longer assume newly recovered foreign assets will be distributed to creditors immediately
despite these being BOP neutral. These will rather be reflected as an increase in external debt
stock. Hence, unlike the previous report, external debt related to old banks is rising over time
reflecting the path of asset recovery and the lack of payment to foreign creditors. However,
in our baseline projections we do assume a gradual release of the BOP overhang which
maintains reserves at minimum adequate levels (150 percent of reserve adequacy metric). As
this is not currently reflected as debt reductions, the external debt path can be viewed as
conservative (and will likely be lower). Once a revised liberalization strategy is in place, we will
adjust the BOP and external debt figures (and macro framework) accordingly.
3.
Staff’s estimate of the size of the BOP overhang has been revised down to about
70 percent of GDP, consisting of liquid offshore króna (16 percent), old banks estates
(close to 30 percent, down from 44 percent) and resident overhang (25 percent). Resident
overhang estimates includes portfolio rebalancing by pension funds and corporates, and could
be much larger should household depositors also seek to exit whether for rebalancing reasons or
for loss of confidence, or much lower if domestic investment opportunities are attractive and
confidence is reinforced. The old banks’ overhang is just a fraction of the estimated asset
recovery of about 138 percent of GDP (before recent LBI payments). The difference is due to:


roughly two-thirds of the old bank estate assets are held in overseas FX instruments that
would have a broadly neutral BOP effect if paid out;



about 6 percent (by value of assets) of old bank creditors are residents; and



some old bank resident debtors, such as commercial banks holding old banks’ FX deposits,
are understood to be hedged, having offsetting FX assets overseas that the CBI estimates
would be used to pay down obligations.

4.
External debt is expected to decline substantially over the medium term but much
slower than previously estimated. External debt is estimated at 257 percent at end-2013, and is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

ICELAND

expected to fall to around 207 percent by 2019 and 196 percent of GDP by 2020, about
54 percentage points of GDP higher in 2019 than previous DSA due to the assumption that
capital controls will prevent payouts being made by the old banks to foreign creditors over the
forecast horizon even though assets will continue to be recovered and become liquid adding to
the stock of recovered debt. Another reason that the external debt ratio is higher is because we
no longer assume that FX auctions will be held, starting in year 2015, that were being used as a
channel to release the offshore liquid króna overhang (about 16 percent of GDP). Hence, the
offshore liquid króna overhang is also not on a declining path in our baseline scenario where
capital controls are in place. However, as noted above, our baseline treatment of the BOP
overhang likely overstates the path of external debt. Once a revised capital account liberalization
strategy is in place, we will adjust the BOP and external debt figures (and macro framework)
accordingly.
5.
Stress tests suggest that the downward trajectory is relatively robust, but risks
remain. Apart from the historical and real depreciation scenarios, standard shocks would not
alter the downward trajectory of the external debt ratio (Annex I, Figure 1). The historical scenario
would put the external debt ratio on an upward trend because of the large capital outflows that
occurred during the crisis and sizeable pre-crisis current account deficits. An orderly lifting of
capital controls, however, would prevent such large capital outflows.

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Since the last review in early July 2014, Iceland’s debt sustainability has improved slightly. In July,
the authorities issued a €750 million Eurobond with a 2.5 percent coupon. The proceeds of this
bond were used to pay off higher cost external debt, thus reducing debt servicing requirements over
the medium term. The Ministry of Finance has also reached an agreement with the Central Bank of
Iceland (CBI) to restructure a CBI recapitalization bond, which has also helped reduce repayment
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the stock of outstanding government guarantees fell by two
percentage points of GDP.
Nevertheless, the general government debt ratio (debt-to-GDP) is high albeit on a downward
trajectory over the medium term. Gross financing needs are manageable given the relatively long
maturities and the limited stock of short-term debt. Iceland has also accumulated a large stock of
assets, which means that the net debt ratio is some 24 percentage points lower than gross debt,
helping to ameliorate debt sustainability risks.
The assessment from stress tests is broadly unchanged from the last review. The downward
trajectory is robust against most negative shocks. For all shock scenarios, the downward trajectory
for the debt ratio would be re-established over the medium term. Nevertheless, general government
debt-to-GDP levels would remain well above the benchmark throughout the medium-term in the
event of a large combined macroeconomic or a financial contingent liabilities shock. The
outstanding stock of state guarantees is 62 percent of GDP. These guarantees are concentrated in
two large state owned enterprises and pose significant fiscal risks.
1.
Iceland’s public debt increased sharply as a consequence of the financial crisis and
remains elevated. At the end of 2014, gross general government debt was estimated to be
82 percent of GDP, compared to a pre-crisis debt ratio of just 28.5 percent in 2007. Nevertheless,
Iceland has made significant progress towards reducing debt vulnerability. Since the peak year of
2011, the general government gross debt ratio has fallen by around 14 percentage points of
GDP.
2.
The structure of Iceland’s general government debt in large part reflects the policy
response to the financial crisis. In 2009, the government issued a bond to cover capital
contributions to distressed domestic financial institutions. The remaining obligation on this bond
is estimated to be ISK 213 billion (10.8 percent of GDP) at end-2014. There are other debts
assumed by the government arising from called guarantees issued by the Treasury. There is also
a sizable non-marketable instrument that was issued to recapitalize the CBI that was restructured
in December 2014, reducing the gross debt stock by 1.2 percent of GDP. The external general
government debt stock owed to Nordic governments has been repaid from the proceeds of the
Eurobond issued in July 2014. These debts were accumulated during the crisis when Nordic
partners offered bilateral financial support for FX reserve purposes.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

ICELAND

3.
A significant proportion of recent general government debt issuance has been used
to bolster foreign exchange holdings. The government has deposited the foreign exchange
proceeds for use by the CBI and thereby has built up sizable deposits at the CBI. This is reflected
in the large divergence between gross and net debt. At end-2014, net general government debt
amounted to 58.3 percent of GDP.
4.
While the level of general government debt is high, the structure of the debt helps
minimize fiscal risks:


Domestic debt. Around three quarters of general government debt is domestic. About
10 percent of this debt stock has been issued by local government entities. The bulk of this
local government debt is held domestically.



Short-term debt. The outstanding stock of short-term debt (original maturity) is small,
comprising of just 2 percent of domestic general government debt. Only a minimal amount
of external debt is coming due in the coming year, although a more sizable repayment of
$1 billion (5.6 percent of GDP) will be amortized in June 2016.



Denomination. Around three quarters of general government debt is denominated in local
currency with the remainder issued in U.S. dollars and Euros, along with negligible amounts
in Sterling.



Fixed versus floating interest rate. About 85 percent of the debt stock was issued using
fixed interest rates.



Duration. The weighted average time to maturity on central government debt is 7.3 years.
The time to maturity on foreign currency debt is lower at 4.7 years.



Ownership. Ownership of Icelandic debt is concentrated in local banks and pension funds.

5.
A significant fiscal risk is posed by the large outstanding stock of government
guaranteed debt. At end-2014, the stock of state guaranteed debt was around ISK 1.2 trillion
(62 percent of GDP) falling from a peak of 84 percent of GDP in 2009. During 2014, the stock of
guarantees fell in nominal terms. Moreover, the government has stated its intention to reduce
the stock guarantees as soon as it is practical. Around three quarters of these guarantees are
denominated in domestic currency. Around 84 percent of these guarantees were issued to two
enterprises—HFF and the National Power Company (Landsvirkjun)—heightening fiscal
vulnerabilities. The government is expected to cover any losses related to HFF though the
budget, including any potential losses from the household debt relief program. Therefore, state
guarantees on HFF debt is not anticipated to be called, though the potential budgetary losses
surrounding HFF could be significant. The remaining state guarantees have been issued to other
financial institutions and state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, the Icelandic authorities estimate

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND
that there is around 24 percent of GDP in unfunded pension liabilities, which are recorded
separately from the gross public debt stock.4
Baseline and Realism of Projections
6.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) focuses on general government gross debt
and is based on the following policy assumptions.


Fiscal outlook. In line with the government’s Spring 2014 Economic Program and the 2015
budget, the authorities will target a general government balance of close to zero over the
medium term. This implies primary surpluses in the range of 2.8 to 3.3 percent of GDP over
the medium term, coupled with a negative interest rate growth differential, will place the
public debt ratio firmly on a downward trajectory.



Debt management strategy. The primary objective of the Icelandic government’s debt
management strategy is a return to debt sustainability, which is defined as a net debt5 to
GDP ratio of 45 percent. This objective is explicitly set out in the draft Organic Budget Law
(OBL) currently under consideration in Parliament. At the same time, the authorities are trying
to maintain adequate foreign exchange buffers while capital controls are liberalized. The
baseline also assumes that the Treasury will pay down one half of the large external bond
amortization due in 2016 (with the remainder rolled over). Thereafter, the DSA assumes that
the government will issue sufficient external debt to rollover repayments coming due in 2017
onwards. Finally, the scenario has taken into account the government’s planned asset sales in
2015–16 of about 3½ percent of GDP, with the resources eventually used to reduce the debt
stock.



Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth will be relatively robust within the range of
2.5 to 3.2 percent over the medium term, while inflation (GDP deflator) will be contained
below 5 percent.



Realism of baseline assumption The median forecast error for real GDP growth during
2004–14 is 0.3 percent. During the earlier years, staff tended to be marginally pessimistic
about growth and slightly optimistic during the crisis years. More recently, growth forecasts
have been close to outturns. Inflation forecasts have been subject to larger error, particularly
before and during the crisis. Since 2011, inflation forecast accuracy has improved. The
median forecast error for the general government primary fiscal balance indicates that staff

Government Financial Statistics.

ICELAND

projections were overly pessimistic before the crisis and too optimistic during the crisis, but
again forecast accuracy has improved in recent years.
7.
The baseline envisages a gradual reduction in the general government gross debt
ratio to around 54 percent of GDP by 2020. Likewise, the net debt ratio will continue its
downward trajectory. By 2017, the authorities are projected to be very close to meeting their net
debt fiscal rule, which will be established under the new OBL, currently under consideration in
Parliament.
8.
The risk assessment heat map indicates that Iceland has transitioned in 2014 from a
high to a moderate debt risk. Under the previous DSA, which used end-2013 data, the general
government debt ratio breached the high risk benchmark of 85 percent (Annex I, Figure 2). In
2014, Iceland’s debt ratio fell below that benchmark. Notwithstanding two repayments peaks in
2016 and 2018, gross financing needs are manageable over the medium term. This is due to the
small amounts of outstanding short term debt, and comparatively long maturities. A large
external bond will come due in 2016. The authorities’ current repayment plan is to roll over
50 percent of the amortized amount and repay the remainder from government deposits. A
second large bond—denominated in domestic currency—will amortize in 2018. The gross
external financing requirement (including public and private obligations) is significantly above
the upper benchmark of the early warning benchmark.
Shocks and Stress Tests
9.
The DSA baseline indicates that Iceland will continue to make further substantial
progress towards bringing the debt ratio down over the medium term. By 2017, the
authorities are projected to meet their 45 percent of GDP net debt objective—the new fiscal rule
outlined in the draft organic budget law. This conclusion assumes that the commitment to fiscal
adjustment is sustained and the macroeconomic and external environment is relatively benign.
Based on an asymmetric restriction of the shocks (Annex 1 Figure 2), the debt ratio peaks at
around 100 percent of GDP at a 95 percent confidence interval.


Growth shock. Under this scenario the real growth rate is subjected to a comparatively large
0.5 standard deviation negative shock starting in 2015–16. The scenario assumes a
0.25 percentage point decline in inflation for every one percentage point decrease in GDP.
The scenario also assumes higher risk premia, further worsening the primary balance. Under
this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio continues on its downward trajectory. However, the debt
ratio in 2020 is 10 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes a 200 basis point increase in spreads throughout
the projection period. However, the shock has a modest effect on the debt scenario due to
the comparatively high proportion of fixed interest debt and the relatively low future debt
rollover requirement. The debt ratio in 2020 is around 4 percentage points higher relative to
the baseline.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND


Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes a 25 percent real exchange rate
devaluation in 2014. The shock results in a small increase in the debt ratio due to the large
share of domestically denominated debt.



Primary balance shock. This scenario considers a 2 percentage point decline in revenues in
2015 and 2016. These shocks lead to a 9 percentage point increase in the debt ratio relative
to the baseline in 2020 and adds almost one percent of GDP to gross financing needs.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario combines shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the real exchange rate, and the primary balance while eliminating double-counting of
the effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, the debt ratio increases sharply, peaking
at 90 percent of GDP in 2017, and then resumes a downward trajectory but with an only
limited reduction in the level of debt by the end of the projection period. Gross financing
needs would be significant, rising to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2018.



Financial contingent liabilities shock. Reflecting the large outstanding stock of state
guarantees, this scenario assumes that 10 percent of these guarantees are called upon in
2015. This assumes a significant deterioration in the balance sheet of HFF. The scenario also
assumes that interest rates increase by 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP worsening
in the primary balance. Interest rates increase by over 210 basis points. The debt ratio
remains elevated throughout the projection period. In 2020, the debt ratio under this shock
scenario is projected to be around 19 percentage points higher than in the baseline.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ The residual in 2014-17 reflects the over-financing of the fiscal balance, an initial build-up of government deposits held at the central bank, and the subsequent
drawdown of deposits to finance external debt.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The Icelandic króna is floating effective October 2008. Iceland accepted
the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 but maintains exchange restrictions arising from
limitations imposed on the conversion and transfer of (i) interest on bonds (whose transfer the FX rules
apportion depending on the period of the holding), (ii) the principal payments from holdings of
amortizing bonds, and (iii) payments on the indexation of principal from holdings of amortizing bonds.
The retention of the three exchange restrictions was first approved by the Executive Board on April 6,
2012 (Decision No. 15133-(12/35)) and subsequently extended in March 2013 (Decision No. 15335(13/25) and further in March, 2014 until March 6, 2015 (Decision No. 15552-(14/22). In addition, Iceland
has in place measures that constitute exchange restrictions imposed for security reasons related to
financial transactions based on UN Security Council Resolutions. The de jure exchange rate arrangement
is free floating and the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Since the króna
followed an appreciating trend within a 2 percent band against the euro in 2014, the de facto exchange
rate arrangement is currently under review for possible revision to crawl-like as of January 2014.
Safeguards Assessment: The 2009 assessment concluded that the CBI's overall control environment
was broadly appropriate for a small central bank, with good controls in the accounting and financial
reporting area. The CBI's external and internal audit procedures practices were not found to be in line
with international practices, however, and the foreign reserves management area would benefit from
development. The authorities have since taken steps to implement safeguard recommendations,
notably by appointing an international audit firm to conduct annual external audits of the CBI in line
with international standards, establishing an internal audit function and appointing a Chief Audit
Executive per the board approved charter. Additionally, new reserves management guidelines were
approved in 2012. Work on the remaining recommendation—amendments to the Central Bank Act—
remains in progress.
Last Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2013 Article IV Consultation were held in Reykjavik
during June 4-14, 2013. The Staff Report (country report No. 13/256) was considered by the Executive
Board on August 1, 2013. Article IV consultations with Iceland are currently held on a 12-month cycle.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the SDDS specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the timeliness and periodicity
for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). The Statistics Department (STA)
prepared a data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (data ROSC) that
was published on November 22, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a timely
manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases, statistical
information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly, and annual
publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the Ministry of Finance,
and Statistics Iceland), and is available on their internet sites. Provision of electronic data in English
has improved substantially in recent years, especially from Statistics Iceland.
The existing methodological framework for producing national accounts data was replaced in
September 2014 with the new European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Statistics Iceland (SI)
published revisions of national accounts calculated backwards to 1997. Alongside the
implementation of ESA 2010, additional new statistics standards, improved benchmarks and sources
of data have been introduced. The main methodological changes which were introduced are:
Recognition that expenditure on research and development (R&D) has the nature of
investment. Research and development expenditure is recorded as gross fixed capital formation
and no longer as current expenditure. This increased the level of yearly GDP by 1.4 percent on
average. The impact on gross fixed capital formation is a level raise by 7.5 -17.3 percent per year.


Thorough revision of the methodology for calculating financial intermediation services
indirectly measured (FISIM). According to Chapter 14 of ESA 2010 FISIM are calculated as the the
difference between the loan rates and reference rates, or reference rates and the deposit rates,
multiplied by the corresponding stock of loans or deposits. SI defined the reference rates as the
weighted average of monthly loans and deposit rates for each type of loan. In volume terms, FISIM
are calculated based on the CPI published by SI in regard to the general price index for resident
non-indexed and inflation-indexed loans and deposits. The narrow trade index and OECD World CPI
are used for currency-linked and foreign currency loans and deposits as is used for foreign private
consumption. Due to the different methodology as well as improved sources of data, there is a
drastic change in the FISIM data during the boom-bust years (2006-09), especially in relation to
private consumption and exports.



A new standard for foreign trade statistics which resulted in transfer between trade in
goods to trade in services was introduced.


Measures of illegal activities were added to the household final consumption statistics
increasing the GDP by less than 0.5%.


Other minor methodological changes affected the investment, public consumption, and
private consumption accounts, and also resulted in a marginal increase of about 0.5% to 1% of GDP
over the revision period.

In December 2014, the authorities (CBI) raised an issue about the quality and interpretation of
Statistics Iceland’s Q3 data, particularly on domestic demand and inventories. The mission and CBI
discussed the issue with Statistics Iceland, which resulted in the conclusion that the difficulties with
dealing with Iceland’s national accounts data stem mainly from high seasonality and volatility of the
quarterly data. This data pattern particularly affects inventories, but also consumption and deflators
in a given quarter. Looking into and adopting best practices from the countries with similar data
patterns are advisable to better adjust for volatility in the quarterly data.
The authorities publish a Treasury cash flow statement on a monthly basis, quarterly data on the
general government operations, and annual data on the general government operations and
financial assets and liabilities.
Iceland reports government finance statistics in accordance with the GFSM 2001 framework in the
GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date contributor to the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Fiscal data was revised in autumn 2014 to reflect changes in treatment of capital expenditure and
research and development. The 2014 preliminary accounts reflect a number of one-off items related
to revenues generated by the financial sector. The accounting treatment of these items will be
revisited when the final GFS accounts are finalized during 2015.
In September 2014, the CBI concluded the migration of the balance of payments (BOP) and
International Investment Position (IIP) to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6),
and published for the first time BOP statistics (Q2 2014) using the new standards. The new
standards take the place of the 5th edition, implemented in Iceland since 1996. The changes will
affect foreign direct investment, external trade in goods and services, and insurance, pension, and
standardized guarantee schemes that will be included with financial assets and liabilities. In addition
to better reflecting Iceland’s external trade and IIP positions, the migration to BPM6 ensured
compliance to most recent standards, as well as greater consistency with other statistical reporting
standards, such as the System of National Accounts. It also improved overall transparency,
presentation, and comparability with other countries.
On monetary and financial statistics, the concepts and definitions broadly conform to the guidelines
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the MFSM, M3/Broad
Money measure includes deposits of the central government, positions of commercial banks with
private nonfinancial corporations include some positions with public nonfinancial corporations, and
the latter include some positions with private nonfinancial corporations. Beginning in February 2010,
the CBI reports for publication in IFS monetary data for central bank and other depository
corporations using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation and Fifth Post-Program
Monitoring Discussion with Iceland
On March 9, 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2014 Article IV consultation1 and Fifth Post-Program Monitoring Discussion with Iceland2.
Iceland has reached a relatively strong macroeconomic position with good growth prospects.
Unemployment continues to trend down, now at 4 percent. Growth slowed last year but is
expected to pick up to around 3 percent over 2015–17, supported by robust domestic demand and
tourism. Consumption will be boosted by household debt relief and—together with net trade—
will benefit from favorable commodity prices.
Against this positive economic backdrop, vulnerabilities remain and risks are tilted to the
downside. Crisis legacies are still being unwound, including a large balance of payments (BOP)
overhang contained by capital controls. The authorities expect significant progress this year in
finalizing and implementing an updated capital account liberalization strategy. The current
account balance is forecast at around 6 percent of GDP this year—boosted by falling oil prices—
and is expected to gradually decline over the medium term to 2 percent of GDP.
Inflation has fallen to 0.8 percent—well below the 2.5 percent target—pulled down by imported
deflation and a stronger exchange rate. However, real wages accelerated to almost 6 percent, and
the outcome of 2015 wage negotiations is highly uncertain. Inflation is expected to move closer
to the target by the end of 2016. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) paused in February and
continued foreign exchange accumulation. The CBI legislative framework review is currently in
progress.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The central objective of PPM is to provide for closer monitoring of the policies of members that have substantial
Fund credit outstanding following the expiration of their arrangements. Under PPM, members undertake more
frequent formal consultation with the Fund than is the case under surveillance, with a particular focus on
macroeconomic and structural policies that have a bearing on external viability.

2

The general government recorded a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP last year—its first surplus in
seven years—helped by one-off revenues. The fiscal stance, measured by the change in the
structural primary balance, tightened 0.2 percent of potential GDP in 2014 and is projected to
tighten further by about 0.5 percent of GDP over the medium term. Household debt relief
became operational, and more frontloaded to 2014, though the overall costs are broadly as
expected. General government gross debt remains high but on a downward sustainable path. The
draft budget framework bill now before Parliament—when approved—will strengthen Iceland’s
fiscal framework. The government has begun an important reform of the VAT system.
Good progress has been made in improving the financial stability framework, but gaps remain.
Banking sector buffers are strong but uncertainties surrounding the unwinding of crisis legacies
and legal risks, including challenges to CPI indexation, remain high. The CBI and the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FME) are making progress in improving macrofinancial and supervisory
stress tests, but gaps remain in bank supervision and financial safety nets. The authorities are
working on permanent solutions for the loss-making government-owned Housing Financing
Fund (HFF) and are developing mechanisms for a successor lender.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors welcomed the improving economic conditions and progress in addressing
crisis legacies. Directors noted that with sound policies, the outlook is for sustained growth, price
stability, and declining debt ratios. However, downside risks remain, including from lower global
growth, wage pressures, and uncertainty surrounding capital account liberalization. It would
therefore be important to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, while enhancing
growth, rebuilding confidence, and preparing for the eventual removal of capital controls.
Directors agreed that the strategy for liberalizing the capital account should remain conditionsbased, be well communicated, and benefit from the support of sound macroeconomic and
financial sector policies. In this context, they recommended that greater focus be placed on
policies to strengthen Iceland’s balance of payments and on structural reforms to boost labor
productivity and competitiveness.
Directors agreed that the monetary policy stance appropriately focuses on price stability. They
encouraged the central bank to remain vigilant and stand ready to respond to opposing pressures
from external deflationary developments and potentially large wage increases. Directors
supported ongoing efforts to accumulate foreign currency reserves to smooth eventual outflows,

as conditions permit. They stressed the importance of maintaining an independent and
accountable central bank, and looked forward to the outcome of the review of legislation in this
area.
Directors welcomed progress in consolidating public finances and the early repayment to the
Fund. They saw merit in developing contingency measures to achieve the 2015 fiscal targets.
Directors supported the medium-term objectives of pursuing a balanced budget and further
reducing public indebtedness. They noted that, with Iceland on track to achieve core objectives,
fiscal policy is well positioned for a transition toward boosting potential growth, particularly
through public investment, while being mindful of the distributional consequences of any
reforms. Directors underscored the importance of adopting the organic budget law to provide an
institutional anchor for fiscal policy, thus reinforcing market confidence ahead of capital account
liberalization. Improving the efficiency of the tax system also remains a priority.
Directors emphasized the need to maintain adequate buffers in the core financial sector in light
of risks surrounding the unwinding of capital controls and some legal challenges. They
recommended that the authorities continue to improve the financial stability framework,
including supervision, deposit insurance, bank resolution, and emergency liquidity assistance.
Directors called for a swift resolution of the Housing Financing Fund to minimize fiscal costs
and financial stability risks.

Statement by Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Iceland
And Ragnheidur Jonsdottir, Advisor to the Executive Director
March 9, 2015

The Icelandic authorities appreciate the productive discussions during the Article IV mission
in December last year.
My authorities broadly agree with the staff appraisal and recommendations. The Icelandic
economy has continued to make progress towards stability and sustainable growth. The slack
in the economy is disappearing, public finances and the current account of the balance of
payments are in surplus, and inflation expectations are settling on the target, with actual
inflation already below it. Economic policy aims at building on this progress and
strengthening its foundation.
As staff points out, however, significant downside risks remain. Some are exogenous, such as
possible deterioration of demand from slow-growing overseas markets. Other risks require
careful maneuvering and a cautious approach by the authorities so as to ensure outcomes that
are consistent with stability. This includes orderly liberalization of capital controls and
general wage settlements that are on the whole consistent with the inflation target. There is
some uncertainty about growth in 2014, and figures based on preliminary estimates for the
first three quarters might be revised upwards. This will redistribute growth outcomes
between 2014 and 2015 but will not change the overall prospects of annual growth in excess
of 3 percent during the forecast period to 2017. This outcome is helped by the recent
significant improvement in terms of trade, but it remains more than satisfactory given the
present weakness of important trading partners and the fact that the scope to increase growth
by eating into the slack is rapidly disappearing.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy aims to ensure further stability and continued debt reduction. The general
government balance showed a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014, after having improved
steadily from 2009, when it showed a post-crisis deficit of 8.6 percent of GDP. A continued
surplus, albeit a small one, is targeted for 2015 and 2016. The organic budget law, when
adopted, will strengthen the institutional foundations for fiscal discipline and credibility. The
VAT system has been improved to expand coverage and reduce differences between the
lower and higher rates. There is a clear need to increase public investment, including the road
system and the healthcare system. Moreover, policies to make the public sector more
productive and efficient are an important part of the medium-term fiscal strategy.
The main VAT rate has been lowered from 25.5 percent to 24 percent, while the lower rate
was increased from 7 to 11 percent. At the same time, the high and distorting excise tax
previously applied to items such as household appliances has been abolished. Finding the

2
optimal balance between direct and indirect taxes is a difficult task that bears directly on
welfare policies, including income distribution. The authorities will continue to seek
improvements in the tax system so as to make it more efficient.
Staff’s DSA indicates that public debt is on a falling trajectory and that the net debt ratio
objective of 45 percent of GDP is a realistic goal for 2017. Contingent liabilities related to
the Housing Financing Fund (HFF) guarantees are a point of concern; however, work on
restructuring the HFF is advancing, and proposals should emerge in the near future. Although
scaling down the HFF to support a more limited function for low-income groups and regional
housing development is easy in principle, the exact implementation of such a strategy is not a
simple task, either technically or politically. Liabilities related to the state pension fund,
estimated at 24 percent of GDP, will be met within a framework of a fully funded pension
system for future generations.
The household debt relief program is being implemented. The purpose is to provide holders
of index-linked mortgages with direct and indirect compensation for the impact of the
inflation shock following the banking crisis. The program has been shifted forward so that
the bulk of the relief occurs in one year instead of three. The financing is included in the
fiscal budget for 2015, and the remainder will be included in the 2016 budget proposal.
Monetary policy
Inflation has fallen below the inflation target. Since December, the year-on-year inflation rate
has been 0.8 percent. Excluding housing, the inflation rate is negative. Inflation is projected
to remain below 2 percent into 2016. Inflation expectations have also subsided from being
well above the inflation target to being by many measures consistent with it.
The Central Bank’s key rate – the seven-day term deposit rate – remains at 4.5 percent after
being lowered by 75 basis points in late 2014 but has been on hold since, consistent with
MPC statements that the Committee looks through the first-round effects of lower oil prices
and needs greater clarity on future wage developments.
The Central Bank has been active in the FX market with the aims of smoothing exchange rate
fluctuations and building reserves that are not financed by foreign borrowing. In the given
environment of a positive current account balance, the Bank has been particularly successful
in this regard. In 2014, the Bank’s net purchases in the interbank market amounted to the
equivalent of 5.6 percent of GDP, and the pace has been similar so far in 2015. The size of
the reserves is now close to 30 percent of GDP. Coverage of the foreign exchange reserves is
more than adequate, as long as the capital controls remain in place, but cannot cover potential
unrestricted outflows. The Central Bank has the long-term aim of keeping reserves close to
1.2 times short-term debt. They are currently well above that level if short-term debt blocked
by capital controls is excluded, but otherwise they are below it. Reserve adequacy in the near
term has to be seen in light of plans to lift the capital controls as soon as conditions allow.

3

Capital controls
Foreign currency auctions have been applied successfully to reduce the off-shore overhang of
claims on short-term ISK assets held by non-residents. The final auction under the Central
Bank’s Investment Program was held in February 2015. The foreign currency auctions held
since mid-2011 have transferred volatile ISK assets in the amount of 175 billion ISK from
non-residents to long-term investors. As a share of GDP, the balance of short-term ISK assets
has declined from 25 percent (of year-2011 GDP) at year-end 2011 to 15 percent of
estimated year-2014 GDP following the February auction.
The auctions have significantly reduced the risk of instability emanating from the current
stock of offshore claims associated with capital account liberalization. But, as is documented
in the IMF Staff Papers and several publications from the authorities, there are two other
“overhangs” that must be dealt with. The risk from the unwinding of the old banks has been
thoroughly measured and must be mitigated before the capital controls can be lifted. The risk
of outflows from domestic residents is highly uncertain, however, and will depend partly on
the level of confidence at the time.
Work on capital account liberalization is progressing on several fronts. The authorities’ work
has reached the phase of working out the details of selected policy options, and the
implementation of some of those options is drawing closer.
As is underlined in one of the selected issues papers, a sudden abolition of capital controls
could potentially lead to rapid outflows of foreign currency, with the associated disruptive
consequences. Meanwhile, aspirations to lift the controls and restore the free flow of capital
existing before the banking crisis have gained momentum. It should be kept in mind that,
although the liberalization strategy is conditions-based and the steps are appropriately phased
and based on careful analysis, the effects of liberalizing the capital account cannot be fully
anticipated or calculated. Some risk will be involved. The authorities expect to take
significant further steps towards freer capital movements over the course of this year.
Financial sector
The Icelandic banks are well capitalized, with a Tier 1 ratio over 25 percent, which is well
above minimum requirements, due in part to strong profits in recent years. The banks also
have strong liquidity and funding buffers, reflecting early implementation of the Basel
recommended liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) in
foreign currency. Nonperforming loans are on a downward trend.
The authorities are in the process of implementing European directives that will bring
domestic legislation on deposit insurance and bank resolutions in line with international
standards. A bill of legislation incorporating the European Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive into Icelandic law is expected to be presented to Parliament in the fall. The FME is

4
strengthening its skills and knowledge base and steadily improving its risk assessment
methodology. The Fund continues to provide valuable technical assistance and support for
this work.
The authorities agree with the IMF staff that the banks’ high capital ratios and robust
liquidity buffers should be maintained at a level that increases the banks’ resilience through
the process of lifting the capital controls. In light of this, the banks’ dividend distribution
should be prudent, and more long-term funding, both domestic and foreign, should be sought.
The labor market
The upcoming general wage negotiations are critical for stability in the economy. In past
years, excessive wage increases have invariably resulted in currency depreciation, inflation
spikes, weakening of the labor market, and sometimes fiscal and external deficits. Recent
wage agreements with physicians in the healthcare sector should not serve as a model for
others. The differential in wages and working conditions between Iceland and neighboring
countries in this field had widened to such an extent that severe brain drain was considered
imminent. Moreover, long-term efficiency gains were an integral part of the agreement.
Although the authorities do not participate directly in the collective wage bargaining process
in the private sector, they will support the process as much as possible, as long the outcome
is consistent with economic stability and growth.
