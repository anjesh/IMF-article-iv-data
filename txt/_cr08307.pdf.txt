Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and Sixth Review under the ThreeYear Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Request for
Waivers of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Jean A. P. Clément and Scott Brown
June 4, 2008
Main topics
Program review. Overall economic performance has been mixed. Staff supports the authorities’
request for waivers of nonobservance of two quantitative performance criteria and one structural
performance criterion for end-December 2007, based on remedial measures and policy
commitments for the remainder of the program.
Article IV consultation. Based on a review of São Tomé and Príncipe’s recent adjustment
experience, this report discusses policy challenges over the medium-term. The discussions
focused on the need to consolidate the macroeconomic environment and develop the country’s
production and export base, to achieve a sustainable private sector-led growth and reduce
poverty.
The exchange rate system is a managed float. Sustainability of the country’s external position
depends critically on finding commercially extractable oil reserves. If oil prospects do not
materialize, maintaining external stability will require further economic adjustment, including
that of the real exchange rate.

Mission
Discussions were held in São Tomé during March 13-26, 2008. The staff team comprised
Mr. Wang (head), Ms. Farhan, Ms. Takebe, and Mr. Fernandez (All AFR). Mr. Shanghavi (AFR)
helped prepare the staff report. The mission met with Mr. Trovoada, the Prime Minister, Mr.
Cravid, Minister of Planning and Finance, Ms. Soares, former Acting Governor of the Central
Bank (BCSTP), other senior government and central bank officials, members of the National
Assembly, trade unions, and representatives of the private sector, the donor community, and the
press.

Selected issues papers
Two selected issues papers were prepared, based on a seminar held in São Tomé during the
mission, on the policy mix to achieve a sustainable reduction in inflation and domestic revenue
mobilization.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic performance under the PRGF-supported program has been mixed. While
economic activity remained robust, inflation accelerated in the second half of 2007, reflecting
surging international prices of food and fuel, as well as a budgetary expenditure overrun,
which put pressure on base money growth. As a result, the performance criteria for endDecember 2007 related to the domestic primary fiscal deficit and net credit to the
government were not met. The structural performance criterion for end-2007 on a pilot
system to strengthen budget execution and monitoring was implemented with delay—the
intended steps were taken in early 2008.
Discussions for the sixth and final review under the PRGF arrangement focused on
corrective measures to restore financial stability. The authorities are committed to
strengthening expenditure control and reducing the domestic primary deficit in 2008. To
mitigate the impact of the recent shocks, the fiscal program has been eased to provide
targeted assistance to the poor, drawing on additional World Bank grants. A more active
monetary policy has led to a slow down in base money growth and currency depreciation in
the first quarter of 2008.
Maintaining external stability over the medium term requires further economic
adjustment, continued donor support, and a significant improvement in export
earnings. São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium-term outlook depends critically on the prospects
for oil exports and revenue, which remain uncertain at this time. The main challenges are to
maintain fiscal sustainability and to develop the country’s production and export base. The
pursuance of fiscal consolidation and an active monetary policy in the context of a flexible
exchange rate regime will be important to buttress macroeconomic stability. Prudent policy
on external borrowing will also be important for maintaining debt sustainability.
There was broad agreement that structural reforms need to be accelerated to achieve a
sustainable private sector-led growth. The improvement of the investment climate through
regulatory reform and upgrading infrastructure are vital for attracting private investment. The
authorities welcomed the staff’s assessment of the country’s monetary and exchange
arrangements and are committed to maintaining an open exchange and trade regime.
Staff recommends completion of the sixth review based on understandings reached on
policy implementation. Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the
nonobservance of the afore-mentioned quantitative and structural performance criteria for
end-December 2007, based on the authorities’ remedial actions to contain budgetary
expenditure and base money growth below the indicative targets and policy commitments for
the remainder of the program.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe is a small, open, low-income economy, with a very
narrow production and export base (Figure 1). The country’s main export commodity is
cocoa but the once-dominant agriculture sector has declined over the last three decades.
Tourism is relatively small and brings in little net foreign exchange receipts because it relies
heavily on imported goods and services. In recent years, public finances have been supported
by large oil signature bonuses, but exploratory drilling for oil has not yet confirmed the
existence of commercially extractable reserves.

2.
The authorities have embarked on economic adjustment and reform supported
by the Fund under the PRGF since August 2005. Growth has been robust and progress has
been made in reducing fiscal imbalances and the pubic debt burden. The country reached the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2007 and benefited from
HIPC/MDRI debt relief. By September 2007, creditors representing over 80 percent of the
country’s external debt at the completion point had agreed to deliver HIPC debt relief,
enabling the Fund to disburse its share of topping-up assistance.

7

3.
The cabinet has been reshuffled in late 2007 and early 2008. A coalition
government took office in February 2008 but suffered recently a vote of no confidence in the
National Assembly (NA). Under the constitutional arrangements, the current government
remains in power until it is replaced democratically by a new government.
4.
In the last Article IV consultation, Directors emphasized the importance of
developing solid institutions to secure transparent management of oil revenue,
strengthening macroeconomic policies and accelerating structural reforms to broaden
the economy’s productive base. Progress has been made in strengthening the management
of oil-related resources. The country is now a Candidate State of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). However, broadening the country’s production and export
base remains a challenge.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
5.
Real GDP grew at an estimated 6 percent in 2007 (Figure 2 and Table 1). Growth
was led by the construction and services sectors boosted by tourism-related foreign direct
investment. 1 However, spillover from foreign-funded tourism projects to local employment
and income is still limited because of the high import content of these projects. Exports
recovered slightly on the back of rising international price of cocoa.
6.
After declining to 14 percent in the first half of the year, annual inflation rose to
28 percent by the end of 2007. This rebound was spurred by surging food and oil prices,
upward adjustments of utility tariffs to cover the bulk of the costs, and depreciation of the
dobra, particularly against the euro, the main invoicing currency for imports. Excluding food
items, inflation was 10 percent (year-on-year) at the end of 2007, compared to 20 percent a
year ago (Box 1). In real effective terms, the exchange rate changed little as appreciation in
the second half of 2007 largely offset the depreciation early in the year.
7.
The domestic primary deficit was larger than programmed in 2007, despite
higher revenue (Table 2 and Table I.1). This was on account of a large increase in current
spending, especially payments to EMAE, the state-owned utility company, to cover part of
the costs to households arising from the utility tariff hike. High current spending also
crowded out funding available for domestically financed capital expenditure. The domestic
primary deficit, at 1.1 percent of GDP higher than the program target, was financed by a
larger-than-projected drawdown of government deposits at the central bank (BCSTP),
including from the National Oil Account (NOA).

Box 1. Recent Rise in Inflation: Domestic Policies vs. External Shocks
Headline inflation went up sharply in the second half of
2007. During this period, a 30 percent general wage
increase and faster-than-programmed liquidity growth
resulted in a significant depreciation of the dobra against
the euro and the U.S. dollar. In response to rising
international prices, the authorities raised domestic prices
of petroleum products (by 14-25 percent) and electricity
and water tariffs (by 40-60 percent) in September 2007.
Moreover, rising import prices for food items contributed
to higher inflation.

Staff estimates suggest that of the 3 percent increase in

attributable to base money growth and exchange rate

and the remaining 0.6 percent to other factors.1

8.
Monetary policy implementation was complicated by volatile capital inflows and
was not adequate in controlling base money growth (Table 3). The BCSTP’s sterilization
of budgetary use of oil bonuses fell short of what was needed to mop up excess liquidity. As
a result, net international reserves of the BCSTP were US$6 million above the program target
at the end of 2007. The excess liquidity put downward pressure on the exchange rate and the
spread between central bank and commercial bank exchange rates widened to over 2 percent.
9.
São Tomé and Príncipe has maintained an open trade regime. The tariff reform,
which started in 2002, has lowered the simple average tariff rate to 11.7 percent and reduced
non-tariff trade barriers. In late 2007, the authorities decided not to sign the European Union
Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), emphasizing the importance of first creating
competitive export sectors, particularly in agriculture, and reducing reliance on trade taxes
before joining the EPA.

10

10.
Progress continued on structural reforms albeit slower than envisaged. The endDecember 2007 structural performance criterion on upgrading the pilot system (SAFINHO)
to strengthen budget execution and monitoring was implemented in early 2008 (Table I.2).
The 2008 budget, prepared in line with the PRGF-supported program, was approved by the
NA in mid-May 2008. The NA also started the process for final approval of the direct
taxation reform package consisting of a new corporate income tax code, a personal income
tax code, and an urban property tax code. On financial sector reform, the BCSTP issued in
early 2008 the new prudential regulations on capital adequacy, internal control and auditing,
bank financial reporting, and credit to employees. In late April 2008, the NA gave its final
approval to the anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) law, paving the way for an operational
AML/CFT regime in São Tomé and Príncipe.
11.
Progress has been made in enhancing the transparency of managing current and
prospective oil resources. The Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML) was enacted. The
law ensures parliamentary authority and supervision over the use of signature bonuses and
other oil-related receipts. Under the ORML, the Petroleum Oversight Committee and the
Public Registration and Information Office were created, and the ORML Handbook was
posted on the official website. The authorities formally declared their adherence to the
principles of the EITI and set up a national committee and appointed a national coordinator
for implementation. To lay the ground for launching licensing for the Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ), the National Oil Agency prepared a Petroleum Sector Strategy and related laws,
but their adoption has been delayed due to changes in government.
12.
Some progress was made to improve the investment climate. In line with the
recommendations of the 2005 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, a new investment code
was submitted to the NA, the labor code was revised, and customs procedures were
simplified. Arbitration tribunals for business litigation were established in 2006. Legislation
to reduce the cost and duration of starting a business were drafted in consultation with the
private sector. The restructuring of the electricity sector and the airport and seaport
authorities were initiated. Under a reform strategy for EMAE, the electricity and water
company, utility tariffs were increased to cover production costs. EMAE also installed
prepaid electricity meters to strengthen payment collection.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Lessons from the Past
13.
As part of the Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities and staff
exchanged views on the key lessons from the country’s recent adjustment experience.
They agreed that the policy and reform agenda since 2005 was underpinned by a Poverty
Reduction Strategy. While a large number of reforms have been introduced, notably in public
resource management and banking supervision, financial policy implementation has not

11

always been consistent. The resulting stop-go pattern of macroeconomic policies created
pressures on inflation, compounding the country’s vulnerability to external shocks.
14.
To improve macroeconomic management, staff and the authorities agreed on the
following priorities:
•

Effective implementation of an appropriate policy mix to achieve a sustainable
reduction in inflation. Staff analysis, taking into account relations between fiscal
policy, money supply, the exchange rate, and import prices, suggests that a prudent
fiscal policy needs to play a central role, supported by a proactive monetary policy.
The former is particularly important because of São Tomé and Príncipe’s limited
monetary policy instruments for liquidity management and the need to maintain
adequate usable reserves (Box 2).

•

Revenue mobilization. São Tomé and Príncipe’s domestic revenue is smaller than its
current expenditure. To meet rising demand for developmental and poverty reduction
expenditures and to avoid putting undue pressure on limited official reserves, in
addition to mobilizing external support, domestic revenue must be increased through
a combination of tax policy reform and improvement in tax administration, based on
an expanded economy.

•

Developing the supply side of the economy. While real GDP has recently grown at
6-7 percent a year, recorded output growth has not yet translated into broad gains in
income and employment. Indeed, the traditional agriculture sector has been shrinking,
the emerging tourism sector remains small, and the government has become the
largest employer in recent years. Reforms to attract investment therefore will have to
be accompanied by public sector reform to make room for private sector
development. Better use of available resources, including oil bonuses and donor
funding, to boost the country’s growth potential, notably in tourism and agriculture,
would help raise living standards and reduce poverty.
B. Medium-Term Outlook and Challenges

15.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium-term outlook depends critically on the
prospects for oil export earnings and revenue. Available information suggests that the
outlook for further inflows of oil signature bonuses from Blocks 5 and 6 of the Joint
Development Zone (JDZ) and from the EEZ remains uncertain at this time. 2 In Blocks 1-4 of

2

Unsettled disagreements among the stakeholders of Blocks 5 and 6 have put on hold oil signature bonuses of
$26.1 million for the two blocks.

12

the JDZ, where investors have paid their signature bonuses, oil exploration is ongoing but
discovering commercially extractable reserves continues to be an uncertain process (Box 3).
Box 2. Policy Mix, Sustainable Disinflation, and Revenue Mobilization1
Appropriate policy mix. The two recent inflation spikes (mid-2006 and end-2007) were heavily
influenced by domestic policies but also affected by external factors. Staff analysis suggests that the
increase in excess liquidity during the two episodes can be largely explained by larger-thanprojected withdrawals from the government’s deposits at the central bank to finance public spending
and by inadequate central bank sterilization.
Although sterilization can be an effective tool to contain
liquidity in the short term, continuous selling of foreign
exchange to mop up liquidity may not be sustainable.
The level of usable net international reserves is rather
modest when excluding commercial bank and
government deposits at the central bank.

To achieve a sustainable reduction in inflation, fiscal
policy therefore will need to play a central role, not only
in directly reducing domestic demand pressures on prices
but also reducing the need for foreign exchange sales by
the central bank for sterilization. A prudent fiscal policy,
together with a proactive monetary policy, is essential to
contain liquidity growth and anchor inflation and
depreciation expectations. Fiscal and monetary anchors are
important for sustainable disinflation.
Domestic Revenue Mobilization. São Tomé and
Príncipe’s small and undiversified economy leaves it with
a narrow tax base to depend on. At the same time, its
revenue performance has increasingly depended on trade
taxes, both custom tariffs and excise duties.

Box 3. São Tomé and Príncipe: Status of Oil Exploration
For oil exploration purposes, São Tomé and Príncipe’s territory can be divided into three distinctive
geographical zones:
The off-shore Joint Development Zone operated jointly with Nigeria. Oil exploration in the JDZ
has started but, as of April 2008, has not yet confirmed the existence of commercially extractable
reserves.
The off-shore Exclusive Economic Zone. Preparatory work is under way for launching licensing for
oil exploration in the EEZ, which is located in areas with deeper water than the JDZ.
On-shore area includes the island of São Tomé and that of Príncipe. The potential for hydrocarbon
discoveries on-shore is considered low and, to date, the authorities have no plans for promoting
exploration in this area.

To illustrate the down side risks and their implications for macroeconomic
policies, staff discussed with the authorities two medium-term scenarios. The baseline
scenario assumes that oil signature bonuses for Blocks 5 and 6 are received in 2008 and oil
production starts in 2014, as previously projected. Under a worse-case scenario where oil
bonuses for Blocks 5 and 6 are delayed indefinitely and there is no oil production, the NOA
could be depleted quickly (Figure 3). Moreover, external budgetary support is expected to be
limited in the next few years. Under the worse-case scenario, large expenditure compression
would be unavoidable, and depletion of official reserves, high inflation, and currency
depreciation are also likely.

17.
São Tomé and Príncipe is vulnerable to adverse external developments and has a
high risk of debt distress, despite HIPC and MDRI debt relief. The government has not
contracted any new debt since reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative.
However, as indicated in the Debt Sustainability Analysis which has been jointly updated
with the World Bank staff (Supplement I), in the event of a large output loss or terms-oftrade deterioration, key debt ratios could exceed the relevant indicative thresholds. Moreover,
the risk of debt distress would increase significantly should oil prospects diminish further.
Under these circumstances, the authorities agreed that they should rely primarily on nondebt-creating external financing, attracting foreign direct investment and donor grants. They
stood ready to reassess their external financing strategies after further oil exploration
drillings.
18.
There was a consensus that the key challenges facing the authorities include
maintaining fiscal sustainability and developing the domestic production and export
base. In view of the uncertain oil revenue outlook, staff argued for continued reduction of
fiscal imbalances, bringing recurrent outlays, particularly on budgetary personnel costs, in
line with available domestic revenue and donor budgetary support. Improving the
composition of public expenditure and increasing the efficiency of public investment are also
important not only for fiscal sustainability but also for increasing the growth orientation of
the budget.
19.
The authorities pointed out that the country’s productive base must be
developed and broadened to sustain growth and reduce external vulnerability. They
noted that São Tomé and Principe has a low saving rate and a very small domestic market.
To unlock the country’s growth potential, it is imperative that the investment climate be
significantly improved by removing the regulatory impediments to private sector

15

development, upgrading infrastructure, improving access to financing, and developing
agriculture and other sectors based on the country’s comparative advantages.
C. Macroeconomic Policies for the Remainder of the Program
20.
Against the backdrop of an external shock stemming from rising food and fuel
prices, the authorities emphasized their commitment to strengthen policy
implementation and restore financial stability. The discussions centered on actions to
correct the policy slippages that occurred in the second half of 2007, particularly in
expenditure control, liquidity management, and structural reforms. With an additional grant
from the World Bank, the discussions also covered the need to support the vulnerable
segments of the population.
Fiscal Policy
21.
The 2008 budget envisages a reduction of the domestic primary fiscal deficit to
5.2 percent of GDP, from 8.1 percent of GDP in 2007 (MEFP ¶11). The domestic primary
deficit for 2008 is higher than the 4.8 percent of GDP originally programmed, to mitigate the
impact of high import prices for food and petroleum products. This will be financed by an
additional budgetary support grant from the World Bank, part of which will be saved for
future use. 3 The fiscal program is fully financed by the use of the World Bank grant of
$4.5 million (2.8 percent of GDP), a drawdown from the NOA of $3 million (1.9 percent of
GDP), and other external budget support of 0.6 percent of GDP.

16

22.
Fiscal consolidation under the 2008 budget would come mainly from
expenditure reform (Figure 4). The full-year effect of the 2007 general wage increase will
be felt in 2008. In addition to measures to strengthen expenditure control, the authorities are
committed to initiating wage reform, as a first step toward a broader civil service reform
strategy, to help contain recurrent spending within the budget envelope (MEFP ¶13). A
comprehensive wage study to rationalize the public service salary structure and integrate
fringe benefits into the wage bill will be launched with the support of the World Bank.
23.
To prevent the recurrence of an expenditure overrun, the authorities agreed to
tighten control on non-wage current expenditure. Key measures include:
•

Strictly limiting nonessential current spending, particularly on goods and services and
transfers not funded by donors (see text table below).

•

Reassessing transfers to the Joint Development Authority to take into account oil
revenue prospects and budget constraints.

•

Putting in place a functioning computerized public financial management system to
effectively manage expenditure commitments. In addition to upgrading information
technology hardware, the authorities intend to make progress in training users at the
level of spending entities, and take other steps to elevate SAFINHO to a fully-fledged
eSAFE system.

•

Strictly complying with the provisions of the ORML on withdrawals from the
National Oil Account.

24.
In response to the rising import prices for food and fuel, the fiscal program was
modified to provide extra room (about 0.4 percent of GDP) for temporary, targeted
assistance to the poor and the most vulnerable (MEFP ¶13). Staff pointed out that implicit
general subsidies, such as those made through EMAE in the last quarter of 2007, are neither
efficient nor effective in delivering assistance to the most needy. Staff encouraged the
authorities to work closely with the World Bank to put in place a scheme, based on income or
other criteria, to provide targeted support to the poor. This extra spending, together with the
HIPC/MDRI debt relief-supported expenditure programs and efforts to align budgetary
allocations with the Priority Action Plan of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), is
expected to help mitigate the impact of the recent external shocks on the population.
25.
On the revenue side, timely implementation of the direct taxation reform
package after NA approval is crucial for the 2008 program. Although the reform is
expected to be revenue neutral for the first few years of implementation, it will help broaden
the tax base, reduce tax distortions, and over time reduce the country’s heavy reliance on
taxation on foreign trade (MEFP ¶14). To ensure that revenue collections are improved, the
authorities have intensified their effort to strengthen tax and customs administration. In this
regard, they are being assisted by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) under
its Threshold Program, including in auditing tax returns, keeping track of large tax payers,
and collecting tax arrears.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
The BCSTP is committed to use foreign exchange auctions more actively to
reduce base money growth, in the context of a flexible exchange regime (MEFP ¶17).
Since extensive use of foreign currencies and weak financial intermediation severely limit the
effectiveness of interest rates and other monetary policy instruments, the authorities have to
rely on fiscal restraints and foreign exchange sales to control liquidity. Accordingly, the
BCSTP held more frequent foreign exchange auctions in March 2008, while maintaining net
international reserves (NIR) above the program target. As a result, annual base money
growth slowed down from 50 percent at the end of 2007 to 27 percent by the end of March
2008. Depreciation of the dobra also slowed from 6.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in the
last quarter of 2007 to 2.6 percent in the first quarter of 2008.
27.
To increase the effectiveness of liquidity control, the fiscal and monetary
authorities agreed to improve their coordination to ensure timely sterilization of
budgetary use of oil bonuses and donor funding (MEFP ¶18). Aside from informationsharing among staff of the Treasury and the BCSTP, the Finance Minister and the BCSTP
Governor also intend to meet regularly on the government’s cash outlays and the BCSTP’s
liquidity forecast. To enhance the accuracy of liquidity management, the BCSTP has started
monitoring the weekly average commercial bank minimum reserve requirement, instead of
the monthly average. These steps are expected to strengthen implementation of the monetary

19

program for the remainder of the year, which aims to bring inflation on a downward path,
while preserving NIR equivalent to about 4 months of imports.
28.
The authorities remain committed to deepening foreign exchange market reform
(MEFP ¶19). The recent external shock has complicated the implementation of the reform by
worsening supply-demand imbalances in the foreign exchange market. The authorities
reiterated their intention, in due time, to remove all multiple currency practices and
restrictions (see Informational Annex I), de facto or de jure, and on that basis, to accept the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
In the near term, they will focus on expediting approval by the NA of the new investment
code, which contains provisions aiming to remove the exchange restrictions on transferring
dividends abroad. The BCSTP will also revise the mechanism for setting the daily central
bank exchange rate, after a review of domestic market conditions in 2008, to ensure that the
spread between the official and commercial bank exchange rates does not exceed 2 percent.
Structural Reforms
29.
For the remainder of the program, the authorities intend to make progress in
several areas where significant preparatory work has already been done. These include:
(i) putting in place new modules to implement the public accounting system and preparing
regulations for the organic budget law (SAFE), as part of the effort to upgrade public
financial management; (ii) completing the revision of the commercial code, an important
regulatory reform to reduce the cost of doing business in the country (MEFP, ¶21);
(iii) adopting the Petroleum Sector Strategy and the related laws before launching the
licensing round for the EEZ (MEFP, ¶22).
30.
Financial sector reform will continue to focus on strengthening the regulatory
framework and the BCSTP’s implementation capacity (MEFP ¶23). There are five banks
in São Tomé and Príncipe. Recently, the BCSTP has received a new bank application and
two more foreign banks have expressed interest in entering the market. To reduce the risk of
money laundering and bank distress, the authorities have given top priority to making the
AML/CFT regime operational through issuing and implementing the enabling regulations
that the BCSTP already prepared. Moreover, they plan to strengthen the requirements for
issuing bank licenses by raising the minimum capital requirement and improving the
standards for feasibility studies, among other conditions.
Program Monitoring
31.
Indicative targets for selected fiscal and monetary variables are set to facilitate
program implementation prior to the expiration of the PRGF arrangement in August
2008 (MEPF, ¶28). These include indicative ceilings on primary nonwage current spending
and 12-month dobra base money growth, as well as floors for the BCSTP’s net international

20

reserves for end-March and end-June 2008 (Table I.1). Two structural benchmarks are added
to help monitor progress in fiscal structural reform (Table I.2).
IV. EXCHANGE RATE ARRANGEMENT AND OTHER ISSUES
A. Exchange Rate Arrangement and External Stability
32.
The exchange rate regime is currently classified as a de facto managed float. The
BCSTP has mostly been the sole seller in the official foreign exchange market for the last
two years while seldom buying foreign exchange from market participants. Empirical
evidence, while limited by the weak database, does not suggest a significant misalignment of
the real exchange rate from its equilibrium level. The authorities are making efforts to
remove the remaining exchange restrictions. 4 In view of the uncertain timeframe of
implementation, staff does not recommend Fund approval for maintaining these restrictions.
Staff assessment based on the updated DSA (¶16-17) also indicates that sustainability of the
country’s external position depends critically on finding commercially extractable oil
reserves. If oil prospects do not materialize, i.e., there would be no oil exports and revenue,
maintaining external stability will require further economic adjustment, including that of the
real exchange rate (Box 4).
33.
The authorities expressed interest in reassessing the country’s monetary and
exchange rate arrangements. They have commissioned experts from the European Union to
conduct a study on this issue. After a seminar held by the mission in October 2007, the
authorities noted that São Tomé and Príncipe could benefit from a strongly anchored currency
arrangement, including possible membership in a monetary union or an agreement to allow for
parity between the dobra and a strong currency. Staff analyzed the pros and cons of various
exchange systems, putting together the monetary history of São Tomé and Príncipe and
relevant international experience. 5 The analysis highlights the benefits under certain
conditions of a firmly anchored currency arrangement for a small, open, low-income country,
emphasizing that prudent fiscal and debt policies are preconditions for a sustainable regime.
B. Debt Management
34.
The authorities are conscious of the need to maintain debt sustainability. They are
committed to refraining from new external borrowing, especially on non-concessional terms. To
strengthen their debt management and analysis capacity, they have installed the Commonwealth
Secretariat debt management system (DS-DRMS) and plan to utilize the system to obtain a debt
payment schedule and other information to analyze the country’s debt sustainability.
4

See ¶28 and Informational Annex, Appendix I for a description of the exchange system and the remaining
exchange restrictions.

5

See IMF working paper (WP/08/118) for more details of the staff analysis.

21

35.
The authorities are seeking full delivery of HIPC relief from the remaining
creditors. Having initiated the negotiations, they have concentrated their efforts to conclude
debt relief agreements with Angola and Portugal, the two largest remaining creditors.
Box 4. The Equilibrium Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness
A simple empirical approach was used to assess exchange rate developments against equilibrium
levels. Due to data weaknesses and lack of high frequency statistics, the model used real per capita
GDP and government consumption to assess developments in the REER.
The results show that the REER moved from overvaluation to slight undervaluation in 20002001 and the gap between actual REER and

Maintaining external stability will require prudent macroeconomic management, continued
donor support and private inflows, including FDI, and a significant improvement in export
earnings. The large external current account deficit, at about 50 percent of GDP before official
transfers, is projected to persist over the medium term. Given the limited external assets, the
country’s production and export base must be developed and broadened. If oil prospects do not
materialize, maintaining external sustainability will require further economic adjustment, including
that of the real exchange rate.

C. Statistics, Capacity Building, and Other Issues
36.
Data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, although there
are still weaknesses in national accounts, government financial operations statistics, and
balance of payments data. The National Institute of Statistics has made significant progress

22

in updating GDP statistics, but the lack of reliable data still hampers analysis in areas such as
private sector development and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. To
further improve data quality, staff recommended that within the tight budget constraint, the
government provide funding for a new household expenditure survey in order to improve
compilation of the consumer price index.
37.
On capacity building, the authorities have showed willingness to follow Fund
technical advice but their ability to implement remains weak. Noting that São Tomé and
Príncipe is not a member of AFRITAC and, therefore, cannot benefit from its technical
assistance, the authorities hoped that the extension of AFRITAC currently under
consideration will cover the country. The BCSTP welcomed a Fund assessment of their
future technical assistance needs, particularly in banking supervision and development.
38.
The authorities have submitted to the Fund and the World Bank the second
Annual Progress Report of the PRSP. In the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), the staffs
noted that the authorities need to enhance monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective
implementation of the PRSP. Moreover, the staffs believe that an update of the PRSP would
be warranted when oil prospects are updated in late 2008-early 2009.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic performance under the PRGF-supported
program has been mixed. While economic activity remains robust, inflation accelerated in
the second half of 2007. The higher inflation reflected surging international prices for food
and fuel which represented a severe shock to São Tomé and Príncipe’s external current
receipts. However, an expenditure overrun and the lack of effective control of base money
growth also fueled inflation and currency depreciation.
40.
To lower inflation and restore financial stability, it is important that the
authorities significantly strengthen fiscal discipline and liquidity management. In this
regard, staff supports the 2008 budget that aims to reduce the domestic primary deficit. The
authorities are committed to tightening expenditure control. As the 2008 fiscal program has
been modified to provide funding to mitigate the impact of the recent external shock, staff
encourages the authorities to refrain from generalized price subsidies and work closely with
the World Bank staff to implement direct, targeted assistance to the poor.
41.
Timely implementation of the direct taxation reform package is crucial for the
2008 program. The tax reform would help broaden the tax base and reduce tax distortions.
Staff encourages the authorities to promptly begin implementation, following approval by the
National Assembly, along with continued effort to improve tax and customs administration.
42.
Recent progress by the BCSTP in curbing liquidity growth is encouraging.
Although base money is an indicative target, it serves as the anchor for the program, playing a

23

central role in restoring price stability. The central bank therefore needs to continue using
foreign exchange auctions more actively to bring dobra base money growth to a downward
path while observing the NIR floor. In addition, monetary policy needs to be supported by
fiscal restraint. In the event that the program’s NIR target is at risk, the government will have
to support monetary tightening by further curtailing non-essential domestic primary spending.
43.
The main challenges facing the authorities over the medium term are to
maintain fiscal sustainability and to develop the economy’s production and export base.
In view of the uncertain outlook for oil revenue, fiscal consolidation needs to continue
beyond 2008 by increasing growth orientation of the budget and bringing recurrent spending,
particularly on personnel costs, in line with domestic revenue and available donor budgetary
support. In this regard, the country’s adjustment experience since 2005 provides valuable
lessons, particularly in avoiding stop-go patterns of policy implementation. Staff also
recommends that the authorities strengthen debt management and rely primarily on
concessional financing.
44.
Accelerated structural reforms are needed to achieve sustained, private sectorled growth. The authorities are to be commended for obtaining the National Assembly’s
final approval of the anti-money laundering legislation. Staff encourages the BCSTP to take
other steps to advance financial sector reform, including tightening the requirements for
issuing new bank licenses. High priority should be attached to improving the investment
climate. The authorities should press ahead with regulatory reform to reduce the cost of
investing and doing business and attract foreign investment and donor support to upgrade
infrastructure and the key economic sectors, particularly tourism and agriculture. Staff
encourages the authorities to make further progress under the EITI to increase the
transparency and accountability of oil-related resource management.
45.
Staff encourages the authorities to maintain an open exchange system. Efforts
need to be made to remove all remaining restrictions in order for the authorities to accept the
obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ interest in reconsidering the country’s monetary and exchange arrangements.
Fiscal discipline and prudent debt management are the main prerequisites for a sustainable
exchange rate regime.
46.
Staff recommends completion of the sixth review based on the country’s
performance and policy commitments. Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers
for the nonobservance of the end-December 2007 quantitative performance criteria related to
the domestic primary deficit and net credit to the government and the structural performance
criterion on public financial management reform, based on remedial measures (summarized
in ¶ 23 and 26) and policy commitments for the remainder of the program.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

LETTER OF INTENT
São Tomé, June 4, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
objectives and policies that the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and
Príncipe intends to pursue for the remainder of 2008. They are consistent with the
Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and the objectives of the three-year
arrangement under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Our economic
adjustment and reform efforts are being supported by the international community, notably
through debt relief under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
2.
The Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe has made
progress in economic adjustment and structural reforms over the past year, amid a difficult
external economic environment. Economic growth has remained robust. In response to rising
international prices for food and fuel, the Government raised the domestic prices for
petroleum products, electricity, and water in the second half of 2007 to reduce implicit
subsidies. It also intensified efforts to mobilize aid and took steps to strengthen public
financial management. However, annual inflation rebounded since mid-2007, reflecting the
higher prices of our imports and depreciation of the dobra, especially against the euro, the
main invoicing currency for imports. Our domestic primary fiscal deficit was higher than
envisaged under the program owing mainly to higher energy prices.
3.
To bring inflation to a downward path, we are determined to strengthen policy
implementation, particularly in containing domestic primary expenditure and in curtailing
liquidity growth. Our policies for the remainder of 2008 aim to consolidate financial stability,
ensure sound management of oil-related and debt relief resources, and lay the groundwork
for sustained private sector-led growth. Our program envisages a further reduction of the
domestic primary fiscal deficit relative to GDP, a strengthening of monetary and exchange
rate policies to lower inflation, and an acceleration of structural reforms. These are key
conditions for sustained growth, which in turn is key for poverty reduction.
4.
In support of our objectives and policies, the Government hereby requests the
completion of the sixth review and the disbursement of the seventh loan under the PRGF

37
arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 0.423 million (5.7 percent of quota). The
Government requests a waiver for the nonobservance of the end-December 2007
performance criteria on net bank credit to the Government and the domestic primary fiscal
deficit, based on the corrective measures we are taking. The Government also requests a
waiver for the nonobservance of the end-December 2007 structural performance criterion
related to upgrading the computerized public financial management system. The intended
policy steps were taken in early 2008.
5.
The Government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request
regarding progress in implementing economic and financial policies and achieving the
objectives of the program.
6.
The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of the 2008 program supported by the PRGF arrangement,
but will take further measures to that end if deemed necessary. During the implementation of
the arrangement, the Government will consult with the Managing Director of the IMF on the
adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of the Government or
whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation.
7.
The Government intends to make the contents of this Letter of Intent and those of the
attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as well as the IMF
staff report on the sixth PRGF review, available to the public and authorizes the IMF to
arrange for them to be posted on the IMF website, subsequent to Executive Board completion
of the sixth review.
Yours truly,
s./

SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
March 26, 2008

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements that of
October 20, 2007 and our Letter of Intent dated December 1, 2007. The new coalition
Government, which took office in February 2008 with a majority in the National Assembly,
is committed to the policies under the PRGF-supported program. This MEFP describes
(i) performance under the PRGF arrangement through December 2007, (ii) economic
developments in 2007 and early 2008, and (iii) the Government’s economic program for the
remainder of this year. The policies set forth in this Memorandum should help achieve the
medium-term objectives set out in our PRSP, including efficient use of debt relief resources
provided under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Our Government is committed to creating the
conditions for sustained economic growth, which is essential for reducing poverty.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
2.
Economic activity remained robust in 2007, with real GDP growth estimated at
6 percent. Tourism-related construction, communication, and other services sectors
continued to be the main drivers of output growth, boosted by foreign direct investment.
Cocoa exports increased on the back of rising world market prices and higher export volume
but the traditional agriculture sector remains depressed.
3.
Consumer price inflation rebounded to 27.6 percent (year-on-year) at the end of
December 2007, after a significant decline in the first half of the year. This acceleration
reflected the impact of exogenous factors such as rising import prices for food and fuel and
appreciation of the euro, the main invoicing currency for our imports. 6 It was also influenced
by higher public expenditure and faster than programmed liquidity growth. In addition, the
Government sharply raised domestic prices of petroleum products (by 14-25 percent) and
electricity and water tariffs (by 40-60 percent) in September 2007, after increases in
international oil prices, in order to reduce implicit subsidies. The dobra depreciated against
the U.S. dollar and the euro by 10 and 26 percent, respectively, in 2007.
4.
Despite higher than projected domestic revenue, the domestic primary fiscal
deficit exceeded the performance criterion for end-December 2007 (Table I.1). Domestic
revenue recovered in the second half of the year, led by higher income tax receipts, as well as
6

Food items account for 72 percent of the basket for the consumer price index. About 80 percent of food
consumption in the country depends on imports. All oil products are imported.

39
tax arrear collections. However, the domestic revenue gains of about 1.2 percent of GDP visà-vis the program target were more than offset by a sharp rise in current spending, especially
on utilities, transfers, and medical expenses. A significant part of the utility payments to
EMAE, the state-owned electricity and water company, was to mitigate the impact of the
sharp utility tariff hike on the population. Higher current spending also contributed to lower
funding available for domestically financed capital expenditure. The widening domestic
primary deficit, at 8.1 percent of GDP, was financed by a larger-than-projected drawdown of
government deposits at the central bank (BCSTP), including from the National Oil Account
(NOA). The Government also made efforts to mobilize external financing, which helped in
clearing arrears on scholarships and other current outlays.
5.
Base money growth accelerated from 23 percent (year-on-year) in June 2007 to
50 percent by the end of the year. While part of base money growth was due to strong
foreign currency flows to the banking system, the excess increase in dobra liquidity reflected
the fact that the BCSTP’s sterilization of budgetary use of oil bonuses and donor grants fell
short of what was needed to adequately bring down liquidity growth. As a result, base money
grew much faster than programmed, while net international reserves exceeded the program
target by a large margin.
6.
The exchange rate of the dobra remains market-determined. The BCSTP has
continued to adjust its exchange rate to market conditions daily by calculating it as the sum
of 40 percent of the previous day’s selling rate quoted by commercial banks and 60 percent
of its own previous day’s selling rate. The excess liquidity put pressure on the exchange rate
and the spread between the reference exchange rate of the central bank and commercial
banks exchange rate widened in the second half of 2007 to over 2 percent.
7.
Progress on structural reforms has been mixed. The end-December 2007 structural
performance criterion on public financial management system was met with delay—the
intended policy steps were taken in early 2008 (Table I.2). On structural benchmarks, the
2008 budget was prepared and submitted to the National Assembly (NA) in mid-December
2007. It has since been withdrawn and needs to be resubmitted with an updated public
investment program. In early 2008, the BCSTP issued the new regulations on capital
adequacy, internal control and auditing, bank financial reporting, and credit to employees.
The Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML) handbook was posted on the internet in
December 2007. However, the direct taxation reform package (new corporate and personal
income tax and urban property tax laws) has not yet been approved pending resubmission by
the new Government of the draft income tax law. The NA has not yet given its final approval
to the anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) law. The National Oil Agency has prepared a
Petroleum Sector Strategy and a set of laws for launching licensing for the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ), but their adoption has been delayed.
8.
Implementation of public enterprise reform has been slow. Under a reform
strategy for EMAE, utility tariffs were increased to cover production costs. EMAE has also

40
introduced prepaid electricity meters to strengthen payment collection. Nevertheless,
EMAE’s facilities need repair and investment, its financial standing remains weak, and its
operational efficiency is low. Similarly, ENASA, the airport authority, has difficulties in
covering its operating costs, with large arrears on electricity. Overstaffing and other problems
led to a bloated cost structure in ENAPPORT, the seaport authority.
III. ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE REST OF 2008
9.
Against the backdrop of strong negative terms-of-trade shocks, the authorities
attach high priority to restoring financial stability. The Government and the central bank
of São Tomé and Príncipe are determined to make a concerted effort to strengthen
expenditure control and liquidity management prior to the Executive Board consideration of
the sixth review.
10.
For the rest of 2008, our macroeconomic framework aims to maintain real GDP
growth at 6 percent, reduce annual inflation to 13-15 percent by the end of the year,
and safeguard international reserves equivalent to 4 months of imports. We will make
every effort to speed up structural reforms, which are critically important for addressing our
economy’s supply constraints, restoring fiscal sustainability over the medium term, and
mobilizing support from the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral development
partners.
A.

Fiscal Policy

11.
The Government plans to further reduce the domestic primary deficit to
5.2 percent of GDP in 2008, from 8.1 percent in 2007. Fiscal consolidation in
the 2008 budget would come mainly from the expenditure side, because the revenue impact
of the envisaged direct tax reforms, which aim to reduce distortions, would be largely neutral
in 2008. The domestic primary deficit is expected to be financed by the use of IDA
Development Policy Operation (DPO) grant of US$4.5 million and a draw-down of up to
US$3 million from the National Oil Account (NOA). There should be no recourse to
domestic banking system credits (excluding the NOA).
12.
In the period immediately ahead, the Ministry of Planning and Finance will
significantly tighten expenditure control to prevent the recurrence of an expenditure
overrun. Specifically,
•
To put in place a functioning computerized public financial management system
(SAFINHO), the Ministry of Planning and Finance will establish a Directorate of Accounting
and an IT office by end-March 2007, in addition to procuring and installing IT equipment.
We intend to make progress in training users of the upgraded SAFINHO at the level of
spending entities in the following months.

41
•
Strict (quarterly) limits will be set on nonessential current spending, particularly on
goods and services and transfers not funded by donors.
•
Withdrawals from the National Oil Account will be in strict compliance with the
provisions of the ORML.
13.

Other expenditure measures planned for 2008 include:

•
Containing budgetary personnel costs. The full year impact of the 2007 general
wage increase will be felt in 2008. The Government will closely monitor all components of
the wage bill and strictly limit the payments of bonuses and benefits to ensure that the wagebill-to-GDP ratio declines from 8.9 percent in 2007 to 8.6 percent in 2008.
•
Public wage reform. As part of its civil service reform strategy to be supported by
the World Bank under the DPO, the Government plans to integrate fringe benefits into the
wage bill and adopt a revised salary structure, based on a comprehensive wage study, with
incentives for public servants, as a first step in its strategy. These reforms are critically
important for restoring fiscal sustainability and enhancing the growth orientation of the
budget.
•
Adjusting nonwage current spending. Transfers to the Joint Development
Authority (JDA) will need to be reassessed, taking into account budget constraints, oil
revenue prospects, and the execution of the JDA budget. Discretionary expenditures on
goods, services, and other items will have to be restrained to correspond with available
resources.
•
Assisting the most vulnerable segments of the population. We plan to achieve this
goal through better implementation of HIPC-related expenditure programs and a temporary,
targeted scheme for the most vulnerable groups. The latter scheme, to be financed by part of
the IDA DPO grant (US$0.5 million), will facilitate adjustment to higher import prices for
food and fuel. While aligning allocations with the PRSP priorities set out in the Priority
Action Plan for 2006–08, we will improve the monitoring of pro-poor spending.
•
Improving the execution of public investment projects. Increasing infrastructure
investment, especially in transportation and the electricity sector, will help address supply
bottlenecks and enhance growth potential. We will work closely with our external
development partners to accelerate implementation of foreign-funded projects, while
ensuring adequate resources for domestically funded investment projects.
14.

On the revenue side, the Government will focus on the following measures:

•
Timely adoption and implementation of the new direct taxation laws. The
Government has resubmitted the draft income tax law to the NA, aiming to obtain NA
approval of the tax reform package by the end of April 2008. The package of legislation

42
includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 45 to 25 percent, a move to a progressive
personal income tax from the current flat rate of 13 percent, and application of the urban tax
code. Timely implementation after NA approval would help broaden the tax base, reduce
distortions, and increase revenue buoyancy.
•
Strengthened tax and customs administration. With support from the
US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the tax authorities will step up efforts to audit
tax returns, keep track of large tax payers, and compile and collect tax arrears, particularly
from large tax payers. To facilitate tax arrear collections, the Government intends to set up
tribunals to settle tax disputes.
15.
To strengthen the monitoring and execution of the 2008 budget, the Government
will further improve the public financial management system. With assistance from
multilateral and bilateral donors, efforts will be made to put in place new modules to
implement the public accounting system, prepare regulations for the organic budget law
(SAFE law), and develop SAFINHO into a fully fledged eSAFE system incorporating all
public accounts, including patrimony and debt.
16.
Prudent use of donor budgetary support and the remaining oil bonuses is
essential for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the next several years. Total grants
from IDA under the DPO are expected at US$6 million. As no additional DPO grants are
envisaged in the next few years, the Government intends to save part of the grant
(US$1.5 million) for future use. In view of the rapidly declining NOA balance, high
uncertainty regarding additional oil signature bonuses in 2008, and further delays in oil
exploration drilling in Blocks 2 and 4, annual draw-down of the NOA will be strictly limited.
The Government is committed to adjusting the medium-term fiscal and financing strategies,
including the use of NOA resources if oil production and exports are seriously delayed
beyond the previous projection of 2014.
B.

MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES

17.
We recognize that to return inflation to a downward path, the BCSTP must step
up its effort to mop up excessive liquidity and significantly bring dobra base money
growth down. Weak financial intermediation and high currency substitution in our economy
severely limit the effectiveness of interest rates and other monetary policy instruments. We
therefore have to rely on fiscal restraint and foreign exchange sales to control liquidity. The
BCSTP will use foreign exchange auctions more actively, consistent with the program’s NIR
target, aiming to lower the 12-month growth rate of dobra base money from 50 percent in
December 2007 to 35 percent by the end of March 2008 and 25 percent by the end of June
2008. Our monetary program for the rest of 2008 aims to keep base money growth on a
declining trend, in order to achieve the program’s objective of reducing inflation.

43
18.
The BCSTP and the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Planning and
Finance intend to strengthen their cooperation to ensure that the BCSTP takes timely
action to sterilize budgetary use of oil bonuses, donor funds, and HIPC and MDRI
savings. Regular information-sharing among the Ministry of Planning and Finance and
BCSTP officials will include the Treasury’s cash outlays (in both domestic and foreign
currency), which are important for the BCSTP’s liquidity forecast and foreign exchange
market operations. To help liquidity forecast, the BCSTP will use the weekly average, rather
than the monthly average, in measuring commercial banks’ compliance with the minimum
reserve requirements. Because public expenditure is a major component of aggregate demand
that also affects domestic prices and the exchange rate, if meeting the program’s NIR target
is at risk, the Government will support monetary tightening by curtailing domestic primary
expenditures.
19.
The BCSTP is committed to deepening foreign exchange market reform. While
accepting the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement remains our goal, in the near term, the Government will focus on expediting
approval by the National Assembly of the new investment code, which contains provisions
aiming to remove the exchange restriction on transferring dividends abroad. To remove the
remaining multiple currency practices, the BCSTP will consider revising the mechanism for
setting the daily official exchange rate, based on a careful review of domestic market
conditions. The revised mechanism would ensure that the spread between the official and
commercial bank exchange rates will not exceed 2 percent. The BCSTP will continue
implementing the current policies of holding regular foreign exchange auctions and
progressively expanding the foreign exchange auction market to ensure a fuller and faster
market determination of the exchange rate.
20.
The BCSTP will continue with its communication strategy of informing the
market of its monetary and exchange policies. In addition to the BCSTP regular meetings
with the banking community and the media, data on monetary and macroeconomic
aggregates will be posted daily on the central bank’s website. The BCSTP will also post
yearly audited financial statements. Its budget execution and profit and loss accounts on a
cash basis will be reported at least quarterly, as part of the program’s monetary data.
C.

Structural Reforms

21.
Reducing the cost of investing and doing business in São Tomé and Príncipe is
crucial for developing our economy’s productive and export potential. The Government
intends to press ahead with the following reforms: (i) with external technical assistance,
complete the revision of the commercial codes; (ii) enact and implement the new investment
code and the revised labor code. The investment code would provide equal treatment to
foreign and domestic investors. Revisions to the labor code would aim to more clearly define
hiring and firing rules, remove ambiguities in contractual employment arrangements, and
increase labor market flexibility by eliminating regulatory impediments; and (iii) submit and

44
obtain NA approval of the draft legislation, prepared in consultation with the private sector,
to reduce red tape and other regulatory impediments to start a business.
22.
We will build on our recent progress to further enhance transparency and
accountability in managing current and prospective oil resources. The Minister of
Natural Resources and Environment issued an order in August 2007 verifying São Tomé and
Príncipe’s formal adherence to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). A
national coordinator for implementation of the EITI has also been appointed. More recently,
the International Board of the EITI has accepted São Tomé and Príncipe as a Candidate State
of the Initiative, in recognition of our serious commitment to transparently manage oil
revenues. To make further progress, we will adopt the Petroleum Sector Strategy and submit
to the NA the legal framework for the EEZ including the Framework Law On Oil-Related
Activities, the Taxation Law, and the Production-Sharing Contract Model. The National Oil
Agency will strive to conduct the licensing round for the EEZ transparently and consistent
with the ORML and the EITI.
23.
Regarding financial sector reform, our top priority is to obtain NA final
approval of the AML/CFT law. We are aware that the country would be negatively affected
if we do not catch up in this important area. We therefore will work closely with the NA to
expedite the legislative process. Once the NA gives final approval to the AML/CFT law, the
implementation regulations, which the BCSTP has already prepared, will be issued. In
addition, based on a review which has already been undertaken, the BCSTP intends to
strengthen the requirements for issuing bank licenses, including by raising the minimum
capital requirement. To reduce the risk of bank distress arising from non-performing loans,
the BCSTP, with IMF technical assistance, will further strengthen its capacity to enforce
banking supervision regulations through training, implementing the new chart of accounts
and quarterly financial reporting by banks, and setting up a central credit unit to facilitate
credit information sharing among banks.
24.
Pressing ahead with reforms in key sectors, such as agriculture, transportation,
and energy, is of fundamental importance if living standards are to improve on a
sustainable basis. We will continue working closely with the World Bank and other
development partners to promote agricultural marketing, commercial fishing, and tourismrelated services. We will also address EMAE’s financial and technical weaknesses through
tariff and other reforms, increase the productivity of ENAPORT through outsourcing (e.g.
cleaning, security guards), and attract investment to upgrade our infrastructure, including the
airport runway and seaport.
D.

Debt Management

25.
The Government is fully aware of the importance of ensuring debt sustainability
after HIPC and MDRI debt relief. We will refrain from new external borrowing,
particularly on commercial terms, and redouble our efforts to seek full delivery of HIPC debt

45
relief from the remaining official creditors. We have initiated discussions on debt
cancellation with Angola and Portugal and will try to conclude these agreements as soon as
possible. The Government will further improve debt management by utilizing the
Commonwealth Secretariat debt management system (CS-DRMS).
E.

Capacity Building

26.
São Tomé and Príncipe continues to need international support to build capacity
for policy monitoring and implementation. The World Bank is providing support for our
public financial management reform. A resident macroeconomic advisor, supported by
Portugal, is now working in the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Under the US MCC’s
Threshold program, technical advisors are assisting our tax and customs administration and
providing advice to help improve the business environment. We have benefited from IMF
technical assistance in central banking, public finances, and statistics and will strive to use
such assistance more effectively in the future. We welcome a mission from the IMF’s
Monetary and Capital Market Department to assess our technical assistance needs and a
mission from the Finance Department to conduct a safeguard assessment after the current
PRGF arrangement expires in August 2008.
27.
We will further improve our economic statistics. Within our very tight budget
constraints, we will provide support for a new household expenditure survey in order to
improve compilation of the consumer price index. Further progress will also be made to
improve budget classification and the consistency between monetary and fiscal data.
F.

Program Monitoring

28.
To facilitate expenditure control and liquidity management, indicative targets
for selected fiscal and monetary variables are set for end-March and end-June 2008
(Table I.1). These include indicative ceilings for primary nonwage current spending, 12month dobra base money growth, and net international reserves of the BCSTP. The nonaccumulation of external payment arrears (as defined in the attached Technical Memorandum
of Understanding) is a continuous performance criterion, as are the injunctions against
imposing or intensifying restrictions on current payments, introducing new or modifying
existing multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payments agreements that are
inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or imposing new or
intensifying existing import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. Two structural
benchmarks are added, one on the adoption of the 2008 budget, in line with the PRGFsupported program, and another on approval of the direct taxation reform package for endApril 2008 (see Table I.2).
29.
The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding sets out the modalities
of program monitoring. These include definitions of performance criteria and indicative
targets; application of adjustors for deviations from programmed amounts of oil signature

46
bonuses, budget support, and net external debt service payments; and data sources and
frequency of data reporting.
30.
We have recently provided the second Annual Progress Report on the PRSP to
the Fund and the World Bank. We welcome the positive assessment of the staff of the two
institutions conveyed by the mission and look forward to the Joint Staff Advisory Note.
Looking forward, we will enhance monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective and
successful implementation of the PRSP and update the PRSP when new information on oil
prospects, especially after further oil exploration drilling in the JDZ, becomes available.

TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) contains definitions and
adjuster mechanisms that are intended to clarify the measurement of variables in Table 1,
Quantitative Performance Criteria, PRGF Arrangement, 2006–07, which is attached to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. Unless otherwise specified, all
quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks will be evaluated in terms of cumulative
flows from end-September 2006.
I.

Provision of Data to the Fund

2.
Data with respect to all variables subject to performance criteria and indicative targets
will be provided to Fund staff monthly with a lag of no more than four weeks for data on the
net domestic assets and net international reserves of the Central Bank of São Tomé and
Príncipe (BCSTP) and eight weeks for other data. The authorities will transmit promptly to
Fund staff any data revisions. For variables that are relevant for assessing performance
against program objectives but are not specifically defined in this memorandum, the
authorities will consult with Fund staff as needed on the appropriate way of measuring and
reporting. Performance criteria included in the program, as defined below, refer to domestic
primary balance of the central government, net bank financing of the central government, net
domestic assets and net international reserves of the central bank, external payments arrears,
nonconcessional medium and long-term external debt, and short-term external debt.
II. Definitions
3.
Government is defined for the purposes of this TMU to comprise the central
government, which includes all governmental departments, offices, establishments, and other
bodies that are agencies or instruments of the central authority of São Tomé and Príncipe.
The central government does not include the operations of state-owned enterprises.
4.
Government domestic revenue (excluding oil revenue) comprises all tax and nontax
revenue of the government (in domestic and foreign currency), excluding foreign grants, the
receipts from the local sale of in-kind grants (e.g., crude oil received from Nigeria, food aid,
etc.), and any gross inflows to government on account of oil signature bonus receipts and
accrued interest in the National Oil Account (NOA). Revenue will be measured on a cash
basis as reported in the table of government financial operations prepared by the Directorate of
Budget and the Directorate of Treasury in the Ministry of Planning and Finance.
5.
Domestic primary expenditure comprises all government spending assessed on a
commitment basis (base compromisso), excluding (i) foreign-financed capital expenditure;
(ii) foreign-financed expenditure under the overseas scholarship program that is externally
financed; and (iii) scheduled interest payments. Reporting of government domestic

50

expenditure will be based on the state budget execution prepared every month by the
Directorate of Budget and the Directorate of Treasury in the Ministry of Planning and
Finance.
6.
Within domestic primary expenditure, propoor expenditure refers to government
outlays recorded in the budget nomenclature that have a direct effect on reducing poverty, as
agreed with the IMF and World Bank staffs. These expenditures, which include both current
and capital outlays, are defined as follows:
a.

The performance criterion on short-term external debt refers to the outstanding
stock of external debt with an original maturity of one year or less (including overdraft
positions) and owed or guaranteed by the government or the BCSTP. 10 At end-September
2006 the stock of short-term external debt stood at US$16.0 million.11
16.
The performance criterion on nonconcessional medium- and long-term external
debt refers to the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt with original maturity of more
than one year by the government or the BCSTP. 12 13 Debt rescheduling and restructuring are
10

The term “debt” is defined in accordance with point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000).

11

This amount includes three nonconcessional loans from Nigeria totaling US$15 million that were previously
classified under nonconcessional medium-term external debt. They were reclassified as short-term debt after a
joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis mission in April 2006.
12

This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received.

13

The concessionality of loans is assessed according to the reference interest rate by currency published by the
Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For
loans of terms of no less than 15 years, the 10-year average of commercial interest reference rates for the
currency in which the loan is denominated will be used. For loans of shorter terms, the six-month average will
apply. A loan is deemed to be on concessional terms if, on the date of initial disbursement, the ratio of the
present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the reference interest rate, to the nominal value of the loan is
less than 50 percent (in other words, a grant element of at least 50 percent). For currencies with no available
reference interest rates, the SDR rate will be used. This performance criterion does not apply to Fund resources.

54

excluded from the ceilings set on nonconcessional borrowing. Medium- and long-term debt
will be reported by the Debt Management Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and
(as appropriate) by the BCSTP, measured in US dollars at current exchange rates. The
government will consult with IMF staff before contracting obligations if it is uncertain as to
whether those obligations are within the performance criterion limits.
17.
The non-accumulation of new external payment arrears is a continuous
performance criterion. Government external payment arrears are defined as all unpaid
external public debt obligations, according to the data established by the Debt Management
Unit of the Ministry of Planning and Finance and (as appropriate) by the BCSTP, except for
arrears pending rescheduling arrangements. The latter will be considered technical arrears.
Debt would be deemed to be in arrears when it has not been paid by the time it is due, unless
arrears have been otherwise contractually defined. The performance criterion relating to
external arrears does not apply to those pending the signing of bilateral agreements in the
context of debt-rescheduling with the Paris Club and other bilateral creditors.
18.
Net external debt service payments are defined as debt service due less interim
HIPC debt relief (including multilateral and bilateral relief) and the accumulation of any new
external payment arrears, including technical arrears.
19.
Official external program support is defined as grants and loans, including in-kind
aid when the products are sold by the government and receipts are freely usable by the
budget, and other exceptional financing provided by foreign official entities and incorporated
into the budget. Amounts assumed in the program consistent with this definition are shown in
the memorandum item entitled “official external program support” of Table 1.
III. Use of Adjusters
20.
Deviations in receipts of oil signature bonuses, including accrued interest on
NOA, in official external program support, and in net external debt service payments,
from amounts projected for the program (see Table I.1) will trigger adjustments for net bank
financing of the central government, net domestic assets of the BCSTP, and net international
reserves, as indicated below. These deviations will be calculated cumulatively from endSeptember 2006 (see Table 1).
21.
Ceilings on net bank financing (NCG) of the central government and net
domestic assets (NDA) of the BCSTP: Monthly differences between actual and projected
receipts of oil signature bonuses, official external program support, and net external debt
service payments in foreign exchange will be converted to dobras at the program exchange
rate and aggregated from end-September 2006 to the test date. The ceilings will be adjusted
downward by the amount of accumulated domestic arrears. For 2007 the ceilings on NCG
and NDA will be adjusted downward or upward by cumulative deviations in the same
direction of actual from projected net payments in external debt service, and by deviations in

55

the opposite direction in external program support and oil bonuses, including accrued interest
on the NOA. The downward adjustment of higher than programmed external program
support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used to accommodate
higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million. For 2008, the ceilings will be
adjusted downward or upward by cumulative deviations in the same direction of actual from
projected net payments in external debt service, and by deviations in the opposite direction in
external program support and transfers from the NOA to the budget that exceed
US$3 million. The downward adjustment of higher than programmed external program
support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used to accommodate
higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million.
22.
Floor on net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP: The quarterly difference
between actual and projected receipts of oil signature bonuses, including accrued interest on
NOA; official external program support; and net external debt service payments will be
converted to dobras at the program exchange rate and aggregated from end-September 2006
to the test date. For 2007, the floor on NIR will be adjusted upward or downward by the
cumulative deviation in the opposite direction in external debt service (including repayments
to Nigeria), and by deviations in the same direction for oil bonuses, including accrued
interest on NOA. The upward adjustment of higher than programmed external program
support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used to accommodate
higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million. For 2008, the floor on NIR will
be adjusted upward or downward by the cumulative deviation in the opposite direction in
external debt service, and by deviations in the same direction for transfers from the NOA to
the budget that exceed US$3 million. The upward adjustment of higher than programmed
external program support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used
to accommodate higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million. In addition,
the NIR floor will be lowered by the amount that disbursements under the PRGF
arrangement are lower than expected.

São Tomé and Príncipe has a high risk of debt distress even after debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
Upgrading the country’s risk of debt distress classification in the future will hinge on the
beginning of oil production. The results suggest that the attainment of debt relief at the HIPC
completion point and MDRI debt relief brought about a substantial improvement in the
country’s debt outlook, though debt ratios will continue to be vulnerable to shocks until oil
production starts in 2014. 2 The debt outlook remains vulnerable even under the baseline
scenario, as indicated by a breach of debt thresholds prior to the production of oil. The risk of
debt distress increases significantly under a scenario with no oil production and no fiscal
adjustment. Reducing the risk of debt distress will therefore depend critically on maintaining
sound fiscal policy consistent with a prudent borrowing strategy for the medium and long
term as well as policies oriented to achieving broad-based long-run economic growth.
I. BACKGROUND
2.
The country reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
in March 2007 and benefited from HIPC/MDRI debt relief. The debt service-to-GDP
ratio was about 3.2 percent of GDP in 2006 and is expected to decline to 0.7 percent in
2008—a result of both enhanced HIPC and MDRI debt relief. Debt relief under the MDRI, in

in February 2007 (CR/07/173). This LIC DSA incorporates revised debt repayment and disbursement schedule,
macroeconomic projections and oil prospects.

2

São Tomé and Príncipe is currently classified as a “Weak Performer” in IDA’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index. Under the joint IDA/IMF debt sustainability framework the thresholds
are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and 15 percent
for the debt service-to-exports ratio.

59
particular, resulted in substantial debt service savings, reflecting the large share of debt to the
IDA, AfDF, and IMF in the country’s total debt before MDRI.
3.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium- and long-term external debt at the end of
2007 is estimated at US $150 million in nominal terms, corresponding to a NPV of debtto-export ratio of 119 percent. The share of multilateral debt is 24 percent, of which about
39 percent is owed to the IDA, African Development Bank, and IMF. The share of official
bilateral debt is about 76 percent, of which 31 percent is owed to Portugal. São Tomé and
Príncipe is current with its obligations to multilateral creditors and has cleared most of its
arrears with Paris Club creditors as part of a debt rescheduling agreement on Cologne terms
(September 2005). The authorities have signed bilateral agreements with all its Paris Club
creditors with the exception of Russia to implement the terms of the May 2007 Agreed
Minute. 3 They are also reconciling debt records with other non-Paris Club creditors. 4

II. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
4.
The macroeconomic framework underlying the long-term sustainability outlook
has been revised to take into account developments since the HIPC completion point. The
revisions include (i) a delay of the start of oil production by two years from 2012 to 2014,
reflecting the result of recent oil exploration, (ii) a reduction of oil production level to 42
percent of the previous assumption, (iii) an upward revision of GDP data series and a
downward revision of exports data series, 5 (iv) the inclusion of topping-up assistance into the
baseline scenario, and (v) a revision of debt services and disbursement schedule reflecting the
latest projections. The framework is in line with the government’s medium-term program,
which is supported by the PRGF arrangement (Box 1). São Tomé and Príncipe could start

São Tomé and Príncipe and Russia have been working since the HIPC completion point to conclude bilateral
agreement.

Since São Tomé and Príncipe is still in the process of signing bilateral agreement with Paris Club creditors, the
country has technical arrears to some of Paris Club creditors.
5 See IMF Country Report No. 07/267. Ratios in this document refer to new GDP and export data series.

60
producing oil in 2014 at the earliest. Development of the non-oil economy is expected mainly
in the service sector, principally banking and tourism, and secondly in fishery and agriculture.
5.
Other baseline assumptions are mostly unchanged compared to the one
performed at the time of the HIPC completion point (Box 1). The baseline scenario
assumes full delivery of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative (including topping up) and
MDRI. GDP growth is expected to accelerate over the medium term to 8 percent and then
slow gradually to 5 percent in the long term. Domestic investment would increase sharply in
the medium term, largely on account of oil sector investment initiatives. The rise in the
investment will require continuing reliance on foreign savings, although national savings are
forecast to increase on account of higher private savings once stability and economic growth
become firmly established.
6.
Inflation is expected to decline gradually to 6 percent by 2011 and over the long
term level off at 4 percent, reflecting a balanced budget and the central bank's
commitment to control inflation. On fiscal policy, oil revenues are assumed to accrue in the
National Oil Account (NOA) and be used to finance the government budget according to a
permanent income rule established by the Oil Management Revenue Law. The permanent
income generated by the NOA would cover all São Tomé and Príncipe's public budget needs
in the long term.
7.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain in deficit until 2016,
as a result of large imports related to the development of the oil sector and public
investment, and revert to a surplus in 2017–23, as a result of oil exports. In the long
term, the external current account is projected to have a small deficit, which is to be financed
by the permanent income generated by the NOA.
8.
Risks to the macro framework arise from a possible weakening of the fiscal
consolidation effort, potential shortfalls in foreign assistance triggered by the expected
oil boom, and lower or no oil production. All scenarios assume no domestic public debt
(no significant development of a domestic-based market for government debt is foreseen) and
most of the scenarios assume external borrowing on concessional terms. In particular, the
scenario of no oil production assumes no fiscal adjustment, as in DSA performed at the time
of the HIPC completion point. This scenario also assumes less concessional terms for
external borrowing, reflecting the worsening of the fiscal stance.
III. FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
9.
In the baseline scenario, São Tomé and Príncipe’s debt outlook shows a
significant improvement after HIPC/MDRI debt relief, but remains vulnerable until oil
production starts (Figure 1 and Table 1). Both the NPV of debt-to-GDP and NPV of debtto-revenue ratios remain low throughout the projection period. The debt service-to-revenue
ratio is projected to remain below 10 percent, declining further once oil production starts.

61
10.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the debt indicators are particularly
vulnerable to deterioration of the primary balance before oil production starts. Under
the most extreme stress test, which assumes that the primary balance is at historical average
minus one standard deviation, all debt indicators increase substantially above the baseline
scenario from 2009 (Figure 1 and Table 1).
11.
Under a scenario with no oil production and no fiscal adjustment, the public
debt dynamics become explosive in São Tomé and Príncipe (Figure 1 and Table 1). In this
scenario, all debt indicators are projected to increase rapidly. Both the NPV of debt-to-GDP
and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratios are projected to increase substantially throughout the
projection period, leading to an increasing debt service-to-revenue ratio.
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2008–26
•
Real non-oil GDP growth is expected to reach 8 percent by 2013 with investments in the
service sector and infrastructure in anticipation of the oil era and development of the tourism and
fishery sectors. After oil production starts to decline from 2018, non-oil GDP growth should slow
gradually to a sustainable 5 percent in the long term.
•
Oil production of one well is assumed to start in 2014. The country’s share in the oil
output of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ), 15,000 barrels a day, at an average price of
US$70 per barrel on average would yield US$380 million in annual exports for 20 years and
would require total investment by São Tomé and Príncipe of US$1.2 billion. Preliminary staff
estimates indicate that, on the assumption that only one of the six blocks auctioned in the JDZ
with Nigeria is found to be commercially exploitable, oil production would still have a sizeable
effect on São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic prospects.
•
Inflation is projected to fall gradually to 6 percent in 2011 and over the long term hold
steady at 4 percent, reflecting a smaller budget deficit and the central bank’s commitment to
control inflation.
•
Fiscal policy will be supportive of economic growth and poverty reduction. The domestic
primary balance is expected to continue recording deficits of around 3-4 percent of GDP through
2014, reflecting large social and infrastructure expenditures.
•
The current account deficit (including grants) is expected to average 35 percent of GDP
for 2008–14 because of large investment-related imports. Between 2017 and 2023, the current
account is projected to turn into a surplus as a result of oil exports. After 2024, it is expected to
return to a deficit, which would be financed by the permanent income from the NOA.
•

External borrowing on concessional terms is assumed to be about US$4 million a year,
mainly from the African Development Bank and IDA.

62
IV. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
12.
The baseline scenario shows unfavorable external debt dynamics before oil
production starts. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI allows the debt ratios to
improve substantially; however, some of the ratios exceed or rise close to the policydependent thresholds until oil production starts (Figure 2 and Table 2b). The NPV of debt-toGDP ratio is projected to remain below the 30 percent policy-dependent debt-burden
threshold throughout the projection period. However, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is
projected to exceed the policy-dependent threshold before oil production starts. Then it falls
sharply after 2014, when oil production starts. The debt service-to-exports ratio is also
projected to rise close to the policy-dependent threshold in 2012-14 before declining sharply
once oil production starts. 6
13.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the debt indicators are particularly
vulnerable to low export growth. In the most extreme stress test, which assumes that export
value grows at historical average minus one standard deviation, São Tomé and Príncipe’s
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to increase well above the policy-dependent
thresholds from 20010 to 2014, then fall sharply after oil production starts in 2014 (Figure 2).
14.
In a scenario with no oil production and no fiscal adjustment, external debt
vulnerability becomes acute in São Tomé and Príncipe (Figure 2). In this scenario, all
debt indicators are projected to increase rapidly. Both the NPV of debt-to-GDP and the NPV
of debt-to-exports ratios are projected to remain above the policy-dependent threshold,
leading to an ever increasing debt service-to-exports ratio in the absence of fiscal adjustment.
V. CONCLUSION
15.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s risk of debt distress is high even after debt relief under
the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Despite the significant reduction obtained under these two
Initiatives, São Tomé and Príncipe’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches its indicative
threshold prior to the production of oil. São Tomé and Príncipe’s external debt will remain
vulnerable to shocks to exports and foreign grants, at least until oil production starts in 2014.7
External debt vulnerability would be further exacerbated in the absence of sound
macroeconomic policies and undue delays in oil production. These risks underline the need
for prudent fiscal and debt management policies, continued reliance on concessional
financing, and implementation of structural reforms essential to support broad-based long
term economic growth.
6

The debt ratios of the LIC DSA may differ from the HIPC debt relief analysis as they use different
methodologies. The LIC uses the same-year exports, while HIPC DSA uses a three-year backward average.
The LIC DSA uses a fixed 5 percent discount rate, while the HIPC DSA uses currency-specific discount rates.
Finally, the LIC DSA debt service projections use WEO exchange rates, while the HIPC DSA uses fixed
exchange rates (end-2005).

IX. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of Sao Tome and Principe
(BCSTP) was subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement
approved on August 1, 2005. The assessment, which was completed on August 2, 2004,
found vulnerabilities in the area of financial reporting, internal audit and internal control.
Measures to strengthen the control framework and help safeguard Fund resources were
proposed. Some recommendations have been implemented, including contracting annual
external audits, endorsing plans to modernize the BCSTP's internal audit function, and
adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the bank's accounting
framework. Progress in the implementation of IFRS has been slow.
X. Exchange Arrangements:
The IMF classifies São Tomé and Príncipe’s exchange rate regime as managed floating with
no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. The official exchange rate is determined daily
as the sum of 40 percent of previous day’s selling rate quoted by commercial banks and 60
percent of previous day’s central bank selling rate. São Tomé and Príncipe’s exchange rate
system has been liberalized in recent years and a number of exchange restrictions/multiple
currency practices have been eliminated. In particular, current data indicate that there is no
earmarking in foreign exchange to specific importers and a multiple currency practice
resulting from the central bank’s auction system has been eliminated with the move to a
single price auction.
Two measures subject to Fund approval remain: (i) a multiple currency practice and
exchange restriction arise from the existence of multiple exchange markets with multiple
effective exchange rates for spot transactions with no mechanism to ensure that the spreads
among rates for spot transactions in these markets do not diverge by more than 2 percent at
any given time; and (ii) an exchange restriction arises from Article 23(b) of the Investment
Code which limits the amount of investment income that can be transferred abroad by nonresidents.
Under the PRGF-supported program, the BCSTP intends to revise, based on a careful review
of the domestic market conditions in 2008, the mechanism for setting the daily official
exchange rate and to establish a mechanism to keep the spread between the central bank rate
and commercial bank exchange rate within 2 percentage points. The government is also
committed to expedite the approval by the National Assembly of the new Investment Code
which contains provisions aiming to eliminate the restrictions on transfers of dividends. The
intervention currency for the dobra is the U.S. dollar. The official selling exchange rate was
Db. 14,882 per U.S. dollar on April 30, 2008.

APPENDIX III—RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of April 21, 2008)
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe became a member of the African Development Bank Group
in 1976. To date, the Bank Group has financed 25 operations in the country. The net
commitments amount to UA 90.4 million, 1 comprising UA 89.4 million of African
Development Fund (ADF) 2 and Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) resources and
UA 1.00 million of Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF) resources. The sectors benefiting from AfDB
Group financing are agriculture (26 percent), transport (25 percent), multi-sector 3
(21 percent), social sector (17 percent), and public utilities (11 percent). These operations
have helped build and rehabilitate basic economic and social infrastructure (roads, airport,
electricity, water, schools, and health centers) and have strengthened São Tomé and
Príncipe’s economic and institutional capacities. The AfDB has had a national program
office since 1999.
2.
The AfDB has two ongoing projects in human resource development and agriculture
(the second phase of the livestock development project). These projects, in accordance with
the PRSP, focus on the main factors affecting poverty. The disbursement rate was
35.20 percent as of August 2007. The two projects have started recently (2005 and 2006).
The second phase of the livestock development project was approved in May 2006 and
signed in July 2006. The human resource development project was signed in June 2003 and
began in March 2005. This project tackles cross-sectoral capacity-building by providing for
training in literacy, information, and community organization, as well as specialized
vocational training adapted to specific demands, particularly in the oil and tourist sectors.
3.
The AfDB Group assistance strategy for 2005–09 (Country Strategy Paper 2005–09)
rests on two pillars: poverty reduction in rural area and promotion of governance in public
finance management. The country allocation on ADF-X resources (2005–07) is UA
5.15 million in the form of grants. The first pillar will help promote and diversify the
country’s economic base, especially the agricultural and rural sector, and reinforce operations
in the social sectors. Under this pillar, the livestock development support project-phase II
(UA 4 millions) was approved in May 2006. The second pillar will support macroeconomic
reforms and governance, through an institutional support project on governance and a
technical assistance on the PRSP process, which will help improve public finance
management and institutional capacity building to prepare the country for the forthcoming oil
era. Given the considerable needs for institutional capacity building, the AfDB will finance

strategic economic and sector studies, such as the Country Governance Profile; the joint
study with the World Bank on the integrated fiduciary assessment (PER/CFAA/CPAR); the
transport sector study; and the insular costs study. Furthermore, the AfDB will finance
regional capacity building initiatives, within CEMAC, ECCAS, the African Portuguesespeaking countries and the small insular countries.
4.
In addition, the AfDB will continue to provide the country with financial assistance
through the enhanced HIPC initiative. In April 2001 the AfDB approved debt relief of
US$34.35 million in end 1999 NPV terms. In light of the delay in the HIPC process, the
AfDB extended its interim debt relief period until the country reaches the completion point in
May 2007 with an additional assistance (topping up) of US$ 9.08 million in end-2005 NPV
terms.

APPENDIX IV—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Introduction
1.
Although economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, serious financial,
human, and technological resource constraints have slowed down efforts to strengthen the
statistical system.
2.
The country has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since April 20, 2004. The metadata and plans for improvement have not been
updated since the original metadata were posted on the DSBB. Over the period 2003–06, the
country has benefited from technical assistance from STA and other providers, largely under
the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa.
National accounts
3.
Statistics on GDP/GNP are compiled on a yearly basis and provided at the time of the
Article IV consultation. STA provided technical assistance in national accounts to the
National Statistics Institute in February and March 2005 and in January 2006 in the context
of a GDDS project for Lusophone countries. Low response rates and/or insufficient rigor of
the responses to the business surveys, including those from important enterprises, continue to
affect the quality of the business data compiled.
4.
A new GDP series for the period 2001-2006 with base year 2001 became available in
early-2007. The new estimates cover: (i) GDP by production approach at current and
constant prices; and (ii) cross-classification tables by industry sectors. The revised series
reflect more accurately recent economic developments. Based on the most recent population
census, corporation census, and living conditions survey, higher weights are now attributed
to the sectors that experienced faster growth, such as trade, transportation and
communication, and services. Despite the considerable upward revision in GDP, São Tomé
and Príncipe remains a low income country, with GDP per capita amounting to about $771 in
2006, compared to $497 before this revision. While the revision of the GDP series is a
significant improvement, a number of shortcomings remain. Further improvements would
require input from a new household expenditure survey (rather than living conditions
survey), using producer prices, and better estimates for agricultural production.
Consumer prices
5.
Since 1997 the CPI weights have been based on a three-month household survey
conducted in 1995. An updated and more comprehensive household expenditure survey is
needed. Current price surveys only cover the capital, although there are plans to implement
regional surveys.

80
Government finance statistics
6.
Detailed revenue and expenditure data are compiled and reported to AFR. The main
areas that need to be strengthened at the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) are (i)
monitoring of expenditures on projects financed by donors; and (ii) financing operations. All
project loans financed by donors are programmed in the budget, but some are executed
independently. The government has requested development partners to help in recording all
external financing in the budget. The recording of financing operations and stocks is
expected to improve since the debt data management capacity is expected to be strengthened.
7.
An October 2004 government finance statistics (GFS) mission helped the MPF to
compile and disseminate GFS for the general government in accordance with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The mission prepared bridge
tables between national budget classification and GFSM 2001 classifications to be used to
compile GFS for reporting to STA and AFR, as well as in MOF policy work. Given the
importance of oil-related revenues, the mission also reviewed the classification of oil
revenues under the Oil Revenue Management Law and made recommendations on
classification of such transactions. A September 2007 follow-up mission found some
progress with regard to the recommendations made by the 2004 mission. In particular, in
January 2007 a new budget law was approved that significantly improved national budget
classifications. Notwithstanding these efforts, faster statistical progress is hampered by an
inadequate accounting system.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
STA missions provided technical assistance on monetary statistics in December 2004,
April/May 2006, and June 2007. As a result, the accuracy and timeliness of the monetary
data reported in the standardized report forms (SRF) for the central bank and the other
depository corporations data have improved. However, the lags with which the Central Bank
of São Tomé and Principe (BCSTP) reports monetary data based on the old reporting forms
have increased again in recent months.
9.
The missions found that the BCSTP monthly trial balance sheets were broadly
adequate to compile monetary statistics in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM). However, the plan of accounts of the other depository corporations is not
adequate to derive monetary statistics consistent with the MFSM, particularly with regard to
the sectorization of institutional units.
10.
The June 2007 follow-up mission assisted in implementing the SRFs for reporting
monetary and financial statistics to the Fund. The mission assisted in finalizing the SRFs
beginning with March 2006 and December 2006 data for the BCSTP and Other Depository
Corporations respectively. It also provided on-the-job-training to compilers. For the
integrated monetary database that will meet the data needs of STA, AFR, and BCSTP to be
finalized, STA needs to reconstruct the historical data starting from December 2001.

81
External sector statistics
11.
There are significant weaknesses in the collection of source data related to
merchandise trade. Some transactions, including certain imports related to investment, are
not fully captured in the balance of payments (BOP). Monthly data on the main exports and
imports are reported to AFR regularly but with some lags in recent months, and unit prices
and volumes of exports are only occasionally included.
12.
The GDDS Lusophone project has targeted a substantial improvement in the source
data, including the response rate to the surveys, and in the methodology for compiling the
BOP in line with the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. A June 2003 mission
reviewed the shortcomings of reported current and financial account transactions and
concluded that weaknesses were mainly due to under coverage, including of foreign direct
investment and commercial bank reports on international transactions.
13.
A June 2004 mission found that despite efforts to implement the previous
recommendations, several measures, in particular those related to improving source data
were at best partially implemented. As a result, inconsistencies in the classification of BOP
operations persisted and certain components continued to be largely estimated. Resource
constraints, particularly with regard to qualified staff, contribute to the lack of improvement
in the response rate to surveys. The mission recommended improving coordination and data
sharing among data-producing agencies, intensifying contacts with survey respondents, and
using alternative sources to improve source data. A March 2007 mission found that little
progress had been achieved in implementing recommendations of previous missions,
primarily due to resource constraints in the BCSTP. The mission assisted the authorities in
reconciling balance of payments data and outlined a set of recommendations and detailed
work plan to improve compilation capacity.
14.
In 2007, the central bank reported balance of payments data to STA for the years
2001-2003.
15.
The authorities have built on previous efforts to strengthen debt data management,
and a unit was created in late 2003 within the MOF. The authorities are reconciling debt
records with creditors and the Commonwealth Secretariat debt recording and management
system is being operationalized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 24, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe
On June 18, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. 1
Background
São Tomé and Príncipe is a small, open, low-income economy with a very narrow production
and export base. The country’s main export commodity is cocoa but the once-dominant
agriculture sector has declined over the last three decades. Tourism is relatively small and
brings in little net foreign exchange because it relies heavily on imported goods and services. In
recent years, public finances have been supported by large oil signature bonuses, but
exploratory drilling for oil has not yet confirmed the existence of commercially extractable
reserves.
The authorities have embarked on economic adjustment and reform supported by the Fund’s
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility since August 2005. Growth has been robust and
progress has been made in reducing fiscal imbalances and the pubic debt burden. São Tomé
and Príncipe reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2007
and has benefited from debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
In 2007 real GDP grew at an estimated 6 percent, led by activities in construction and services,
financed by an inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI). However, spillover from these projects
to local employment and income is still limited because of the high import content of these
projects. Annual inflation rose from 14 percent in mid-2007 to 28 percent by the end of the year,
reflecting surging food and oil prices, as well as a budgetary expenditure overrun, which put
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

84
pressure on base money growth and currency depreciation. The domestic primary deficit was
larger than programmed in 2007, despite higher revenue. This was due to a large increase in
current spending, partly to cover the rising utility costs of households. Implementation of
monetary policy was complicated by volatile capital inflows and did not adequately control
growth of base money. The central bank’s sterilization of budgetary use of oil bonuses fell short
of what was needed to mop up excess liquidity.
Against the backdrop of rising food and fuel prices, the authorities are taking steps to strengthen
policy implementation and restore financial stability. The National Assembly recently approved
the 2008 budget, which envisages a reduction in the domestic primary fiscal deficit, while
providing funding to mitigate the impact of the high prices for food and fuel on the poor. A more
active monetary policy slowed base money growth and currency depreciation in the first quarter
of 2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that São Tomé and Príncipe’s growth performance under the PRGF-supported
program has been robust and progress has been made in reducing fiscal imbalances and the
public debt burden. However, these favorable developments have been accompanied by
accelerating inflation. While surging international prices of food and fuels have contributed to
recent higher inflation, public expenditure overruns and weak control of base money growth
have also played a role in increasing the pressures on prices and currency depreciation.
Against this background, Directors noted that the main challenges facing the authorities over
the medium term are to maintain fiscal sustainability and to develop the economy’s production
and export base through a deepening of structural reforms. These policies would be particularly
important in view of the still unclear prospects for oil revenue and the economy’s continuing
vulnerability to external shocks.
Directors underscored the need to continue fiscal adjustment and strengthen expenditure
control so as to lower inflation and restore financial stability. They supported the authorities’
2008 fiscal program that aims to reduce the domestic primary deficit relative to GDP, introduce
direct taxation reform, and provide additional fiscal space to mitigate the impact of rising food
and fuel prices on the poor. Directors encouraged the authorities to avoid generalized price
subsidies and instead implement targeted assistance to the most vulnerable segments of the
population.
Directors supported the efforts of the central bank to improve liquidity management. More active
use of foreign exchange auctions to sterilize promptly the budgetary use of oil bonuses and
donor funding would help slow base money growth. Directors also emphasized the critical role
of fiscal policy in supporting monetary tightening and helping safeguard international reserves.
Directors agreed that maintaining fiscal sustainability in the medium-term will call for enhancing
the growth orientation of the budget and bringing recurrent spending— particularly on personnel
costs—in line with domestic revenue and available foreign budgetary support. Moreover, to
maintain debt sustainability, Directors emphasized the importance of continued efforts by the

85
authorities to strengthen debt management and rely on non-debt-creating inflows and other
concessional external financing.
Directors emphasized the need for accelerated structural reform in order to achieve sustained
private sector-led growth. In particular, they called on the authorities to significantly improve the
investment climate by reducing regulatory impediments to investing and doing business in São
Tomé and Príncipe, upgrading infrastructure, and attracting private investment to key economic
sectors, especially agriculture. Directors welcomed the progress that the authorities have made
in putting in place the legal framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism. Advancing financial sector reform will be crucial to support private sector
development. Directors also encouraged the authorities to build on the progress under the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which would further improve the management of
oil-related resources.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate in real effective terms does not
show a significant misalignment from its equilibrium level. They underscored the importance of
deepening foreign exchange market reform. Pressing ahead with measures designed to remove
all remaining exchange restrictions would improve the functioning of the foreign exchange
market and enable the authorities to accept the obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to reconsider São Tomé
and Príncipe’s monetary and exchange arrangements, and noted some possible benefits and
limitations of alternative exchange rate regimes. They emphasized, however, that fiscal
discipline and prudent debt management are the main prerequisites for any sustainable
exchange rate regime.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431, USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth Review under PRGF Arrangement for São Tomé and
Príncipe’s and Approves US$680,000 Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the sixth review of the
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe's economic performance under a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review allows for a
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 423,000 (about US$680,000), which would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 2.96 million (about US$4.77 million).
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on August 1, 2005 (see Press Release No.
05/187), for a total amount of SDR 2.96 million (about US$4.77 million) to support the government's
economic program for 2005-2008.
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved waivers of the nonobservance of the
quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2007 related to the domestic primary fiscal
deficit and net credit to the government, and a structural performance criterion for end-December
2007 related to public financial management, based on the authorities’ policy commitments and
remedial actions.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, stated:
“São Tomé and Príncipe’s growth performance under the PRGF-supported program has been robust
and progress has been made in reducing fiscal imbalances and the public debt burden. However,
these favorable developments have been accompanied by accelerating inflation. An expenditure
overrun and the lack of effective control of base money have added to the pressures on inflation and
depreciation of the currency.

89

“The authorities are committed to strengthening fiscal discipline and liquidity management to lower
inflation and restore financial stability. Their 2008 fiscal program is designed to reduce the domestic
primary deficit, introduce direct taxation reform, and provide resources to mitigate the impact of high
food and fuel prices on the poor. In addition to fiscal adjustment, the authorities need to implement a
proactive monetary policy in order to effectively curb liquidity growth. It is important that the
authorities support a tight monetary policy with fiscal restraint, if necessary by further reducing
nonessential domestic primary spending to safeguard the program’s international reserve targets.
“Over the medium term, the authorities face the challenge of maintaining fiscal and debt
sustainability. With uncertain oil prospects, the authorities will need to continue fiscal consolidation
beyond 2008, strengthen debt management, and rely on non-debt-creating inflows and other
concessional external financing.
“Furthermore, it is crucial that the authorities accelerate structural reforms in order to develop the
economy’s production and export base and reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. In particular,
advancing financial sector reform and improving the investment climate should be given high
priority.
“The authorities are committed to deepening foreign exchange market reform. They intend to make
efforts to eliminate all remaining restrictions, with the aim of accepting the obligations under Article
VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement,” Mr. Portugal said.

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an annual
interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal
payments.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Democratic Republic of
São Tomé and Príncipe
June 18, 2008

On behalf of my São Tomé and Príncipe authorities, I would like to thank the Board,
Management and Staff for their continued support and useful advice to São Tomé and
Príncipe. My authorities are grateful to the international community for their continued
assistance to São Tomé and Príncipe.
I. Recent Developments
As expected at the time of the fifth review, economic activity has been robust in 2007,
with a real GDP growth estimated at 6 percent, mainly driven by tourism-related
construction, communication, and other services. Cocoa exports, the main exports,
increased owing to both higher international prices and increased export volume.
After declining to 14 percent in June 2007, inflation reaccelerated in the second half of
the year to reach 27.6 percent at end-December 2007 and 34 percent in March 2008, due
to a combination of factors including higher fuel and food prices, depreciation of the
dobra, and higher-than-programmed liquidity growth.
In the fiscal sector, higher income tax receipts and increased tax arrears collection
boosted revenue performance over the program objective by 1.2 percent of GDP.
Expenditures also increased higher than programmed on account of higher utilities,
transfers and medical expenses. A significant part of utility payments to EMAE, the stateowned electricity and water company, was to mitigate the impact of the sharp utility tariff
hike (40-60 percent) on the population. It is also worth noting that in light of continued
increase in international fuel prices, the prices of domestic petroleum products were also
increased by 14-25 percent in order to reduce implicit subsidies. In addition, capital
expenditure has been cut in order to accommodate the increase in other expenditure
items. Despite the mitigating measures taken, the net effect has been a higher-thanprogrammed domestic primary deficit, which has been financed by drawdown of
government deposits.
The authorities made further progress toward a fully integrated computerized public
financial management system (eSAFE) by issuing an administrative decree establishing
an IT office and a Directorate of Accounting, and issuing a tender for the procurement of
IT equipment for upgrading SAFINHO. They submitted to the Parliament a direct
taxation reform that will help broaden the tax base, reduce distortions and increase
revenue buoyancy over time. To ensure that revenue collections are improved, the

91

authorities have intensified their effort to strengthen tax and customs administration, with
notably the assistance of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The budget
for 2008, which is consistent with the program and the Poverty Reduction Strategy, has
been approved in May 2008.
In the monetary sector, base money grew much faster than programmed and net
international reserves exceeded the program target by a large margin, as result of a partial
sterilization of budgetary use of oil bonuses and donor grants, in a context of marketdetermined exchange rate. In light of the inflation developments, the central bank
(BCSTP) has increased its use of foreign exchange sales since March 2008 to mop up
excess liquidity. Since then, base money growth decreased from 50 percent in December
2007 to 27 percent in March 2008. On the financial sector reform, the central bank
(BCSTP) issued the new regulations on capital adequacy, internal control and auditing,
bank financial reporting, and credit to employees. In April 2008, the National Assembly
(NA) gave its final approval to the anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) law, paving the
way for an operational AML/CFT regime in Sao Tome and Principe.
On structural reforms, the government has prepared and submitted to the National
Assembly numerous legislations aimed at reducing the cost of investing and doing
business in Sao Tome and Principe, and is awaiting their approval by Parliament. These
legislations include a new investment code that will provide equal treatment to foreign
and domestic investors, a revised labor code that will increase labor flexibility, and a
draft legislation, prepared in consultation with the private sector, to reduce impediments
to start a business.
Progress has also been made in the implementation of the institutional framework of the
oil sector. To lay ground for launching licensing for the Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ), the National Oil Agency (NOA) prepared a Petroleum Sector Strategy and related
laws –the framework law on oil-related activities, the taxation law, and the production
sharing contract model– and submitted them to the National Assembly for approval.
II. Economic Policies for the Rest of 2008
My authorities remain committed to strengthening policy implementation, particularly in
containing domestic primary expenditure and in curtailing liquidity growth in order to
bring inflation to a downward path. In this regard, policies for the rest of this year will
ensure sound management of oil-related and debt relief resources, and lay the
groundwork for sustained private sector-led growth. The objectives of the program are to
maintain real GDP growth at 6 percent, reduce annual inflation from its current level 34
percent to 13-15 percent by the end of the year, and safeguard international reserves
equivalent to 4 months of imports.

92

Fiscal policy
In the fiscal sector, the objective is to reduce further the domestic primary deficit to 5.2
percent of GDP in 2008, through fiscal consolidation. Specifically, expenditures will be
contained through (i) strict quarterly limits on nonessential current spending, particularly
on goods and services, (ii) strict controls of personnel cost to ensure that the wage bill-toGDP ratio does not increase, and (iii) a reassessment of transfer to the Joint Development
Authority (JDA), taking into account budget constraints, oil revenue prospects, and the
execution of the JDA budget. My authorities intend to assist the most vulnerable
segments of the population through better implementation of HIPC-related expenditure
program and a temporary, targeted scheme that will facilitate adjustment to higher import
prices for food and fuel. They will continue to improve the execution of public
investments projects. In particular, they work closely with external development partners
to accelerate implementation of foreign-funded projects, while ensuring adequate
resources for domestically-funded investment projects. The projected deficit will be
financed in part by the use of IDA’s Development Policy Operation (DPO) grant of
US$4.5 million and by statutory drawings from the NOA.
Fiscal reforms will essentially continue to focus on strengthening tax and customs
management and public expenditure management. In particular, a comprehensive wage
study will be undertaken as part of the DPO-supported program with a view to revising
the salary structure with improved incentives for civil servants, and thereby avoiding the
recourse to ad hoc increases in wages. In order to strengthen the monitoring and
execution of the 2008 budget, including the use of debt relief resources, my authorities
will continue to upgrade SAFINHO and turn it into a fully fledged eSAFE system
incorporating all public accounts, with the assistance from multilateral and bilateral
donors.
My authorities are cognizant of the uncertainty regarding future receipts of oil bonuses.
Accordingly, they will continue to make good use of donor budgetary assistance and the
remaining oil bonuses to maintain fiscal sustainability in the next several years. They
stand ready to revise their fiscal program, if the prospects in the oil sector do not
materialize as expected.
Monetary, exchange rate and financial policies
The central bank will pursue a tighter monetary policy to complement fiscal
consolidation efforts in order to achieve the inflation objective for 2008. The monetary
program aims to keep the base money growth on a declining trend. To this end, given the
limited effectiveness of interest rates and other monetary policy instruments, the central
bank will continue to use foreign exchange sales to mop up liquidity, consistent with the
NIR objective. The central bank and the treasury department of the ministry of planning

93

and finance will strengthen their cooperation, through regular information-sharing, to
ensure that the BCSTP takes timely action to sterilize budgetary use of oil bonuses, donor
funds and HIPC and MDRI savings. To help the liquidity forecast, the BCSTP will use
the weekly average, rather than the monthly average, in measuring commercial banks’
compliance with the minimum reserve requirements.
The central bank is committed to deepening foreign exchange market reform and
complying with obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement. In this regard, the new investment code, which foresees, among
others, the elimination of exchange restriction on transfer abroad of dividends is yet to be
approved by the National Assembly. To remove the remaining multiple currency
practices, the BCSTP will consider revising the mechanism for setting the daily official
exchange rate, which will ensure that the spread between the official and commercial
exchange rates will not exceed 2 percent. The BCSTP will continue implementing the
current policies of holding regular foreign exchange auctions and progressively
expanding the foreign exchange auction market to ensure a fuller and faster market
determination of the exchange rate.
The central bank intends to continue with its communication strategy of informing the
market of its monetary and exchange policies through regular meetings with the banking
community and the media, and the posting of various monetary data and financial
statements on the central bank’s website.
Regarding the financial sector reform, the BCSTP intends to further strengthen the
requirements for issuing bank licenses, including by raising the minimum capital
requirement. The central bank also intends to enhance its banking supervision. In this
regard, with IMF technical assistance, it will further strengthen its capacity to enforce
banking supervision regulations through training, implementing the new charts of
accounts and quarterly financial reporting by banks and setting up a central credit unit to
facilitate information sharing among banks.
Other issues
My authorities remain determined to enhance the investment climate through regulatory
reform and upgrading infrastructure. They are hopeful that the completion of
abovementioned reforms in the fiscal, monetary and financial sectors and the approval of
business-related legislations will significantly improve the business climate and will
contribute to the development of the private sector. They will work closely with donors to
press ahead with reforms in key areas such agriculture, transportation and energy. They
will also proceed with the reform of public enterprises to improve their financial
situation.

As regards debt management, my authorities will continue to ensure debt sustainability
after HIPC and MDRI debt relief by refraining from new external borrowing, particularly
on commercial terms, and redouble their efforts to seek full delivery of HIPC debt relief
from the remaining official creditors.
III. Conclusion
Overall, performance under the program in 2007 has been broadly satisfactory, despite
that two quantitative performance criteria at end-December 2007 on the fiscal primary
balance and net credit to the government have not been observed and the structural
performance criterion on public financial management reform was met with delay. In
light of the remedial actions taken and the policy commitments for the remainder of the
program, my authorities are requesting Board approval for the requested waivers and the
completion of the sixth and final review of the PRGF-supported program.
