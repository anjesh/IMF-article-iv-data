REPUBLIC OF CONGO
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation and
a New Staff-Monitored Program
Prepared by the African Department and Policy Development and Review Departments
(In consultation with the External Relations, Finance, Fiscal Affairs, Legal, Monetary and
Financial Systems, and Statistics Departments)
Approved by Menachem Katz and Anthony Boote
May 12, 2004
• The discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo
(hereafter “the Congo”) were initiated in Brazzaville during February 5-20, 2004 and
completed at headquarters during March 1–5, 2004. The letter of intent (LOI) dated
March 31, 2004 outlines the government’s policies during January–June 2004 under the 2004
staff-monitored program (SMP).
• The staff team consisted of Messrs. Ghura (Head), Karangwa, Leite, Ms. Linares
(Administrative Assistant) (all AFR), Mr. Op de Beke (PDR), and Mr. Moussa (FAD). Staff
members from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank participated in
the discussions.
• The mission met with President Sassou-Nguesso; the presidents of the national assembly
and the senate; Mr. Andély, Minister of Economy, Finance, and Budget; Mr. Moussa,
Minister of Planning; Mr. Dzon, National Director of the Bank of Central African States
(BEAC); other senior officials; and representatives of civil society and the donor community.
• At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation on June 13, 2003 (Country report
No. 03/193), Directors noted that performance in 2002 was disappointing, despite favorable
oil prices, and expressed concern about the deterioration of the fiscal position. However, they
welcomed the new government’s focus on reestablishing fiscal discipline and were
encouraged by the improved performance during October 2002–March 2003. As for the
length of the performance track record needed for consideration of an arrangement supported
by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), Directors favored a 12-month period
under an SMP ending in September 2003.
• The Congo is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and together with other
members of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Congo’s relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•
The gradual reestablishment of political stability and democratic institutions
over the past four years has generated a sense of guarded optimism that the Congo is on
the cusp of a structural break from the previous pattern of intermittent outbreaks of civil
conflict. Over the past year, security improvements have been consolidated by the launch of
the demobilization program for former combatants, and further progress has been registered
with respect to the reestablishment of democratic institutions.
•
The onset of peace in 1999–2000 has boosted the pace of economic activity in the
non-oil sector. Consumer price inflation has abated in the post-conflict period, partly due to
a more reliable supply from Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville. In an encouraging sign of a pickup
in non-oil sector activity, credit to the economy grew in 2003 at a faster rate than non-oil
GDP for the first time in three years. Nonetheless, key social indicators have continued to
deteriorate, and the external debt burden is heavy.
•
The completion of the transition period to a democratic state and the gradual
return to peace, thus far, has not been accompanied by the strict implementation of
economic programs. Since 2000, one post-conflict emergency assistance and three
subsequent staff-monitored programs(SMP) have not led to a medium-term program
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
•
Performance under the 2003 SMP, covering the period January–September, was
weak. While overall fiscal performance improved in 2003, key budget targets, including on
non-oil revenue and expenditures, were missed. Continued weaknesses in treasury
management necessitated the deferment of oil-collateralized debt to 2004. Although some
key structural measures were not implemented, an effort to improve transparency in the oil
sector was launched under the SMP and reinforced in the fourth quarter.
Article IV consultation issues
•
The discussions focused on the following key medium-term issues: (i) improving
governance and transparency, starting with the oil sector; (ii) ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability; (iii) strengthening public expenditure management and institutional capacity;
and (iv) creating favorable conditions for private sector expansion and poverty reduction.
•
The key policy challenges will be to enhance fiscal discipline while facing pressures
for “peace dividends,” implement oil sector reform measures that may run counter to vested
interests, and improve the statistical infrastructure in the face of significant institutional
capacity constraints.
•
The authorities intend to establish the necessary track record to move to a
possible PRGF-supported program by satisfactory implementation of an SMP during

-5-

January–June 2004. The key objectives are to strengthen the framework for fiscal discipline
and enhance oil sector transparency.
Issues stressed in the staff appraisal
•
The staff is encouraged by the recent progress on the security and political
fronts. Accompanying this positive momentum, the staff welcomes the pickup in economic
activity in the non-oil sector and deceleration of inflation. Nonetheless, the implementation
of the 2003 SMP was weak and did not allow the Congo to move to a medium-term program
supported by the international community.
•
The staff regrets the opportunity missed in 2003 by not using additional oil
revenues to clear a significant amount of external arrears. The staff urges the authorities
to use future additional oil revenues in accordance with stated program objectives and
priorities.
•
The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ renewed determination to strengthen
the framework for moving to a medium-term program for growth and poverty reduction
that can be supported by the international community. The program for 2004 appropriately
addresses the most pressing issues facing the Congo, and the authorities are encouraged to
diligently implement the proposed measures.
•
The implementation of the SMP would be a necessary, but not sufficient,
condition for moving to a PRGF-supported program. The Congo would also need
exceptionally favorable treatment on arrears to official bilateral and commercial creditors on
post-cutoff-date debt and to multilateral creditors. To improve the credibility of the
government’s strategy, the staff urges the authorities to take decisive steps in improving
transparency and accountability in the oil sector, and in mobilizing maximum domestic
resources and utilizing them judiciously.
•
The Congo is faced with daunting challenges in moving onto a sustainable path
of economic development. Increased focus on oil sector transparency and governance
should be a key aspect of a strategy to lower the probability of future conflicts and to
strengthen the decision-making process. Another key challenge is to improve the business
climate by, inter alia, enhancing the overall governance framework and effectively
combating corruption, and improving the efficiency in the delivery of public utility services.
•
Timely provision of reliable economic and financial data is essential for effective
macroeconomic management and Fund surveillance. The provision of comprehensive
information, including on oil-related activities, will help to convince development partners
that domestic resources are being fully mobilized and will lend credibility to the ongoing
reform efforts.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Congo is emerging from
three intense civil conflicts in the
1990s. Once classified as a lowermiddle-income economy, the Congo
has experienced a continuous decline
in per capita income over the past
15 years or so (see accompanying
figure). This negative trend coincided
with the overvaluation of the
CFA franc in the second half of the
1980s, three conflicts in the 1990s, an
acceleration of rural to urban
migration in the 1980s, and continuing
institutional weaknesses.

2.
The post-conflict period ushered in by the 1999 cease-fire agreement has been
conducive to the installation of democratic institutions but, thus far, has not been
accompanied by the strict implementation of economic programs. Over this period, the
program launched in November 2000 under the post-conflict emergency assistance and three
subsequent staff-monitored programs (SMPs) have not been successful in laying the
foundations for moving to possible support under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). Nevertheless, the combination of a steadily improving security situation and some
encouraging results under the 2003 SMP have generated cautious optimism that a virtuous
circle of political stability and economic reform has been set in motion.
3.
The World Bank has also been involved in Congo’s postwar economic recovery
efforts. Currently, an Economic Recovery Credit amounting to US$30 million is under
preparation. Appendix II summarizes Congo’s relations with the World Bank Group.
II. POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
4.
The enormity of the destruction left by the successive and intense rounds of civil
wars (1993, 1997, and 1998–99) has been revealed as the security situation improved.
Key social and economic indicators have deteriorated or stagnated in the 1990s, and the
external debt burden is heavy (see Table 1 below). Over 70 percent of the population lives
below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates.

5.
Recent developments on the security front are helping to consolidate the stability
and peace achieved by the 1999 ceasefire and the 2002 elections:
•

A March-2003 peace accord with the remaining rebel group, recommitting both sides
to the terms of the 1999 cease-fire, was followed by the approval in August of
amnesty provisions for both rebel and government combatants.

•

With security restored in the area surrounding Brazzaville—the Pool region—the
reliability of the vital rail link between Pointe-Noire (port city) and Brazzaville
(administrative capital) has improved.

•

In November 2003, President Sassou-Nguesso signed into law the program for
demobilization, disarmament, and reinsertion of former combatants.

6.
To help convert these gains into lasting political stability, efforts are under way to
strengthen the institutional framework by nominating officials and allocating budgetary
resources for the Court of Accounts, the Economic and Social Council, and the

-8-

Constitutional Court. The authorities stated that the bulk of the spending on post-conflict
reconstruction, security, and elections was being financed from their own resources and oilbacked borrowing. They explained that

strengthening of the euro (see accompanying figure).
III. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2003
8.
Building on the momentum generated by the improvements on the political and
economic fronts, the government began focusing on economic management in late 2002.
To pave the way for a move to a PRGF-supported program, the authorities implemented an
SMP in 2003, initially covering the period January-June and then extended to September
2003. Overall performance under the SMP was weak, but the authorities took steps,
especially later in 2003, to enhance transparency and governance in the oil sector and to
strengthen public finance management (Box 2).
9.
The Congo benefited in 2003 from a favorable international oil market but a
somewhat slower-than-projected pace of domestic economic activity. The world oil price
averaged US$29 per barrel (compared with US$22 per barrel in the budget), but this was

-9-

partially offset by the weakening dollar (with the CFA franc per U.S. dollar exchange rate
about 15 percent lower than programmed). Real GDP grew by 1 percent (compared with
2 percent in the budget), owing principally to lower-than-projected oil production. Non-oil
real GDP growth slowed to 5.8 percent (from 6.7 percent in 2002) as the “catch-up” factor to
a more normal pace of economic activity in the post-conflict period began to taper off.
Box 1. Oil Revenue Discrepancy, 1999–2001
The 2003 Article IV consultation (Country report No. 03/193, para. 9) identified a shortfall of
some CFAF 174 billion in oil revenues over the period 1999–2001. This gap related to a
discrepancy between revenues recorded by treasury and tax liabilities of the oil companies as
stipulated in the production-sharing contracts. Although the 1999–2001 external audit of the
national oil company (SNPC) was expected to shed light on this issue, the auditors were not
granted access to the underlying documentation and were thus unable to reach any
conclusions.1 The government committee charged with explaining the discrepancy was able to
verify approximately half of the shortfall, as follows:
Explanation/Item
Nonpayment by CORAF of crude oil deliveries
Losses on fixed-price three year forward sale
Losses due to sales by the SNPC below reference price

Percent of shortfall

The remainder of the discrepancy could not be verified. Off-budget expenditures, carried out
by the SNPC on behalf of the government, were estimated to total 30 percent, as follows:
Explanation/Item
Construction projects
Security-related expenditures
Peace initiatives
Humanitarian aid
Financing charges

3

Budget expenditures, identified ex post, were estimated to total 8 percent. The residual,
15 percent of the discrepancy, could not be verified or explained.
__________

The terms of reference for the external audit included an examination of the fiscal agency role
of the SNPC and an audit of expenditures carried out on behalf of the government. Because of
concerns of national security, the auditors were not allowed access to the invoices and bank
statements necessary for these evaluations.

- 10 -

Box 2. Program Implementation in 2003
Overall performance under the 2003 SMP (covering January-September 2003)
was weak:
• The primary fiscal surplus fell short of the program target by some
CFAF 57 billion (equivalent to 2.8 percent of annual GDP). The main reasons
included (i) a significant shortfall in non-oil revenue, (ii) retention of tax
obligations by the national oil company (SNPC), and (iii) unprogrammed
expenditures. Additionally, exceptional oil receipts1 and unprogrammed oil bonus
and dividend receipts were effectively used to clear unprogrammed internal
arrears.
• On the structural front, performance was mixed. The audit of the SNPC for
1999-2001 was completed, efforts were made to centralize government revenues,
no new oil-collateralized debt was contracted, and initiatives were launched to
publish oil sector data. Nonetheless, not all nonreschedulable debt service was
paid, the privatization of the remaining publicly owned bank (CAIC) was not
completed, and the end-September 2003 measures on oil sector transparency were
not implemented.
The authorities had set quantitative and structural targets in the last quarter of
2003 with a view to stabilizing the fiscal slippages registered under the SMP and
further enhancing transparency and governance in the oil sector:
• On the fiscal front, the basic primary budget balance objective (which had been
revised downward) was met. Nonetheless, unprogrammed outlays were made on
clearance of pension arrears and the financing of structural reform costs.
• On the structural front, a significant step was taken to enhance transparency in
the oil sector with the completion of the certification, by an external auditor, of
government oil revenue for the period January-September 2003. Measures in the
fiscal area included (i) the appointment of new directors in the General
Directorates of Budget, Customs, and Taxes, as well as at the General Inspectorate
of Finance, in order to reinvigorate the revenue departments and strengthen
control; (ii) the signing of an agreement among the government, SNPC, and
CORAF, to have the latter pay for its purchase of government crude oil; and
(iii) the production of the 2000 budget review law (Loi de règlement).

measures were taken later in 2003 to start correcting these deficiencies (Box 2).

11.
In an encouraging sign of a pickup in non-oil sector activity, credit to the
economy grew in 2003 at a faster rate than non-oil GDP for the first time in three years
(Table 9). Bank deposits decreased by 8 percent in 2003, partly in response to the difficulties
in effecting current transfers (Box 3) and the diminished confidence in the remaining stateowned bank, Crédit pour l’Agriculture, l’Industrie et le Commerce (CAIC). Overall, the
banking system remains fragile as, in addition to the CAIC, two out of the other three
commercial banks have failed to meet some of the key prudential ratios.
Box 3. Control by the Regional Central Bank of External Transfers, 2003
Monetary developments in 2003 were marked by the regional central banks (BEAC)’s
tightening of controls on external transfers, a response to low external reserve coverage
in the Republic of Congo. Over the first half of 2003, the Congo suffered a sharp
decline in reserves with the currency cover ratio1 falling below the minimum threshold
of 20 percent in April; the primary cause of the sudden drop was a large outflow,
including to service external debt.
In tightening control, the BEAC set a ceiling above which transfers require the prior
written consent of its headquarters. In the case of the Congo, the ceiling was
progressively lowered until reaching zero in June 2003; public sector transfers were
excluded from these controls. The local BEAC authorities assured the mission that this
process did not cause undue delays in effecting current transfers.

The external current account deficit remained relatively unchanged, at
0.3 percent of GDP, in 2003 (Table 10). The decline in oil export value1 was offset by lower
government imports and interest due on external debt. In the non-oil sector, exports of
tropical wood increased significantly as new production capacity came on-line. Efforts were
undertaken in 2003 to start normalizing relations with external creditors by (i) remaining
current on debt-service payments to multilateral institutions and Paris Club creditors (with
the exception of one bilateral creditor) on post-cutoff-date debt, and (ii) clearing arrears (of
about US$12 million) to a few multilateral creditors. The Congo remains a heavily indebted
country, with an external debt stock equivalent to about 185 percent of GDP at end 2003,
two-thirds of which represents arrears (Table 11).

The record on the government’s nonbank privatization program was mixed in
2003. A core component of the strategy was to place the distribution of water and electricity
under private management, a process started in 2001. Potential investors are wary of the
financial risks of investing in the rehabilitation of the distribution network, and little progress

For 2003, the effect of higher prices was more than offset by lower production.

Box 4. Legal Settlement with an International Oil Company
The authorities have assured the staff that the full financial impact of the legal settlement in
2003 with an international oil company (IOC) has been properly recorded at the treasury.1 In
particular, they have assured the staff that the cash payment of US$80 million is not an oilcollateralized loan of the government (as claimed in press reports).2
Under the agreement, the Congo’s claims included grievances with respect to the
(i) economic terms of the 1995 transition from a regime of concessions to shared
production;
(ii) price of the 1995 purchase by the IOC of the government’s share of a jointly owned oil
company;
(iii) management of escrow accounts that provision for expenditures related to the
abandonment and remediation of oil wells; and
(iv) treatment of interest payments related to the repayment of oil-collateralized debt and
interest earnings on the abandonment and remediation provisions.
The IOC’s counterclaim centered on the government’s unilateral confiscation of a previously
allocated license area (which was awarded to a different private company under the productionsharing agreement for the Common Zone with Angola).
Under the reported terms of the final agreement, and in exchange for relinquishing any and all
claims related to the period prior to January 1, 2003, the authorities confirmed the receipt of the
following financial benefits:
•

in 2003 in the form of cash, US$80 million on account of general damages and
US$40 million on account of item (iv) above;

•

in 2003, one additional shipment of crude, equivalent to approximately US$25 million,
on account of item (iii) above; and

•

in the future, US$70 million, to be paid (net of possible legal awards) upon the
conclusion of a legal case brought, before European courts, by an external creditor
against the Congo.

Additionally, the Congo obtained a rescheduling of payments on oil-secured loans (related to
government expenditures carried out by the oil company prior to 2002), and secured the right
to comanage the funds related to the abandonment and remediation provisions.
______________

A confidentiality clause, reportedly inserted at the request of the oil company, prevents the
government from sharing the source documentation with staff.

The cash payment of US$80 million resulted from a series of transactions, namely: (i) the
transfer of the operating license on an oil field (known as Likouala) by the IOC to the
government; (ii) the subsequent sale of the operating license by the government to a private
Congolese company; and (iii) the contracting of an oil-collateralized loan by the Congolese
company to finance the US$80 million cash payment to the government. The authorities have
explained that, whereas the IOC preferred to transfer the operating license (rather than
effecting a cash payment), the government did not wish to absorb the risk of operating an oil
field.

has been registered. However, the bidding process for the management contract of the
Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville railroad is forging ahead, with the submission of technical bids by
end-2003. At odds with the government’s privatization strategy, the Société Nationale
Pétrolière du Congo (SNPC) embarked in 2003 on a diversification strategy, including into
non-oil activities such as finance, air transport, and services, financed out of a non-oil
investment budget equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2003.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Challenges
15.
The discussions focused on how to cast economic and financial policies in a
medium-term context in order to safeguard macroeconomic stability, enhance policy
credibility, and create conditions for broad-based economic growth and poverty alleviation.
In this context, the staff underscored the following key medium-term challenges:
•

reinforcing the framework for peace and social stability by making further progress in
the participatory approach to economic reforms;

•

continuing to strengthen the framework for enhanced transparency and governance in
the oil sector;

•

ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability in the face of uncertain future oil revenues,
and avoiding procyclical public spending;

•

strengthening public expenditure management and institutional capacity; and

•

creating favorable conditions for private sector expansion and poverty reduction.

16.
The authorities are faced with the daunting challenge of setting the country on a
path of sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The related discussions focused on the
key constraints on growth, including the heavy dependence on oil and low access to
information (see Box 5 for a cross-regional comparison of Congo’s performance), as well as
weak institutions and poor governance (Box 6). The authorities generally concurred with this
assessment and stressed that the legacy of central planning and the associated antibusiness
bias, the civil conflicts, the lack of infrastructure, and the heavy debt burden were key
hurdles in relaunching economic growth.
17.
There was broad agreement on the policy agenda. In particular, the authorities
concurred with the critical need for (i) improvements in governance and fiscal management,
including a break from the propensity for stop-go fiscal policy, and (ii) a clear strategy to
promote sustainable growth in the non-oil sector. Overall, the authorities stressed the urgency
of the reconstruction effort. The staff emphasized that success in the implementation of their
development plan will depend on the ability of policymakers to fully mobilize domestic
resources, improve the quality of fiscal expenditures, and ensure that fiscal policy is on a
sustainable path.

From the comparative data above, key constraints on growth and poverty reduction in the Congo
appear to relate to the (i) high dependence on oil; (ii) low access to information; (iii) heavy public
debt burden; (iv) high cost of public utilities; (v) low degree of financial depth; (vi) deteriorating
social indicators; (vii) weak infrastructure; and (viii) urban bias. Recent research has shown that a
(i) high dependence on natural resources significantly raises the probability of domestic conflicts
and is inversely related to the income of the poor; and (ii) there is a strong positive relationship
between the income of the poor, on the one hand, and financial depth and secondary school
enrollment, on the other.

Box 6. Institutions and Governance
The legacy from past public management weaknesses and recurring bouts of civil conflict is
reflected in low governance ratings (including political stability and rule of law). Using a broad
definition of governance as “the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is
exercised” and combining several individual measures into clusters, World Bank researchers have
constructed aggregate indicators of six dimensions of governance
(www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/wp-governance.htm). The indicators are measured in units
ranging from about –2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to better governance outcomes.

For economic agents, the implications of the low ratings on the quality of institutions and
governance are effectively captured by assessments of the business environment carried out by
COFACE (French export credit agency). According to these rankings, available at
www.coface.fr, Congo is rated as “very uncertain with a poor payment record” (the secondlowest grade on a scale of 7 points) for short-term deals, and as “very high risk” (the lowest grade
on a scale of 4 points) for long-term investments.
In the preparation of a national anticorruption program, the government in 2003, with assistance
from the UNDP: (i) carried out a corruption survey, (ii) commissioned a study, and (iii) organized
a seminar with the participation of officials, experts and representatives from civil society and the
international donor community. The survey established the widespread nature of corruption in
Congo: half of the 6,144 respondents reported having paid bribes to government officials. The
survey also identified poverty, a lack of adequate controls, and an ineffective judicial system as
the most important causes of corruption.

- 17 -

18.
To launch the non-oil economy, the authorities favor a strategy that emphasizes
infrastructure development, including roads to improve market access for the agricultural
sector. The authorities emphasized the need to foster development in the north of the country
(for which the Ollombo International Airport is being built) and to improve the delivery of
basic services, especially water and electricity (for which the recently launched Imboulou
Dam project is considered strategic). The staff noted that improving competitiveness in the
non-oil sector will require creating a more favorable environment for private sector
expansion, including through improved public service delivery and physical infrastructure, as
well as an enhanced overall governance framework to effectively combat corruption (see
Section IV.E).
19.
The staff stressed that, in determining the appropriate mix of development
expenditures, prospective projects needed to be carefully vetted to ensure economic
viability. In particular, the limits of capacity absorption must be taken into account, and
consistency with the objectives laid out in the interim poverty reduction strategy paper
(I-PRSP) must be ensured. The staff also cautioned that attempts to quickly launch a number
of projects aimed at the agricultural sector must take into account the currently high rate of
urbanization and the tendency for people to remain in the urban area, where services are
more widely available.
20.
The staff met with a wide range of stakeholders, including parliamentarians,
donors, labor leaders, and civil society. They broadly endorsed the government’s efforts to
improve fiscal management practices and underscored the importance of more rapid progress
on the transparency front in order to ensure full mobilization of domestic resources. The role
of the Bretton Woods institutions in promoting transparency was widely lauded, and there
was general agreement on the importance of moving to a formal Fund-supported program
and obtaining debt relief. A common theme from these meetings centered on the need for the
government to broaden policy discussions and expand reform ownership.
B. Macroeconomic Outlook
21.
Real GDP is projected to grow by about 3½-4 percent per annum during
2004-07, propelled by an annual average non-oil real GDP growth rate of about 4 percent
(see Box 7 on the sources of growth). The non-oil-real GDP growth projections assume a
“catch-up” factor of about ½-1 percentage point per annum, reflecting increased capacity
utilization owing to the expected continued rebound in economic activity. The authorities
argued that the Congo had a much higher growth potential, but the staff stressed the need for
realism and analytical support for growth projections. The staff’s estimates suggest that
achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the proportion of the
population living below the poverty line would require a non-oil real GDP growth of about
7–8 percent per year during 2004–15.

•

Factor accumulation explained the bulk of output growth during 1970–2003, with TFP
playing a limited role.

•

Starting in the second half of the 1980s, the decline in non-oil real GDP growth appears to
have been caused by a loss in competitiveness (due to the overvaluation of the CFA franc)
and to have been accompanied by an acceleration of rural to urban migration.

•

Developments in the 1990s reveal the devastating impact of civil conflicts along with
indications of a “catch-up” factor, in the form of higher productivity, during the latest postconflict period.

22.
In view of the appreciating trend in the real effective exchange rate, vigilance is
required on the fiscal policy front. In this regard, the proposed consideration by the
government to adopt, starting in 2005, a fiscal rule under which oil revenues (and,
consequently, expenditures) would be projected on the basis of a conservative oil price2 is a
welcome step. The staff noted that a key lesson from last year’s budget implementation was
that, for a price rule to be effective, the government would need to discuss it with the
parliament and seek its endorsement, and to regularly update the parliamentarians on
budgetary execution. Additionally, an enabling framework, including transparency on oil
revenue and clear rules on the use of windfall revenues, would need to be in place.
23.
Given that the Congo is a member of a monetary union, sound fiscal policy is
key to achieving and sustaining macroeconomic stability. Inflation is projected to average
about 2 percent annually, as domestic demand is to be held in check by fiscal prudence. The

macroeconomic projections assume an improvement in the non-oil basic primary fiscal
balance (of about 5½ percentage points of non-oil GDP during 2003-07), with about
2 percentage points from non-oil revenue mobilization and the remainder from non-oilrelated expenditure compression (see Table 4 below).

1/ Noninterest current expenditure plus domestically financed investment.
2/ Including net lending.
3/ Excess oil revenue (which arises when operating costs of oil companies are lower than the limits
stipulated in production sharing agreements) is partly assigned automatically to cover an
existing liability (HydroCongo).

24.
Non-oil revenue is projected to increase by about 0.5 percent of GDP per annum.
This objective is ambitious but feasible, as the authorities have already undertaken a number
of measures in 2003 (Box 2), and others are envisaged during the SMP period and over the
medium term. Given that tax policy is carried out in the context of the Central African
Economic and Monetary (CEMAC) region, there is limited scope for raising tax rates (with
the exception of the doubling of the statistical tax to 2 percent in 2004 and its extension to oil
companies). The projected increase in the non-oil revenue in later years is to be achieved
from measures to widen the tax net, combat fraud and evasion, and progressively eliminate
ad hoc exemptions. The authorities were of the view that there was considerable upside
potential to the non-oil revenue forecast, but agreed with the staff on the need for prudence.
25.
On the expenditure side, the staff stressed that it would be critical that the share
of poverty-related spending rise over time. The projected decline in transfer payments
would be expected to create room to start achieving this objective. Budgetary transfers on
account of oil-related liabilities (HydroCongo) will decline on the basis of revised contractual
terms that shift a larger share of the repayment burden from the government to the SNPC.3
3

The SNPC inherited the related assets of HydroCongo at the time of its creation.

- 20 -

Transfers to the national oil refinery (CORAF) are projected to fall on the basis of a
performance contract, signed in December 2003, for the payment of crude oil deliveries.
26.
Transfers to CORAF and price subsidies on consumer petroleum products are
to be explicitly incorporated into the budget. The staff noted the need for early
implementation of an automatic price adjustment mechanism for refined petroleum products,
accompanied by appropriate safeguards to shield the poor. The authorities have decided, for
the time being, to maintain the current retail prices for petroleum products, in light of the
failure, amid popular dissatisfaction, to put in place a system of automatic price adjustment in
October 2002. In addition, the government would need to develop a strategy for reforming
CORAF so that over the medium term it can operate without recourse to fiscal subsidies.
27.
The authorities agreed that the investment budget should focus on projects
required to accelerate growth and poverty reduction. It will be critical that the execution
of the investment budget be closely monitored in order to ensure consistency with approved
outlays. In this connection, the staff stressed the importance of finalizing the work on
establishing a comprehensive functional classification system. The staff also noted that
public investment plans needed to give due consideration to the public resources invested by
the SNPC, part of which was allocated to support the company’s diversification policy. On
the latter, the staff urged the authorities to prepare an action plan to have the SNPC focus on
its core activities.
28.
The fiscal compression over the medium term would help to generate funds to
ensure external debt service.4 In order to allow increased spending on poverty-related
outlays, the authorities stressed the need for debt alleviation. A preliminary analysis of the
Congo’s public debt indicates that, even after the application of full traditional Naples terms
rescheduling, Congo’s debt burden would remain unsustainable; the net present value (NPV)
of debt-to-government revenue ratio would remain higher than 250 percent over the medium
term (Appendix IV).
29.
The staff noted that domestic payment arrears should be settled in an equitable
and transparent manner. All domestic payment arrears of a commercial nature, as of end2002, have been audited, and the government plans to follow up with an audit of arrears on
wages and pensions.5 The authorities were urged to prepare a comprehensive domestic
arrears settlement plan, and to publish the related policy framework. The implementation of
this plan should follow budgetary procedures and be contingent on the availability of
financial resources.

The total domestic debt stock is estimated at about 27 percent of GDP, the bulk of which
represents arrears.

C. Economic Program for 2004
30.
The authorities noted that their overarching objective was to set the economy on
a sustained path of growth and poverty reduction in the context of an arrangement
under the PRGF. To assist the Congo in establishing the track record necessary for moving
to a PRGF-supported program, the government is implementing a new SMP covering the
period January-June 2004.6 The primary objectives of the new SMP—which is dovetailed
into the framework of a medium-term program—are to strengthen fiscal discipline and
enhance oil sector transparency.
31.
A key objective of fiscal policy in 2004 is to entrench discipline in public finance
management. On the revenue side, full mobilization of domestic receipts will be facilitated
by the continued certification of oil revenue by an independent auditor. In addition, non-oil
revenue measures will focus on a better identification and tracking of taxpayers,
modernization of the computer system at customs, and establishment of electronic links
among revenue departments. The program will incorporate an adjustor to account for
deviations of oil revenues from programmed amounts.7
32.
As regards the forestry sector, the authorities explained that operators had resisted
the increase in tax rates in 2003. The sector reform recommended by the World Bank, while
calling for a gradual increase in tax rates to levels comparable to those in neighboring
countries, had also envisaged a change of the tax base from “free on board” to “free on
truck,” so as to exclude transport costs from the base. The authorities have yet to change the
tax base under the new regime. Recognizing the fiscal burden on the sector, the government
has delayed the second round of tax increases, originally planned for 2004. The staff noted
that the forestry sector held good promise for economic diversification and poverty
reduction. It therefore urged the authorities to carry out, with assistance from the World Bank
and sector operators, a comprehensive evaluation of reform implementation.
33.
Expenditure policy is geared to raising poverty-related outlays while keeping
nonproductive transfers to a strict minimum. In 2004, traditional transfer payments are
projected to increase considerably, owing to the establishment of new institutions in support
of democratization, including the Audit Office, the High Court of Justice, the National
Commission on Human Rights, and the Economic and Social Council. Overall, the structure
of spending should gradually shift toward priority social spending.
34.
To meet pressing social needs, the government signed with the labor unions a
“social truce,” whereby the gradual payment of wage and retirement pension arrears

See the authorities’ letter of intent (Appendix III).

The basic primary fiscal balance will be adjusted upward if oil revenue is higher than
projected, and the extra resources would be utilized to finance the residual budgetary gap
and reduce external payment arrears on debt not eligible for rescheduling.

- 22 -

will begin in 2004. To this end, the 2004 budget law provides about 1.8 percent of GDP for
the payment of social arrears (on wages and pensions) and priority arrears (to small and
medium-sized enterprises), with a view to bolstering economic activity.
35.
The structural measures for 2004 focus on oil sector transparency and public
finance. In addition to increasing the level of publicly available information, the process of
conducting annual external audits of the SNPC and the quarterly certification of oil revenue
will continue. The 2003 accounts of the CORAF are to be audited, and a preliminary action
plan to have the SNPC focus on its core activities is to be prepared. In addition, for the
SNPC, it is critical that the action plan resulting from the 1999–2001 audit be quickly
implemented, and that its reporting obligations to the Ministry of Finance be effectively
executed. In the area of public finance, the key objectives are to ensure full revenue
centralization and enhance expenditure control.
D. Monetary and Financial Sector Issues
36.
Monetary and credit policies are conducted by the Bank of Central African
States (BEAC) in the regional context of the CEMAC. Broad money in the Congo is
expected to grow in line with domestic nominal non-oil GDP over the medium term. Net
credit to the government is projected to increase in 2004 (by about 0.6 percent of GDP), but
the monetary program leaves room for credit to the economy to expand and for the central
bank to build up its net foreign assets.
37.
Given the fragile health of the banking system, the staff is encouraged by the
privatization of the remaining publicly owned bank (CAIC). As a further confidencebuilding measure for the banking system, and with the ultimate goal of improving access to
banking services, the staff encouraged the authorities to begin addressing weaknesses in the
legal and judicial system (namely, an ineffective bankruptcy law and the lack of a functional
land title system) and to adopt a comprehensive plan to restructure the nonbank financial
sector, with the assistance of the World Bank. In addition, the staff encouraged the
authorities to steadfastly implement the proposed modernization of the payment and
settlement system.
38.
The authorities agreed with the need to promote the healthy development of
microfinance institutions, which have offered a viable banking option for small businesses
and low-income workers. Accordingly, mutual microfinance firms (MUCODEC) will
continue to benefit from their tax-exempt status,8 and the authorities have launched a series

8

New regional regulations establish two main categories of microfinance institutions, with
category 1 encompassing those that deal exclusively with members (such as mutuals) and
category 2 including those that also lend to nonmembers and that are typically limitedliability companies. Owing to their particular role in extending credit to low-income
consumers, category 1 institutions benefit from tax exemptions in many countries. There are
(continued)

- 23 -

of seminars to assist the sector in complying with the new regional regulations over the
coming three years.
E. Transparency and Governance
39.
The authorities agreed with the importance of reinforcing recent efforts to
enhance transparency and governance in the oil sector. As part of the transparency
initiative in the Congo, the staff encouraged them to consider participation in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The authorities argued that, for the time being, they
would prefer to focus on the oil sector transparency measures in the 2004 SMP.
40.
The staff discussed with the authorities their action plan for addressing the
weaknesses in accounting practices and fiscal agency accountability pointed out by the
1999–2001 audit of the SNPC. It commended them for publishing, on the Internet, parts of
the audit report, the SNPC action plan, and the full reports on the 2003 oil revenue
reconciliation conducted by an external auditor (see www.congo-site.cg). It encouraged the
authorities to move swiftly with the external audit of the SNPC’s 2002 accounts, and to draw
lessons from the 2003 certification of oil revenue, so as to maximize the government’s take
from the oil it receives as fiscal payment.
41.
To begin to tackle other aspects of governance (Box 6), the government has
(i) started preparing, with assistance from the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), a national anticorruption program, and (ii) enacted a code of conduct for civil
servants and the enabling regulations for the related disciplinary councils. Additionally, in
January 2004, the establishment of a National Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Commission
was proposed to the Council of Ministers. Under the chairmanship of the President of the
Republic, this commission would monitor the implementation of anticorruption policies,
centralize all information necessary for the prevention and detection of corruption, oversee
procurement policy, alert competent authorities to cases of serious corruption, and assist
government agencies or enterprises in tackling corruption.
F. Poverty Reduction
42.
A draft interim poverty reduction strategy paper (I-PRSP) is at an advanced
stage of preparation. It has benefited from comments from the international community,
which has stressed that the document needs to do the following: (i) take a strategic approach
and prioritize objectives; (ii) discuss the importance of good governance in the management
of oil wealth and public finance; and (iii) present a macroeconomic framework that ascertains
that the maximum domestic revenue is being mobilized and that expenditures are being
oriented toward the priority sectors. Additionally, the staff stressed the importance of rapidly
completing the work started in late 2003, with technical assistance from the Fund, to
efforts under way, with the support of the World Bank, to ensure that such treatment is made
universal throughout the CEMAC region.

- 24 -

implement a functional classification system to help monitor poverty-related budgetary
outlays.
G. Statistics and Technical Assistance
43.
The authorities are making efforts to improve the statistical apparatus. The
recent decisions to participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (IMF Press
Release No. 03/229) and to increase the resources allocated to statistical development should
help ensure that this process is sustained. The data provided by the authorities and the BEAC
are broadly adequate to monitor macroeconomic developments, although improvements
would be needed, inter alia, in the coverage of the oil sector data. With a view to
strengthening the poverty-related database, a number of surveys are to be launched with
assistance from the World Bank and UNDP, including a household survey and a population
census. Given its vast capacity-building needs, the Congo is expected to request further
technical assistance from the international community, especially in the areas of public
expenditure management, non-oil revenue mobilization, oil sector transparency, public debt
management, and statistics.
V. FINANCING GAP, CAPACITY TO PAY, AND EXTERNAL DEBT
44.
A large core residual financing gap9 of about CFAF 110 billion (5.2 percent of
GDP) remains in 2004-05 (Table 5 below), despite the authorities’ efforts to mobilize
revenues and control primary expenditures (Section IV.B; Table 4 above; and Table 12). The
hump in the residual financing gap in 2005 is due primarily to the high debt service on oilcollateralized loans (CFAF 83 billion, about 4 percent of GDP). The staff advised the
authorities that it may be necessary to refinance part of this debt in order to generate some
room for the settlement of arrears to multilateral institutions and on post-cutoff-date debt to
Paris Club creditors.

45.
The scope for generating additional domestic savings to cover the residual
financing gap and make external arrears payments appears limited. The authorities
agreed that a settlement plan on arrears (amounting to about 19 percent of GDP; see Table 5)
to multilateral institutions and Paris Club creditors (on post-cutoff-date debt) that was
satisfactory to the creditors would be needed to secure financing assurances for a successor
PRGF-supported program.

2003, the Congo reported good progress with two criteria met (see Table 6). On the
integration of goods markets, the Congo promulgated the CEMAC’s investment charter and
issued two implementing regulations; and the National Law of Investment is expected to be
revised, in compliance with the CEMAC charter, by end-2004. The Congo is also in broad
compliance with the implementation of the regional customs code. Finally, the Congo has
established the national financial intelligence unit that will implement and coordinate
regional efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
47.
The trade and payment system is largely free of restrictions. The Fund index of
trade restrictiveness is estimated at 3 (on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is the least restrictive), with
a simple average tariff rate of 16 percent and no significant nontariff barriers. With respect to
the payment system, the authorities eliminated in 2003 the preclearance procedure (whereby
economic operators had to receive clearance by a unit in the Ministry of Finance before
submitting a request for external transfers to a commercial bank); the Congo is now in
compliance with the CEMAC harmonized foreign exchange arrangement. However,
temporary controls imposed by the BEAC on external transfers have generated concerns on
the part of operators (Box 3). These controls are expected to be eased as the external
coverage ratio rises above the minimum threshold established by the BEAC.
VII. RISKS
48.
Despite the recent success in consolidating peace, the Congo continues to face
risks to the continuance of sound economic performance. To maintain the reform
momentum, there is a pressing need to broaden the policy discussions and expand ownership
of the reform process. Key challenges for economic policy include the growing pressures for
“peace dividends” (in the form of higher public expenditures), management of oil price
volatility, and the need to curtail the impact of special interests. In addition, it will be critical
for the national oil company to fully contribute to ongoing efforts to improve transparency
and accountability in the oil sector. Finally, the timely provision of information, especially on
oil-related activities, will help to convince development partners that domestic resources are
being fully mobilized.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Recent developments on the political front are encouraging against the
background of the recurrent conflicts in the 1990s. Under the umbrella of peace, Congo
completed a four-year political transition period, held democratic elections, and installed the
full complement of democratic institutions required by the Constitution. To ensure that this
period of political stability is prolonged, it is now critical to secure social stability by
promptly implementing the proposed demobilization program for former combatants and
tackling the huge socioeconomic challenges facing the nation. In this context, entrenching
democratic institutions and installing transparent decision-making practices would effectively
broaden policy discussions and expand ownership of the reform process.

- 27 -

50.
Accompanying the positive momentum on the political front, economic activity
in the non-oil sector has picked up significantly and inflation has decelerated in the
post-conflict period. In an encouraging sign of a pickup in non-oil sector activity, credit to
the economy grew in 2003 at a faster rate than non-oil GDP for the first time in three years.
Nonetheless, key social indicators have deteriorated, and the external debt burden is heavy.
The proportion of the population living below the poverty line increased sharply during the
conflict period. Under plausible assumptions, real GDP growth is projected in the range of
3½-4 percent per year during 2004-07, which is about half of the staff’s estimate of the level
that would be required to lower the income poverty rate by half by 2015.
51.
Building on the momentum generated by the improvements on the political and
the economic fronts, the government has begun to focus on economic management.
Measures to enhance budget management and oil sector transparency, along with efforts at
initiating a wider policy debate, augur well for the prospects of increased public support for
reforms. In the period ahead, it will be critical for the government to strengthen this fledgling
participatory approach to economic policy formulation. The staff urges the authorities to
finalize the preparation of the I-PRSP, as it will serve as a key ingredient for the international
community’s support for the country in the period ahead. The I-PRSP should provide a road
map for the policies required to accelerate non-oil sector growth, manage oil sector resources
effectively, and reduce poverty. To help monitor poverty-related outlays, it is critical that the
implementation of a comprehensive functional classification system for the budget be
completed promptly.
52.
Performance in 2003, in the context of the implementation of the SMP for that
year, was weak and did not allow Congo to move to a PRGF-supported program. While
some encouraging results were observed, notably on oil sector transparency, the
achievements were outweighed by the unbudgeted use of windfall oil revenue, the
underperformance in non-oil revenue, and weaknesses on the part of the national oil
company in carrying out its fiscal agency role. In the period ahead, the authorities will need
to remain vigilant with respect to fiscal discipline and bold in tackling the influence of vested
interests.
53.
The staff regrets the opportunity missed in 2003 by not using additional oil
revenues to clear a significant amount of external arrears. The choice made by the Congo
to clear domestic commercial arrears contributed not only to weak program implementation,
but also to a setback to the authorities’ goal of moving quickly to a PRGF-supported program
and securing the goodwill of the international community. The staff urges the authorities to
use future additional oil revenues in accordance with stated program priorities.
54.
The staff is encouraged by the authorities’ renewed determination to strengthen
the framework for moving to a medium-term program for growth and poverty
reduction that can be supported by the international community. The program for 2004
appropriately addresses the most pressing issues facing the Congo, and the authorities are
encouraged to diligently implement the proposed measures. The authorities are cognizant,
however, that obtaining financing assurances for a Fund-supported medium-term program

- 28 -

would entail receiving exceptionally favorable treatment on post-cutoff-date arrears to the
Paris Club and arrears to multilateral creditors. The international community, in turn, will
need assurances from the government that it is making the maximum effort to implement
reforms, and to mobilize domestic resources and utilize them judiciously.
55.
The Congo is faced with daunting challenges in moving onto a sustainable path
of economic development. Increased focus on oil sector transparency and governance,
together with access by the public to information on economic management, should be key
aspects of a strategy to lower the probability of future conflicts and to strengthen the
decision-making process. In addition, actions to ensure that oil-related resources are being
fully accounted for will be key to strengthening domestic ownership and securing the
exceptional donor support that the Congo needs to move to a PRGF-supported program.
Another key challenge will be to improve the business climate by enhancing, inter alia, the
overall governance framework and effectively combating corruption, and by improving
efficiency in the delivery of public utilities.
56.
While the real effective exchange rate remains below its pre-1994 devaluation
level, vigilance is required on fiscal policy in view of the strengthening of the euro and
the rise in the terms of trade. In this regard, the staff is encouraged by the authorities’
stated objective to adopt a fiscal rule, starting in 2005, to project oil revenues and to program
expenditures on the basis of a conservative price assumption. In addition, with a view to
enhancing the Congo’s non-oil sector competitiveness, the staff urges the authorities to work
in concert with development partners to tackle the fundamental causes of the high cost of
doing business in the Congo.
57.
The timely provision of reliable economic and financial data is essential for
effective macroeconomic management and Fund surveillance. The provision of
comprehensive information, including on oil-related activities, will help to convince
development partners that domestic resources are being fully mobilized.
58.
The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month consultation cycle.

1/ Saving and investment data are preliminary. Balance of payments estimates are being revised with Fund technical assistance.
2/ Interest due on external arrears and residual financing gap.
3/ Including grants, excluding interest due on external arrears and residual financing gap.
4/ Revenue minus noninterest current expenditure minus domestically financed capital expenditure.
5/ Including public transfers, and excluding interest due on external arrears and residual financing gap.
6/ From 2005 onward, WEO price forecasts are reduced by US$2 per barrel (see note 7 on price rule).
7/ Following a price rule, oil revenue from 2005 onward is projected on the basis of an international price estimated to be US$2 lower than the
latest WEO forecasts. Alternatively, using WEO price forecasts would increase oil revenue and generate windfall oil revenues.

APPENDIX I

Implementation of HIPC Initiative:

The Republic of Congo is likely to be eligible to debt relief under the HIPC Initiative,
once it establishes a track record under a PRGF-supported program. The timing of a
possible PRGF arrangement will depend on performance under the staff-monitored
program covering the period January–June, 2004.
VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
An on-site safeguards assessment of the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC), of
which Republic of Congo is a member, was completed on July 20, 2001 (see Appendix
V). The assessment concluded that high risks may exist in the financial reporting
framework and internal audit mechanism and made recommendations as reported in the
safeguards assessments report. In a letter dated July 11, 2001, the BEAC authorities
committed to implementing most of the recommendations, progress on which is
monitored by staff.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Congo’s currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 = euro 1. On April 1 , 2004, the rate of the CFA franc was
CFAF 791.73 per SDR. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultations:

Consultations with Congo are on the standard 12-month cycle. The 2003 consultation
discussions were held in Brazzaville in February/March 2003. The staff report (Country
report No. 03/193) was considered by the Executive Board on June 13, 2003.

APPENDIX II

Republic of Congo: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of December 31, 2003)
The World Bank reengaged in Congo in early 2001 within the context of a Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) aimed at (i) supporting the Government in facing the challenges of
consolidating civil peace; (ii) laying and solidifying the foundation for the democratization of
political life; (iii) rehabilitating social and economic infrastructure; and (iv) improving
economic management, including increased transparency and good governance in the oil
sector.
A.

The Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations

On August 8, 2001, the Republic of Congo cleared all its overdue service payments to IBRD
and IDA. All IBRD loans and IDA credits to the Republic of Congo have been restored to
accrual status and the country’s eligibility for disbursements under existing loans, credits,
project preparation facility advances and for new operations, was reinstated. Bank assistance
to Congo resumed and the field mission reopened. As a result, and in line with the TSS, the
Bank has been supporting Congo with a variety of operations including (i) a Post-conflict
Economic Rehabilitation Credit (PERC) for SDR 30 million10 (in July 2001) to support
implementation of key structural reforms, help to better manage fiscal resources, and assist in
improving governance and transparency in the oil sector; (ii) an Emergency Demobilization
and Reintegration Credit for SDR 4 million (also in July 2001) to facilitate the reintegration
of about 10,000 ex-combatants into civil life; (iii) an Infrastructure Rehabilitation and
Improvement in Living Conditions Credit for SDR 32.2 million (in April 2002) to
rehabilitate key infrastructure (including portions of the key railroad link, roads and health
facilities) and help mitigate unemployment through a variety of labor-intensive microprojects; and (iv) a Governance and Transparency Capacity Building Credit for SDR
5.6 million (in February 2002) to accompany reforms supported by the Post Conflict
Economic Rehabilitation Credit.
An Emergency Reconstruction and Community Support Credit to assist communities living
in smaller municipalities and rural areas has been approved by the Board in June 2003. An
Economic Recovery Credit to sustain and deepen economic reforms initiated under PERC, as
well as an HIV/AIDS project to be financed by grants, are scheduled to be presented to the
Board by the end of FY 2004. An education project is also under preparation.
Under non-lending services, the Bank is preparing a Public Expenditure Management
Review to help improve fiscal management, and is assisting the Congo in preparing its
interim poverty reduction strategy paper. An Institutional Development Grant has been
approved to support the rehabilitation of statistical capacity.

APPENDIX II

The updated Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for FY2004-5 has been presented to the
Board and approved in September 2003. Its main objective is to help the Congo get out of the
conflict trap. The current TSS has four strategic elements:
•

Promote economic growth and diversification through: (i) supporting economic
reforms, particularly in the context of access to PRGF; (ii) rebuilding infrastructure;
(iii) enhancing education and professional training; and (iv) supporting rural
development.

•

Help strengthen and reposition the public sector through advisory services and
adjustment operations, with a focus on: (i) increasing transparency in the oil sector;
improving public resource management; and (iii) enhancing capacity.

•

Help mitigate short-and medium-term social and political risks by: (i) supporting
demobilization and reintegration of former combatants; and (ii) assisting in the fight
against HIV/AIDS.

•

Assist in increasing resources for peace and development by helping the Congo in
benefiting from the HPIC initiative, and obtaining support from other donors.
B.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas

The IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in supporting
policies to consolidate civil peace and recover from a decade of recurring conflicts, sustain
macro-economic stability, improve governance, reverse a marked decline in social indicators,
and promote sustainable development. Exchange of information and discussion on progress
in the implementation of the reform program take place on a regular basis between the Bank
and the Fund. Joint missions are carried out to review progress.
Areas where the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement:
•
•
•

health and education sectors, for which two projects are under preparation;
state disengagement from productive sectors through privatization/restructuring of
public utilities enterprises and commercial banks; and
more transparent use of public funds through the reform of public procurement and
the institution of a special body (Cour des Comptes).

Areas where the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input to the IMF:
•
•
•
•

review of selected issues in the oil sector, including the recently completed audit of
the oil company (SNPC) and the follow up action plan;
forestry management;
social policies;
assistance in PRSP preparation;

APPENDIX III

Brazzaville, March 31, 2004

Ms. Anne O. Krueger
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Ms. Krueger:
1.
On behalf of the government of the Republic of Congo, I am pleased to send you
herewith the memorandum on economic and financial policies. This memorandum describes
recent economic developments, the implementation of the 2003 staff-monitored program
(SMP), and the measures that the government undertakes to implement in 2004 with a view
to strengthening macroeconomic management.
2.
The government recognizes that, despite encouraging results, the overall
implementation of the 2003 SMP was weak, especially in the fiscal area and governance in
the oil sector. The government remains, nevertheless, convinced that an improvement of the
country’s economic and financial position is indispensable to attain the strong and lasting
growth necessary for poverty reduction, and that the implementation of a program supported
by resources from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) is the best way to
achieve those objectives. As a result, the government has decided to adopt another SMP,
which it intends to implement rigorously during the first half of 2004 in order to strengthen
the framework that would permit an agreement to be reached on an arrangement that can be
supported by the PRGF.
3.
The two principal objectives of this new program are to strengthen fiscal discipline
and enhance transparency in fiscal management, particularly in the oil sector. The gradual
improvement in administrative capacity and the commitment of the government to avoid the
slippages of the past constitute assurances that this program will succeed. The government
requests the support of Fund staff for the monitoring of the proposed program.
4.
The government is aware that the satisfactory implementation of the new SMP will be
necessary but not sufficient for embarking on a PRGF arrangement. Indeed, in addition to its
own efforts, the government is also counting on the support of its development partners for
assistance in addressing the budgetary financing gap, which is largely attributable to the
external debt burden. In this context, the government believes that an exceptional treatment
of the country’s external debt payment arrears by the international community will be
necessary, including on arrears to multilateral institutions and Paris Club creditors on postcutoff-date debt.

5.
An interim poverty reduction strategy is being drafted on the basis of broad civil
society participation. The government plans to adopt this strategy in a timely manner and to
submit it to its development partners to seek their support for its implementation, including
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
6.
The government will provide the Fund with any information it may request for
monitoring the implementation of economic and financial policies and the achievement of the
program objectives, as described in the technical memorandum of understanding attached to
the memorandum on economic and financial policies. The government is committed to
disseminating this memorandum and authorizes the Fund to publish it on its website.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
Brazzaville, March 31, 2004
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Republic of Congo, a post-conflict country, is determined to strengthen its
economic and financial medium-term framework in order to achieve sustained growth and
initiate lasting poverty reduction. The government recognizes that performance in the
implementation of previous Fund-supported programs has generally been below
expectations. The reasons for this disappointing performance include (i) the inherited
sluggishness of the planned economy, which has long had a negative impact on the private
sector; (ii) the civil wars of the 1990s which disrupted the economy, weakened the
institutions, and undermined the rule of law; (iii) the weakness of economic management
during the transition period that followed the war; and (iv) insufficient ownership of program
implementation by the government.
2.
With the completion of the democratization process in 2002 and the signing of the
peace agreements with the rebel groups in 1999 and 2003, the government began
implementing its Nouvelle Espérance (New Hope) economic and social program based on
consolidating economic management and poverty reduction, strengthening institutional
capacity, and improving transparency and governance.
3.
In 2003, the government adopted and implemented a staff-monitored program (SMP)
that was geared to lead to a program supported under the International Monetary Fund’s
(IMF’s) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Despite encouraging results, there
have generally been major weaknesses in the implementation of this program, especially as
regards fiscal discipline and transparency in oil sector management. Conscious of the need to
build a sound economic basis for achieving sustainable poverty reduction, the government
has decided to adopt a new SMP covering the first half of 2004. This memorandum on
economic and financial policies describes the objectives of that program and the actions
envisaged for achieving them.
4.
After five years of domestic efforts to reconstruct the country destroyed by war, the
Congolese government is seeking the support of the international community in the form of
technical assistance, further financing, and rescheduling of the country’s external debt on
exceptional terms, including the arrears that are nonreschedulable.
II. IMPROVED SECURITY
5.
The Congo is emerging from some ten years of political instability, marked by three
civil wars that have led to enormous human loss, the exodus of a portion of the population,
and the destruction of entire villages, buildings, infrastructure, and units of production. These

- 50 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

wars have exacerbated the preexisting shortcomings in public management, particularly in
fiscal and oil revenue management. In the social sectors, many facilities and much equipment
were destroyed or looted. The socioeconomic fabric has been seriously torn, and the
proportion of the population living below the poverty line rose sharply.
6.
Recent developments on the political and security fronts have involved considerable
improvements. The political transition period, which began at the end of the war in 1997, was
completed in August 2002 after the presidential, legislative, and communal elections. Out of
an interest in consolidating peace, the government and representatives of the remainder of the
rebellion signed a peace agreement on March 17, 2003, pursuant to which demilitarization,
demobilization, and reintegration operations started, with support from the international
community. The speed with which the country is being rebuilt and democratic institutions are
being installed, using only domestic resources, raises much hope, and the government is
making efforts to restore sound macroeconomic management and promote transparency.
7.
The overall debt situation has worsened because a portion of the spending on
reconstruction and elections was financed through oil-backed borrowing. In addition, during
the period 1999–2001, the oil revenue reported by the treasury fell short by about CFAF 174
billion of the oil companies’ fiscal liabilities to the government, as stipulated in the
production-sharing contracts. This was related to the use of extrabudgetary resources to
finance reconstruction and humanitarian projects, as well as sovereignty-related outlays, such
as elections, security, and national reconciliation.
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
8.
The return of peace has stimulated economic activity in the non-oil sector,
particularly in agriculture, forestry, trade, and transportation. Non-oil real GDP grew by
about 6 percent in 2003. The consumer price inflation rate decelerated to 1.6 percent in 2003
from 3.1 percent in 2002 as a result of the strengthening of the euro and the regular supply of
consumer goods, attributable to the resumption of rail traffic between Pointe-Noire and
Brazzaville. In the oil sector, high world prices have offset the decline in production, thereby
increasing government oil revenue. These additional resources have helped finance an
appreciable expansion of the public investment program. In 2003, for the first time in three
years, credit to the private sector grew faster than non-oil GDP, partly as a result of a catchup to more normal activities.
9.
The fiscal position improved in 2003 compared with 2002, but by less than the
approved budget suggested. The basic primary fiscal surplus increased from 1.2 percent of
GDP in 2002 to 6.8 percent in 2003 (the 2003 budget had targeted a surplus of 9.3 percent).
The improvement in the fiscal balance in 2003 is essentially attributable to the reduction of
total expenditure and higher-than-expected oil revenue. The main budget execution
weaknesses included, inter alia, weak tax revenue collection, larger-than-expected transfers,
and unbudgeted payments for domestic arrears related to both the social sector and
reconstruction investment. However, for the first time in two decades, the government did
not resort to collateralized borrowing against future oil revenue, and, as a result of payments

- 51 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

made in 2003, the stock of such debt is now smaller. In light of the exceptionally high debt
service related to those loans in 2003, the government was, however, obliged to defer to 2004
a number of payments due.
10.
The external current account was in broad balance in 2003; indeed, oil exports,
expressed in CFA francs, fell only slightly compared with 2002, as the decline in oil
production was offset by the rise in oil prices, while public sector imports and external debt
service decreased. Faced by the deterioration in the Congo’s rate of external reserves
coverage (and even though for all Central African Economic and Monetary Community—
CEMAC—countries combined the rate was 64 percent), the regional head office of the Bank
of Central African States (BEAC) in Yaoundé tightened its control of private sector current
transfers and gradually reduced, to zero in June 2003, the threshold above which its prior
authorization is required. Nevertheless, the BEAC head office decided to relax this policy as
of January 2004, and the rate of acceptance of transfer requests has increased.
11.
The large volume of external debt arrears remains an obstacle to the full
normalization of relations between the Republic of Congo and its creditors. Indeed, on
December 31, 2003, the stock of public external debt totaled approximately US$7 billion
(185 percent of GDP), about 65 percent of which represented arrears. However, efforts were
made in 2003 to (i) ensure the regular and timely payment of the current maturities of service
on the debt that is not eligible for rescheduling (except for one Paris Club creditor who
received only a portion of the service due on its post-cutoff-date debt), and (ii) begin paying
off the stock of external arrears to multilateral creditors.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM IN 2003
12.
The Congolese government recognizes that, overall, performance under the SMP
covering the period January-September 2003 was unsatisfactory. The program was
implemented vigorously in the first quarter of 2003, but performance deteriorated steadily in
the following two quarters.
13.
Fiscal performance was generally weak (Table 1); indeed, the basic primary fiscal
surplus, adjusted to take account of favorable trends in oil prices compared with program
estimates, fell short of the program objective by about CFAF 57 billion between January and
September 2003 (2.8 percent of annual GDP). This shortfall was primarily a result of five
factors: (i) the shortfall in nonoil revenue; (ii) transfers to the national oil refinery (CORAF)
not foreseen under the program; (iii) failure by the national oil company (SNPC) to transfer
to the state treasury on a timely basis oil revenue due to the government; (iv) higher-thanprogrammed subsidization of petroleum products; and (v) prices realized by the SNPC on the
sale of the fiscal oil it received on behalf of the government that were below the reference
price. In addition, the exceptional oil revenue derived from the settlement of a dispute
between the Congolese government and private oil companies (representing 1.3 percent of
GDP) and unprogrammed oil bonus and dividend yields (equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP)
were used for the unplanned clearance of large amounts of domestic arrears related to the
social sector and public reconstruction projects.

- 52 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

14.
On the structural side, performance was mixed (Tables 2 and 3). Noteworthy progress
was achieved with the completion in July 2003 of the audit of the SNPC’s 1999–2001
accounts. Considerable efforts were made to centralize public revenue and expenditure in the
budget; to stop incurring debt collateralized by future oil revenue; and, for the first time in
two decades, to publish in the interest of transparency, oil sector data and improve the
macroeconomic statistics. In addition, the external payment arrears owed to a few
multilateral institutions were cleared. On the other hand, the Congo paid only about
80 percent of the current service due on the 2003 debt not eligible for rescheduling; the
privatization of Crédit pour Agriculture, l’Industrie, et le Commerce (CAIC) was not
completed; and certain other measures planned for end-September 2003 to increase oil sector
transparency (the publication of production-sharing contracts, the SNPC’s 2003 budget, and
the audit report on the SNPC’s 2001 accounts) were not implemented.
V. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003
15.
The government took measures to stabilize the fiscal position, and progress was made
in the implementation of structural measures in the last quarter of 2003 (Tables 4 and 5). The
basic primary fiscal balance target was slightly exceeded as a result of higher oil revenue and
the savings on transfers and investment expenditure. However, unprogrammed expenses
were made in the fourth quarter, in particular for the payment of pension arrears and to cover
the costs of structural reforms (CFAF 8 billion). The certification by an external auditor of
government oil revenue for the period January-September 2003 is an important step toward
oil sector transparency. Other structural reforms in the fiscal area have been implemented,
including the following: (i) the appointment of new directors in the General Directorates of
Budget, Customs, and Taxes, as well as at the General Inspectorate of Finance, to
reinvigorate the revenue departments and strengthen control; (ii) the signing of the
government/SNPC/CORAF agreement, which drastically reduced the subsidies to be paid to
CORAF; and (iii) the production of the 2000 budget review law (Loi de règlement).
VI. POVERTY REDUCTION FRAMEWORK AND MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY
16.
The government is determined to place poverty reduction at the center of its strategy.
The primary objectives of this policy can be found in the interim poverty reduction strategy
paper (I-PRSP) being drafted by the government. To achieve these objectives, the
government is targeting an average real growth rate of about 3½-4 percent during the period
2004–06. The expected upturn in oil production and sound performance by the non-oil
sectors, in particular agriculture, forestry, and the processing industries, will contribute to this
growth. The rate of inflation is projected at 2 percent on average over the period, assuming
sound fiscal policy, the pursuit of a prudent monetary policy by the BEAC, and a smooth
traffic flow between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville. Following the expected increase in oil and
non-oil exports, the current account balance should improve over the medium term.
17.
The government will in the future avoid procyclical fiscal expenditure related to oil
revenue. It expects to achieve this objective, starting in 2005, by adopting a rule for
forecasting oil revenue that is based on prudent price assumptions and by gradually

- 53 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

establishing a medium-term public expenditure framework consistent with the objectives of
the I-PRSP. Clear rules for the allocation of budgetary resources will be established, and
special attention will be paid to the fiscal deficit, with a view to reducing government
borrowing gradually. In addition, nonpriority current expenditure will be better controlled
through (i) the revival of the mechanism of quarterly ceilings for each ministry, strengthened
as of 2004 by a new budgetary commitment procedure based on the weekly availability of
resources, and (ii) the ongoing enhancement of the tracking of “service performed.”
18.
In the next few years, the public investment program financed with domestic
resources will be dominated by a few major projects with the following priority objectives:
(i) to ensure a regular supply of electricity in the country (the building of Imboulou Dam and
restoration of the Mokoukoulou Dam); (ii) to strengthen the public infrastructure and open up
the interior of the country (road networks and Ollombo Airport); (iii) to improve basic social
services; and (iv) to enhance infrastructure in local communities (safe water, schools, and
dispensaries).
19.
In order to ensure the financing of its development and poverty reduction program,
the government plans to maximize the mobilization of domestic resources. In this regard, the
ratio of non-oil revenue to non-oil GDP is expected to rise from 17.6 percent in 2003 to
19.5 percent by 2007. In addition, the government plans to undertake the regular and efficient
monitoring of oil receipts due by oil companies to the state treasury. The government will
ensure that all the revenue generated by the settlement of the disputes with the oil companies
is transferred to the treasury and shown in the budget. In 2003, exceptional oil revenue from
the settlement of the disputes with one oil company totaled US$215 million, US$145 million
of which was paid during the year in cash and in increased oil rights.
VII. OBJECTIVES FOR 2004
20.
The principal quantitative targets for 2004 are as follows: (i) real economic growth of
3.6 percent, (ii) an annual average inflation rate of 2 percent, (iii) a basic primary fiscal
balance representing 5.8 percent of GDP, and (iii) a current account deficit equal to
1.5 percent of GDP.
21.
The government program agreed with the Fund was prepared on the basis of revenue
estimates totaling CFAF 585.6 billion (27.3 percent of GDP). The petroleum sector revenue
estimate is based on the assumption of a volume of oil production totaling 84.3 million
barrels, a world price of US$28.7 dollars a barrel, and an exchange rate of
CFAF 515.5 = US$1. The government is committed to using additional oil receipts resulting
from higher-than-programmed prices to finance the budgetary gap, as well as to accelerating
external arrears payments in its efforts to normalize relations with creditors. Non-oil revenue
is estimated to reach CFAF 200 billion (18.2 percent of nonoil GDP). In the event that the oil
price or the non-oil revenue is lower than envisaged, the government will take the necessary
actions to lower expenditures via a revised budget law.

- 54 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

22.
Efforts are under way to make poverty reduction and the strict control of
unproductive expenditures the main aim of public expenditure policy. The expected rise in
the wage bill (approximately CFAF 4 billion more in 2004 than in 2003) is a result of social
sector recruitment plans and the reintegration into the civil service payroll of employees of
the former General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations. Total traditional transfer
payments are expected to increase considerably relative to 2003, principally owing to the
establishment of institutions in support of democratization, including the Audit Office, the
High Court of Justice, the National Commission on Human Rights, and the Economic and
Social Council.
23.
Domestic payment arrears are to be settled in an equitable and transparent manner.
All domestic payment arrears of a commercial nature as of end-2002 have been audited. The
government plans to complement this work with an audit of social debt and the adoption and
publication of a policy and settlement plan for all domestic arrears. The implementation of
this plan will follow budgetary procedures and will depend on the availability of financial
resources. To improve the social environment for productive activity, the government signed
with the unions a “social truce,” whereby gradual payment of wage and retirement pension
arrears will begin in 2004. To this end, the 2004 budget law provides for the payment of
CFAF 23.3 billion to wage earners and retirees and a package of CFAF 15 billion for the
settlement of other domestic priority arrears.
24.
For 2004, a residual financing gap is projected (excluding treatment of the stock of
external arrears and current service due on reschedulable external debt), totaling CFAF 30.2
billion. The government expects that this gap will be financed through (i) budgetary support
from development partners; and (ii) the release of residual resources from the legal
settlement of disputes with a private oil company. In the event that these resources are not all
forthcoming or prove insufficient to bridge the gap, the government has drawn up a
contingency list of expenditure items, the execution of which will be deferred.
VIII. STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
25.
The new SMP covers the period January-June 2004. The two principal pillars of the
new program relate to the strengthening of fiscal discipline and transparency in fiscal
management, particularly in the oil sector (Tables 6 and 7; see paras. 23-29 of the technical
memorandum of understanding for the technical details of the structural measures).
A. Fiscal Policy
26.
Fiscal policy is being implemented in line with the spirit of the 2004 budget law, that
is, it will seek to increase non-oil revenue and ensure strict expenditure management.
27.
As regards oil revenue, the government is committed to ensuring that all revenue
payable to the state is immediately transferred to the treasury. Oil revenue estimates and the
sums actually received by the treasury will be systematically cross-checked. To this end, the
size of the staff of the Oil Revenue-Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Finance is to be
increased.

- 55 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

28.
Measures are being taken to achieve a sustained increase in non-oil revenue. In this
regard, the implementation of a customs warehouse and exemption control program has
already started. In addition, by end-July 2004, the principal measures envisaged are as
follows: (i) establishment of the single taxpayer identification number; (ii) introduction of
new computerized customs clearance procedures (SYDONIA); and (iii) establishment of a
computer link between the revenue departments in Pointe Noire and Brazzaville.
29.
Expenditures are to be executed in conformity with normal budgetary procedures.
Accordingly, advance payments and the awarding of contracts by mutual agreement (gré à
gré) will be reduced to a strict minimum. Over time, it is planned that all contracts above
CFAF 10 million will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. In addition, the
Treasury is being strengthened through the assignment by the French Cooperation of public
accounting experts; the January 2004 provisional balance will be available at endMarch 2004. Finally, the government will gradually introduce a functional classification
system for expenditure that will permit the earmarking of a greater portion of public spending
for poverty reduction programs. Preliminary versions of this system for classifying operating
and capital expenditure will be available by June 2004.
B. Oil Sector Reform
30.
The government is convinced that transparency and accountability in oil sector
operations are essential to the improvement of governance and sound fiscal management.
Components of the reforms in this sector are as follows:
•

Maximizing revenue collection. First, the government undertakes to continue the
quarterly certification, by an internationally recognized audit firm with the
collaboration of the Oil Revenue-Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Finance, of oil
revenues, a process started in 2003. Second, a clear policy on dividend payments to
the public treasury by the SNPC will be adopted by the government by end-March
2004. The policy will ensure that the SNPC limits its costs and focuses on its core
activities in order to produce the maximum return on public resources invested in the
oil sector. Third, the government plans to regularly order independent audits of the
costs of oil companies, so as to ensure that the latter pay all their financial liabilities
to the Treasury.

•

Monitoring the SNPC’s operations. The external audit of the SNPC’s 1999-2001
accounts and operations for the government pointed to shortcomings, including in
accounting practices, internal controls, and the provision of information to the
government on the marketing of government oil and financial transactions carried out
for the government. To remedy these shortcomings, a comprehensive action plan is
being drawn up, in consultation with World Bank and IMF staff. Progress made in the
implementation of this plan will be checked through the conclusions of the
recommendations made in the annual external audit reports. A strategy for restoring
the focus of the SNPC on its basic activity will be drafted and adopted by the
government by end-June 2004.

- 56 -

•

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT I

Improving transparency. The government will continue to increase the amount of
information made available to the public through internet sites, including the
publication of the revenue certification reports, information on oil sector operations,
and the external audit reports.

31.
The government undertakes to carry out the reform of the CORAF, subsidies to which
continue to be a drain on the government budget. The financial statements of the CORAF at
end-2002 will be audited in 2004. The results of this audit will help in the preparation of a
reform strategy for the company. Meanwhile, a ceiling of CFAF 8 billion has been set on
budgetary subsidies to this company in the 2004 budget.
32.
Finally, the subsidization of petroleum products will henceforth be established
objectively and managed efficiently. A key objective is to gradually eliminate the subsidies,
while being mindful of the impact on the poorest segments of the population. To this end, the
government will seek the assistance of the World Bank to assess the cost and efficiency of
the current system of setting prices at the pump, including the subsidy granted, and will
propose alternative mechanisms. The study will analyze, among other things, the modalities
of establishing a mechanism for automatic price adjustments, depending on world prices.
Where applicable, it will propose a system of subsidies for the most underprivileged
segments of the population, which are expected to be the most affected by these adjustments.
C. Other Structural Reforms
33.
In the banking sector, the process of privatizing CAIC will be completed by end-June
2004; the participation of the strategic international investor, already approved by the
regional banking supervisory commission (COBAC), is expected to be formalized with the
payment of its capital share. In addition, with technical assistance from the World Bank, the
government will begin discussions on the formulation of a reform policy for the insurance
sector, which is facing serious financial problems. The government recognizes the
importance of the reforms aimed at ensuring the continued growth in the microcredit sector
and the recent expansion of credit to the private sector. To this end, the government will
maintain the tax exemption for microfinance mutual associations, a subsector that has been
flourishing in the postwar period.
34.
Implementation of the program to restructure/privatize public enterprises will
continue with World Bank assistance. The actions envisaged for the short term relate to an
acceleration of the reforms in the water, electricity, telecommunications, and rail transport
sectors. The aim is to improve the quality and lower the cost of these services, so as to make
them more accessible, to promote economic activity, and to improve living conditions for the
people. With respect to rail transport, the bids received for the award of the Chemin de Fer
Congo-Océan (CFCO) concession are being assessed, and the government intends to divest
the operation of this company to the private sector by end-2004.

- 57 -

ATTACHMENT I

IX. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
35.
The capacity-building needs of the Republic of Congo are vast, given the destruction
caused by several years of war. As a result, the implementation of the planned economic
program cannot succeed without substantial assistance from development partners. The
government welcomes the technical assistance already provided by the international
community, including the IMF in the fiscal and statistics areas. However, given the enormous
task at hand in the area of fiscal reform, the government needs long-term resident experts,
including in the areas of tax and customs administration and expenditure programming and
management. The other areas in which the needs are pressing include the following: (i) the
formulation of a strategy to settle domestic and external arrears; (ii) support for the Program
Technical Monitoring Committee, and the Oil Revenue-Monitoring Unit at the Ministry of
Finance; and (iii) the strengthening of control procedures and structures and for inspection in
the revenue departments.
X. PROGRAM MONITORING
36.
The implementation of the program will be monitored on a quarterly basis by means
of the quantitative and structural indicators described in Tables 6 and 7 and the attached
technical memorandum of understanding.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Brazzaville, March 31, 2004
1.
This memorandum establishes the modalities for monitoring the staff-monitored
program agreed between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the government of the
Republic of Congo for the period from January 1 to June 30, 2004.
I. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS
2.

3.

The primary quantitative indicators are the following:
a.

a minimum basic primary fiscal balance, starting January 1, 2004;

b.

a ceiling on the change in the banking system’s net credit to the government
(excluding net IMF credit), starting January 1, 2004;

c.

no new medium- or long-term nonconcessional external debt (including leasing)
contracted or guaranteed by the government, starting January 1, 2004 (indicator
to be monitored continuously);

d.

no new external debt (including leasing) with a maturity of less than one year
contracted or guaranteed by the government, starting January 1, 2004 (indicator
to be monitored continuously);

e.

no new debt collateralized by crude oil deliveries, starting
January 1, 2004 (indicator to be monitored continuously);

f.

payment of a minimum amount of external arrears (floor), starting
January 1, 2004;

g.

no accumulation (in gross value) of new external payment arrears, excluding
external debt service due that is eligible for rescheduling, starting
January 1, 2004 (indicator to be monitored continuously);

h.

a ceiling on payments of domestic debt arrears, starting January 1, 2004; and

i.

no accumulation (in gross value) of new domestic arrears, starting
January 1, 2004.

The other quantitative indicators are as follows:
a.

a minimum threshold for non-oil and nontax revenues, starting January 1, 2004;

b.

a ceiling on the government wage bill, starting January 1, 2004; and

- 69 -

c.

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

a ceiling on public investments financed with domestic resources, starting
January 1, 2004.
II. DEFINITIONS AND COMPUTATION
A. Government, and Basic Primary Fiscal Balance

4.
Unless otherwise indicated, “government” is defined as the central government of the
Republic of Congo. The scope of the government’s fiscal operations table (TOFE) includes
the general budget, the special accounts of the treasury and the government debt management
agency (Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement, CCA).
5.
The government’s basic primary fiscal balance is equal to total revenue excluding
grants, minus total expenditure excluding interest payments and capital expenditure financed
with external resources. It is measured on the basis of the budget execution reported every
month in the TOFE prepared by the Ministry of Finance. At end-2003, the basic primary
fiscal balance was estimated at CFAF 139.1 billion, resulting from total revenue (excluding
grants) of CFAF 603.7 billion and total expenditures (excluding interest on the debt and
capital expenditure financed with external resources) of CFAF 464.6 billion.
6.
The government’s total revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all revenue (tax
revenue, oil revenue, and nontax revenue collected by the treasury). Total revenue also takes
into account the gross revenue of the special accounts. Oil revenue excludes all forms of
prepayment and prefinancing (see definitions below).
7.
Expenditure is valued on a payment order basis. It includes current expenditure,
domestically financed capital expenditure, externally financed capital expenditure, and net
lending. Current expenditure is defined as the difference between total expenditure and
capital expenditure and net lending. Current expenditure is broken down into personnel
expenditure, expenditure on goods and services, interest on the debt (domestic and external),
transfers and subsidies, and other current expenditure.
B. Change in Net Position of the Government
8.
The government’s net position vis-à-vis the banking system (including net IMF
credit) is defined as the balance between the central government’s claims on, and debts to,
domestic banking institutions. The claims of the central government include the cash
balances of the treasury, deposits at the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), deposits at
commercial banks, and central government deposits at the Caisse Nationale d’Épargne
(CNE) and the Centre des Chèques postaux (CCP). Treasury liabilities with the banking
system include BEAC lending (including statutory advances and consolidated advances),
lending from commercial banks (including government securities held by the commercial
banks), and CNE/CCP deposits.
9.
The end-of-period stock of net bank claims on the government, excluding the
counterpart of the use of Fund resources, is valued in accordance with the accounting

- 70 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

framework currently used by the BEAC. At December 31, 2003, these claims amounted to
CFAF 169 billion.
C. Debt and External Arrears
10.
The definition of government used for the external debt performance criterion
includes government, as defined in paragraph 4, and government agencies.
11.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the definitions of “debt” and “concessional
borrowing” are as follows:
a. As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000, debt
will be understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments; and (iii) leases, that is,
arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for
one or more specified periods of time that are generally shorter than the total expected
service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of
all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to
debt.
b. Loan concessionality is assessed on the basis of the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the OECD. A loan is said to be on concessional terms if,
on the initial date of disbursement, the ratio of the present value of the loan,
calculated on the basis of the reference interest rates, to its nominal value is less than
50 percent (i.e., a grant element of at least 50 percent). For debts with a maturity
exceeding 15 years, the ten-year reference interest rate published by the OECD is

- 71 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

used to calculate the grant element. For shorter maturities, the six-month market
reference rate is used.
12.
The indicator with respect to external debt applies not only to debt as defined in
point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has yet been received or on which
only partial drawings have been made. However, this indicator does not apply to financing
from the IMF or to treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the CEMAC regional
market.11
13.
For external debt with a contractual maturity of less than one year, loans associated
with imports and exports are excluded from the scope of the indicator.
14.
The accumulation of external payment arrears is the difference between (i) the gross
amount of external debt service payments due (principal and interest, including penalty
interest, as appropriate) and (ii) the amount actually paid during the period under
consideration. Payment arrears to creditors for which the government is actively seeking debt
relief in good faith are excluded from the external payment arrears for purposes of program
monitoring. The stock of external debt payment arrears is assessed at the end of the period,
and the amounts in foreign currency are converted to CFA francs based on the exchange rates
published by the IMF. Under the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate
external payment arrears on its debt, with the exception of external payment arrears arising
from government debt being renegotiated with external creditors, including bilateral creditors
who are not members of the Paris Club. The accumulation of new arrears is the amount due
but unpaid on the due dates during the period of the program. Nonaccumulation of external
payments arrears is an indicator to be continuously monitored.
D. Oil-Backed External Debt
15.
Prefinancing is defined as a loan backed by oil, that is, advances of money to the
debtor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the debtor will surrender to the
creditor at a future date the equivalent in oil of the loan plus interest and other fees; the loan
is repaid by the sale of the oil in a different fiscal year. New prefinancing (excluding
refinancing operations of the existing stock12 and/or deferral of the service due) is strictly
prohibited under the program. The refinancing operation and/or deferrals should not give rise
to the augmentation of the existing stock of oil-backed debt.

11

Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the CEMAC (Central Africa Economic
and Monetary Community) regional market are excluded from the external debt.
12

The stock of oil-collateralized debt amounted to CFAF 236 billion at end-December 2003,
and the government plans to pay down CFAF 54.4 billion in 2004 on this category of debt.

- 72 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

16.
A prepayment is an advance of money (from the oil trader) to the government on oil
cargoes intended purely for commercial purposes, with a maximum repayment period of six
months. This type of financing is designed to enhance cash flow by offsetting any
misalignments in receipts and disbursements of funds. Prepayment-related operations must
be unwound in the calendar year to which they apply. They are recorded in the accounts as
follows:
•

At the time the prepayment is obtained, the amounts received are recorded as positive
financing (drawings); the amounts corresponding to commissions are recorded as
current expenditure.

•

The advance is repaid by the sale of the oil; at the time of the repayment transaction,
the revenue derived from the sale of the oil is recorded as final oil revenue accruing to
the treasury and the amount of the repayment is posted as negative financing
(repayment).
E. Arrears and Domestic Debt

17.
Cumulative ceilings on domestic payment arrears are fixed. These arrears cover back
pay, overdue payments to pension funds, and the audited domestic commercial debt. This
latter category of debt is based on the complete list of arrears due at end-2003, which was
provided to the IMF. The authorities intend to begin implementing the “social truce”
negotiated with the labor unions; when it ends, the outstanding debt on wages and pensions
will be settled. Budget appropriations to cover arrears are estimated at CFAF 23.3 billion in
2004—CFAF 14.5 billion for wages in arrears and CFAF 8.8 billion to pay the arrears owed
to pension funds (treasury correspondents). Furthermore, a CFAF 15 billion envelope was
budgeted for a partial payoff of the audited domestic commercial debt.
18.
Net changes in the domestic payment arrears of the central government are equivalent
to the difference over the period between the amount of payments authorized and the actual
payments made (within 45 days). A net reduction in arrears is reflected in the TOFE as a
negative amount and a net accumulation as a positive sum. Payments made by the
government cover payments by the treasury, including through clearing operations.
F. Wage Bill
19.
The wage bill is defined as the total of all government personnel expenditure,
including the wages and statutory benefits of all civil service and military personnel, be they
permanent or temporary. The annual wage bill in 2003 is estimated at CFAF 120.2 billion at
December 31, 2003.
III. ADJUSTMENTS
20.
The basic primary fiscal balance (2a) will be adjusted upward if oil revenue is higher
than projected. Oil revenue is adjusted by multiplying expected revenue by the ratio of the
actual price to the expected price (in CFA francs). This is calculated on a quarterly basis.

- 73 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

21.
If the basic primary budget surplus exceeds the quantitative program indicator (2a)
and/or if additional nonearmarked budgetary support, over and above the program amount,
becomes available, the authorities will use these extra resources to
•
finance the residual budgetary gap;
•

further reduce external payment arrears on debt not eligible for rescheduling; and/or

•

reduce the net claims of the banking system on the government (excluding the
counterpart use of Fund resources).
IV. STRUCTURAL INDICATORS

22.
The structural indicators are laid out in Table 7 of the memorandum on economic and
financial policies.
23.
The certification of oil revenues by an external auditor, based on the terms of
reference of the certification for the third quarter of 2003, will include, inter alia,
(i) verification of the tax declarations of the oil companies, (including compliance with the
terms of production-sharing contracts—CPPs), (ii) reconciliation of the commercial
transactions of the national oil company (SNPC) and the quantity of oil due to the
government in settlement of the oil companies’ tax liabilities (the SNPC included), and (iii)
verification that the corresponding revenue has been transferred to the treasury.
24.
The government’s adoption of an action plan for implementing all the
recommendations of the SNPC audit will be articulated in a letter addressed to the IMF
Managing Director by the supervisory ministers, namely, the Minister of Economy, Finance,
and Budget and the Minister of Hydrocarbons; a copy of the action plan will be attached
thereto.
25.
The government’s adoption of a policy on the payment of dividends by the SNPC will
be done by the supervisory ministers, namely, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of
Hydrocarbons. An independent expert on the Organization for the Harmonization of Business
Law in Africa (OHADA) matters will issue a legal opinion that the policy is consistent with
the laws of the Republic of Congo and the rules and regulations applicable to the SNPC.
26.
Work on the SNPC audit for fiscal-year (FY) 2002 is scheduled to begin no later than
mid-May 2004, with a view to having the final report produced by end-July. For FY 2003,
FY 2004, and FY 2005, a different contract from the one in effect for FY 2002 will be
awarded by end-August 2004, with the terms of reference specifying that the auditors should
submit their final reports for each fiscal year within two months after the SNPC produces its
consolidated accounts. Furthermore, the authorities intend to request that the SNPC
accelerate production of the consolidated accounts to meet the following deadlines: for FY
2003, by end-December 2004; for FY 2004, by end-November 2005; and for FY 2005, by
end-October 2006.

- 74 -

APPENDIX III
ATTACHMENT II

27.
The call for bids for the 2002 financial audit of the national oil refinery (CORAF) is
scheduled for no later than April 15, 2004, and the contract is to be signed by August 31. In
that case, work will start by September 15, and the final report will be submitted to the
Ministry of Finance no later than December 15, 2004.
28.
The consolidated provisional balance sheet of the treasury for January 2004, produced
in March 2004, must show an opening and closing balance, as well as the details of activity
for the period.
29.
The privatization of the CAIC bank will be considered complete once all the capital
of the new bank (La Congolaise des Banques) that will replace it is released and the new
bank becomes operational.

APPENDIX IV

REPUBLIC OF CONGO: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The analysis shows that an unsustainable debt burden would persist into the medium term
even under the assumption of sound policies and the application of full traditional debt relief
mechanisms. The Congo is extremely vulnerable to adverse shocks.
1.
The baseline projections assume the implementation of sound macroeconomic
policies. Oil production is projected to increase steadily until 2010 when it plateaus at
110 million barrels per year (compared to 84 million barrels in 2004) for the remainder of the
projection period. Nonoil real GDP is projected to grow at an average of close to 5 percent
per year, initially on the basis of strong growth in the forestry sector (as current investments
come online) and later in mining and public utilities (as security allows exploration and
public investments come onstream). The current account surplus is projected to rise to about
1 percent of GDP by 2010, primarily due to the increases in oil exports, but over the longer
term, it is projected to be roughly balanced. In the fiscal area, the overall budget balance is
projected to become positive by 2009 on the basis of higher oil revenues and slightly lower
primary current expenditures. Nonoil revenue is projected to rise steadily to about 20 percent
of nonoil GDP by 2010 (from around 18 percent in 2004), and the composition of public
expenditures is expected to shift in favor of capital outlays over the long term.
2.
On external debt, the baseline assumes no debt relief and no settlement of external
arrears. Additionally, new arrears are accumulated on potentially reschedulable debt service,1
late interest on the stock of arrears accrues at market rates, and all new borrowing (including
on financing gaps) is on commercial terms. Under this scenario, the Congo’s external debt to
GDP ratio would remain unsustainable into the long-term with NPV of debt to GDP
remaining in excess of 150 percent by the end of the projection period, 2023 (Table 1). The
debt sustainability indicators worsen slightly when domestic debt is taken into account in the
analysis (Table 2). The results of the stress tests show that the Congo is vulnerable to
external shocks, in particular to the decline in exports and GDP growth, and shortfalls in
primary fiscal balance.
3.
The alternative scenario assumes: (i) a hypothetical Paris Club stock-of-debt
operation on Naples terms—67 percent NPV reduction on eligible debt, including arrears—
and comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors; (ii) settlement of
external arrears at end-2003; and (iii) new borrowing on IDA terms.2 Although the
1

Debt service due to Paris Club creditors on pre-cutoff-date debt, and to other bilateral and
private creditors (excluding debt service on oil-collateralized debt). The creditors of oilcollateralized loans have a legally-binding and direct claim on Congo’s oil shipment as
collateral.
2

It is assumed that half of the financing gap is covered by new concessional borrowings and
the remaining by grants.

- 79 -

APPENDIX IV

application of debt relief induces a significant improvement in the debt indicators (Table 3),
the Congo’s debt would remain unsustainable over the medium term: the key criterion, NPV
of debt-government revenue ratio,3 remains above the 250 percent threshold into 2008.

3

As a very open economy, the Congo would qualify for debt relief under the fiscal window.

Bank of the Central African States: Safeguards Assessment
Introduction
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the common central bank of the Central
African States, which includes the Republic of Congo. A Stage Two (on site) safeguards
assessment of the BEAC was completed in July 2001 and proposed specific remedies to
alleviate vulnerabilities that were identified by staff. The authorities have committed to
implement most of the proposed remedies, as described in the following sections.
Safeguards areas and main remedies
The external audit mechanism: The auditing function and the quality control procedures of
the external auditor are adequate. The safeguards assessment proposed that: (i) the external
auditor refer explicitly to the international standards of auditing (ISA) in its opinion, (ii) the
external auditor become more cognizant of the accounting rules applicable to the recording
of Fund’s balances; and (iii) the BEAC should include the audit opinion in the annual
publication of the financial statements. The management of the BEAC has agreed to
implement these actions for the FY 2002 accounts.
Legal structure and independence: The legislation governing BEAC is adequate.
Financial reporting: The monthly statements of the bank’s financial position are not
published in any form and the December 31, 2000 audited financial statements were not
published in a timely manner. The staff recommended that the BEAC: (i) enhance the
readability and the credibility of the published annual accounts by including detailed
explanatory notes on the accounting methods followed, and if these methods referred
explicitly to a generally accepted accounting framework; (ii) adopt International Accounting
Standards; and (iii) change the accounting of some of its operations with the Fund, especially
with regard to the revaluation of the IMF accounts. The management of the BEAC has
agreed to implement these recommendations by FY 2002.
Internal audit mechanism: The quality of the personnel, the rigorous methods followed for
the audit of branches, the training program in place, and the risk assessment methods in place
are satisfactory. However, certain weaknesses remain and staff recommended that the BEAC:
(i) establish a charter for the Internal Audit Department (IAD); (ii) expand the audit scope
and coverage of IAD to include activities at headquarters; (iii) prepare an annual rolling
multi-year audit program describing risk assessment, activities scheduled, staffing and
financial resources required, and (iv) increase the number of qualified staff.
In its response to the Stage Two report, the management of the BEAC has specifically agreed
to expand the scope and coverage of the audit department, and increase the number of
qualified staff. A charter for the audit department will also be prepared, with the assistance of

- 86 -

APPENDIX V

Fund staff, which will provide the BEAC with the relevant documentation. A gradual
implementation of these recommendations should be completed by end 2002. The
management of the BEAC did not specifically cover in its answer to the report the
recommendation related to the risk-based rolling multi-year audit program.
The system of internal controls: On the whole, the risks are relatively well captured,
although uncertainties exist because of insufficient a posteriori controls exercised on some
activities at headquarters. The bank has a codified system of rules, selects its personnel
carefully, maintains segregation of duties in the branches, and has recently increased
resources for control purposes. Nevertheless, the staff recommended that BEAC: (i)
strengthen the coordination among the audit bodies; (ii) examine in depth the segregation of
duties at headquarters; and (iii) put in place a more systematic follow-up of all
recommendations made by the external auditor to allow the Governor and the Board of
Directors to better exercise their oversight responsibilities.
In its response to the Stage Two report, the management of the BEAC has agreed to establish
an audit committee by 2002. Regarding the proposed segregation of duties, management
noted that an internal assessment was under way, but that for budgetary reasons a formal
audit cannot be undertaken before end-2002.
Regarding late payments of Fund obligations, which was an issue for all of the BEAC’s
member countries at some time in the last three years, the staff concluded that, while the
BEAC’s own payment procedures and related management controls in this area are
functioning adequately, procedures should be modified with respect to BEAC’s relations
with member countries. The staff recommended that the BEAC should repay the Fund
directly using its own resources for those countries with borrowing capacity with the central
bank; for countries facing fiscal difficulties, staff recommended that they at least maintain
sufficient borrowing capacity with the BEAC to repay IMF obligations falling due within the
next year. In its answer to the Stage Two Report, the management of the BEAC did not
follow the mission’s recommendation that the BEAC should repay the Fund directly. The
management also commented that apart from direct statutory advances to Treasuries, the
BEAC could not grant loans to member countries.

APPENDIX VI

Republic of Congo: Statistical Issues
1.
The Republic of Congo’s statistical infrastructure is being slowly rebuilt after the
civil strife of 1997 and December 1998–October 1999, during which severe damage on
administrative infrastructure was inflicted and many records were lost. The current coverage
of the Congo’s statistics is described below. Social statistics are weak. Since October 2001, a
resident statistical expert has been assisting the authorities with the macroeconomic statistics.
2.
A multisector mission that visited Brazzaville in May 2002 prepared a diagnostic of
the statistical system. The mission’s general conclusion was that the Congo’s macroeconomic
statistics are weak and suffer from the absence of a national statistical program, and
shortages of financial, physical, and human resources. It recommended measures for
improvement, which are being followed up by the statistical advisor.
3.
The Republic of Congo is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB) on November 5, 2003.
National accounts
4.
The quality of national accounts data is weak. The compiled data show
inconsistencies, both internally and with the balance of payments. Estimates for the informal
sector are based on information that dates back to 1978. The authorities provide Fund
missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and sectors, both in nominal and real
terms. These data are prepared by the Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry
of Finance. Historically, data on oil sector transactions have been weak, reflecting a lack of
transparency on the part of the oil companies operating in the country and the government
agencies dealing with them.
Employment and unemployment
5.
Annual data on employment in the central government are available from the
Ministry of Finance, but they are not consistent with data from the civil service roster of the
Ministry of the Civil Service. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of
the post-conflict program, the government completed an audit of public service employees
and established a new civil service payroll roster. Data on employment in the private sector
are not available.
Prices
6.
Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are recorded for
the capital city of Brazzaville (weights for 1977 and price reference period of December
1977) and the second-largest city of Pointe Noire (price reference period of January 1996 and
weights for 1989). Weights no longer reflect current household consumption patterns. Data

- 88 -

APPENDIX VI

are compiled on a monthly basis. The authorities intend to compile a CPI that is harmonized
with other CEMAC countries.
Government accounts
7.
Compilation of government finance statistics (GFS) is neither comprehensive nor
systematic. The Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’État (TOFE) is based on several
disparate sources rather than a comprehensive set of accounting statements. Financing data
are currently obtained from money and banking data instead of the government accounts. As
a result, intersectoral consistency between government finance and money and banking
statistics cannot be ascertained, impeding the assessment of accuracy of these data.
8.
At the time of the May 2002 multisector mission, the Balance des comptes du Trésor,
a basic and essential treasury source document, as well as other sources, were not made
available to the producers of the TOFE.16 The mission recommended that systematic
procedures be established for the compilation of government finance statistics, based, to the
extent possible, on a unified set of accounting and administrative records.
9.
TOFE compilers do not have access to relevant financial statements of the Société
Nationale des Pétroles Congolais (SNPC), which carries out several operations on behalf of
the government (notably in the oil sector).
10.
In 2003, the Congo reported GFS to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook using
the new GFSM 2001 template. The Congo does not report subannual GFS data for
publication in IFS. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported to the Fund should be
carried out in close cooperation with the compilers of the TOFE.
11.
Progress is underway to address these shortcomings. In February/March 2003, a FAD
follow-up mission found that most of the recommendations of the 2001 FAD mission on
expenditure management, in particular with regard to the centralization of all government
revenue and execution of public expenditure through the budget, are being implemented or
are underway and steps have been taken to computerize the expenditure chain.
Monetary accounts
12.
Monthly data on monetary statistics for the Congo, as well as for the other members
of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are regularly
reported to the Fund in electronic form by the regional central bank (BEAC). Accuracy of
monetary data is affected by large cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC
16

This compilation is not undertaken on the basis of treasury accounting records, to which the compilers
themselves do not have access. The mission examined the Excel worksheet used for the compilation of the
TOFE and made recommendations for improvements, although it could not establish the links between that
worksheet and the primary data sources.

- 89 -

APPENDIX VI

member countries. However, the Congo is moderately affected by such movements:
7.5 percent of banknotes issued in the Congo by the BEAC national directorate circulate in
Cameroon and about 3.5 percent in Gabon, while currency in circulation in the Congo
includes about 6.5 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and about 3.5 percent from Gabon.
13.
The monetary and financial statistics mission that visited the BEAC headquarters
(May 2001) provided technical assistance on the compilation and timeliness of monetary
statistics. The mission discussed an action plan for the implementation of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the introduction of an area-wide page in IFS for
the CEMAC. Following the 2001 mission, a regional workshop on monetary and financial
statistics was organized by the BEAC in Libreville (Gabon) in May 2002 to support the
implementation of the MFSM in the CEMAC countries. The new page for CEMAC was
published in the January 2003 issue of IFS.
14.
The May 2002 multisector mission found that the institutional coverage of
government and of nonfinancial public sector in monetary statistics are outdated and need to
be revised.
External and domestic debt
15.
The Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA) produces comprehensive data on the
outstanding stock of external public debt, including arrears and its composition, together with
detailed projections on debt service due. These data are provided to Fund missions. However,
the debt-stock data cannot be reconciled with flow data in the balance of payments. The CCA
also produces domestic debt data.
Balance of payments and trade statistics
16.
As in other CEMAC countries, the national agency of the BEAC is responsible for
the collection and the dissemination of balance of payments data in the Congo. The balance
of payments statistics are prepared on an annual basis while the compilation system has been
specifically designed to produce quarterly data. Through 1994, balance of payments data
were compiled in the framework of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fourth Edition. The
BEAC provides annual data on exports of goods and services and on capital flows other than
public debt. Since 1995, data are being prepared using the Balance of Payments Manual,
Fifth Edition. In 2003, balance of payments data for 1995 through 2002 were reported to the
Fund for publication in International Financial Statistics.
17.
In May 2002, the technical assistance mission found the compilation system and
procedures for balance of payments statistics to be conceptually sound but flawed in their
application due to the absence of documented sources and methods, understaffing, and lack
of training. This situation has resulted in significant delays in the production of balance of
payments statistics and, in general, poor monitoring of the quality of the input data provided
by the statistical respondents. Furthermore, the opacity surrounding certain transactions in
the oil sector introduces an important element of imprecision. In addition, net investment

- 90 -

APPENDIX VI

flows are overestimated by significant unrecorded disinvestment operations that are part of
the tax regime arrangements obtained by oil-drilling nonresident companies.
18.
The Fund’s resident expert on statistics, who took up his assignment at end-October
2001, has been assisting the authorities in developing an appropriate methodology for
compiling balance of payments statistics. This resulted in improved data communication in
2003 and balance of payments detailed data were submitted for the period 1995–2002.
Public enterprise sector
19.
There is no centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public
enterprises. However, some information has been made available to Fund missions by
individual enterprises.

Republic of Congo: Core Statistical Indicators

- 91 APPENDIX VI

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 10, 2004
1.
This supplement contains information on recent economic developments in the
Republic of Congo since the circulation of the staff report for the 2004 Article IV
consultation and new staff-monitored program. The information does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
2.
The implementation of the staff-monitored program (SMP) was broadly satisfactory
through end-April (see Appendix III of the staff report for the details of the SMP).
•

All end-March quantitative targets were met. In particular, the primary fiscal balance
was met by a comfortable margin owing to higher-than-projected non-oil revenues
and enhanced expenditure control. No new domestic arrears were accumulated. In
addition, external debt service payments due to multilateral institutions and Paris
Club creditors on post-cutoff-date debt were made on a timely basis and the ceiling
on domestic arrears payments was respected.

•

Most structural targets were met. Particularly noteworthy were the external
certification of oil revenues in 2003 and the adoption of an action plan for the reform
of the accounts and operations of the national oil company (SNPC), as well as
publication on an internet site (www.congo-site.cg) of the above-mentioned SNPC
action plan, the reports from the oil revenue certification, and parts of the 1999–2001
audit of the SNPC. However, three structural measures were only partially
implemented. First, not all of the production sharing agreements (PSAs) with oil
companies already published in the official gazette were posted on the internet.
Second, the information published on financial transactions carried out by the SNPC
on behalf of the government in 2002–03 was incomplete, especially with respect to
interest costs and commissions. Third, while significant progress has been made in
centralizing revenues at the treasury, forestry tax revenues (which represent about
6 percent of non-oil revenues) have yet to be transferred to the treasury. The
government plans to rapidly take corrective actions on all these measures.

3.
On the basis of the broadly satisfactory implementation of the SMP through
end-April, the staff initiated negotiations in May 2004 on a program that could potentially be
supported by a new three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). The conclusion of these negotiations with a recommendation in support of such a
new arrangement would be conditional on (i) continued good implementation under the SMP
through end-June 2004, (ii) completion of all the SMP structural measures,
(iii) implementation of possible prior actions to be determined in the course of the PRGF
negotiations, and (iv) obtaining full financing assurances. In addition, staff would need to
have adequate information on the 2003 financial settlement between the government and an
international oil company.

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Congo
On June 10, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo.1
Background
The gradual reestablishment of political stability and democratic institutions over the past four
years has generated a sense of guarded optimism that the Congo is on the cusp of a structural
break from the previous pattern of intermittent outbreaks of civil conflict. Over the past year,
security improvements have been consolidated by the launch of the demobilization program for
former combatants, and further progress has been registered with respect to the reestablishment
of democratic institutions.
In the context of improved security, the pace of economic activity in the non-oil sector has
increased (particularly in agriculture, commerce, and transportation). Non-oil real GDP increased
by about 10 percent per annum on average during 2000–03. Consumer price inflation
decelerated significantly in the postwar period, helped by a more reliable supply line from PointeNoire to Brazzaville and a strengthening of the euro.
Nonetheless, key social indicators have continued to deteriorate, and the external debt burden is
heavy.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2The fiscal position in 2003 improved from the exceptionally poor performance of 2002, but the
underlying fiscal effort was weak relative to the 2003 budget. Higher-than-budgeted oil revenue,
together with lower-than-budgeted investment and interest expenditures, generated an
improvement in the overall fiscal balance to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003 (from–8.1 percent in
2002). However, effective budget execution was hampered by weaknesses in expenditure
controls, ineffectual treasury management, and delays in the implementation of non-oil revenue
measures. A significant amount of windfall oil revenue was used to pay unbudgeted domestic
commercial arrears. Steps were taken later in 2003 to start correcting these deficiencies.
In an encouraging sign of a pickup in non-oil sector activity, credit to the economy grew in 2003 at
a faster rate than non-oil GDP for the first time in three years. Nonetheless, bank deposits
decreased by 8 percent in 2003, partly in response to the difficulties in effecting current transfers.
The recent privatization of the last remaining state-owned bank, Crédit pour l’Agriculture,
l’Industrie et le Commerce (CAIC), in early 2004, coupled with the expected continued
improvement in non-oil sector activity, should strengthen confidence in the banking sector.
The external current account remained relatively unchanged, with a surplus of 0.3 percent of
GDP registered in 2003. The decline in oil export value, owing to a contraction in production that
was only partially offset by higher prices, was offset by lower government imports and interest
due on external debt. The authorities made efforts in 2003 to start normalizing relations with
external creditors by (i) remaining current on debt-service payments to multilateral and Paris Club
creditors (with the exception of one bilateral creditor), and (ii) clearing arrears to a few multilateral
creditors. The Congo remains a heavily indebted country, with an external debt stock equivalent
to about 185 percent of GDP at end-2003, two-thirds of which represents arrears.
On the structural front, performance was mixed in 2003. The audit of the SNPC for fiscal years
1999-2001 was completed, efforts were made to centralize government revenues, no new
oil-collateralized debt was contracted, and initiatives were launched to publish oil sector data.
Nonetheless, the privatization of the remaining publicly owned bank (CAIC) was delayed, and the
end-September 2003 measures on oil sector transparency were not implemented. In the last
quarter of 2003, a significant step was taken to enhance transparency in the oil sector with the
completion of the certification by an external auditor of government oil revenue for 2003.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress toward political stability in the Republic of Congo as
well as the improvements in security. Directors commended the authorities for the strengthening
of the macroeconomic situation, marked by strong growth in economic activity, including in the
non-oil sector, and the easing of inflationary pressures. They noted, however, that the fiscal
outturn in 2003 was weak compared with the budget, notwithstanding some improvement relative
to 2002, that key social indicators have continued to deteriorate, and that the external debt
burden remains heavy. Building on recent positive steps aimed at ensuring that the Congo’s
resources are effectively harnessed for the benefit of all its people, Directors encouraged the
government to broaden ownership of the reform program further and to press ahead with crucial
reform measures in order to lay the basis for sustained growth and poverty reduction.

-3-

Directors expressed concern about the considerable shortfalls in economic performance in 2003
vis-à-vis the objectives embedded in the staff-monitored program (SMP). Most Directors
considered that the opportunity provided by favorable oil market developments could have been
used more effectively to reduce external arrears and normalize relations with the international
community. A few Directors supported the authorities’ decision to use part of the oil windfall to
clear some domestic arrears. Directors welcomed the progress made in advancing structural
reforms in some areas. However, they felt that more could have been done in implementing
reforms in key areas, including oil sector transparency and the privatization of a publicly-owned
commercial bank. They also expressed concern over the accrual of new external arrears that
cannot be re-scheduled, and urged the authorities to remain current on amounts falling due to
multilateral creditors and on Paris Club post cut-off debt claims.
Directors stressed the need to improve fiscal management and adopt a more comprehensive
medium-term framework, particularly in light of the formidable challenges posed by the heavy
reliance on oil revenues. They also stressed the importance of strengthening non-oil revenue
collection, including by reducing the widespread use of ad hoc tax and customs exemptions, and
by centralizing revenue collection at the treasury. On the expenditure side, Directors urged the
authorities to increase poverty-related spending, which would require reducing unproductive
transfers and carefully selecting investment projects. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to
adopt a fiscal rule to project oil revenues and to program expenditures based on conservative oil
price projections, and highlighted the need for complementary measures to ensure that any
windfall revenues are used in a clear and transparent manner.
Directors noted the importance of creating an environment favorable to private sector business
and investment activity in order to promote economic diversification. They stressed the need to
prevent further erosion in the competitiveness of the non-oil sector. In this context, Directors
urged the authorities to exercise vigilance on the fiscal front and to take steps to reduce the high
costs of doing business in the Congo.
Directors welcomed recent efforts to enhance transparency in the oil sector. They commended
the authorities for the completion of the external audit of the national oil company (SNPC),
covering the fiscal years 1999-2001; the external certification of oil revenues in 2003; and the
publication of key oil sector data on the internet. Nevertheless, Directors noted that the audit of
the SNPC had revealed weaknesses in management and accounting practices as well as severe
limitations in access to information, and they urged the authorities to improve the auditors’ access
to information for the 2002 audit. Directors urged timely implementation of the action plan
adopted by SNPC so that future audits may provide a more accurate picture of the company’s
financial operations. They also encouraged the authorities to continue to publish the production
sharing agreements between the government and the oil companies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their structural reform agenda.
In particular, they stressed the need to strengthen governance and the rule of law, and welcomed
the preparation of the anticorruption program. Directors recommended addressing issues of
property rights, including establishing a land title system. They urged renewed efforts to

-4restructure the large public enterprises, particularly those expected to provide essential services.
Directors welcomed the recent privatization of the remaining publicly-owned commercial bank,
but noted that further efforts were needed to strengthen the financial sector. To allow commercial
banks to play a more effective role in economic development, they noted that it was essential to
address structural impediments to commercial bank lending to the private sector, in particular the
weaknesses in the legal framework. Directors also called for forceful implementation of the
regional framework on laws to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Looking forward, Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed determination to establish a track
record of policy performance including maintaining orderly relations with external creditors that
could allow the Congo to move to a Fund-supported program. They were encouraged by the
satisfactory results in the first quarter of 2004 under the six-month SMP. To ensure the support of
the international community, including for possible debt relief, Directors stressed that enhanced
public access to oil sector information should be a key aspect of a strategy to broaden ownership
of the reform program, lower the probability of future conflicts, and enhance accountability. To this
end, they emphasized the need for full transparency on all oil-related transactions.
They welcomed the authorities’ decision to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI).
Directors encouraged the authorities to finalize preparation of the interim poverty reduction
strategy paper (I-PRSP), implement a functional budget classification system to help monitor
poverty-related outlays, and carry out the poverty-related surveys necessary to improve the social
database.
Directors welcomed ongoing improvements of the statistical database, including the recent
decision to participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System and the budgetary
increases for statistical development. They urged the authorities to continue to expand further the
coverage of the national statistics, including with respect to the coverage of the oil sector and
poverty monitoring, and to make full use of the technical assistance from the Fund and other
development partners.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for the Republic of Congo
June 10, 2004

I would like to express my appreciation to Fund management and staff for the support
and valuable advice provided to my Congolese authorities in the design and implementation
of their economic adjustment programs. The comprehensive staff report and the selected
issues paper offer a useful guidance to my authorities for advancing economic adjustment
and structural reforms.
The Republic of Congo, a post-conflict country, is emerging from a decade-long
political instability, characterized by three successive civil conflicts in the 1990s. These
episodes of political turmoil have entailed considerable costs to the country. They have
imposed tremendous suffering on the population, in terms of loss of life, exodus of a portion
of the population, and destruction of entire villages, exacerbating poverty and weakening key
social indicators. They have inflicted serious damages to the economy and the basic
infrastructure, and have led to a weakening of key institutions. Moreover, sanitary and health
conditions have deteriorated and the country’s external debt burden is heavy. Poor economic
conditions have led to a significant impoverishment of the population, and the spread of the
HIV/AIDS endemics and other diseases. In evaluating the Congo’s economic performance, it
is important to bear in mind these daunting constraints and adverse conditions.
Following the completion of a four-year transition period by end-August 2002,
including the installation of democratic institutions, the signing of the peace agreements with
rebel groups in 1999 and 2003, political stability and security have improved, contributing to
the pick up of economic activity in the non-oil sector and to the deceleration of inflation.
With the completion of the democratization process and peace in 2002, a new government
began to implement a policy agenda known as New Hope (Nouvelle Espérance). In that
context, the authorities adopted and implemented a staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2003,
initially covering the first half of 2003 and then extended to September of the same year.
Despite difficulties, the implementation of this program helped the authorities to make
progress in improving transparency and governance in the oil sector. Important achievements
include the completion of the audit of national oil company, SNPC, for 1999-2001,
centralization of government revenue, non-contraction of new oil-collateralized debt, and the
publication of oil sector data on an internet site (www.congo-site.cg). Also encouraging
were the observance in the last quarter of 2003 of the basic primary budget balance objective
and certification of government oil revenue by an external auditor.
In order to consolidate the positive results achieved in late 2003 and stabilize the
macroeconomic environment, the authorities adopted and are implementing a new SMP,
covering the period of January-June 2004. Up to April 2004, the implementation of
quantitative and structural indicators is broadly satisfactory. The authorities are determined to
place poverty reduction at the center of their medium-term strategy. In this regard, an interim
poverty reduction strategy paper is at an advanced stage of preparation, and is being
conducted through a participatory process.

-2With the return of more stable conditions, my authorities are determined to strengthen
the adjustment process and establish a strong track record under the 2004 SMP. Their aim is
also to enable the Republic of Congo to receive Fund support under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), and to qualify for assistance under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative, so as to bring the country’s heavy debt burden to sustainable
levels, and increase pro-poor outlays. To help them achieve their objectives, both technical
and financial assistance from the international community will be of critical importance.
I. Recent developments and performance under the 2003 SMP
Developments on the political and security front are encouraging. The political
transition period, which started at the end of the war in 1997, was completed in August 2002,
after the presidential, legislative and communal elections. A peace agreement was signed
between the government and the remainder of the rebel groups in March 2003, pursuant to
which demilitarization, demobilization, and reintegration operations of former combatants
started. With the improvement in security, displaced persons have returned to their villages,
and all sites for internally displaced people were closed in May 2004. My authorities are
appreciative of the support received from multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental
organizations for care and resettlement of these persons. Moreover, the railway service
between Pointe-Noire, the main sea port and Brazzaville has resumed its normal activity. To
consolidate the gains being made and ensure lasting political stability, the authorities are
strengthening the institutional framework, through the establishment of the Audit Office, the
Economic and Social Council, and the Constitutional Court.
Economic activity in the non-oil sector continued to be strong in 2003, driven by
favorable developments in agriculture, forestry, trade and transportation. Non-oil real GDP
increased by about 5.3 percent in 2003. With regard to the oil sector, high world prices have
compensated for the decline in production, leading to an increase in the government oil
revenue. These additional resources were used to finance urgent reconstruction needs.
Inflation decelerated to 1.2 percent from 3.1 percent in 2002, reflecting the recovery of food
production; the regular supply of consumer goods, attributable to the resumption of rail
traffic between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville; and the strengthening of the euro. Moreover,
for the first time in three years, credit to the private sector increased faster than non-oil GDP,
reflecting a catch-up to a more reliable economic activity.
Fiscal performance improved in 2003, although it remained below the objective of
the approved budget. The basic primary surplus increased from 1.2 of GDP in 2002 to 6.8
percent in 2003. This encouraging upturn was due to lower-than-expected expenditures and
higher-than-expected oil revenue, leading to a significant improvement in the overall fiscal
balance in 2003. Moreover, the authorities have taken corrective measures to address
difficulties encountered in the collection of non-oil revenue and the management of treasury
resources.
The monetary policy implemented by the regional central bank, BEAC, has served
the country well. Reflecting a pickup in non-oil sector activity, credit to the economy
increased at a faster rate than non-oil GDP growth for the first time in three years. The recent

-3privatization of the remaining state-owned bank, Crédit pour l’Agriculture, l’Industrie et le
Commerce (CAIC), together with the expectations that activity in the non-oil sector will
continue to improve, augurs well for ensuring a healthy banking system in the Congo.
Regarding the external sector, the Congo’s external debt, currently estimated at 185
percent of the GDP, remains a heavy burden on the country’s limited finances. Moreover,
two-thirds of the external stock of debt represents arrears. Despite their limited resources,
the authorities have started to normalize relations with external creditors, notably by
remaining current on debt-service payments to multilateral institutions and Paris Club
creditors on post-cutoff-date debt, and by clearing arrears to a few multilateral creditors.
Although performance in 2003 as a whole under the SMP turned out to be less
favorable than projected, the authorities took steps during the last quarter of 2003 to stabilize
the fiscal position and made progress in implementing structural measures. On the fiscal
front, the objective set for the basic budget balance, which was revised downward, was
attained. In order to ensure the payments of pension arrears and to cover the costs of
structural reforms, the authorities were induced to carry out some additional spending. On the
structural front, the authorities completed the certification, by an external auditor, of
government oil revenue for the period January-September 2003. Other actions taken included
the appointment of new directors in the General Directorates of Budget, Customs, and Taxes,
as well as at the General Inspectorate of Finance; the signing of agreement among the
government, SNPC, and CORAF, to have the latter pay for its purchase of government crude
oil; and the production of the 2000 budget review law. All these actions go in the direction of
improving the tracking of government revenues and enhancing governance.
II. Economic program for 2004
For 2004, the focus of the authorities is on putting the economy on a sustainable path
of growth and poverty reduction in the context of an arrangement under the PRGF. In this
connection, the authorities are implementing a new SMP covering the period January-June
2004. The main objectives of this SMP are to strengthen fiscal discipline and transparency in
fiscal management, particularly in the oil sector. In the area of public finance, the key
objectives are to ensure full revenue centralization and enhance expenditure control. The
authorities are determined to improve the health of public finance, so as to create appropriate
conditions for more effective fiscal management over the medium term. In the context of the
SMP, efforts will be intensified to complete the restructuring of the banking sector.
The 2004 macroeconomic objectives are as follows: real economic growth of 3.6
percent, a rate of inflation of 2 percent, a basic primary fiscal surplus of 5.8 percent of GDP.
The current account is expected to remain roughly balanced.
Fiscal policy
For 2004, fiscal policy aims at fostering discipline in public finance management. On
the revenue side, the authorities are committed to ensuring that all revenue payable to the
state is immediately transferred to the treasury. In this regard, they have continued the

-4certification of oil revenue by an independent auditor. Measures are also being taken to
achieve a sustained increase in non-oil revenue. The implementation of a customs warehouse
control program has begun. The authorities are also taking the necessary steps to develop a
better identification and monitoring of large taxpayers, and modernization of management of
customs and tax administrations.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are taking steps to ensure strict adherence to
budgetary procedures. In this regard, efforts are ongoing to strengthen control over outlays,
while ensuring that poverty reduction expenditure is protected. However, total traditional
transfers are expected to record an important increase relative to 2003, due to the
establishment of new institutions in support of democratization, including the Audit Office,
the High Court of Justice, the national Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and
Social Council.
To improve the social environment for productive activity, the authorities signed with
labor unions a “social truce”, which will allow a gradual payment of wage and retirement
pension arrears to begin in 2004. Moreover, the Treasury is being strengthened with
expertise provided by the French Cooperation on public accounting. The authorities will
gradually introduce a functional classification system for expenditure that will permit the
allocation of a greater portion of public spending for poverty reduction programs. For the
future, they will avoid procyclical fiscal expenditures related to oil revenue. In this
connection, starting in 2005, the authorities will adopt a fiscal rule under which oil revenue
will be projected on the basis of a conservative projection of oil prices.
Monetary and financial issues
Monetary policy will remain consistent with the objectives of preserving the
exchange rate arrangement under the currency union and maintaining adequate level of
reserves, while containing inflation. The expansion of credit to the economy is projected to
meet the increasing needs of the private sector.
With regard to financial sector, besides the recent privatization of the CAIC, a reform
of the insurance sector is also envisaged, with technical assistance from the World Bank. The
role of the microfinance institutions in the expansion of the private sector will be enhanced.
The authorities have launched a series of seminars to assist this sector in complying with the
new regional regulations.
External debt
Based on a preliminary analysis, the Congo’s debt burden, at 185 percent of GDP,
even after application of full traditional Naples terms rescheduling, will remain
unsustainable. While my authorities are committed to a prudent debt management policy,
they will be unable to service their external debt’s obligations fully. My Congolese
authorities are hopeful that they could benefit shortly from the HIPC Initiative. In the
meantime, they are making every effort to remain current on their nonreschedulable debt

-5obligations and, to the extent allowed by higher-than-projected oil prices, to make payments
to reduce the large stock of outstanding arrears.
Implementation of the SMP during the first quarter of 2004
The implementation of the SMP through end April 2004 remains broadly satisfactory,
both in terms of quantitative and structural indicators. Noteworthy are the fact that the
primary fiscal balance was met by a comfortable margin, due to higher-than-projected nonoil revenue and enhanced expenditure control, and that no new arrears were accumulated. On
the structural front, the authorities have made progress in publishing information, on the
internet, of full report on oil revenue reconciliation for the first half of 2003, the SNPC action
plan, and summary of the report on the 1999-2001 audit of the SNPC. They continue to take
additional steps to strengthen transparency, and enhance policy credibility. My authorities
remain committed to ensuring a good implementation of all measures envisaged under the
SMP.
III. Governance issues
The authorities have taken important steps to strengthen transparency since 2003. In
this context, it is important to note that the authorities carried out a corruption survey,
commissioned a study on the issue and organized a seminar with the participation of
officials, experts and representatives from civil society and the international donor
community. Based on the views expressed at the seminar, the authorities are in the process of
establishing a National Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Commission. Under the
chairmanship of the President of the Republic, this commission would monitor the
implementation of anticorruption policies; centralize all information necessary, in order to
assist government agencies or enterprises in tackling corruption.
IV. Poverty alleviation and medium term strategy
A poverty reduction strategy is under preparation and is at an advanced stage, and
should become an integral part of the authorities’ medium-term economic strategy. The main
objectives of this strategy will be to stimulate a sustained growth and to promote
development centered on the poor. It is the authorities’ intention to promote growth that will
generate employment and resources that will benefit a large portion of the population.
Moreover, my authorities are also committed to promoting the development of private sector
activity, mostly in the non-oil sector.
Constraints to economic development are related to high dependence on oil, weak
infrastructure, heavy public debt burden, high cost of public utilities, and low degree of
financial depth. The legacy of central planning and the associated anti-business bias have
also been a cause of severe constraint. Moreover, the civil wars of the 1990s, which affected
the economy, weakened the institutions and undermined the rule of law. The authorities have
begun to address these problems and important progress has been made. These constraints
have also been a source of program failure in the past, but all these are in the process of being
changed, with the economy moving gradually but steadily towards a market economy. The

-6authorities have learnt lessons from these past experiences and are determined to take
necessary steps to create conditions for broad-based economic growth and poverty
alleviation.
V. Regional integration
Being a member of the CEMAC, Congo has met two convergence criteria, namely
the basic balance-GDP ratio and inflation rate. However, it has missed the remaining two
criteria related to public debt-GDP ratio and net change in arrears in government arrearsGDP ratio. On the integration of product markets, key actions undertaken were the
promulgation of the CEMAC’s investment charter and the issuance of two implementing
regulations. The National Law on Investment is expected to be revised, in compliance with
the CEMAC charter, by the end of this year. Congo remains in compliance with the
implementation of the regional customs code. The authorities have also established the
national financial intelligence unit that is in charge of coordinating regional efforts to combat
money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
VI. Conclusion
My Congolese authorities have made significant efforts to emerge from a postconflict situation. Remarkable achievements towards peace and political stability have been
made. My Congolese authorities are committed to continuing to work closely with their
partners to help them achieve the goals of sustained growth and poverty alleviation. The
results achieved up to now under the 2004 SMP are encouraging and reflect the authorities’
firm determination to restore fiscal discipline. However, strong support from the international
community remains critical for the consolidation of the progress achieved. In this context,
they hope that their efforts will be well recognized and will help to pave the way for Fund
support under the PRGF, which will be the basis for the creation of a solid foundation for
economic development and poverty reduction.
