Approved by Michael Deppler and Martin Fetherston
June 28, 2005

Consultation discussions were held in Vienna during April 21–May 2, 2005. The mission comprised
Messrs. Hilbers (head), Tzanninis, Lundback, and Epstein (all EUR). Mr. Prader, Alternate Executive Director
for Austria, attended the meetings. The mission met the Ministers of Finance and Social Security, Generations
and Consumer Protection; the Governor of the Austrian National Bank (OeNB); the Chief Executive Officers of
the Financial Market Authority (FMA); the chairman and members of the parliamentary budget committee;
senior officials of the federal government, the OeNB, and the FMA; and representatives of the private sector,
economic research institutes, employers’ organizations, and the federation of trade unions.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and intend to publish this report.
Since 2000, the government has been supported by a coalition between the People’s Party and the Freedom
Party. In April 2005, a majority of the members of Parliament of the Freedom Party created a new party—the
Alliance for the Future of Austria—while continuing their support for the government. The next parliamentary
elections are scheduled to take place by November 2006.
Austria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix I) and subscribes to the Special Data

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Austria’s economy continues to perform relatively well. Growth of real GDP accelerated to
2.2 percent in 2004 supported by strong exports, inflation remains fairly low, and the
unemployment rate, while high by Austrian standards, is one of the lowest in the EU. Moreover,
company profitability increased and stock prices went up sharply. Much of this favorable
performance can be traced to sound economic policies, the diversification of the Austrian
economy into the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), and a social partnership that
has delivered wage moderation, thereby maintaining a strong competitiveness position.
Key issues
Short-term outlook. Staff expects economic growth to slow down to 1.9 percent in 2005
and to reach 2.2 percent in 2006, and inflation to remain low and stable over this period. There
are uncertainties related to the behavior of consumption and external developments, and
downside risks to this outlook warrant close monitoring.
•

Fiscal policy. There will be a widening of the deficit in 2005–06 resulting from tax
reform preceding compensating expenditure measures. This does not raise sustainability
concerns, as long as it is limited and temporary. There is broad political support in Austria for the
government’s objective to balance the budget over the cycle, but unless the authorities identify
the areas where further expenditure savings can be implemented and proceed expeditiously to
mobilize the necessary consensus, the feasibility of returning to budget balance in 2008 will be
compromised.
•

•
Structural policies. Progress in this area has been impressive in recent years, but there is
no room for complacency. Additional tasks remain, including with regard to the further
liberalization of labor, product, and services markets. Pension reform is well under way, and next
steps will be to also include the regional governments in the harmonization effort and to ensure
proper use of the disability pension system.

Financial sector issues. Follow-up to last year’s FSAP has been satisfactory and the
financial sector had a good year, but the authorities need to remain vigilant, including with regard
to foreign exchange lending and the banks’ rapidly expanding activities abroad.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
A policy shift since 2000 has oriented Austria’s economic policies toward fiscal
consolidation and liberalization. The coalition government in power since 2000 set the
objectives to balance the budget over the cycle, reduce the tax burden to 40 percent of GDP
by 2010, contain fiscal pressures from population aging, and increase Austria’s growth potential.
Concrete steps so far include a small fiscal surplus in 2001 and a marked reduction in the size of
government during 2000–04; a major pension reform in 2003 and harmonization of the main
pension systems effective 2005; privatization and deregulation in product and labor markets over
the past five years; and tax reform in 2004–05. These steps and the underlying objectives have
been supported by the Fund (Box 1).
Box 1. Key Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
During Article IV consultations in recent years, the Executive Board commended the authorities for their success in
balancing the budget, reducing taxes, containing public spending and launching an effective structural reform
process.1 Overall, policy implementation has been consistent with Fund policy advice.
Fiscal policy. Directors endorsed the authorities’ medium-term macroeconomic policy objectives of sustaining a
balanced budget over the cycle, further reducing the tax burden, and pursuing structural reforms to increase Austria’s
growth potential. During the 2004 consultation, a number of Directors encouraged the authorities to strive to bring the
deficit in 2005–06 as close as possible to the target of a cyclically adjusted balance. The authorities noted that
temporarily higher deficits result from expenditure measures lagging tax measures, and that they plan a return to a
balanced budget in 2008.
Financial system. The FSAP found the financial system to be generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to
shocks. The authorities were advised to maintain their proactive approach to supervision with a view to enabling and
supporting further restructuring and consolidation in the financial sector, and in particular to closely monitor risk
exposures of Austrian banks in Central and Eastern Europe. Supervision has been strengthened further in the
meantime, and developments in CEECs are closely monitored, including through collaboration with local supervisors.
Structural policies. Directors praised the authorities for their achievements on the structural front and encouraged
them to follow through with their reform agenda. Top priority was to be given to the harmonization of the public and
private pension schemes, which came about to a large extent earlier this year. Further harmonization to also include
civil servants at the regional and local levels in the system has proven more difficult. In other areas, including
disability pensions, deregulation, the liberalization of services, and privatization there has been significant progress as
well, although further work is needed toward the full implementation of the recommendations.

2.
There are reasons to be relatively optimistic about the Austrian economy. The
recovery took firm hold in 2004 and although some slowdown in growth is expected in 2005,
Austria has not seen signs of weaknesses recently witnessed by some other EU countries. Growth
averaged 1¾ percent during 2000–04, comparable to the euro zone average, and inflation and
unemployment rates compared favorably (Table 1; Figure 1). Competitiveness has remained
strong, with Austrian exports gaining market shares in recent years, and several economic
reforms have already been implemented. As a result, Austrians enjoy high standards of living,
ranking fourth in the EU and twelfth in the world in terms of per capita GDP. The key challenges

-5-

facing the Austrian authorities are to adhere to the agreed path of fiscal consolidation while
avoiding potential reform fatigue.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic activity gathered speed in 2004, supported mostly by strong export
performance. Growth of real GDP rose to 2.2 percent in 2004 from 0.8 percent in 2003
(Figure 2). Consumption growth was modest, in view of small gains in employment and nominal
wage growth barely matching inflation. Investment demand continued to expand, benefiting from
the improved prospects for exports and the extension of tax incentives through end-2004. The
export boom that began in early 2004 (exports of goods surged over 12 percent in real terms
in 2004) lost some momentum in the last quarter of the year, but still made a considerable
contribution to growth. Consequently, the output gap has begun to narrow.
4.
Austria’s competitiveness remained strong, despite the appreciated euro. Nominal
wage increases averaged 2 percent, while industrial productivity rose 5½ percent in 2004. As a
result, relative unit labor costs declined and Austria’s REER rose only modestly during the past
12 months (1½ percent in ULC terms). Austria enjoys a large competitiveness advantage built
since the 1990s on the back of sustained wage moderation. In addition, the successful expansion
of Austrian business into the CEECs—and recently into Southeastern Europe and EU-15—has
boosted demand for Austrian exports. Export market shares showed strong gains in past years,
although recently there has been a decline with regard to EU trading partners (Figure 3).
5.
Inflation was contained and unemployment continued to be among the lowest in the
euro zone. Harmonized inflation accelerated during the course of 2004 to 2.0 percent (period
average), and the 12-month inflation was 2.0 percent in May 2005. Rising energy prices and

the main contributing factors. Underlying inflation has

supply due to immigration and an increase in
participation by older cohorts.
6.
The fiscal policy stance became more accommodative in 2004. Concerned about a
faltering recovery, the authorities took discretionary fiscal measures after the passage of
the 2004 budget, namely a fiscal package announced in late 2003 with measures aimed primarily
at supporting R&D and investment, and the front-loading in 2004 of some of the tax measures
initially planned for 2005. In the event, the budgetary cost of these measures was larger than
planned. Against an initial budget deficit target of 0.7 percent of GDP, the additional measures—
plus higher spending on pensions of civil servants due to a surge of early retirements in view of
pension reform—contributed to a widening of the general government deficit to 1.2 percent of

-6-

GDP in 2004 and a fiscal impulse of nearly ½ percent of GDP (Table 2). Monetary conditions
have remained accommodative throughout this period with real interest rate declines
compensating for the impact of real appreciation.

7.
Financial conditions improved during 2004.
Company profitability rebounded, and the Vienna stock
exchange—which had escaped the dotcom boom and
bust—staged an impressive rally in 2004 (up more than
50 percent for the year), fueled in part by the growing
interest in Austrian firms’ operations in the CEECs.
Companies took advantage of the rally by issuing equity
to cover most of their external financing needs in 2004.
In addition, they benefited from the downward trend in
real interest rates.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on the short-term outlook and the government’s policy
objectives, with a particular emphasis on fiscal, structural, and financial sector policies.
With the budgets for 2005 and 2006 adopted by the parliament in November 2004 and
April 2005 respectively, a key discussion issue in the fiscal area was the tension between the
pursuit of further tax reform and the government’s commitment to a balanced budget over the
cycle. In the structural field, although the major part of the government’s reform agenda has been
accomplished, there are significant unfinished tasks. In addition, discussions covered the
financial sector, based on the findings and recommendations of the 2004 FSAP.
A. Short-Term Outlook
9.
Growth is expected to weaken somewhat in 2005–06. Staff projects growth to average
1.9 percent in 2005 and 2.2 percent in 2006 (Table 3). This envisages a gradual shift in the
sources of growth from external to domestic demand. A strong competitiveness position, coupled
with robust underlying growth in productivity, and the fiscal stimulus to personal incomes and
investment provided by the measures in the 2005–06 budgets will provide ongoing support to
economic activity. Specifically:
•

Private consumption is expected to strengthen, supported by further employment gains.

•

Investment growth is expected to remain robust, helped by good prospects for exports,
increased corporate earnings and favorable financing conditions, and capacity utilization
that currently exceeds long-run averages.

•

Export growth is expected to slow due to a softening of external demand. With imports
growing strongly on the back of strengthening domestic demand, the external sector is
expected to make virtually no contribution to growth in 2005–06.

-7-

10.
The authorities and mission agreed that downside risks to the short-term outlook
warrant close monitoring. Domestic demand has yet to take off decisively in this recovery, and
the baseline outlook hinges on a rebound in private consumption. Indeed, while various
indicators have been improving, consumer confidence continues to lag (Figure 4). Uncertainty
associated with the pension reforms has contributed to higher savings rates, which could keep a
lid on faster consumption growth in the near term. Additionally, the authorities noted that Austria
is not isolated from the recent deceleration in output growth seen globally. They pointed out that
downside risks primarily include concerns about the strength of activity in the euro area—
particularly Germany, which remains an issue not just directly for Austria but through its effects
on activity in Europe in general. Finally, higher oil prices1 and a large, disorderly appreciation of
the euro could weaken the prospects for exports and discourage investment.
11.
Consumer price inflation is expected to average 2 percent in 2005. Inflation persisted
at about 2¼ percent in early 2005 and the staff expects it to moderate somewhat toward the end
of the year as the base effect of higher oil prices and government measures dissipates. Two
factors support this outlook: the still considerable slack in the labor market; and wage settlements
in 2004 (governing wage growth in 2005) that suggest moderate wage developments ahead.
There are no signs yet of second-round inflation effects from higher oil prices, and the risk of
higher oil prices feeding into wage increases is low. The authorities noted that the recent rise in
inflation was caused inter alia by last year’s increase in rents, the impact of which can be
expected to run out by this summer.
12.
Austria’s economic outlook is affected by its changing international economic and
financial relationships. The mission discussed the implications of the growing economic and
financial links between Austria and the CEECs and Southeastern Europe. These links have
helped diversify the economy and, recently, cushion it from relatively less favorable
developments in Western Europe in general, and Germany in particular (Box 2).
B. Fiscal Policy
13.
The fiscal deficit will widen in 2005–06 because of tax reform, but there was
agreement that this does not threaten macroeconomic stability if it is temporary. The
widening of the deficit by an average of 0.7 percentage point of GDP in nominal terms during
these years—the worsening is about 1 percent of GDP in structural terms—is the result of a
reduction in the tax burden by more than 1 percentage point of GDP on average per year that is
largely but not fully offset by expenditure cuts (Table 2). Staff would have preferred more
ambitious deficit targets in 2005–06, but recognized that expenditure cuts require broad
consensus, including in the Austrian case among key subnational authorities, and thus take longer
to design and implement.

1

To date, the overall impact of rising oil prices appears moderate, explained by the relatively low
oil intensity of production and consumption in Austria.

-8-

Box 2. Austrian Growth and the Linkages to Germany and the CEECs
Austria has benefited for many years from access to diverse markets among mature European economies. In particular,
Austria’s strong economic ties to Germany have helped sustain a relatively stable growth path and provide a buffer against
external shocks. There are signs, however, that the economy is diversifying away from Germany, and toward the faster
growth economies of CEECs.1
Two key findings from an accompanied selected issues paper on this subject:

•

Germany remains Austria’s largest trading partner, but its relative importance for Austrian exports has weakened. In
1992, Germany accounted for 40 percent of Austria’s exports; CEECs contributed 8 percent. By 2004 Germany’s
share dropped to 32 percent, while CEECs’ share doubled to 16 percent.

•

German and Austrian business cycles are no longer as synchronized as they once were, particularly with respect to
the correlation between Austria’s real GDP and German domestic demand growth rates.

14.
The mission reiterated its support for the government’s objectives to balance the
budget over the cycle and lower the tax burden further. Consistent with this, the latest
Stability Program has set out an ambitious consolidation goal for 2007–08, aiming for
an adjustment of about 1¾ percent of GDP in both nominal and structural terms. Further
modest tax cuts are envisaged for 2007–08 that would allow the government to meet

-9-

15.
The mission noted, however, that the policies to achieve these objectives in 2007–08
are not well defined. The identified areas at the federal government level—chiefly further
reform of public administration—are insufficient to deliver the required expenditure savings. As
for the subnational governments, the initiatives under way aimed at generating sustainable
savings—notably reform of public administration and the health sector—are expected to help
them achieve the agreed targets of the Austrian Stability Pact, but not contribute to a further
improvement of the general government balance.
16.
Unless the government identifies the areas where expenditure savings can be
implemented and proceeds expeditiously to mobilize the necessary consensus, the prospects
for returning to budget balance in 2008 will diminish. In view of the 2006 elections, it is
conceivable that the budget for 2007 will become law only within calendar-year 2007, which will
make it difficult to achieve the ambitious general government deficit target for that year set out in
the Stability Program. Designing expenditure measures that are both durable and target the least
productive areas of government spending is therefore an urgent priority, and further tax cuts
should be conditional upon the identification of such measures. The authorities, however, were
not in a position to outline concrete expenditure measures at this stage, noting the upcoming
elections in 2006.
17.
Limited progress has been made in redressing federal-provincial fiscal relations and
increasing the contribution of subnational governments to the fiscal reform effort. The
mission noted that the new revenue-sharing arrangement between federal and local governments
(Finanzausgleich) and the Austria Convention (Oesterreich-Konvent) had the potential to
increase efficiency, streamline the functions of various levels of government, generate savings,
and improve the incentive structure by realigning spending responsibilities and revenue-raising
powers (Box 3). However, neither seized the opportunity to address the efficiency of subnational
governments. The mission expressed the hope that the required broad political consensus will
emerge to provide impetus to what seems to be a stalled constitutional reform process, as Austria
needs a modern, efficient framework guiding relations between the various layers of government.
18.
The mission emphasized that there is considerable scope for rationalizing
expenditures in a number of areas. This includes the size of public administration, especially at
the subnational level. The Finanzausgleich included measures in the health sector, but there is
still room for savings. The authorities underscored the importance of keeping the health system
accessible to all. They agreed, however, that it possible to improve the efficiency of the health
sector through rationalization of services—including through cooperation of subnational
governments—without materially affecting the quality of services. In addition, staff
recommended that the authorities reexamine the size and role of subsidies. The housing subsidy
amounting to about 1 percent of GDP is particularly costly and not well targeted. Staff reiterated
that, moreover, more frequent means-testing of social transfers would be desirable.

- 10 -

Box 3. The Intergovernmental Fiscal System in Austria
There are three key levels of government in Austria: federal, provincial, and municipal. Government finances are
characterized by intergovernmental coordination and dispute-settling mechanisms. The framework for expenditure
responsibilities and taxing powers is laid out in the constitution. As in most federations, the bulk of tax revenues is
collected at the federal level while spending is more decentralized. Consequently, vertical equalization transfers take
place. There is concentration of decision-making at the federal level, with subnational governments being largely
responsible for the administration of programs.
The framework for coordinating public finances between the three levels of government comprises the:

•

Revenue-sharing agreement (Finanzausgleich). Given the need for equalization transfers, a formal
coordination and agreement is necessary to ensure financing of all subnational governments. Federal
revenues are distributed among subnational governments based mainly on the size of their population, with
some adjustments made in favor of larger municipalities and provinces with per capita revenue below the
national average. The agreement becomes federal law, the Fiscal Equalization Law (Finanzausgleichgesetz).
A new Finanzausgleich covering 2005–08 was agreed in late 2004.

•

Austrian Stability Pact. In line with the EMU Stability and Growth Pact, Austria established an internal
pact that allocates to subnational governments a budget-surplus target. The pact (which becomes law after
ratification by the federal and provincial parliaments) envisages the application of sanctions for fiscal
underperformance. In the latest Austrian Stability Pact for 2005–08, subnational governments agreed to raise
their aggregate fiscal surplus from ½ percent of GDP in 2005 to ¾ percent of GDP by 2008, the level set in
the previous Finanzausgleich.

Intergovernmental coordination is a strength of the system. However, there is scope to provide better incentives for
efficient fiscal management. Rationalizing intergovernmental fiscal relations would require steps that realign spending
and financing responsibility, strengthen accountability, streamline the functions of various levels of government, and
generate savings. The Austria Convention (set up by the federal parliament to submit a proposal for reform of the
constitution) had the potential to revamp intergovernmental fiscal relations. However, it appears that the fiscal aspects
of the proposed constitutional changes are not much different from the current system.

19.
The mission was encouraged by the progress made in designing a medium-term
expenditure framework. Early legislative approval will be important to enable the framework to
become operational by 2007. The authorities emphasized that this framework will help improve
the transparency and operation of fiscal policy, strengthen the budgetary process, and achieve
medium-term fiscal goals (Box 4).

- 11 -

Box 4. Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a comprehensive reform of the federal government fiscal budgeting and
accounting system, which has three main components: (i) the introduction of a Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF); (ii) more target-based budgeting; and (iii) improved accounting and information systems.
There appears to be broad basic political support for an MTEF and the intention is to have a law passed so
that it can take effect in 2007. The MTEF would include the following elements:

•

The MTEF would cover four years, to be revised and updated annually on a rolling basis with binding
expenditure ceilings.

•

Ceilings on cyclical expenditures would be guided by the prevailing economic conditions, and ceilings on
other expenditures would be set in nominal terms.

•

The MTEF is intended to be an instrument for setting strategic expenditure priorities and expenditure
ceilings would be broken down by broad categories. Subsequently, the expenditures on broad categories
would be allocated among ministries, being binding only for the next annual budget.

•

The MTEF would only cover the federal government, although budgetary targets for provinces and
municipalities are set in the Austrian Stability Pact.

The authorities emphasized that the tax reform agenda is not yet completed. The
mission agreed and noted that recent measures have mainly targeted taxes on profits and
capital. These measures will enable Austria to attract

reforms. It emphasized that further tax cuts should
coincide with corresponding expenditure measures.
C. Structural Policies
21.
The authorities saw additional structural reforms as key to a further strengthening
of growth and reduction in unemployment. The mission agreed that, although progress had
been impressive, further liberalization and deregulation of labor, product and services markets as
well as an enhanced focus on education will contribute to raising the underlying growth potential

- 12 -

of the economy. It also noted that these reforms would need to be mutually reinforcing to
maximize the impact on growth, which in any event would take some time to materialize.
22.
Key tasks remain in a number of areas. The Austrian labor market is relatively
flexible, but labor force participation of older workers remains among the lowest in the EU.
Pension reform is expected to help raise participation rates, but the government needs to do more

Competition Authority, and to proceed with their
remaining privatization plans, taking advantage of the favorable conditions in equity markets.
The authorities emphasized the importance of bringing public and private R&D spending to
internationally agreed levels in order to strengthen the growth potential of the economy.

23.
The recent harmonization of pension schemes has been a major step in reducing
inequities (Box 5). In addition, the harmonization will generate savings in the long run, and
will help labor mobility by facilitating transferability of pension claims. This, as well as
the 2003 pension reform, is a major accomplishment, which has significantly improved longterm fiscal sustainability by ensuring substantial reductions in projected pension
expenditures (Appendix III). Even though population aging will put pressure on the pension
system and drive up costs for health and other care, the reforms have helped Austria be better
prepared than many other advanced economies to face the demographic challenges of the
future. However, staff noted that the lowering of the cap on pension benefit losses surrenders
some of the long-term savings achieved with the 2003 reform. The authorities pointed to
equity considerations—those retiring now should not be treated much differently than earlier
retirees—and also noted that the fiscal loss is limited to a period during which the pension
system is not expected to face large demographic pressures.
24.
The mission argued that the next order of business on the pension front should
include the completion of the harmonization and safeguards for the proper use of disability
pension schemes. The authorities noted that pensions of most civil servants at the subnational
level remain outside the unified pension system, and agreed to the need to include them in the
new framework. Further harmonization would be an issue of equity, while it would also generate
additional savings. Its achievement will require the provinces and municipalities to work toward
a solution that would bring these groups within the unified system. Despite the ongoing
rationalization of disability pensions, the number of new claimants remains high, and it will be

- 13 -

important for the government to continue its efforts to ensure that access is restricted only to
those who need these pensions.
Box 5. Pension Harmonization
Effective January 1, 2005, most groups of workers were included in a unified pension system, with equal
contributions and benefits guided by the provisions of the general social security law (ASVG) as amended in 2003
(see IMF Country Report No. 03/372, Annex).

•

Harmonization applies to those currently 50 years or younger.

•

The unified system is guided by the same fundamental principles that guide the ASVG, notably:
(i) 45 years of contributions; (ii) a gradual rise in the retirement age to 65 by 2017; and (iii) benefits
amounting to 80 percent of lifetime earnings.

•

Special provisions apply. A lower age (60 years) of retirement applies to persons doing hard physical labor.
Contribution rates for farmers and the self-employed will be lower, with the federal government covering
the difference.

•

Pension increases will be based on changes in the cost of living.

•

The 10 percent cap on benefit losses under the reform of the ASVG in 2003 has been reduced to 5 percent,
to rise by 0.25 percentage point annually until it reaches 10 percent in 2024.

26.
The continuing growth of foreign currency loans to households remains an area of
concern in the financial system. These loans—mainly in Swiss francs—are a source of
vulnerability, both for the borrowers as well as, more indirectly, the lenders (Box 6). The
authorities agreed, but emphasized the limited legal and regulatory opportunities that are open to
them to intervene. The staff supported the public information campaign launched by the OeNB as
well as the measures the FMA has taken to improve risk management of banks. It urged the
authorities to continue informing consumers about the risks involved, address consumer
protection aspects, and monitor developments very closely.
Box 6. What Explains the Surge of Foreign Currency Loans to Austrian Households?
Foreign currency loans to Austrian households entered a phase of explosive growth around 1995. Even though their
growth has moderated since 2001, foreign currency loans still account for about half the growth of total credit to
households. By end-March 2005, about 30 percent of outstanding loans to households were in foreign currency. The
spread of these loans reflects currency substitution and has not led to a lending boom. Nearly all these loans are in
Swiss francs and, to a lesser extent, Japanese yen. The popularity of foreign currency loans among households is a
uniquely Austrian phenomenon in the euro zone, which has raised questions about the driving forces and heightened
concerns about risks.

A staff study circulated as a selected issues paper, suggests the following:

•

The rapid spread of foreign currency loans among Austrian households cannot be fully explained by economic
determinants and seems to reflect elements of herd behavior.

•

Supply factors have also played a role in the growth of foreign currency loans. Banks have been promoting
these loans, including because of their potential to raise fee income.

•

Foreign currency loans expose parties involved to a host of risks. Key risks include exchange and interest rate
risk for the borrowers and, as a result, potential credit risk for the lenders.

•

Policy measures addressing the demand and supply of these loans have so far not had a significant impact on
either the levels or growth rates of these loans.

27.
Supervision is being strengthened further and adapted to the changes in financial
markets. Recent developments in asset markets are being monitored closely, and the staff
encouraged the financial sector authorities to remain vigilant. The expansion in the CEECs, while
beneficial overall, has brought new risks, including with regard to lending in foreign exchange.
The FMA has developed further its strategy to improve the supervision of Austrian financial

- 15 -

institutions in the region. Furthermore, EU enlargement has enhanced cooperation of supervisors
with the new member states. Amendments of the Banking Act and the Financial Market
Authority Act adopted recently by parliament clarified that the state, not the supervisors, could be
held liable for the performance of the supervisors' duties, but no state liability would arise from
the activities of external auditors unless they performed examinations following a specific request
by the FMA. However, the supervisors felt the amendments had not gone far enough to address
their concerns; they would have preferred the amendments regarding the external auditors to have
been enacted as constitutional law and the potential liability of supervisors in the performance of
their supervisory duties to have been limited further.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Austria’s economy is performing relatively well, reflecting continued structural
reforms and sound macroeconomic policies. Growth of real GDP has gathered speed in 2004
on the back of strong exports, inflation has been moderate, and unemployment—although high
by Austrian standards—has been one of the lowest in the EU. Productivity has outpaced wage
growth and, as a result, relative unit labor costs have declined. Company profitability rebounded
and the Vienna stock exchange staged an impressive rally. Much of this favorable performance
can be traced to balanced economic policies and a social partnership that has delivered wage
moderation, thereby maintaining a strong competitiveness position.
29.
In particular, a strong track record of policy implementation has placed Austria
ahead of its peers. A policy shift since 2000 has oriented Austria’s economic policies toward
fiscal consolidation and liberalization. The main objectives have been to balance the budget over
the cycle, reduce the tax burden, and increase Austria’s growth potential. Notable achievements
so far include a marked reduction in the size of government; major pension reform and
harmonization of the main pension systems; privatization and deregulation in product and labor
markets; and tax reform in 2004–05.
30.
Austria has also profited from its sustained focus on the East. It is likely among the
EU-15 countries that have benefited most from the transition in Eastern Europe and the
subsequent entry into the EU of 10 new member states. Austria’s early focus on building
economic and financial relationships with CEECs, including through the banking, the industry,
and the transport sectors, is now bearing fruit; it has increased its exposure to a relatively fastgrowing area in Europe, while it has reduced its dependence on traditional trade partners, in
particular Germany. This diversification of the economy is likely to have positive effects for both
growth and macro stability in the period ahead.
31.
The short-term growth outlook is relatively favorable, although the pace of
expansion is likely to be more gradual. Robust underlying growth in productivity and the fiscal
stimulus in the 2005–06 budgets will provide ongoing support to economic activity. However,
domestic demand has yet to take off decisively. In addition, higher oil prices and concerns about
the strength of activity in the euro area—despite an increasing orientation toward Central and
Eastern Europe—could weigh on short-term prospects.
32.
Following a strong implementation record over the past five years, the credibility
and success of Austria’s fiscal policies now face a critical test. In past years, the authorities

- 16 -

have been successful in reducing the size of government while maintaining limited deficits.
Lately, the focus has shifted to tax reform. Reducing the tax burden is appropriate as it will
increase Austria’s attractiveness as a business location. However, as a result, larger deficits will
emerge in 2005–06. The objective is to erase these deficits by 2008 as spending cuts required to
return to a budget balance are to come on stream gradually. The credibility of this strategy hinges
on identifying the necessary expenditure reductions. Unless the government succeeds in reversing
the widening of the deficit as planned, plans for further tax reform would not be feasible.
33.
In this context, the accommodative fiscal program for 2005–06 should, in the
current cyclical conditions, be seen as the maximum acceptable. The widening of the deficit
resulting from tax reforms in 2005–06 does not raise sustainability concerns as long as it is
limited and temporary. It will be essential for the authorities to resist any temptation to spend
unanticipated windfalls—especially if the economy turns out to be stronger than anticipated—or
to introduce additional spending packages.
34.
Looking further forward, there is a need to design and set in motion now the
expenditure cuts that would enable the next government to return to a budget balance by
2008. The medium-term objective to balance the budget over the cycle is appropriate, but policies
to achieve this are so far not well defined. Unless the government identifies the areas where
expenditure savings can be implemented and proceeds expeditiously to mobilize the necessary
consensus, the feasibility of reaching the budget targets in 2007–08 will be compromised. In this
connection, there is scope for rationalizing public administration—especially at the subnational
level—the health sector, and various subsidies. Progress made in designing a medium-term
expenditure framework is therefore welcome, and it will be important for the framework to
become operational by 2007 and contribute to meeting the fiscal objectives. The failure to agree
on substantial changes in the federal-provincial relations, however, was a setback to fiscal reform
and it is hoped that the necessary political consensus is reached to modernize this relationship in
the future.
35.
The pace of structural reforms in Austria has been impressive, including in
comparison to its European peers, but there is no room for complacency. The government
should maintain the momentum and take advantage of the current conditions to complete the
outstanding reform agenda in order to tap the dynamism of the private sector and help unleash the
full growth potential of the Austrian economy. This includes further measures to deregulate the
services market, liberalization of shop-opening hours by local governments, and a more flexible
work hours regime. In this connection, the government’s emphasis on public and private R&D
spending in the context of the Lisbon Agenda is well placed.
36.
Due to substantial pension reform in recent years, Austria is relatively well
prepared to face demographic challenges. Pension reform and harmonization have been major
steps in reducing inequities and achieving fiscal savings, although the recent lowering of the cap
on pension benefit losses surrenders some of the gains. Follow-up measures should include
bringing the pensions of civil servants at the subnational level under the unified pension system,
and close monitoring of the disability scheme to ensure that access is restricted to those who
qualify for this pension and that the system is not used as a safety valve for pension reform as has
happened in some other countries.

- 17 -

37.
2004 was a good year for Austria’s financial sector, but developments in financial
markets in Austria and abroad require close monitoring. The authorities implemented a
variety of measures recommended during last year’s FSAP exercise. However, there remains an
imbalance between developments in Austria’s home market, where margins are tight and further
consolidation can be expected, and the abundant growth abroad, in particular in the CEECs. At
home, the continuing growth of foreign currency loans to households remains an area of concern,
and all relevant authorities should continue informing the public about the risks involved,
including in the context of consumer protection. Abroad, the supervisory authorities should
remain vigilant with regard to risks associated with the rapidly expanding activities of Austrian
financial institutions in Eastern and, more recently, Southeastern Europe. This includes, but is not
limited to, the rapid growth of lending to the private sector, including in foreign currency. Close
cooperation and exchange of information with local supervisors, as already set in motion, are
strongly recommended.
38.
Staff welcomes Austria’s official development assistance reaching about 0.4 percent
of GNP in 2006 and encourages them to raise it further toward the U.N. target of 0.7 percent of
GNP.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ On ESA95 basis. The Maastricht Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) definition differs from this due to the inclusion of revenues
from swaps.
2/ For 2004, authorities' estimated outturn. Projections for 2005-06 are based on the budgets for these years. Projections for 2007-08
are based on the Austrian Stability Program (2004-08). For 2009-10, projections assume unchanged overall and structural balances
from those in 2008.

I. Baseline Projections

2006

1/ The general government comprises the federal government, provincial and local governments, and the various budgetary funds. Debt figures are in gross terms.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as general government deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term general government debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 8/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2006-10 7/
A2. No policy change (constant primary balance) in 2006-10

A. Alternative Scenarios

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 6/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)

AUSTRIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Austrian statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria has subscribed to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are available on the Fund’s electronic
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/dsbbhome/ ).
Austria is taking an SDDS flexibility option for the timeliness of the industrial production index.
The timeliness of Austrian data could be improved, particularly with respect to data on industrial
production, the (accrual based) current account, international investment position, and
merchandise trade. Compared to Germany and France, for instance, the publication of these data
lags by about one month.
The transition to compiling data in accordance the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA
1995) has complicated the analysis of the national accounts and fiscal data. New national
accounts data provide no information on household disposable income (only an economy-wide
aggregate), barring the calculation of a household saving ratio. In addition, the reclassification of
public hospitals in 1997 has introduced a break in the national account series on public and
private consumption. Fiscal data from 1995, compiled in accordance with the ESA 1995, are not
complete. Although data on expenditure by function has not been available since 1995, the
authorities have resumed reporting the total outlays of general government according to major
functional categories for 2000–2004, compiled in accordance with the methodology of
GFMS 2001, for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Similarly, reporting of
data on financing and debt data have been resumed for inclusion in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, although a breakdown between domestic and foreign debt according to
residency is not reported.
There is a large difference between the data on goods trade recorded by the statistical office
(Statistics Austria) and the payments data recorded by the Austrian National Bank. Data on
accrual basis are only available with a long time lag. Data based on the Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition are only available back to 1992.

APPENDIX III

AUSTRIA: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

This Appendix analyses medium-term (2005–10) general government debt sustainability and
assesses the impact of aging on Austria’s fiscal situation and public debt profile. The conclusion
is that Austria’s medium-term fiscal position appears resilient to different macroeconomic
scenarios and shocks, and that the long-term outlook is manageable.
In recent years, Austria’s general government debt has been broadly stable with a small
decline of 2¼ percentage points since 2000 to 63½ percent of GDP at end-2004
(Table 5). This is in contrast to the developments in the 1990s when persistent fiscal deficits
brought the level of debt up by almost 10 percentage points (from 56½ percent of GDP at
end-1989 to 66½ percent at end-1999).
Looking forward, the baseline medium-term scenario results in a drop in public debt by
about 8½ percentage points from end-2004 to 55 percent of GDP by end-2010, reflecting the
planned return to balanced budgets by 2008. The scenario is based on government policies as
communicated to the mission, and expressed in the 2005 and 2006 budgets, and the Austrian
Stability Program for 2004–08. In keeping with the government’s aim to run balanced budgets
over the cycle, balanced budgets are assumed for 2009 and 2010.
Debt levels decline over the medium-term also in scenarios with looser fiscal policies or
more pessimistic macroeconomic assumptions. If there was no adjustment (keeping the
primary balance at its 2005 level), or if key macroeconomic and fiscal variables are set at
their 10-year historical averages, debt levels would still not enter an upward path. The general
government debt ratio is, moreover, resilient to various macroeconomic shocks, resulting only in
temporary increases in debt levels. The exception is when real GDP growth is set at its historical
average minus two standard deviations during 2006–07, which results in a virtually flat debt
trajectory after the initial jump. However, this is a scenario where real GDP growth equals 0 in
two consecutive years and budget expenditures are kept unchanged from the baseline scenario in
nominal terms. It is not surprising or particularly worrying that, under such circumstances, a
quick reversal to declining growth rates would require some fiscal policy response.
The long-term outlook could potentially be more difficult as population aging puts pressure
on the pension system, and drives up costs for health and other care, but the recent pension
reforms has significantly improved long-term fiscal sustainability. The reforms are expected
to improve the projected expenditures by as much as 3 percentage points of GDP in the long
term, limiting the increase in pension expenditures to about 1 percentage point from 2005 to the
peak in 2035. Public health care and other public care costs are estimated by the Austrian
government to increase by a little over 2 percentage points of GDP over the next 45 years.

Even with these pressures on fiscal developments, Austria’s fiscal policy appears to be on a
sustainable path. Assuming that the medium-term fiscal plans, as described above, are followed
through 2010, and that the balance of non-aging related expenditures and revenues remain
unchanged thereafter, public debt will be on a broadly declining trend through 2050. This is
encouraging in light of the high projected dependency ratio in Austria; by 2050 the Austrian
population aged 65 and over as a share of the population aged 16–64 is projected to be 55 percent
compared to an average of 49 percent in the EU-15.1

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
July 20, 2005
The Austrian authorities welcome the consultation with the Fund and commend the staff for the
high quality of its staff report. They broadly agree with the staff's assessment of Austria's
economic situation and its general recommendations on economic and financial policies. They
welcome the Selected Issues study, which sheds light on the specific Austrian phenomenon of
foreign exchange borrowing of households.
The staff report again highlights Austria's good economic performance relative to its European
peers in terms of GDP-growth, unemployment, competitiveness and public finances.
Short-term outlook
The most recent data show that real GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2004, revised upward from the
2.2 percent estimate quoted in the staff report.
In the first quarter of 2005, GDP growth was only 0.2 percent, but reached 2.1 percent year-onyear. The lagged effects of the appreciation of the Euro on exports, low investment due to the
expiration of a temporary tax allowance and continued weak growth of private consumption
were responsible for the outcome. On the positive side, dependent employment expanded at a
rate of 1 percent in the first half of 2005. Further, the increase in both disposable income and
after-tax profits as a result of the recent tax reform will gradually support private consumption
and investment. Yet, signals of a strong upswing are currently absent. In view of high oil prices
and the declining momentum of world trade, high growth is not very likely.
Fiscal policy
In 2003, the current fiscal policy strategy was adopted for the period until 2008. It aims at a
balanced budget over the cycle and at reducing the tax burden to 40 percent by 2010. A major
step to reduce the tax burden has been implemented in 2004/2005. In the short-run, tax cuts are
not fully financed by expenditure cuts, resulting in a temporary deviation from a balanced
budget (cyclically-adjusted) in the years 2004-2007.
Since then, fiscal policy has stayed broadly on track, but has been adjusted to a somewhat
weaker economic environment. The latter prompted several actions, aimed at enhancing the
supply-side of the economy and providing a growth stimulus. Over the period 2003-2005, the
cumulative growth stimulus amounted to some 3/4 percentage points and helped to contain the
still widening output-gap. The particularly strong fiscal impact contributed to the 2.4 percent
GDP growth in 2004.
The 2005 budget is dominated by the tax reform aimed at reducing the tax burden of private
households and further strengthening the growth potential of the economy. Recently, the
economic research institutes revised downwards the GDP forecast for 2005 to around 1.9
percent. Yet, the authorities are confident to keep the overall budget balance at 1.9 percent of

-2GDP, owing to better than expected tax revenues so far in the year. The estimated deficit is still
comfortably within the cyclical safety margin of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
Taking into consideration the moderate economic developments in 2005, the authorities see no
danger in the pro-cyclicality of the tax reform, especially as the output gap will remain negative,
at least until 2006. Previous investment incentives were phased out and reductions in public
expenditure will be phased in. Thus, the tax reform will support the Austrian economy on its
recovery to potential output, but will not lead to any overheating.
The government is strongly committed to achieve a balanced budget by 2008. Austria will
continue its reforms of public administration at the national and regional levels. The efficiency
of general government is to be increased further. In 2004, the new fiscal revenue sharing scheme
was agreed upon by the federal, regional and local governments. At the same time, the Austrian
domestic stability pact was re-instated for the years until 2008. For the fiscal revenue sharing
agreement in the period after 2008 it is planned to put special emphasis on the expenditure side.
The federal and provincial levels have recently begun discussing the inclusion of civil servants
at the sub-national levels into the harmonised pension system.
Taking into consideration the remarks made by Directors during last year’s Board meeting, the
Ministry of Finance has intensified and recently finalized a proposal for a medium-term
expenditure framework. This proposal is due to be discussed in Parliament and a final decision
should be expected this year. It would be implemented in 2007, as the federal budget for 2006
has already been approved by Parliament.
Other structural policies
In early July, Parliament adopted another set of policies to foster growth and employment. This
package forms part of the Austrian National Action Plan to reach the targets of the EU-agreed
Lisbon strategy. It includes efforts to increase the ratio of R&D expenditures to GDP from 2.35
percent in 2005 to 3 percent in 2010 by additional public spending and by broadening the
income tax allowance of 25 percent to outsourced R&D and unincorporated companies. The
housing savings-promotion scheme ("Bausparen") will be extended to cover also credits for
education and nursing.
Infrastructure investment will be speeded up and procedures for project approval streamlined.
The package also includes measures against moonlighting and tax fraud. In addition, the labour
market authority will dedicate a special premium to additional apprenticeships.
According to expert estimates, the total package will create some 20,000 new jobs (0.6 percent
of the work force). The measures will not significantly affect the general government budget
balance for 2005/2006.
Foreign exchange borrowing of households.
The Austrian authorities are well aware of the increase in foreign currency loans of
households. They have time and again pursued campaigns to inform the public about the
risks involved in such borrowing.

-3While one can certainly point to the potential risks of household indebtedness in foreign
currency, the reasons for its popular appeal are obvious: some households saved substantial
amounts by switching from yen to Swiss franc. Moreover, the Swiss franc is less volatile and
less likely to appreciate further. In terms of the domestic market, borrowing in foreign
currency has had a dampening effect on interest rates of loans, and on the interest rate spread,
which both are now among the lowest in the Euro-area.
Linkages to Germany and Central and Eastern Europe
While the business cycle in Austria was for many years strongly linked to the business cycle
in Germany, these close ties have weakened as a result of significant foreign direct
investments in Central and Eastern Europe by Austrian Banks and manufacturing industries
in recent years. This is welcome from a risk-diversification strategy point of view. The staff's
paper hints at the possibility of a more volatile cycle in Austria. In our view, this scenario
seems rather remote. More fundamentally, the staff’s study on the regional linkages of
Austria supports a positive outlook for the Austrian economy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On July 20, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Background

Economic activity gathered speed in 2004, supported mostly by strong export performance.
Growth of real GDP rose to 2.2 percent in 2004 from 0.8 percent in 2003. Consumption growth
was modest, in view of small gains in employment and nominal wage growth barely matching
inflation. Investment demand continued to expand, benefiting from the improved prospects for
exports and the extension of tax incentives through end-2004. The export boom that began in
early 2004 (exports of goods surged over 12 percent in real terms in 2004) lost momentum
towards the end of the year, but still made a considerable contribution to growth.
Short-term prospects are relatively favorable. Economic growth is expected to slow down to
slightly below 2 percent in 2005 with a slight increase projected for 2006, while inflation is
estimated to remain low and stable over this period. There are uncertainties related to the
behavior of consumption and external developments, however, and downside risks to this
outlook warrant close monitoring.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The fiscal policy stance became more accommodative in 2004. Concerned about a faltering
recovery, the authorities took discretionary fiscal measures after the passage of the 2004
budget, namely a fiscal package announced in late 2003 with measures aimed primarily at
supporting Research & Development and investment, and the front-loading in 2004 of some of
the tax measures initially planned for 2005. In the event, the budgetary cost of these measures
was larger than planned. Against an initial budget deficit target of 0.7 percent of GDP, the
additional measures—plus higher spending on pensions of civil servants due to a surge of
early retirements in view of pension reform—contributed to a widening of the general
government deficit to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2004 and a fiscal impulse of nearly ½ percent of
GDP. There will be a temporary widening of the deficit in 2005-06 resulting from tax reform
preceding compensating expenditure measures. The authorities plan for a gradual return to a
balanced budget during 2007-2008, when expenditure measures come on stream.
Progress in the structural area has been impressive, and this has contributed to Austria’s
relatively favorable growth performance in the past period. In particular, pension reform is well
advanced, including through the recent harmonization of pension schemes. Additional tasks
remain regarding the need to also include pensions of civil servants at the subnational level in
the unified system, as well as with regard to the further liberalization of labor, product and
services markets.
Following a favorable assessment in the context of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
last year, overall financial sector conditions improved further, including in terms of capital
adequacy and profitability. Financial sector supervision has been strengthened and adapted to
the changes in financial markets. The continuing growth of foreign currency loans to Austrian
households, as well as the rapid expansion of the activities of Austrian financial institutions
abroad remain areas of potential risk.
Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended Austria’s recent economic performance as among the best in
the euro area, with GDP growth gaining strength on the back of strong exports, low inflation,
and low unemployment. They noted that much of this favorable performance can be traced to
sound economic policies, wide-ranging structural reforms, and a social partnership that, by
delivering wage moderation, has helped maintain strong competitiveness. Directors supported
the authorities’ main objectives to balance the budget over the cycle, reduce the tax burden,
and increase Austria’s growth potential. Welcome achievements so far include a marked
reduction in the size of government, major pension reform, privatization and deregulation in
product and labor markets, and tax reform. Directors emphasized that identifying expenditure
measures to return to a budget balance by 2008 will be key to ensuring the credibility and
success of the authorities’ strategy.
Directors observed that Austria’s sustained focus on Eastern Europe has made it one of the
EU-15 countries that have benefited most from the transition in that region and the subsequent
entry into the EU of 10 new member states. In particular, they noted that Austria’s early
attention to building economic and financial relationships with Eastern Europe is now bearing

-3fruit, and that the country can be expected to continue to benefit from this diversification of the
economy.
Directors considered the short-term growth outlook to be relatively favorable, although the
pace of expansion is likely to moderate. They expected robust growth in productivity, and the
fiscal stimulus in the 2005–06 budgets to provide ongoing support to economic activity. At the
same time, they acknowledged that domestic demand has yet to gain decisive traction, and
that higher oil prices and concerns about the strength of activity in the euro area could weigh
on short-term prospects.
Directors commended the authorities’ success over the last few years in reducing the size of
government and maintaining limited deficits. They noted that the recent shift in focus to tax
reform and reducing the tax burden is appropriate as it will increase Austria’s attractiveness as
a business location. Directors observed that the tax reform will contribute to larger deficits
in 2005–06 as offsetting spending cuts are to come on stream gradually. They agreed that this
widening of the deficit does not raise sustainability concerns as long as it is limited and
temporary, and stressed that it will be important for the authorities not to spend unanticipated
windfalls or introduce additional spending packages.
Directors supported the authorities’ objective to eliminate the fiscal deficits by 2008 and return
to budget balance. They underscored the importance of designing and setting in motion now
the expenditure cuts necessary to achieve this objective on time as envisaged. Unless the
government identifies the areas where expenditure savings can be achieved and proceeds
expeditiously to mobilize the necessary consensus, the feasibility of reaching the budget
targets in 2007–08 will be compromised as will plans for further reducing the tax burden.
Directors saw scope for rationalizing public administration—especially at the subnational
level—the health sector, and various subsidies. They welcomed progress made in designing a
medium-term expenditure framework that will enhance fiscal transparency and credibility, and
encouraged the authorities to ensure that it becomes operational by 2007. Directors regretted
the lack of agreement on substantial changes in federal-provincial relations. They expressed
the hope that the necessary political consensus can be reached to modernize this relationship
in the future, with a view to increasing efficiency, streamlining the functions of various levels of
government, and realigning spending responsibilities and revenue-raising powers.
Directors commended the authorities on the impressive pace of structural reforms in Austria in
comparison to European peers, but stressed that there is no room for complacency.
They advised the government to complete the outstanding reform agenda taking advantage of
the current favorable conditions. The priority should be on further measures to deregulate the
services market, liberalization of shop-opening hours by local governments, and continued
labor market reform, including a move towards more flexible work hours and further efforts to
facilitate the integration of older workers. Directors supported the authorities’ emphasis on
raising research and development spending to international levels. Welcoming the reforms on
competition policy, they advised that the role of the Federal Competition Authority be further
strengthened.

-4Directors observed that substantial pension reform in recent years has put Austria in a better
position to face demographic challenges. Pension reform and harmonization have been major
steps in reducing inequities, enhancing labor mobility, and achieving fiscal savings.
Directors stressed that follow-up measures should include bringing the pensions of civil
servants at the subnational level under the unified pension system, and close monitoring of the
disability scheme to ensure that access is restricted to those who qualify for this pension.
Directors welcomed the resilience of Austria’s financial sector, but emphasized that
developments in financial markets require continued close monitoring. They welcomed the
authorities’ implementation of a variety of measures recommended during last year’s Financial
Sector Assessment Program exercise. However, Directors noted that there remains a
discrepancy between developments in Austria’s home market, where margins are tight and
further consolidation can be expected, and the strong growth abroad. Given the continuing
growth of foreign currency loans to households, Directors underscored that all relevant
authorities should continue informing the public about the risks involved, including in the
context of consumer protection. They also urged the supervisory authorities to remain vigilant
with regard to risks associated with the rapidly expanding activities of Austrian financial
institutions in Eastern and, more recently, Southeastern Europe. In this context, they pointed to
the rapid growth of lending to the private sector in these countries, including in foreign
currency. They recommended close cooperation and exchange of information with local
supervisors, as already set in motion.
Directors commended Austria’s official development assistance reaching 0.4 percent of GNP
in 2006, and encouraged the authorities to raise it further toward the U.N. target of 0.7 percent.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post
