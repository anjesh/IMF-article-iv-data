EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Burkina Faso’s recent macroeconomic performance was good. Average real GDP
growth was above 6 percent and inflation was low and stable. The fiscal policy stance
was in line with policy agreements, but targets for revenue collection were missed.

•

Burkina Faso is facing a severe external shock related to the balance of payments
implications of weather-related declines in cotton exports and increased oil prices.
This is expected to reduce growth, and has negatively impacted the debt sustainability
outlook. While policies are being put in place to deal with this shock, the authorities
are requesting an increase in access under the PRGF arrangement of 15 percent of
quota (SDR 9.03 million). Upon completion of this review, a disbursement of
SDR 3.51 million will be available.

•

There were delays in structural policy implementation (two structural performance
criteria and two benchmarks were missed), although the substance of measures was
often in place. The adoption of a pricing mechanism for cotton was a major
achievement.

Key Issues
•

Increasing domestic revenues is essential to create fiscal space for poverty-reducing
expenditures while keeping debt sustainable. This requires firm efforts to modernize
revenue administration and reform the tax regime by broadening the tax base.

•

There is some evidence that the real exchange rate is overvalued. The authorities
intend to address this through structural reforms aimed at improving competitiveness.

•

Improving the climate for private sector development is necessary to sustain growth.
Areas of focus will be the financial sector, public utilities and infrastructure, and
corruption.

•

Public financial management (PFM) needs to be reformed to ensure that public
resources are used efficiently and to strengthen governance. Restoring the viability of
the cotton sector requires further reforms through government disengagement from
the sector.

•

Scaling up of aid would help increase growth and reduce poverty. Grant financing is
desirable to keep debt sustainable.

Program Risks
•

Risks mainly relate to the domestic revenue effort, the cotton sector, the external
environment, and weather-related vulnerabilities.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Developments Since the 2005 Article IV Consultations
1.
Burkina Faso’s macroeconomic performance in 2005–06 was better than
projected during the last Article IV consultation. Despite a difficult external
environment, the economy grew strongly (Text Table 1), compared both to projections
and the average for the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In
2006, inflation fell below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent. The current
account improved as official current transfers exceeded expectations. Fiscal policy
loosened as planned, with the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) rising. The overall
positive macroeconomic performance reflects sound policy implementation, but also
delayed adjustment to world cotton prices and additional debt relief. The authorities’
policy to pass-through higher energy prices through automatic fuel price adjustments
and a tariff increase for electricity were critical for adjusting to the oil price shock.
Debt sustainability benefited from MDRI relief, which eased a key constraint on fiscal
policy. The revenue effort remained low, including in comparison to other WAEMU
countries; with lower-than-projected revenues, the authorities also had to cut back
expenditure increases.

was adopted that links

In the past, limited pass-through shielded producers from the decline in world prices,
keeping production—as well as exports and real GDP growth—high. The result was
large financial losses at ginning companies, which had to be recapitalized at great cost
to the budget.
B. Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3.
Cotton production in 2007 is likely to fall short by almost 50 percent in
volume terms relative to the original program primarily because of late rainfalls.
A lower production base in 2006 (about 15 percent less than expected) and lower
cotton producer prices also contributed. As weather conditions normalize, production
is projected to rebound in 2008, but will likely be about 30 percent below the program
forecast.
4.
Real GDP growth is forecast at about 4½ percent for 2007 and 2008
(Figure 2), much lower than the 6½ percent seen in recent years, mainly because of
lower cotton production and the recent increase in oil prices. The stimulus from a
looser fiscal stance will only partly offset these developments. Inflation has been
negative in much of 2007, mostly because food prices have fallen, and is expected to
be slightly negative for the year as a whole. The current account deficit, excluding
official transfers, will likely widen in 2007 and 2008 because of lower cotton
production and higher oil prices, though an expected increase in gold production could
partly offset these effects (Figure 3). Moreover, higher grant inflows, including
disbursements from the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), should help
rein in the current account deficit, including transfers.

5.
Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress has increased. A key factor is the
deterioration in exports. Although Burkina Faso’s net present value (NPV) of debt-toGDP ratio is in line with the regional average, its export-based ratios are almost twice
the averages (Text Table 2). With exports revised downward because of lower cotton
production, even with additional grants, the NPV of debt to exports is projected to rise
close to its indicative threshold in the Fund/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA, Figure 3). Another uncertainty is whether Burkina Faso can regain its rating as
strong performer under the World Bank’s Country Performance and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), following its classification as a medium performer in the 2007
exercise (see DSA appendix). Thus, a reclassification of the debt distress risk as high
in the next joint DSA is possible.

II. SURVEILLANCE PRIORITIES
A. External Competitiveness
6.
Several indicators suggest that Burkina Faso’ real exchange rate (RER) is
overvalued. These include competitive pressures in the cotton sector; sluggish
noncotton export performance; some estimates of the RER (although the results are not
unambiguous; and large and persistent current account deficits. Recent losses in the
cotton sector, which stem partly from the appreciation of the euro and the projected
decline in exports, are signs the RER is overvalued. In addition, other exports have not
yet gained much prominence.1 According to an econometric analysis of the equilibrium
real exchange rate (ERER), Burkina Faso recently lost competitiveness, though it is
unclear from the analysis whether the RER is overvalued. Lastly, Burkina Faso’s large
current account deficits in recent years could prove unsustainable. The authorities
shared some staff concerns about overvaluation, but expected the policies they are
adopting to address most competitiveness concerns over time. While there are
indications of a real overvaluation, Burkina Faso’s membership in the WAEMU—
whose RER was deemed in line with fundamentals at the last Article IV consultation—
gives it ready access to foreign exchange. Moreover, Burkina Faso’s fiscal policies
have generally been sound.
7.
The euro’s appreciation has added to the financial difficulties of the cotton
sector and weighed on export performance. A sharp decline in world cotton prices
1

The evolution of exports as a share of world exports is an alternative measure for assessing external
imbalances. In Burkina Faso, this ratio has been relatively stable over the past 10 years; however, this
might not be a reliable indicator because cotton production was shielded from the movements in the
RER.

10
(U.S. dollars) since their last peak in late 2003 triggered the sector’s crisis (Figure 4).
Since then, although U.S. dollar cotton prices have recovered to near historical average
levels, the euro has appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar (Figure 4), effectively
offsetting the recovery of world cotton prices. The start-up of large gold mining
operations, supported by high gold prices, should partially offset the loss in cotton
exports, but cotton remains the economy’s most important export. The strength of the
euro complicates efforts to diversify into other agricultural products and thus broaden
the export base.

Econometric analysis of Burkina Faso’s RER produces no clear-cut
evidence of overvaluation, but suggests some loss of competitiveness. As of August,
2007, the RER has appreciated by 30 percent since the 1994 devaluation, although it is
still 30 percent lower than before it. Staff calculations using cointegration methods
suggest that the RER was broadly in line with its fundamentals in 2006 (Figure 5).
Two other studies yield contradictory evidence: one finds undervaluation and the other
overvaluation.2 Despite these diverging results, there is broad agreement that the recent
deterioration in the terms of trade would have tended to depreciate the ERER, while
the actual real exchange rate appreciated, leading to a loss of competitiveness.
However, given the difficulties in determining the ERER, there is considerable
uncertainty about whether this has led to an overvaluation of the RER, because this
depends on the level of the ERER rate prior to the terms of trade shock. Model
uncertainty, data quality issues and the short sample period also complicate the
analysis.

2

These issues are discussed in more detail in an accompanying selected issues paper (SIP).

The large current account deficit could point to an external imbalance,
although the evidence is not conclusive. The current account deficit, including
official transfers, averaged 10 percent of GDP in 2002–06, which is large in absolute
and relative terms.3 If such a deficit were maintained for many years and financed
entirely through borrowing, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would be unsustainable
(Figure 6).4 However, only part of the current account deficit over the past five years
was financed through borrowing and projected borrowing is unlikely to pose a clear
threat to debt sustainability under the baseline (Text Table 3). Under more
conservative assumptions for the availability of private sector inflows than in the
baseline (Box 1), however, net borrowing of 5½ percent of GDP would be required.
This would be too high to stabilize the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio below its
indicative threshold.

3

A multi-year average of the current account deficit was used to filter out the effect of temporary
fluctuations. Simulations of the hypothetical current account in the absence of the cotton price shock
also suggest an underlying deficit of about 10 percent of GDP.

4

The focus here is on public borrowing, because it is unlikely that the private sector, with the exception
of cotton, has access to external financing, and external public debt sustainability is the main constraint
for Burkina Faso.

The baseline consolidation of the current account deficit mostly stems from
public sector efforts. In the past five years, the public sector savings-and-investment
imbalance accounted for about a third of the total current account deficit (Figure 7).
Going forward, a stronger revenue effort should boost government savings, reducing
the public sector savings and investment gap to almost balance. The gap in private
sector savings and investment, on the other hand, is not expected to narrow much,
because efforts to improve the business environment and promote private-sector-led
growth will likely raise private sector investment.

13
Box 1. Determining a Sustainable Current Account Deficit
Another way to assess the sustainability of the current account outlook is to determine its net
borrowing implications. Debt-financing of the current account deficit directly impacts the debt
sustainability outlook. However, sustainable non-debt-financing inflows appear significant in
Burkina Faso. In 2002–06, for example, the average current account deficit of 10 percent of GDP
was mostly financed by non-debt inflows, in particular project grants, private sector inflows, and
errors and omissions (Text Table 2).
Looking forward, these non-debt-financing inflows are key to evaluating a sustainable current
account position. Project grants could be about 3 percent of GDP, in line with experience and
donor intentions. Furthermore, a build-up of net foreign assets (NFA) of about ½ percent of GDP
per year would be consistent with maintaining the reserve cover at about 3½ months of imports.
The largest uncertainty regards the level of private inflows: Over the past five years, these
averaged about 4½ percent of GDP but included approximately 2½ percent in errors and
omissions that are not necessarily sustainable. A conservative estimate for sustainable private
inflows might therefore be 2 percent of GDP. This is lower than in the baseline, which assumes
that progress in improving the business environment boosts foreign investment inflows. Thus,
non-debt-financing inflows of about 4½ percent of GDP could be considered sustainable—project
grants (3 percent of GDP) plus private sector inflows (2 percent of GDP) minus a buildup of NFA
(½ percent of GDP).
With such an estimate for non-debt-financing inflows, a current account deficit of 10 percent of
GDP would not be sustainable because it implies net borrowing requirements of 5½ percent of
GDP, which would lead to steadily increasing debt ratios (Figure 7). To keep the NPV of debt-toexports ratio below its indicative threshold, net borrowing requirements should not exceed
3 percent of GDP, in line with borrowing plans under the baseline. Consequently, with 4½ percent
of GDP in sustainable non-debt- financing inflows, a sustainable current account deficit would be
about 7½ percent of GDP.

11.
If the strong private sector capital inflows assumed in the baseline do not
materialize, further public or private sector adjustment might be needed to
sustain the current account deficit. The NPV of debt to exports ratio could be
brought below its indicative threshold by tightening fiscal policy. Alternatively, private
sector adjustment, spurred through a real depreciation in the exchange rate, could help
reduce the current account deficit. The real depreciation, however, would likely need
to be relatively large since Burkina Faso’s openness to trade is low and its dependence
on commodity exports high, implying the trade balance is likely to change little with
movements in the RER.
B. Growth Prospects
12.
Economic growth in the past 10 years was strong. Burkina Faso saw growth
accelerate in the mid-1990s, which broadly carried over into recent years (Figure 8).
The large devaluation of the CFA franc is likely to have contributed to the growth
acceleration by boosting cotton production and exports (Figure 8)—consistent with
results from the empirical growth literature. Growth outside the cotton sector (which
accounts for 5 percent of GDP but drives other activities) was broad based, supported
in particular by the telecommunications and transportation sectors. This broad base
bodes well for future growth prospects, although the euro’s recent appreciation will
make it harder for Burkina Faso to expand its exports base.

Increased public investment should bolster the foundation for growth. The
authorities intend to raise public investment spending by about 2½ percent of GDP
over 2007–10 from its average in the preceding five years (Figure 9). For 2007, this
includes approximately 1 percent of GDP for the recapitalization of SOFITEX,
whereas for 2008 and beyond the bulk of the additional resources is intended for

15
infrastructure projects.5 Grants from the U.S. MCC, about 1 percent of GDP over
2008–10, are expected to finance a substantial part of these additional expenditures. As
suggested in the empirical literature, a 1 percentage point increase in the public
investment-to-GDP ratio could increase the per capita GDP growth rate by about
0.2 percentage points; consequently, the envisioned increase in public investment
spending should contribute about ½ percentage points to medium-term GDP growth, as
reflected in the baseline.6 While grant inflows create some fiscal space, further efforts,
in particular a higher revenue effort, will be needed to make such expenditure levels
sustainable over the medium term.

Stronger growth will also require structural reforms to improve the
investment climate. The most problematic factors for doing business according to
recent surveys are (i) access and cost of finance; (ii) tax regulations and tax rates;
(iii) corruption; and (iv) an inefficient government bureaucracy.7 A number of
initiatives are underway to address these issues; for example, the regional Financial
Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in late 2007, as well as a
Burkina Faso-specific FSAP planned for spring 2008, will assess financial sector
access constraints. Likewise, work under the program to improve tax administration
and streamline the tax code (see below) should ease the administrative burden on
taxpayers and will likely reduce tax rates in return for a broader tax base. Regarding
corruption, perceptions appear to have worsened recently, and forceful action by the

authorities will be required to stem this trend (see below). Substantial progress has
been made in improving the business environment: Burkina Faso is ranked among the
five top reformers in Africa in the Doing Business 2008 report.8 Nevertheless, its
absolute rank in several surveys, while in line with the WAEMU average, is still
among the least competitive in the world (Text Table 4).

C. Public Sector Efficiency
15.
The planned tax policy reform is aimed at generating further revenue and
simplifying and eliminating nuisance taxes. Regarding tax administration, a recent
FAD mission noted the need for measures to boost revenue quickly without distracting
the administration from medium-term reform priorities. Key measures going forward
are (i) full computerization of the large and medium taxpayer offices, especially for
monitoring taxpayer obligations, and (ii) simplification of exemptions to make tax
administration more productive and lower compliance and administrative costs. The
authorities are determined to implement this reform program.
16.
The authorities have approved a new public finance strategy and multiyear action plan, which benefited from input from FAD and AFRITAC-West. A
review conducted in spring 2007 based on the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) methodology found that Burkina Faso scores well on the
credibility of its budget—with the notable exception of revenue projections being too
optimistic—and the comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget. However, the
effectiveness of ex-post controls are weak. There is also scope for improving ex-ante
8

Key measures include the introduction of specialized commercial chambers in the general courts;
lowering the cost of enforcing a judgment; reducing the cost of property registration to 12.2 percent of
the property value; and establishing a one-stop shop for company registration that cut the time for
business start-up to 18 days.

17
controls; a recent FAD PFM mission recommended simplifying expenditure
procedures and eliminating redundant controls. The authorities’ domestic debt audit,
completed in mid-2007 similarly found that such weaknesses led to expenditure
commitments outside the budget process and, consequently, payment delays, which are
being addressed.9
17.
Burkina Faso ranks relatively well on quality of governance and
corruption indicators, but there have been some slippages recently. On most
governance indicators—government effectiveness, corruption, voice, and
accountability—Burkina Faso ranks above the average of WAEMU, sub-Saharan
Africa, and other low-income countries (Figure 10). Year-to-year comparisons are
difficult, however, Burkina Faso’s rankings on the World Bank’s governance
indicators have shown little improvement and its score on Transparency International’s
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) has dropped.10 The authorities are aware of these
developments, which they attribute partly to misperceptions, and are determined to
continue to fight corruption. They intend to redouble efforts by merging three
institutions into a state control authority (Autorité Supérieure de Contrôle d’État
(ASCE)), which will investigate government agencies and monitor the work of audit
offices. In addition, unlike its predecessors, it will have power to take direct legal
action and will independently publish its reports. This new institution is an integral part
of the authorities’ strategy to strengthen public financial management through better
ex-post controls.

9

Payments took place only after these commitments were discovered by the debt audit. The delays are
not arrears under the program, which follows the WAEMU definition as expenditures approved for
payment but not paid within three months.

10

Burkina Faso’s CPI score declined from 3.4 in 2005 to 2.9 in 2007 (a score below 3 suggests a
perception of rampant corruption). However, the confidence interval is relatively wide, ranging from
2.6 to 3.4. Within Africa, Burkina Faso ranked 17 out of 52 countries in 2007.

D. Policy Implications Going Forward
18.
Enhancing private sector efficiency is a key medium-term challenge to
address real exchange rate overvaluation and bolster growth. Burkina Faso’s
membership in a currency union implies ample access to foreign exchange to finance
its balance-of-payment needs. Nevertheless, addressing the potential overvaluation is
critical (i) because it adversely affects the competitiveness of the tradable sector, and
(ii) because it contributes to potentially unsustainable large current account deficits.
The WAEMU membership rules out a nominal depreciation to reverse the
overvaluation, which puts the onus on productivity gains to compensate the loss of
competitiveness. This is primarily a challenge for the private sector, but public sector
reforms and growth-oriented public investment can contribute by enhancing the
investment climate. Given that part of the cotton price shock is likely to be permanent,
productivity increases through liberalization in this sector are particularly critical. The
authorities also viewed increased productivity as essential for stimulating growth and
adjusting to the external shock.
19.
The increased risk to the external public debt sustainability outlook
reinforces the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation, which would contribute
to reducing external imbalances. In order to sustain high expenditures under
Burkina Faso’s poverty reduction strategy, fiscal consolidation will require strong
increases in revenue, based on ongoing and envisioned revenue reforms. These reforms
will take time to become effective, and thus require a somewhat back-loaded
adjustment path. Gains in public sector efficiency will be important as well to create
fiscal space for poverty-reducing expenditures without putting pressure on the deficit.
The authorities agreed with the need for medium-term fiscal adjustment, but
emphasized that it should not come at the expense of reduced growth.

19
III. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
A. Program Implementation and Policies for the Remainder of 2007
20.
While some indicative fiscal targets for June 2007 were narrowly missed,
the deficit target was observed. Government revenue at the end of June fell short by
less than 0.1 percent of GDP, though grants exceeded projections by 0.3 percent of
GDP. On the expenditure side, on a commitment basis, expected payments for goods
and services were higher than expected because of one-off expenditures (e.g., resulting
from the ongoing decentralization), larger externally financed capital spending, and
higher-than-projected expenditure execution rates through June. Poverty-reducing
expenditures, though, fell marginally short of the target. The end-June performance
criterion on the fiscal deficit, including grants (on a payments-order basis), was met.
21.
The deficit target for 2007 should be observed, despite lower projected
revenue. Because of lower-than-expected growth and inflation, the nominal revenue
year-end target was lowered but is still 1 percentage point of GDP higher than in 2006,
exceeding the programmed increase by 0.2 percentage points (Table 2). Grants are now
projected to be 2 percent of GDP higher than previously programmed, mainly because
grant-financed projects were executed faster than expected and some budget support
grants came in. Thus, the year-end target for the deficit, including grants, is projected
to be met despite higher expenditure. Most of the additional spending will be on capital
projects and moderately higher current expenditure, in particular for utilities and
wages. The projections also include allocations to complete SOFITEX’s
recapitalization and repay VAT refund requests.
22.
Some structural reforms in tax and customs administration were delayed,
although the substance of measures was often in place. The delays resulted partly
from the large reform agenda; for example, beyond initiatives in the program, the
authorities developed a comprehensive reform strategy for tax administration.
Regarding program performance, the large taxpayer office did not promptly send
automatic reminders to all late filers and non-filers starting in July (continuous
structural performance criterion). This measure will be implemented starting in
February, 2008; the recently appointed new director of computerization will oversee
the implementation. The authorities also delayed the payment of VAT refunds
(structural benchmark, Text Table 5), but this issue was rectified in November 2007
(MEFP ¶9). Regarding customs administration, the customs-specific valuation
database has been put in place in all computerized offices as planned. The authorities
came close to meeting the benchmark for implementing a single customs declaration
form by end-June, but one computerized office and small non-computerized offices
experienced delays; consequently, the single customs declaration form became

23.
Some tax policy and PFM measures envisioned for 2007 are likely to be
delayed. The authorities are on track to submit the single tax code consolidating all tax
legislation to parliament by December 2007. However, the required technical work for
the tax reform strategy took longer than expected, and approval by the cabinet
(structural benchmark for end-December), is likely to be delayed until April 2008.
Finally, considerable technical difficulties, in particular regarding software interfaces,
have emerged in developing a system for tracking foreign-financed expenditures, now
expected to be operational in 2009 (MEFP ¶20).
24.
The cotton sector reform agenda is on track. The producer price mechanism
for cotton was adopted in May, meeting a structural benchmark; the authorities are also
expected to meet the end-December structural benchmark on the approval of a
liberalization strategy for SOFITEX. Regarding the automatic adjustment mechanism
for petroleum products, price adjustments slowed after July 2007, but the authorities
are committed to fully implementing the automatic price adjustment mechanism in
2008.
B. Economic and Structural Policies for 2008 and the Medium Term
Fiscal Program for 2008
25.
Domestic revenues are projected to decrease as growth slows, but
additional grants and privatization receipts provide greater flexibility:
•

Revenue outlook. The fall in cotton production and reduced economic growth
will lower tax revenue in nominal terms (Text Table 6); moreover, the
authorities intend to lower the corporate income tax in order to increase
competitiveness, which will lower revenue by about CFAF 10 billion
(0.3 percent of GDP). As a ratio to GDP, revenues are still projected at
13.6 percent of GDP.

•

Grants. When Burkina Faso’s debt distress risk was reclassified from low to
moderate, its financing from the World Bank and African Development Bank
became half grants. Some other donors are also expected to increase grants—
most notably, the authorities expect to receive a first grant disbursement from
the MCC. Grants are projected at 7.2 percent of GDP in 2008, from 4.7 percent
of GDP under the original program.

•

Expenditures. The nominal expenditure projections are broadly in line with
the original program targets except for greater net lending due to the onlending
of a concessional loan by the French Development Agency for the cotton

22
smoothing fund (see below) and a loan to the state-owned electricity company
for a large capital project.
•

Domestic financing. Given the reduction in revenue and slightly higher
expenditures, as well as broadly unchanged foreign financing, domestic
financing requirements have increased relative to the original program target,
but this is mostly covered by privatization receipts expected from the sale of a
20 percent share of ONATEL.11

26.
The proposed fiscal stance strikes a balance between deficit reduction and
maintaining expenditures in the face of revenue shortfalls. Normally, with
increased risk of debt distress, the additional grants related to the debt distress revision
(about 1¼ percent of GDP) would best go to reducing the fiscal deficit (including
grants), which was originally envisioned at 5.7 percent of GDP for 2008. Adjusting for
the nominal revenue shortfall would require spending cuts, however, which would
exacerbate the negative growth impact and could jeopardize progress towards the
Millennium Development Goals. Weighing these considerations, the authorities agreed
to use about ¼ of the additional grants to reduce the 2008 deficit to 5.4 percent of
GDP; the remaining grants will help offset the revenue losses and allow for a slight
increase in net lending.
Structural Fiscal Agenda
27.
Tax administration reform in 2008 will concentrate on consolidating
reforms of the large taxpayer office. For example, the introduction of a systematic
notification system for non-filers, combined with issue-oriented taxpayer audits,
11

This sale was originally planned for 2007.

23
should reduce the non-filer rate below 5 percent in 2008, in line with international
good practice (MEFP ¶17). Likewise, the combination of new procedures for VAT
refunds and sufficient budgetary resources should eliminate past delays in VAT
refunds. New measures for 2008 for strengthening tax administration include revised
regulations to focus the large and medium taxpayer offices on the largest 500 and
1,500 medium taxpayers, respectively, and to subject small taxpayers to simplified
taxation instead of the regular value-added tax (structural benchmark for end-June);12
and eliminate withholding taxes for large taxpayers.
28.
Customs administration reform in 2008 aims to reduce direct contact
between customs officials and traders. An important aspect is the choice of the
appropriate customs channel, which should be selected by ASYCUDA’s selectivity
module and not by individual customs agents. The authorities have agreed to limit the
deviation from ASYCUDA recommendations for the customs channel to less than
10 percent, and they will program the selectivity module to assign at least 50 percent of
customs declarations to the green and blue channels, in order to focus customs
resources on higher-risk declarations and to reduce the administrative burden on
importers (structural benchmark for end-September). Building on the customs-specific
valuation database introduced in 2007, the authorities intend to interface it with
ASYCUDA and use it for dues calculation and risk assessment in the selectivity
module.
29.
The ambitious revenue targets for 2009 and beyond require that a tax
policy reform agenda be approved by parliament in 2008/09. This reform agenda
will draw on work done by a FAD tax policy mission to Burkina Faso in
November/December 2007. The goal is to broaden the tax base for major taxes,
eliminate nuisance taxes, and simplify the tax system. The authorities decided to
reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 30 percent as part of the 2008
budget to bring it closer to rates in neighboring countries. However, this has shrunk the
scope for further reductions in tax rates. Given the time needed to prepare the
legislation and the parliamentary timetable, the draft tax reform legislation will be
submitted to parliament by end-December 2008 (structural benchmark), and the bulk
of the reforms are expected to take effect only in 2010. Key tax policy measures,
however, will already be included in the 2009 budget, scheduled to be submitted to
parliament in September 2008 (structural benchmark).
30.
To improve public financial management, the program in 2008 will focus
on strengthening budget execution, ex post controls, and expenditure tracking. To
find ways to shorten the payment process, the authorities will review existing ex-ante
controls and the scope for reducing redundancies and plan to develop an action plan by
end-December 2008 (MEFP ¶19, structural benchmark). Streamlining and enhancing
12

Turnover would be used as the sole criterion for classifying the taxpayer population, and small
taxpayers would no longer be subject to VAT.

24
the effectiveness of these controls would improve budget execution and address
weaknesses identified by a recent FAD PFM mission. Moreover, the authorities’ audit
of domestic debt obligations has shown that stronger ex-ante controls are needed to
ensure that line ministries do not enter into expenditure commitments outside the
budget process. The new institution for control and oversight (ASCE), will help
reinforce ex-post controls; the authorities plan to develop an action plan for scaled-up
audit activities, ensure sufficient funding in the 2009 budget, and develop modalities
for publication of audit reports and systematic follow up. A comprehensive system for
tracking poverty-reducing expenditures is expected to be introduced by end-June 2008
(structural benchmark).13
Cotton Sector
31.
The authorities are working with stakeholders to restore the financial
viability of the cotton sector. Because of the limited pass-through of lower world
cotton prices to producers, ginning companies have had sizable financial losses. To
help ensure the viability of the ginning companies, a new mechanism for the 2007/08
campaign links the producer floor price to world cotton prices (centered five-year
moving average), discounted by 5.1 percent. This brought the producer floor price
down to CFAF 145 per kg for 2007/08, from CFAF 165 per kg for 2006/07. If current
price levels prevail over the next few months, these companies should break even in
the 2007/08 campaign, and farmers might earn a small bonus reflecting the difference
between the floor price and actual sales price.
32.
The authorities have taken steps to recapitalize SOFITEX, and intend
to reduce the government’s ownership over time. Total recapitalization is expected
to require CFAF 34 billion (1 percent of GDP) in 2007. The government is working
with the World Bank and other donors on a strategy to rehabilitate SOFITEX, improve
productivity, and reduce the government’s role in the sector (end-December 2007
structural benchmark). It is important to improve the pricing mechanism further, in
particular to ensure that a smoothing fund being set up by the interprofessional
association, with the assistance of donors, can be sustained. To sustain the fund’s
resources, the discount between the producer floor price and the moving average of
world prices could be linked to the financial condition of the fund. Technical work on
this continues, including on measures to mitigate the effects on cotton output and
farmers’ income.
Other Structural Reforms
33.
Financial sector reform will become more important, informed by the
regional and Burkina Faso-specific FSAPs. The financial system is stable overall,
relatively efficient and profitable, and the quality of the loan portfolio of
13

This will also provide an opportunity to reassess appropriate targets for this expenditure category.

25
Burkina Faso’s banks is better than the WAEMU average. However, there has been
some deterioration in bank soundness indicators—the recent regional FSAP showed
that the weighted capital-adequacy ratio for Burkina Faso declined significantly—
reflecting recent troubles in the cotton sector and weak balance sheets at new banks.
Moreover, lack of access to finance constrains business development. Financial sector
development will aim to strengthen the banking and insurance systems; increase access
to finance for the rural sector, housing and SMEs; and improve the judicial system for
credit. The national FSAP for Burkina Faso will present an opportunity to address
Burkina Faso’s implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism standards.
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES AND RISKS
34.
Given the anticipated widening in the current account deficit from sharply
lower cotton production and higher oil prices, the authorities request to augment
access by 15 percent of quota. The projected current account deficit for 2008 is
expected to be about CFAF 35 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) larger than originally
programmed. The requested augmentation would cushion the drawdown in reserves
needed to finance the higher deficit. Current projections point to moderate financing
gaps over the medium term. Together with the approved access of 10 percent of quota
under the program, the augmentation would increase total access to 25 percent of
quota, below the norm of 35 percent for countries under a fifth PRGF arrangement.
The augmentation should not adversely impact Burkina Faso’s capacity to repay the
Fund.
35.
Staff proposes to change the definition of the performance criterion for the
overall deficit, including grants, from a payment-order basis (ordonnancement) to
a commitment basis (engagement). Better quality data for the deficit are available on
a commitment basis.
36.
To keep the program on track, revenue administration reforms must be
carried out and tax policy reform elaborated in a timely way. The revenue
administration reforms fundamentally change work practices, which will become
computer-based, and allow the new revenue administration to move towards self
assessment. The required institutional change could test institutional capacity at
revenue administration agencies. Regarding tax policy reform, delays in developing
concrete proposals could push the 2009 fiscal targets out of reach.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The macroeconomic environment in 2006 and 2007 was difficult, but
overall policy performance was strong. In the face of the cotton sector crisis, rising
oil prices, and other challenges, the authorities implemented adjustment measures as
needed. The new cotton producer price mechanism is a major step to putting cotton

26
ginning companies on a sustainable footing. Up until the recent spike in oil prices, the
authorities have consistently adjusted domestic petroleum prices and raised electricity
tariffs to cap subsidies. The fiscal stance has been in line with program targets; the
revenue effort, though, fell short of expectations.
38.
The real exchange rate appears somewhat overvalued, but external
imbalances are modest. The latter reflects broadly appropriate adjustment policies,
the ability of Burkina Faso to draw on WAEMU reserves, and the fact that the CFA
franc’s value appears to be broadly appropriate for the WAEMU zone according to the
assessment at the last WAEMU Article IV consultation.
39.
Fiscal performance in the first six months of 2007 was mixed. The
performance criterion on the overall deficit target was observed; the indicative targets
for revenue and poverty-reducing expenditures were narrowly missed. For the
structural agenda, most measures were put in place, despite some delays. The
authorities are requesting waivers for two performance criteria related to tax and
customs administration; the required measure for customs administration reform has
since been implemented, and the tax administration measure will be implemented
starting in February 2008, under the oversight of the recently appointed new head of
computerization. The cotton producer price mechanism—an important structural
benchmark—was adopted as planned. Going forward, the authorities should aim for a
more timely implementation of the structural agenda.
40.
The planned fiscal stance for 2008 strikes a balance between adjusting to a
worse debt sustainability outlook and protecting expenditures under adverse
economic conditions. The availability of additional grants from the World Bank and
the African Development Bank related to Burkina Faso’s moderate risk of debt distress
rating eased this balancing act considerably. Further reductions in the fiscal deficit,
including grants, will be needed to stabilize the NPV of debt to exports below its
indicative threshold.
41.
The staff supports the authorities’ request for an augmentation of access.
As cotton exports decline and oil imports rise, 2008 is expected to be a difficult year
for Burkina Faso’s economy. While the resulting projected drawdown in reserves
poses no risk to economic stability, it is nevertheless appropriate for the Burkinabè
authorities to manage this drawdown by drawing on Fund resources. Also, an
augmentation could help to mobilize additional donor resources.
42.
The structural agenda for 2008 focuses on reforms to raise revenue. Efforts
in tax and customs administration to consolidate computerization by integrating new
tools into the work flow will require considerable management resources; constraints
in this area could derail program implementation. The ambitious revenue targets
starting in 2009 also require tax policy reform; the authorities intend to plan for such
reforms in 2008 and implement them in 2009/10. In this context, the decision to lower

27
the corporate income tax rate outside a comprehensive reform package was unfortunate
as it removes one potentially positively perceived element of the reform.
43.
The authorities’ strategy for strengthening public finances is
commendable, although further prioritization may be needed given resource
constraints. The authorities’ audit of domestic debt obligations uncovered some flaws
in the expenditure system, which are being addressed. Staff welcomes the authorities’
work on a study to expedite payments and to eliminate redundant controls. Given the
authorities’ comprehensive reform agenda, it will be important to focus on priority
areas.
44.
Moving the cotton sector reform agenda forward is a priority. With
SOFITEX recapitalized and a new producer price mechanism established in 2007, the
focus for 2008 will be to consolidate reforms and continue disengaging the government
from the cotton sector. The World Bank and other donors have taken the lead in this
area, and will assist the authorities with improving the design of the smoothing fund
and the liberalization strategy.
45.
The authorities intend to improve governance and the business
environment. On governance, the merger of agencies engaged in financial control into
an independent agency with increased powers is promising. It will be important to
expand the agency’s resources; it is welcome that it can take direct legal action and
independently publish its reports. Improving government transparency by publishing
reports on budget implementation would be beneficial. The authorities’ work with the
World Bank to improve Burkina Faso’s Doing Business indicators is commendable,
and should be continued to increase competitiveness.
46.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory.
Against this background, and on the basis of policies set forth in the authorities’ Letter
of Intent, the staff recommends that their request for waivers be granted and that the
first review under the PRGF arrangement be completed.
47.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation take place in
accordance with the July 15, 2002, Executive Board decision on consultation
cycles.

IMF Country Report No. 07/153, May 9, 2007.
On a commitment (engagement) basis.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative stock-of-debt operation, including cancellation of debt treated under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, shown on accrual basis. Includes
relief from IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank. For the World Bank and African Development Bank, implementation of the stock-of-debt operation is
assumed for July 1, 2006. The operation increases domestic and external amortization payments in 2006, which are offset by MDRI grants, and lowers amortization and
interest from 2006 onwards. MDRI relief from the Fund is higher than in the balance of payments because of a valuation adjustment by the BCEAO.

3

Multilateral Debt relief Initiative stock-of-debt operation, including cancellation of debt treated under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, shown on accrual
basis. Includes relief from IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank. For the World Bank and African Development Bank, implementation of the
stock-of-debt operation is assumed for July 1, 2006. The operation increases domestic and external amortization payments in 2006, which are offset by
MDRI grants, and lowers amortization and interest from 2006 onwards. MDRI relief from the Fund is higher than in the balance of payments because of
a valuation adjustment by the BCEAO.

APPENDIX I. BURKINA FASO: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (UPDATE)
This appendix updates the joint debt sustainability analysis (DSA) from April 2007.14 Overall,
the risk of debt distress has increased because of deterioration in the export outlook and
some uncertainty as to whether Burkina Faso will be able to maintain its status as a strong
performer. The upcoming joint DSA planned for 2008 will assess both aspects—based on
additional data that will be available then.15
48.
The export outlook has worsened since the previous joint DSA mainly on
account of cotton. The harvest for the 2006/07 campaign was 15 percent lower than
expected, and projections for the 2007/08 harvest had to be reduced by another 30 percent as
a result of unfavorable weather conditions; the reduction in producer prices also contributed
to the downward revision, but to a lesser extent. Assuming normal weather conditions for
2008/09, cotton production is projected to rebound by 30 percent, but given the lower base,
the long-run production outlook remains below its previous trajectory (Figure I.1, Panel 1).
The export profile for non-cotton exports has been revised to incorporate an earlier-thanexpected startup of commercial gold mining operations, which offsets initially some of the
decline in cotton production (Figure I.1, Panel 2). Overall, export projections have been
revised downwards by approximately 12 percent in the long term (Figure I.1, Panel 3), and
the exports-to-GDP share by about 1 percentage point (Figure I.1, Panel 4).
49.
The fiscal stance, as measured by the overall balance excluding grants, has
loosened somewhat, but external borrowing requirements are lower. Whereas the
revenue path in terms of GDP has remained unchanged, expenditures over the medium term
are higher on account of additional capital spending and a higher base in 2007
(Figure I.2, Panel 1). Nevertheless, external borrowing requirements in 2007 and 2008 are
expected to decline considerably relative to previous projections because of higher grants and
larger recourse to domestic financing (Figure I.2, Panel 2). Additional grant resources are
available from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and from the World Bank
and the African Development Bank following Burkina Faso’s classification as having a
moderate risk of debt distress. Larger recourse to domestic financing is facilitated by the
inflow of substantial privatization receipts in 2007.

14

See IMF Country Report No. 07/153, May 9, 2007. The update has been shared with World Bank staff.

15

Since domestic debt is small in Burkina Faso, this updates focuses on external public debt.

On balance, risks to the debt sustainability outlook have increased. The reduction
in external borrowing requirements has lowered the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio below its
previous trajectory over the medium term, but in the long term the deterioration in the export
outlook dominates, and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio rises closer to its indicative
threshold (Figure I.3, Panel 1). However, the baseline does not take into account grants from
the World Bank and the African Development Bank that could result from future risk of debt
distress ratings.16 If one were to assume that the moderate risk of debt distress (‘yellow light’)
and the corresponding 50:50 mix of loans and grants were maintained for another five years,
the increase in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would be considerably dampened (Figure I.3,
Panel 2). That is, the likely support from these two institutions given Burkina Faso’s risk of
16

If a country is rated at a moderate risk of debt distress, the loan/grant allocation mechanism of these two
institutions switches from ‘green’ to ‘yellow’, leading to a 50:50 disbursement mix of loans and grants. In case
of a high risk of debt distress rating (‘red light’), they will disburse 100 percent grants. However, apart from the
current fiscal year, for which firm grant commitments have been made, baseline projections do not take this
mechanism into account, because doing so would require forecasting future risk of debt distress ratings, and it
would be impractical with respect to the allocation mechanisms of the World Bank and the African
Development Bank, which require an analysis that abstracts from their endogenous response.

39
debt distress rating will probably lead to a significantly more favorable trajectory for debt
ratios than is projected under the baseline.

Another risk to the debt outlook relates to Burkina Faso‘s performance rating.
This is based on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). In
the 2006 rating, which became available after the last joint DSA was finalized,
Burkina Faso’s score declined below the threshold for strong performers; in the absence of a
strong improvement in the 2007 rating, it is likely that Burkina Faso could be reclassified as
a medium performer, in which case lower indicative thresholds would apply. In the baseline
projection, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio threshold would be breached—all other debt
indicators remain below their thresholds, including stress tests and historical scenarios—

40
which could lead to a high risk of debt distress rating (Figure I.4, Panel 1). In this case, the
World Bank and the African Development Bank would switch to a ‘red light’ in their
loan/grant allocation mechanism, leading to 100 percent grant disbursements. If this ‘redlight’ status were to be maintained over 10 years, the trajectory for the NPV of debt-toexports ratio might be dampened enough to keep it below the 150 percent threshold
(Figure I.4, Panels 1 and 2).

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, capital transfers are included–in particular
project grants, which are projected to average about 3 percent of GDP over the long term, and close to 4.5 percent over 2007-12 due to MCC grants—and private, non-debt-creating capital inflows.
Projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

APPENDIX II. BURKINA FASO: LETTER OF INTENT
Translated from French
Ouagadougou,
December 20, 2007
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431
USA
Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The government of Burkina Faso has successfully implemented the measures
contained in its economic program carried out with the support of the International Monetary
Fund through its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The program, approved by
the IMF Board on April 23, 2007 for an amount equivalent to SDR 6.02 million (10 percent
of quota), runs through April 2010.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) supplements
the one attached to my letter to you dated April 11, 2007. The MEFP attached to that letter
established quantitative performance criteria (for end-June 2007) and structural performance
criteria (for end-June 2007) for the completion of the first review under the PRGF
arrangement.
The quantitative performance criteria for the completion of the first review under the
PRGF arrangement were observed. However, we are requesting a waiver of applicability for
the two structural performance criteria. For one of them the related measures were put into
place, but with a delay, and for the second, the measures will be in place starting in
February 2008. On the basis of our overall performance, and on the strength of the policies
set forth in the attached memorandum, we request that the IMF complete the first review
under the PRGF and disburse the second loan in the amount of SDR 3.51 million.
The cotton crisis and deterioration in Burkina Faso’s terms of trade caused by higher
world oil prices has considerably weakened our external position. The government is
determined to forcefully address these challenges and, to facilitate the adjustment while
addressing our additional balance of payments needs, requests an augmentation of access
under the PRGF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 9.03 million (15 percent of
quota).

45
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP will enable
it to meet its program objectives, but is ready to take any other measures that might be
necessary to this end. Burkina Faso will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any
measures that may be appropriate, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), in accordance with the
Fund’s policies on such consultation. The second review under the PRGF arrangement is
expected to be completed no later than end-July 2008 and the third review by endJanuary 2009.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter and the attached MEFP
and Technical Memorandum of Understanding available to the public. Therefore, it
authorizes the IMF to post these documents on the IMF website once the Executive Board
concludes the review.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Jean-Baptiste M. P. Compaoré
Minister of Economy and Finance
Commander of the National Order

APPENDIX II. ATTACHMENT I. BURKINA FASO: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR 2007–08
Translated from French
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum updates Burkina Faso’s economic and financial program
under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
with the IMF. The program, which was approved by the IMF’s Board of Executive
Directors on April 23, 2007, aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability and fostering
conditions that can sustain high economic growth and reduce poverty.17 This memorandum
summarizes recent economic developments, reviews performance under the PRGF-supported
program, and updates the government’s strategy for pursuing its financial and economic
policies.

Burkina Faso’s macroeconomic performance in 2006 was good. Economic growth
was a resilient 5½, despite low international cotton prices and the strength of the euro, to
which the CFA franc is pegged. Inflation fell below the WAEMU convergence criterion of
3 percent. Exports grew strongly, partly because the fall in world cotton prices was not fully
passed on to farmers. Imports were higher than expected because of an upward revision in
historical petrol imports, leading to higher than envisioned external current account deficits.
Fiscal policy loosened as planned, as reflected in the fiscal balance, excluding grants.
Revenue collections fell short, but increases in grants partly offset the difference. An
adjustment in expenditures resulted in a better-than-expected deficit, including grants. Debt
sustainability benefited from MDRI relief, which cut the external debt stock in half.
3.
Limited pass-through of lower world cotton prices to producers caused sizable
financial losses among ginning companies. As a result, SOFITEX—the largest ginning
company, which is partly government owned—has been recapitalized to restore its financial
health (see below). The recent adoption of a new producer price mechanism linked to
changes in world prices is crucial to getting ginning companies back on sustainable footing,
but adverse weather conditions, lower prices, and other factors have hurt cotton output.
4.
We have made substantial progress in reforming revenue administration and
public financial management, but a large reform agenda must still be accomplished. In
the past two years, we computerized tax and customs administration and set up joint brigades
to combat fraud. The former Ministry of Finance and Budget and Ministry of Economy and
Development were merged into one, improving policy coordination. There has also been

progress in computerizing the expenditure system. However, perhaps because of
inappropriate prioritization of revenue administration reforms, revenue fell short of
expectations and the revenue ratio remains low by both international standards and the
WAEMU criteria. Further progress is also needed in other areas.
II. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR 2007 AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
THROUGH SEPTEMBER
A. Recent Economic Developments and 2007 Macroeconomic Framework
5.
Recent economic activity is still robust, despite signs of slowing related to
difficulties in the cotton sector. Fiscal stimulus fueled economic activity. In the first half of
2007, total fiscal expenditures increased by over 30 percent year-on-year. Inflation has
declined steadily since the second half of 2006 and turned negative in recent months, as food
prices have dropped, with the help of good grain harvests in both 2005 and 2006. Meanwhile,
nonfood inflation remains moderate, even though the increase in world oil prices was fully
passed through to domestic petrol prices.
6.
An abrupt decline in cotton output will reduce GDP growth in 2007. The
2007/08 output is expected to fall by a third from the already reduced 2006/07 result, from
657,000 tons to 435,000. The decline primarily stems from adverse climate conditions (late
rainfall) but also reflects the decline in the producer floor price, which is 12 percent lower
than a year ago, delayed payments from the last campaign, and the late announcement of the
producer floor price. Given the late start of this season’s rains, some producers decided to
stop or reduce cotton production and will instead produce maize and, to a lesser extent,
sorghum and millet. These crops will mostly be grown for the farmers’ own consumption and
thus will not enter the formal economy. Bad weather has also reduced expected maize output,
and vulnerable farmers may need support (see below). Given these developments, projected
growth for 2007 was reduced to 4¼ percent; inflation is expected to be slightly below zero.
B. Program Implementation and Policies for the Rest of 2007
7.
Some fiscal targets for June were narrowly missed. Government revenues at the
end of June fell marginally short by CFAF 2 billion (about 1 percent), while grants exceeded
projections by CFAF 8 billion. Expenditures on a commitment basis were higher than
expected for goods and services because of one-off expenditures (utility payments, salaries
(stemming from a 2006 agreement), and higher-than-expected expenditures resulting from
the decentralization program), larger externally financed capital spending, and higher-thanprojected expenditure execution rates through June. However, on a payment-order basis,
expenditures were lower and end-June performance criterion on the fiscal deficit, including
grants (on a payments-order basis), was met. The indicative floor on social expenditures was
missed by less than 1 percent because of strong spending pressures related to the
recapitalization of SOFITEX, where the amount turned out larger than anticipated—some of
the budgetary support for the sector was even moved to 2008.

48
8.
The deficit target for 2007 will be observed despite lower projected revenues.
Because of lower economic growth and inflation, the nominal year-end revenue target was
reduced by CFAF 10 billion; in percent of GDP, the revised revenue target nevertheless
represents an increase by one percentage point relative to 2006, exceeding the programmed
increase by 0.2 percentage points. To reach the target, we intend to complete the
computerization of the large taxpayer office in the tax administration, devote more resources
to audit and collection enforcement, and make better use of ASYCUDA and the import
valuation database in customs administration. Grants are now projected to be about
CFAF 60 billion higher than programmed, mainly because grant-financed projects were
implemented faster than expected and some additional budget support grants. Thus, the yearend performance criterion for the deficit, including grants, is projected to be met despite
higher expenditures. Most additional spending is foreign-financed capital spending and
moderately higher current expenditures, in particular utilities and wages. The projections also
include an additional CFAF 8 billion to complete SOFITEX’ recapitalization and
CFAF 4 billion for the payment of VAT refund arrears.
9.
Parts of the structural reform agenda were delayed. We adopted a new producer
price mechanism for cotton in May, thus meeting the related structural benchmark. We will
continue to implement the automatic adjustment mechanism for petroleum products in 2008
despite high international oil prices and delayed implementation in July–November 2007.
SINTAX, the tax administration computer system, was modified so that late filers and
nonfilers will be automatically notified starting in July (continuous structural performance
criterion). However, because of the delayed transmission of the filing information of
taxpayers that do not file their declarations with the large taxpayer office (LTO) in
Ouagadougou but with local offices, not all late filers received their notification letter on
time. Between now and the completion of the interconnection of the computer system, all
large taxpayer declarations received by local offices will be faxed to the LTO so computer
records are complete and late filers can be notified automatically on time. We are currently
reviewing the need for further organizational changes, and the new head of computerization
will work to assure the implementation of the notification measure starting after
January 31, 2008. Another structural benchmark that went unmet was the prompt payment of
VAT refunds. Although a circular was issued that outlined procedures to ensure VAT refunds
are paid on time (within 90 days after the refund is requested), communications problems
between the agencies involved caused initial delays. As of November 15, 2007, all verified
and unverified requests more than 90 days old were paid.
10.
We intend to eliminate the delays in customs administration. The single customs
declaration form was in place in 14 of the 15 computerized customs offices by end-June
(missed structural performance criterion). The Bingo office will use the form after it relocates
its offices. There were also delays in preparing regulations for noncomputerized offices,
which are responsible for less than 6 percent of customs revenues. However, as of
November 22, 2007, all customs offices are using the single customs declaration form. We
have put in place a computerized customs-specific valuation database in all the computerized

49
offices (end-September structural benchmark) for use in the customs process. We did not
meet the end-September structural benchmark for using the remote access and selectivity
modules of the computerized customs system ASYCUDA in Ouagadougou. However,
remote access tests for the Ouagadougou rail office with seven brokers were successful. We
will use the remote access and selectivity modules in all computerized offices by
December 31, 2007.
III. POLICIES FOR 2008
11.
The cotton shock, which could be in part permanent, has hurt exports and debt
sustainability; this requires policies to reduce debt and improve competitiveness. Cotton
exports in 2008 are now expected to be CFAF 44 billion lower than previously projected, and
represent 37 percent of exports, from 45 percent previously. The fall in cotton exports is
partly offset by the start of production in one major gold mine in 2007 and another two in
2008, which should significantly boost gold production and exports. Though we expect
cotton production to rebound from 435,000 tons to around 580,000 tons in 2008/09,
preliminary results indicate that the baseline path for the net present value (NPV) of the debtto-exports ratio will increase and almost reach the threshold under the debt sustainability
(DSA) framework. Thus, debt distress risk has clearly increased and we are adjusting our
policies accordingly. Over time, the most important way to improve our international
competitiveness will be structural reforms, but reducing the budget deficit to levels that will
stabilize our NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio at low levels is also necessary. A medium-term fiscal
adjustment will also raise government savings and thus help reduce the current account
deficit and prevent future losses of international reserves. The adjustment should be
supported by the estimated $500 million we expect to receive over the next five years from
the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account; this increases our capacity to undertake additional
capital spending, while reducing the overall fiscal deficit.
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
We will reduce the fiscal deficit for 2008 to reflect the increased risk, but also
need to smooth the impact of the cotton shock. After the last joint Bank-Fund DSA, which
changed the risk of debt distress from “low” to “moderate,” the World Bank and the African
Development Bank made half their financing to Burkina Faso grants. Normally, such an
increase would be used to substantially lower the deficit from the 5.7 percent of GDP
originally envisioned for 2008; but the cotton crisis and damages from the 2007 floods
require social spending, and lower economic growth will have a negative impact on tax
revenues of about CFAF 10 billion (0.3 percent of GDP). Adjusting for this revenue shortfall
would reduce economic growth and would require large spending cuts, which could
jeopardize progress toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals. Weighing these
factors, we intend to aim at a deficit, including grants (on a commitment basis), of
CFAF 192 billion (5.4 percent of GDP) to mitigate the negative impact of the shock on the
economy.

50
13.
Revenue policy is aimed at boosting competitiveness while improving tax
administration. We have decided to lower the corporate income tax from 35 to 30 percent
for 2008, which should reduce revenues by CFAF 10 billion. We believe that this is
necessary to increase private sector investment and help Burkina Faso compete with its
neighbors. We also think it will help boost revenues over time as economic growth
accelerates and tax evasion decreases. There is also a very small loss in customs revenues
expected after the WAEMU-ECOWAS free trade agreements are implemented. Despite these
revenue reducing measures, we will be able to increase the revenue-to-GDP ratio by
0.2 percentage points in 2008 through our ambitious revenue administration reform, which
will require steadfast application of modern revenue administration principles (see below).
14.
We must prioritize expenditures given our limited resources. In 2008, we will
expand spending in the health and education sectors by expanding coverage in rural areas and
providing free textbooks. We intend to increase social expenditures by CFAF 10 billion,
more than the increase in current expenditures. Thus, we will keep firm control on current
expenditures to allow for greater infrastructure spending. Additional funds for infrastructure
will also be available because the 2008 budget does not require further funds for the
completion of the SOFITEX recapitalization, which had a cost of CFAF 34 billion in 2007.
Also, in 2008, we expect to receive about CFAF 24 billion funding through the U.S.
Millennium Challenge Account. Thus, we still expect to be able to increase capital spending
by CFAF 17 billion from 2007. We intend to work with the World Bank to make our overall
spending more efficient, including through public expenditure reviews and analyses of
capital projects.
B. Cotton Sector Reform
15.
Cotton sector reform is progressing. We have already contributed 75 percent of the
required recapitalization of SOFITEX and expect to complete it by the end of 2007 for a
combined total of CFAF 34 billion paid by the government. We are working closely with the
World Bank and other donors on the restructuring strategy for SOFITEX, and intend to
finalize a government decision on its future liberalization by end-December (structural
benchmark). We are also working on a strategy to restore the long-term viability of the cotton
sector and to reduce government involvement in ginning over time, which is expected to be
ready by mid-2008. The creation of a price smoothing fund (fonds de lissage) will be
finalized by early 2008 with inputs and financial resources from the French Development
Agency. We continue to work with cotton sector stakeholders to further improve the
operation rules of the fund to ensure it is self-financing under most imaginable scenarios.
Moreover, we will ensure that the finances of the fund are fully transparent. Finally, together
with the World Bank, we are studying ways to address the impact of the cotton crisis in
cotton-growing areas.
C. Fiscal Structural Reform
16.
The structural agenda for 2008 will focus on measures to mobilize more revenue
and reinforce PFM. The recommendations of the Fund technical assistance missions have

51
been useful for prioritizing our reform agenda in both areas. In the area of tax reform, we are
on track to submit the unified tax code to parliament by end-December 2007 (structural
benchmark). We now expect the tax policy reform strategy to be approved by cabinet by endApril 2008 (structural benchmark). The thrust of the strategy will be to broaden the tax base
for the major taxes, eliminate nuisance taxes, and simplify the system for the taxpayer and
tax administration. To meet our ambitious revenue targets for 2009 and beyond, we will
submit draft tax policy reform legislation to parliament by end-December 2008 (structural
benchmark). We are considering setting up a technical group to work on revenues within the
framework of our Strategy for the Strengthening of Public Finances (SRPF) to help move this
process forward.
17.
Measures to reform revenue administration will focus on the large taxpayer
office (LTO). The establishment of the LTO has been a major milestone in tax
administration reform. The minister of finance has approved the tax administration reform
strategy that received inputs from Fund technical assistance. The strategy places most of its
emphasis on ensuring that the LTO has the resources and strategic orientation to implement
reforms. We will attempt to bring the nonfiler rate for large taxpayers to below 5 percent,
from 12 percent in early 2007. Also, we intend to reduce the rate of VAT declarations with a
zero or negative tax liability from its current level of 49 percent to less than 20 percent
through issue-oriented audits. At the same time, we will ensure verified VAT refund requests
are paid promptly and have allocated CFAF 6 billion in the budget to do so. Productivity
gains will be reaped from computerization only after all software modules are integrated into
the work flow. Given the limited resources for tax administration reform, we are scaling back
our plans to decentralize the tax administration and are limiting the resources available to
develop the cadastre system, two longer-term reform objectives. We will issue regulations to
categorize taxpayers using turnover as the only criterion (i.e., large, medium, and small) with
the objective of creating a group of about 500 large and 1,500 medium taxpayers, who would
be subject to the regular tax system. By contrast, small taxpayers should be subject to
simplified taxation instead of VAT. Implementation of these regulations would constitute a
structural benchmark for end-June, 2008. We will also eliminate withholding for large
taxpayers and simplify them for medium taxpayers starting in July 2008.
18.
Customs administration reform will concentrate on reducing the direct contact
between customs officials and traders to support the fight against fraud. The
ASYCUDA system is designed to reduce this contact, which can easily be compromised, but
ASYCUDA is not yet applied systematically by the customs administration. To ensure its
use, we will design our selectivity system to assign at least 50 percent of customs
declarations to the green and blue channels and will ensure that the cases where the
ASYCUDA choice is not adhered to does not exceed 10 percent (structural benchmark
end-September 2008). We intend to raise the ratio of declaration assigned to the green and
blue channels over time by improving the risk assessment capabilities of the selectivity
module. To this end, we will interface the customs valuations database with the ASYCUDA
system to improve the valuation aspect of ASYCUDA by end-March 2008. The valuation

52
data would be used both for customs duty calculation and as an input for the risk assessment
in the selectivity module.
19.
PFM measures will be directed to improving budget execution and preparation,
and tracking spending. We are undertaking a study to expedite the processing of payments
and eliminate redundancies of controls, which should be finalized by end-September 2008.
This will form the basis for an action plan to be implemented over 2008 and 2009 (structural
benchmark, end-December 2008). To improve the scope and effectiveness of ex-post
controls, we are in the process of fundamentally reforming the existing control framework to
rationalize it and make it more effective. The draft laws that are being finalized seek to bring
together under a single authority the tasks now accomplished by three separate bodies (the
General Inspectorate of the State (Inspection générale de l’État), the High Authority for the
Coordination of the Fight Against Corruption (Haute autorité de coordination de la lutte
contre la corruption), and the National Commission for the Fight Against Fraud
(Commission nationale de la lutte contre la fraude), and extending its jurisdiction to
monitoring implementation of the recommendations of inspection missions and to judicial
proceedings. Thus, we will study ways to scale up audit activities of this new institution
during 2008, and provide it with the corresponding resources in the 2009 budget. We will
also develop an action plan for scaled-up audit activities by the new institution by
December 2008. To enhance the transparency and the deterrent effect of ex-post controls, we
will propose by December 2008 modalities for the publication of audit reports and their
recommendations, and the systematic follow up on the recommendations made by these
offices. We also plan to increase the reliability of revenue forecasts for budget preparation.
This will help improve budget execution by ensuring availability of resources. This concern
will be addressed by the technical groups of the steering committee beginning with the 2009
budget process.
20.
Tracking expenditures more closely is a priority. We have worked to develop a
comprehensive system for tracking foreign-financed expenditures (end-December 2007
structural benchmark). The technical development work on the first module, which helps
track the mobilization of funds, is expected to be completed before year-end. However, the
need for numerous interfaces with other software systems and the overall complexity of the
project have delayed the full implementation of all six modules until 2009 at the earliest. We
are also working on establishing the interface between the integrated system for the
management of wages and salaries (SIGASPE) and the software for general expenditure
tracking (CID), with work expected to be completed by December 2008. To improve
tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures, we will launch a pilot project applying the
functional classification of GFSM 2001 to poverty-reducing expenditure tracking, which is
expected to be operational by end-June 2008 (structural benchmark).
21.
We are taking measures to improve internal and external expenditure controls.
We recently completed the domestic debt audit, which started in 2004 with support from the
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation as part of the previous PRGF program. The
comprehensive inventory shows claims from various government suppliers amounting to

53
about CFAF 78 billion at December 31, 2006. CFAF 50 billion of these obligations have
already been examined, and those recognized have been paid, including the regularization of
salary advancements (CFAF 18 billion). Of the CFAF 28 billion claims still under
investigation in August 2007, some CFAF 15.4 billion relate to benefit claims on social
security agencies (CARFO and CNSS), which will be dealt with according to the conventions
relating to these organizations. An amount of CFAF 10.8 billion are contributions to
international organizations, which will be analyzed case by case. A detailed report was
submitted to the Cabinet to elicit instructions on the treatment of these claims, after
verification, and on measures to be implemented to prevent similar situations in the future.
One of the objectives of such audits, which are conducted periodically, is to ensure that all
government institutions abide by public expenditure processes as prescribed by the
instruments in force, and to remind them, if need be, about the obligations of financial
controllers. To prevent such obligations from recurring, we intend to have regular meetings
between the budget department and the financial controllers of the line ministries, and each
party will have to adhere to the requirements of the budget law. In addition, we are
considering ways to better define the profile of financial controllers and the organizational
structures they oversee to achieve a better budget execution. We also discovered that an
oversight in April 2007 led CFAF 3.3 billion to be paid to Libya, counter to the
comparability-of-treatment clause under the Paris Club agreements, but no further payments
will be made.
D. Other Structural Reforms
22.
As noted in the government’s previous letter of intent, we will continue to
improve the business environment by combating corruption, streamlining procedures
and the licensing of businesses, and enhancing labor market flexibility. Through our
work with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), we are continuing to improve the
business climate, especially in the area of access to credit. Significant progress was made in
2007, reflected in Burkina Faso’s rating in IFC’s latest Doing Business report: we introduced
specialized commercial chambers, reduced judgment enforcement registration tax from
4 percent to 2 percent, reduced the property transfer and registration fees, and reduced the
time to register a company to 23 days. Regarding the labor market, we are working on a
revised legislation that will ensure greater flexibility. It is expected to be finalized in 2008.
Meanwhile, the ministry of labor adopted specific measures to improve the use of fixed-term
contracts in the mining industry. On governance we follow the National Plan of Good
Governance (Plan national de bonne gouvernance, PNBG), with a specific emphasis on the
role of the State in development, the fight against corruption, and improving the legal system.
The government’s recently launched plan to fight corruption emphasizes the streamlining of
governance institutions to increase their efficiency, especially through the creation of a single
authority, whose mandate includes both general government supervision and the fight against
fraud and corruption. This new authority will have the power to bring suits and will publish
its reports. Burkina Faso will be one of eight countries carrying out comprehensive
Governance and Anti-Corruption diagnostics with support from the World Bank in 2008.

54
These diagnostics will focus on identifying the locus and vectors of corruption and will
include several sector diagnostics and policy recommendations.
23.
Financial sector reform will take higher priority in the future. The World Bank’s
financial sector review, now being finalized, will be a major input in our strategy. The review
notes the financial system overall is stable, relatively efficient, and profitable. Also, it shows
the bank loan portfolio is higher in quality in Burkina Faso than in the sub-region on average.
However, credit ratios have deteriorated some owing to recent troubles in the cotton sector
and weaker balance sheets at new banks. As recommended by the World Bank, we are
considering steps to strengthen the banking and insurance systems; increase access to finance
for the rural sector, housing and small and medium-sized enterprises; and improve the
judicial system for credit. Moreover, we will work with the World Bank and Fund staffs on a
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), scheduled to be conducted in the last quarter
of 2007 for the WAEMU area and in the first quarter of 2008 for Burkina Faso.
24.
Privatization will continue despite some delays. Additional government shares in
ONATEL will be sold (20 percent through public offering, and 6 percent directly to
ONATEL employees) by mid-2008. On the basis of a new electricity law adopted in
November 2007, we are working with the World Bank to solicit bids for private management
of the national electricity company (SONABEL). In addition, shares of the national oilimporting company (SONHABY) are scheduled to be sold in 2008.
E. Program Monitoring
25.
The program will continue to be monitored against the agreed quantitative financial
targets (Table 1) and structural performance criteria and benchmarks (Table 2) and through
program reviews. The quantitative financial targets for end-December 2007 and end-June
2008 are performance criteria; those for end-March 2008 and end-September 2008 are
indicative targets. The second program review is scheduled to be completed by endJuly 2008 and the third by end-January 2009. Definitions of all targeted variables and
reporting requirements are contained in the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU). The definition of the performance criterion on the overall deficit
including grants was changed from the payment-order basis (base ordonnancement) to the
commitment basis (base engagement) after September 30, 2007 to facilitate program
monitoring.

APPENDIX II. ATTACHMENT II. BURKINA FASO: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
Ouagadougou, December 20, 2007
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also sets deadlines for reporting data to Fund staff to
facilitate program monitoring.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the following definitions of “debt,”
“government,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:
•

Debt, as specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect
to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000, will
be understood to mean a current, not contingent, liability, created by contract through
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, that requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency)
or services, at one or more future points in time; these payments being made to
discharge principal and interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take
a number of forms, the primary ones being:
¾ (i) loans, consisting of advances of money to the obligor (e.g., deposits, bonds,
obligations, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits), who undertakes to repay the
funds in the future, and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans where the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually
pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(e.g., repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
¾ (ii) suppliers’ credits, which are contracts where the supplier lets the obligor defer
payments until after the date on which the goods have been delivered or the
services provided; and
¾ (iii) leases, which are arrangements in which property is provided for the use of
the lessee for a specified period, usually shorter than the total expected life of the
property, while the lessor retains title to the property. For purposes of this
guideline, the debt is the present value at the inception of the lease of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement, except
payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.

58
¾ Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU (West African
Economic and Monetary Union) regional market are included in domestic debt for
purposes of this memorandum.
•

Government is defined as the central government of Burkina Faso and does not
include any political subdivision, government-owned entity with a separate legal
personality, or the central bank.

•

External payments arrears are external payments due but unpaid. Domestic arrears
are domestic payments due but unpaid after a 90-day grace period, unless the
obligation specifies a different grace period.

•

Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as
such by the government (including any government debt).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

3.
The numerical values for quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and
adjusters are set out in Table 1 of the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP).
A. Overall Deficit Including Grants
Definition
4.
For the program, the overall deficit including grants is valued on a commitment basis
(base engagement). It is defined as the sum of foreign and domestic financing (net) of the
government measured from the financing side plus cash basis adjustment. Net foreign
financing is the sum of foreign borrowing and debt relief minus amortization. Net domestic
financing is the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government, including both net bank credit
to the treasury as defined below and other government claims on and debts to national
banking institutions; (ii) unredeemed government bills and bonds held outside national
commercial banks; and (iii) privatization receipts. Net bank credit to the treasury is the
balance of the treasury’s claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Treasury
claims include the cash holdings of the Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central bank,
deposits with commercial banks, secured obligations, and government deposits with the
postal system (CCP). Treasury debt to the banking system includes funding from the central
bank (including statutory advances, consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing
of secured obligations), government securities held by the central bank, funding from
commercial banks (including government securities held by commercial banks), and CNE
(Caisse Nationale d’Épargne Postale)/CCP securitized deposits. Net bank credit to the
government is calculated by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), whose
figures are recognized as valid for program purposes. The stock of treasury bills and other
government debt, as well as net foreign financing, is calculated by the Ministry of Finance.

59
Cash basis adjustment is the sum of (i) expenditure commitments not-paid (engagées nonpayées); and (ii) change in treasury deposits.
5.
All these items are valued according to the statement of government budgetary
execution established monthly in the central government’s financial operations table. This is
prepared by the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Policies and Programs
(SP-PPF), in collaboration with the other directorates of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance.
Adjustment
6.
The overall deficit including grants is adjusted upward by the amount that grants fall
short of what is programmed up to a maximum (see the MEFP, Table 1). It will not be
adjusted if grants are higher than programmed.
7.
The overall deficit including grants will also be adjusted upward by the amount that
concessional loans exceed what is programmed up to a maximum (see the MEFP, Table 1).
Reporting deadlines
8.
The ministry in charge of finance will forward data to the IMF on the overall deficit
excluding grants within six weeks after the end of each quarter.
B. Nonaccumulation of Domestic Arrears
Definition
9.
The government undertakes not to accumulate any new arrears on domestic
government obligations. The treasury keeps records of such arrears and records repayments.
Performance criterion
10.
The government will not accumulate any arrears on domestic government obligations
during the program period. This is a performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
11.
Data on balances, accumulation, and repayment of arrears on domestic obligations
will be reported within four weeks after the end of each month.
C. Nonaccumulation of External Arrears
Performance criterion
12.
The government’s external debt is the stock of debt owed or guaranteed by the
government. External arrears are external payments due but not paid on the due date. Under
the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate arrears on its external debt,
except those arising from government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors,

60
including non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. Nonaccumulation of external arrears is a
performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
13.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external arrears will
be forwarded within six weeks after the end of each month.
D. Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government
Performance criterion
14.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any external debt maturing in
one year or more that has a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the
interest reference rate for borrowed foreign currencies provided by the IMF) beyond the
ceiling indicated in the MEFP (Table 1). This performance criterion applies not only to debt
as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines (see ¶2), but also to all commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. However, it does not apply to treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market. This performance
criterion is to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
15.
Details on any loan (terms and creditors) to the government or guaranteed by the
government must be reported within four weeks of the end of each month.
E. Government Short-Term External Debt
16.
The government undertakes not to accumulate or guarantee any new external debt
with a contractual maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only
to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines (see ¶2), but also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this performance
criterion are import- and export-related loans and treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA
francs on the WAEMU regional market and normal short-term suppliers’ credits of one year
or less. This performance criterion is to be observed continuously. As of April 1, 2007, the
government of Burkina Faso had no short-term external debt.
III. OTHER QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
17.
The program also includes indicative targets on total government revenue and
poverty-reducing social expenditures.

61
A. Total Government Revenue
Definition
18.
Total government revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all tax and nontax
revenue collected by the Directorate General of Taxation, the Directorate General of
Customs, the Burkinabè Treasury, and revenue collection units at ministries and institutions,
and it also includes revenue from treasury checks. VAT refunds are considered as
expenditures.
Reporting deadlines
19.
Details on total revenue will be sent to IMF staff by the SP-PPF of the Ministry of
Finance and Budget within six weeks after the end of each month.
B. Poverty-Reducing Social Expenditures
Definition
20.
Poverty-reducing social expenditures are defined by the PRSP priority sector
programs designed to accelerate the reduction of poverty. They cover all spending categories
for the following ministries: Primary Education and Literacy; Health; Social Action and
National Solidarity; Promotion of Women; Labor and Social Security; Employment and
Youth; Agriculture, Water and Fishing Resources; Animal Resources; and Environment.
They also cover rural roads and HIPC resources for infrastructure spending and for the
Justice Ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Development. Until 2006 these
expenditures were compiled from budget execution tables and from the special HIPC
account. Starting in 2007 they are monitored directly through the budget, as are all HIPC
resources.
Reporting deadlines
21.
The government will report within six weeks after the end of each month the monthly
data on poverty-reducing social expenditures.
IV. STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
22.
The program incorporates structural performance criteria (see the MEFP, Table 2 in
IMF Country Report No. 07/153 (5/09/2007)).
A. Nonfiler Notices
23.
The government will use Sintax to generate a list of Large Taxpayer Office (LTO)
late filers and nonfilers for the main tax categories and send reminders within a week after
the deadline for returns. This performance criterion will be observed on a continuous basis
starting after January 31, 2008. A late filer is anyone who files a tax return after the deadline.

62
A nonfiler is anyone in the database who did not file taxes. The main tax categories are the
VAT (TVA), the corporate income tax (BIC), the tax on income from securities (IRVM), and
the tax on income from real estate (IRF). Declaration deadlines for the main tax categories
are set in the tax code. The government will send reminders to at least 98 percent of the late
filers and nonfilers.
V. ADDITIONAL PROGRAM-MONITORING INFORMATION
A. Public Finance
24.

The government will report the following to Fund staff:

•

The monthly government flow-of-funds table (TOFE) and the customary appendix
tables, to be forwarded within six weeks after the end of each month; if data on actual

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point, but not disbursed during the interim
period.
20

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt
relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the
member qualifies for such debt relief.

5

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union that includes Burkina Faso.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005.
The assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The monitoring results of the first half of 2007 indicate certain vulnerabilities remain in
internal control systems and legal structure, while there has been some progress in improving
the external audit process (through adopting a multi year audit program), establishing an
audit committee, expanding disclosures in the notes to financial statements on financial
positions with the Fund by countries, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of the
internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and MonetaryUnion (WAEMU)
and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to
the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of
the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc
of CFAF 100= F 1. On April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was CFAF
769.68 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its member. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers on current international
transactions.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

The periodicity of Burkina Faso’s Article IV consultation is set in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board Decision on consultation cycles. Discussions on the 2005
Article IV consultation and fourth review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) were held during the period May 24—June 9, 2005 in Ouagadougou. The staff report

6
(IMF Country report No. 05/354, September 30, 2005) and the Selected Issues and Statistical
Annex (IMF Country Report No. 05/358, September 30, 2005) were considered by the
Executive Board on September 7, 2005.
XII.

ROSC/AAP:

An FAD mission visited Ouagadougou during May 7–18, 2001 to assist the authorities
undertake a draft fiscal module of a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC). The final report, which was issued in July 2002, found that Burkina Faso was
making good progress in a number of areas to increase the transparency and accountability of
government. Additional efforts are needed to bring a number of improvements to the point of
implementation, particularly with regard to expenditure tracking at the local level and
external audit functions. Initial discussions indicated that the authorities broadly concurred
with the mission assessment. On July 31, 2002, the authorities formally adopted an action
plan based on the recommendations of the final ROSC.
An STA mission during May 8–21, 2003 assisted the authorities in preparing a data ROSC.
The report was published in March 2004. The mission found that most of the methodologies
used in the compilation of macroeconomic statistics are in broad conformity with
internationally accepted guidelines. However, most datasets are affected by limited or
impaired source data arising from irregularity in the conduct of surveys (national accounts),
use of outdated weights (CPI), or low response rate to surveys (balance of payments). For
CPI and government finance statistics, data dissemination meets the SDDS requirement, but
for other macroeconomic datasets, timeliness falls short of GDDS recommendations. The
authorities broadly concurred with the main findings of the mission as well as the
recommendations made to address them.
The team, jointly with World Bank staff, also discussed a HIPC Initiative Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP) with the authorities. The aim was to assess the capacity of the public
expenditure management system to track poverty-reducing public expenditures under the
HIPC Initiative and the need for technical assistance to enhance that capacity. The mission
secured the officials’ approval of the jointly prepared preliminary assessment; identified the
main needs for technical assistance on upgrading the capacity to track such expenditures; and
drew up a draft outline action plan. This plan identifies the main needs for further technical
assistance to improve tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures. The AAP has been
endorsed by the authorities.

APPENDIX II. BURKINA FASO: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of December 10, 2007)
A.

Partnership in Burkina Faso’s development strategy

Government’s development strategy. The government of Burkina Faso outlined its
development strategy in a revised PRSP (PRSP-2) adopted by the Council of Ministers on
October 27, 2004, along with a Priority Action Program (PAP). The PAP translates strategic
objectives into sequenced actions and strengthens results-based monitoring of the PRSP. The
revised PRSP and accompanying PAP were presented to World Bank and IMF Boards on
May 3, 2005. PRSP-2 reaffirms the four interrelated pillars as identified in the first PRSP,
namely: (i) accelerating broad-based growth; (ii) promoting access to social services;
(iii) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv) promoting
good governance.
Partnership with the Fund. The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative
relationship in supporting the government’s macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line
with the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration. This includes regular
participation of Bank staff in the meetings with the government on the Fund’s program
review missions, IMF staff participation in Bank development policy missions, and Bank
internal review meetings. The IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization and the
World Bank in economic growth and poverty reduction, with close collaboration on
overlapping issues. The Fund’s dialogue and conditionality are consistent with the structural
programs agreed with the Bank, and the Bank’s dialogue and conditionality have maintained
consistency with the macroeconomic framework endorsed by the Fund.
B.

World Bank Group Strategy

29.
On June 28, 2005 the Bank’s Board discussed the World Bank Group’s country
assistance strategy (CAS FY2006–09). This CAS supports the pillars of PRSP-2 with
analytic work, technical advice, on-going operations and new financing. It is built around a
results framework that explicitly defines the assumed causal links between IDA-supported
activities, direct outcomes of these activities and the country’s higher-level development
outcomes. On July5, 2007 the Bank’s Board discussed the CAS Progress Report which
emphasized that the CAS remains highly relevant for Burkina Faso and is being effectively
implemented to deliver results in the following key strategic areas:
•

Accelerated and shared growth. IDA will support enhanced regional integration,
expanded and diversified export earnings, cotton sector reform, an improved investment
climate, decentralized urban development to promote urban-rural linkages, and economic
infrastructure needed to reduce factor costs and stimulate private sector investment and
growth.

12
•

Improved access to basic social services. IDA will continue to support access to
education and improved quality of teaching, expanded coverage of basic health care and
HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and increased access to clean water and sanitation,
particularly in urban areas.

•

Increased employment and income opportunities for the poor. A two-pronged
approach will focus, first, on the labor market and employment strategy for urban
workers. Second, IDA will support efforts to reduce risk, increase revenues, upgrade
economic and market infrastructure and enhance women’s opportunities in rural areas,
along with promoting community-based land and natural resource management for
sustainable development.

•

Better governance with greater decentralization. Governance affects the achievement
of development outcomes across all strategic pillars and sectors. Efforts to enhance
governance and accountability will be integral to all IDA-supported activities. Particular
emphasis will be placed on supporting a more efficient judiciary, promoting public
resource management and increased decentralization and strengthening local
government’s capacity and participation in public policy decisions.

30.
The current Bank Portfolio comprises 14 IDA and 2 GEF commitments of
US$ 579.7 million, of which US$ 418 million are undisbursed. IDA’s detailed portfolio in

Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue on
macroeconomic policies and monitors macroeconomic performance through quantitative
performance criteria. In addition, it has established structural performance criteria in the
areas of tax policy, financial transparency and good governance, and trade policy.
33.
Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in economic growth and
poverty reduction The Bank is supporting the implementation of the PRSP in the areas of
cotton sector reform, public finance management, good governance, decentralization, energy
sector and economic diversification and competitiveness through a series of poverty
reduction support credits (PRSC), complemented with a portfolio of specific projects
addressing issues related to HIV/AIDS, education, infrastructure investments in transport,
water and sanitation, urban and rural development, private sector development, and statistical
capacity building.
34.
Areas of shared responsibility. The staffs of the Bank and Fund consult with each
other on a regular basis on all aspects of the policy dialog in order to ensure a well
coordinated approach. Bank and Fund staffs are expected to attend Board discussions in the
other institution, and will normally be called to the table to present their views on areas of the
reform program where their institution is in the lead. Bank and Fund staffs collaborate as
needed on a variety of topics in ways that are consistent with their areas of emphasis. These
include but are not limited to the following: debt sustainability assessments; level and
composition of public expenditures; public financial management; anti-corruption efforts;
and HIPC resource use.

APPENDIX III. BURKINA FASO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Overall, data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes, but serious shortcomings
hamper economic and program monitoring. The country has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2001 and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). However, the metadata have not been
updated since 2001. Following the conversion of the National Institute of Statistics and
Demography (INSD) into an autonomous agency, its human and material resources were
significantly increased in 2002.
The country has received technical assistance (TA) under the government finance statistics
(GFS) component of the regional GDDS project (funded by Japan) for member countries of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).23 A data ROSC mission visited
Burkina Faso in May 2003 and the report was published in March 2004. The May 2006 and
September 2006 STA missions helped the authorities update the statistical plans for
improvement and recommended increasing resources to support statistical reforms, especially
to the INSD, for additional staff and survey work. This was seen as a prerequisite to
enhanced overall effectiveness of technical assistance.
Real sector
Serious problems have been identified in both national accounts and price statistics. The
INSD compiles the national accounts following the harmonized WAEMU guidelines, which
are in line with the 1993 SNA. Annual data are available on GDP estimates by economic
activity (19 industries) and by expenditure categories at current and constant (1985) prices, as
well as by institutional sector accounts. Also, a general table of transactions and an overall
balance of goods and services are available.
The quality of the national accounts estimates is affected by the scarcity of suitable data
sources and by deficiencies in statistical practices. In particular, the informal sector is not
properly captured, with estimates derived from limited informal sector surveys conducted in
1989 and 1996. Although included in the directory of industrial and commercial enterprises,
most medium and small enterprises belonging to the “modern sector” fall short of submitting
accounting statements or tax declarations. Other deficiencies revealed from GDDS metadata
are the residual estimation of private household consumption in the absence of an adequate
framework to validate data (i.e., supply-use tables), and the use of an outdated base year
(1985) for constant price estimates. The country has completed, with TA from the Fund and
other donors, the current price accounts for 2000 and revised the 1999 data. A work program
aiming at improving the quality of the national accounts and producing estimates for missing
years has been set up with AFRITAC West assistance. To this end, the INSD will receive
further TA from the AFRISTAT and INSEE-France.

23

Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo.

15
The consumer price index compiled by the INSD follows the methodology of the harmonized
index adopted by the WAEMU member countries. The index only covers expenditures by
households living in the capital. Further restrictions are the exclusion of non-African
households, various types of purchased goods and services, as well as services of owneroccupied dwellings. The weight for the item “food, beverages, and tobacco” (33.9 percent of
the total) is very low in comparison with neighboring countries. A possible explanation is
that the survey from which the weights are taken did not cover a full year. There are plans—
subject to the availability of funding—to update the weights. Currently, the base year is
1996. When a product is unavailable, its price is presumed to remain unchanged for a period
of up to three months, which is in conformity with the WAEMU methodology. However,
best practice would impute a price change for these items on the basis of the prices recorded
for closely related products. The software package used for calculating the consumer price
index needs to be improved. There do not seem to be other major problems concerning the
index, whose periodicity and timeliness meet SDDS requirements. The index is published by
the INSD and is also available on the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and
AFRISTAT websites.
The authorities do not compile a producer price index or wholesale price index. According to
plans for improvement posted on the DSBB, the development of these indices is not
envisaged, even for the medium term.
Government finance
Annual data are published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) through 2005. No
detailed monthly or quarterly data have been reported to STA for publication. The 2006
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook includes data for 2004 and 2005 that were for the
first time reported in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM
2001). The data cover budgetary operations only, but include a breakdown by function for
2004. In general, GFS compilation is constrained by a lack of coordination among fiscal
agencies. The ROSC identified as areas for improvement the production of functional and
ministerial breakdown of expenditure, extending the coverage of the TOFE to the general
government, and basing compilation on the Treasury ledger. The above-mentioned areas
benefited from the June-July 2007 FAD/AFRITAC West public finance management
mission. It provided a medium-term strategy to improve budget management, furthered the
progress on prior STA recommendations, and strongly encouraged the authorities to adopt
functional classification of expenditure and other methods consistent with GFSM 2001.
Monetary and financial statistics
Preliminary monetary data are prepared by the national agency of the BCEAO and released
officially with a lag of two to three months. Most of the problems in the monetary statistics
are not specific to Burkina Faso, but affect all member countries of the WAEMU. For
example, the BCEAO has encountered difficulties in estimating currency in circulation in
each WAEMU member country due to large backlogs of unsorted banknotes held by the
central bank in its various national agencies. Another problem has been the slower-thanexpected implementation of the new accounting system by banks since its introduction on
January 1, 1996. These delays contribute substantially to the lag in reporting monetary
statistics.

16
The problems underlying delays in reporting of monetary statistics have not been resolved,
despite technical assistance and additional measures to accelerate the bank note sorting
operations to estimate currency in circulation in the WAEMU countries. In August 2005, the
BCEAO informed STA of a change in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The new method, based on updated sorting coefficients (“coefficients de
tri”), has been applied backwards to time series from December 2003 and aims at improving
the accuracy and timeliness of monetary statistics in the WAEMU countries. The African
Department and STA await more information from the authorities to review the new
methodology. Meanwhile, however, key monetary aggregates such as broad money, net
foreign assets and other monetary indicators have undergone substantial revisions.
Following a technical assistance mission to the BCEAO headquarters in 2001, the authorities
agreed on an action plan for the implementation of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM) and on the introduction of an area-wide page for the WAEMU in the IFS;
the latter was achieved in January 2003.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s methodology,
the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for June 2006 for all member countries using
Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository corporations, and 5SRmonetary aggregates). These data were reviewed in STA and feedback was provided to the
authorities. A response from the authorities is pending.
Balance of payments
The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance of payments statistics with a seven-month
lag, in partial compliance with the recommendations of the GDDS, and annual international
investment position data with an eighteen-month lag. Regarding trade data, the customs
computer system (SYDONIA) was upgraded in 1999, and its implementation in the main
border customs offices is complete; this allowed for better monitoring of import data and
should improve the coverage of informal trade. Further improvement of services and
transfers (especially workers’ remittances) coverage is clearly linked to the future
intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies. The 2003 data ROSC mission found that
the response rate for the survey among industrial and commercial enterprises was only
40 percent. To address this, the mission recommended that more attention and resources be
devoted to improve data collection. Updates for the IFS and the BOPSY since 2001 are
pending.
In the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbank sector are well covered
through the use of data from the Bank for International Settlements. The organization of
annual surveys for the reporting of foreign direct investment transactions is still at a
preliminary stage. The BCEAO authorities have indicated that they are looking forward to
integrating two additional sources aimed at improving the quality of the balance of payments
reports: the regional stock exchange transactions, and the firms’ balance sheet database
(centrale des bilans). They have also indicated that quarterly data derived from banking
settlement reports will soon be used to assess the existing information. The balance of
payments compilers receive payments statements every ten days; however, the information is
not used in the compilation of the annual balance of payments statements, but rather to
support data quality controls and to provide early information to the BCEAO authorities.

17
The computer debt-management system software, SYGADE, developed by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, was introduced in 1999 and is fully
operational. Information on debt disbursement has also been fully integrated with the
expenditure-monitoring system.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Burkina Faso
On January 9, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso.1
Background
Burkina Faso has made considerable progress towards macroeconomic stability over the
past decade. Real GDP growth over the past 10 years was strong, averaging 6 percent
annually, and inflation has been contained. Growth was broad based, supported recently
in particular by the telecommunications and transportation sectors. Structural reforms and
stability oriented macroeconomic policies have strengthened the market orientation of the
economy and improved its flexibility. The gains from macroeconomic reforms have
resulted in improvements in social indicators, with household survey poverty incidence
reducing from 54.6 in 2000 to 46.4 percent in 2005. Nevertheless, Burkina Faso
continues to rank among the poorest countries in the world, and reaching the Millennium
Development Goals might be challenging.
Burkina Faso’s macroeconomic performance in 2006 was better than projected during the
last Article IV consultation despite a difficult external environment. Real GDP growth was
around 5.5 percent and inflation fell below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent
because of lower food prices. The current account improved as official current transfers
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted
to the country's authorities.

2
exceeded expectations. Exports grew strongly partly because the fall in world cotton
prices was not fully passed on to farmers. Fiscal policy loosened as planned, with the
fiscal deficit (excluding grants) rising.
The overall positive macroeconomic performance reflects sound policy implementation,
but also delayed adjustment to world cotton prices and additional debt relief. The limited
pass through of world cotton prices shielded producers from the decline in world prices,
keeping production—as well as exports and real GDP growth—high. The result was large
financial losses at ginning companies; and the largest, partially-owned company,
SOFITEX, had to be recapitalized at great cost to the budget. The authorities’ policy to
pass-through higher energy prices through automatic fuel price adjustments and a tariff
increase for electricity were critical for adjusting to the oil price shock. Debt sustainability
benefited from MDRI relief, which eased a key constraint on fiscal policy. The revenue
effort remained low, including in comparison to other WAEMU countries; with lower-thanprojected revenues, the authorities also had to cut back expenditure increases.
Burkina Faso’s medium-term outlook was impacted by an external shock relating to the
balance of payments implications of weather-related declines in cotton exports and
increased oil prices. This is expected to reduce growth, and has negatively affected the
debt sustainability outlook. Real GDP growth is expected to decline to roughly 4.5 percent
for 2007 though an expected increase in gold production could partly offset these effects.
The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, will likely widen in 2007 and 2008.
However, higher grant inflows, including disbursements from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC), should help rein in the current account deficit, including transfers.
The continued appreciation of the euro will make it harder for Burkina Faso to grow its
exports base.
Ongoing structural reforms include steps to improve revenue performance. Domestic
revenues are still low by regional standards, and measures focus on improving tax
compliance and broadening the tax base. Reforms to improve tax administration include
the computerization of the large taxpayer office, the removal of exemptions, and the
streamlining of the tax code. The strengthening of public financial management is another
focus of the authorities’ reform program. In other areas, structural reforms are aimed at
reducing constraints to the business environment, reduce corruption and improve
international competitiveness. The authorities are also working with stakeholders on
cotton sector reform.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Burkinabè authorities for implementing strong
policies in 2006 and 2007, in the context of a difficult macroeconomic environment. These
policies have contributed to robust economic growth and low inflation.
Directors noted that the fall in international cotton prices, the appreciation of the euro, and
rising oil prices pose challenges for sustaining growth and macroeconomic stability going

3
forward. They welcomed the adjustment measures taken by the authorities in response to
these challenges, and underscored the importance of maintaining a sound fiscal policy
and pressing ahead with structural reforms to improve competitiveness, diversify the
economy, and attract private investment. A prudent policy framework is especially
important to improve external competitiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce the fiscal deficit by increasing the revenueto-GDP ratio over the medium term. This will be necessary to raise priority spending while
reducing the current account deficit and maintaining fiscal and external debt sustainability.
In this connection, timely implementation of revenue administration and comprehensive
tax policy measures will be crucial. Directors therefore welcomed the focus on revenueraising reforms in 2008 and encouraged early adoption of the planned tax policy reform.
Directors also recommended against contracting new non-concessional borrowing, and
stressed that the authorities should seek new assistance in the form of grants wherever
possible.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen public financial management
and governance by improving budget preparation and execution, tightening expenditure
controls, and tracking foreign-financed and poverty-reducing expenditure more closely.
They welcomed in particular the steps taken to strengthen the government’s audit
capacity. Directors encouraged the authorities to further enhance transparency and
expenditure prioritization, and welcomed their decision to join the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors commended the adoption of the new cotton producer price mechanism, which is
a major step toward putting cotton ginning companies on a sustainable footing. They
encouraged the authorities to liberalize the cotton sector and reduce the government’s
role, and to re-activate the automatic mechanism for adjusting domestic petroleum prices.
Directors commended the substantial progress achieved in improving the business
climate, and encouraged continued attention to improving governance, reducing rigidities
in the labor market, and strengthening public institutions and infrastructure. Directors
noted that, while the banking system appears to be stable, increasing vulnerabilities point
to the need to strengthen the system further. The upcoming FSAP would be a good
opportunity to help formulate the necessary reform measures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under PRGF Arrangement with Burkina Faso,
Approves US$5.5 Million Disbursement, and Increases Access Under the Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review of
Burkina Faso’s economic performance under the three-year, SDR 6.02 million (about US$9.5
million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility(PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the first
review enables the release of an amount equivalent to SDR 3.51 million (about US$5.5 million)
bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 4.01 million (about US$6.3 million).
The Executive Board also approved an SDR 9.03 million (about US$14.3 million) increase in
access under the PRGF arrangement and granted waivers for the non- observance of two structural
criteria pertaining to the adoption of the single customs document, and the notification of nonfilers
by the tax administration on the basis of corrective actions taken.
The PRGF arrangement with Burkina Faso was approved on April 23, 2007 (see Press Release No.
07/77) to support the government’s economic reform program for 2007-10.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that PRGFsupported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.
In commenting on the Executive Board's decision, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Burkinabè authorities have maintained a strong policy performance in a difficult
macroeconomic environment. The fall in international cotton prices, the appreciation of the euro,
and rising oil prices posed severe challenges. The authorities addressed these challenges through

2
appropriate adjustment measures, in particular by facilitating a pass through of international price
movements. In this context, the new cotton producer price mechanism represents a major step
toward putting cotton ginning companies on a sustainable footing. Resuming the automatic price
adjustment mechanism for domestic petroleum prices will also be critical to facilitate economic
adjustment to higher oil prices.
“In 2008, the expected decline in cotton exports and rise in oil imports will pose further external
challenges. The Fund is helping Burkina Faso to meet the challenges by providing additional
resources of SDR 9.03 million (about US$13.9 million) in balance-of-payment support. Temporary
factors, in particular adverse weather conditions, contribute to the expected widening of the current
account deficit. However, the international price shocks also have a permanent component, and the
authorities need to strengthen competitiveness in order to improve the long-run balance-ofpayments outlook.
“The planned fiscal stance for 2008 strikes an appropriate balance between adjusting to a
deterioration in the debt sustainability outlook and protecting expenditures under adverse economic
conditions. The authorities plan to focus in 2008 on further strengthening tax and customs
administration, together with significant tax policy reforms. The availability of additional grants
from the World Bank and the African Development Bank will make a significant contribution
toward improving the debt sustainability outlook. This will need to be reinforced by policy
measures, particularly a reduction in the fiscal deficit including grants over the medium term,”
Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Burkina Faso
January 9, 2008
On behalf of my Burkina Faso authorities, I would like to thank the Executive Board, Management
and Staff for their continued support to Burkina Faso. My authorities are very grateful to staff for
the constructive and high quality policy exchange over the past years and also for the fruitful
discussions recently held in Ouagadougou.
In spite of a difficult external environment marked by low cotton prices, the country recorded a
good macroeconomic performance in 2006, with a growth rate of 5 ½. Inflation fell below
3 percent, the convergence criterion of the monetary union. Even though revenue collection was
adversely affected by slowdown in economic activity, the fiscal position was in line with
expectations, owing to a higher inflow of grants and spending restraint. Exports increased strongly,
but due to increases in the prices of oil imports and unfavorable international cotton prices, the
current account deteriorated. The country's external position benefited from MDRI, which helped
reduce by half the stock of external debt.
In order to enhance the country's resilience to exogenous shocks and make steady progress in
poverty reduction and growth, my authorities have embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda
within the framework of the PRGF, including tax and customs administration reforms, the adoption
of a new public finance strategy aimed at yielding higher revenue collection and improving public
financial management. In spending, my authorities efforts aimed at better tracking and prioritizing
expenditures in order to increase growth enhancing and poverty reducing outlays. The agenda also
involves the reform of the cotton sector, structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency,
including through increased transparency and accountability and continued improvements in the
business climate. In this latter respect, Burkina Faso's selection by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) as one of the best reformers in its latest Doing Business Report is a testimony of
my authorities' commitment to- and ownership of-their ambitious reform agenda.
In view of the overall satisfactory program performance, amid adverse exogenous shocks, and given
the commitment of my authorities to sound economic policies going forward, I request the Board's
support for the completion of the first review of the PRGF-supported program and my authorities'
request for an augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement by 15 percent of quota, in order
to smooth the adjustment of reserves. In addition, my authorities have already implemented the
missed performance criterion on the implementation of a single customs declaration form and have
initiated corrective actions to meet the missed criterion on tax administration as soon as possible.
I- RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity in 2007 has been buoyant, owing to my authorities steadfast implementation of a
comprehensive policy response supplemented by an increased assistance from development
partners. Inflation kept falling and has turned negative recently, even with the full pass-trough of
increases in world oil prices to domestic prices. However, GDP growth projection has been reduced
to 4 ¼ percent, following the sharp reduction of cotton production. The production of cotton fell
sharply, due to a decline in the floor price to cotton producers, a late announcement of the producer

4
floor price, delayed payments from the cotton ginning company to producers- following banks
refusal to extend to it further credit for the 2006–07 campaign, and a late rainfall.
On fiscal policy, my authorities maintained a prudent stance by restraining spending, while
implementing reforms aimed at raising revenue, so as to create the fiscal space needed for priority
spending. On the revenue side, key reforms were implemented, including in tax and custom
administration and additional allocation of resources were made for audits and collection efforts. In
tax administration, my authorities started using the functionalities of the tax administration
computer system to automatically notify late tax filers. Further organizational improvements are
being considered to ensure of the full implementation of the notification measure by end-January
2008. In customs administration, a single custom declaration form is being used since November
2007. Moreover, a computerized customs-specific valuation database is in place in all the
computerized offices and will be used to improve the custom process. On spending, my authorities
have limited spending to priority areas and one-off priority spending, such as the recapitalization of
SOFITEX or the payment of VAT refund arrears. Further additional spending was restricted to
foreign-financed capital spending.
My authorities took steps to reduce external competitiveness pressures following the increase of
some real exchange rate indicators, including through structural reforms and a reduction of
income taxes to a level in line with regional averages. They also took steps to increase the banking
system soundness and promote financial development.
Structural reforms focused on reforming the cotton sector, efforts to fight corruption and improve
the business climate. In order to ensure the financial viability of cotton ginning companies which
registered significant losses, my authorities have completed the recapitalization of SOFITEX.
Moreover, a new producer price mechanism for cotton was adopted, which will be in line with
world prices. On governance and the fight against corruption, my authorities took steps to
implement the national strategy for good governance, the Plan National de Bonne Gouvernance,
(PNBG). They streamlined the institutions involved under a new Autorité Supérieure de Contrôle
d'Etat (ASCE) vested with more autonomy and powers to take legal action. On the business
climate, my authorities have made significant progress, as reflected in Burkina Faso's rating
improvement in IFC's Doing Business Report. They reduced the time required to register a company
to 23 days, halved the cost of enforcing judgments, reduced property registration and transfer fees
and introduced specialized commercial chambers to provide a one stop window for businesses.
II- POLICY AND REFORM AGENDA FOR 2008
My authorities plan to implement policies aimed at improving Burkina Faso's competitiveness, in
order to diversify the sources of growth, increase the economy' resiliency to exogenous shocks and
reduce poverty. In doing so, they will strive to preserve debt sustainability.
Fiscal policy will aim at creating the fiscal space required to make steady progress towards the
millennium development goals, while preserving macroeconomic stability. This will require
additional spending, especially in the face of increased social needs arising from the crisis in the
cotton sector as well as recent flooding. Policy action in this respect is significantly complicated by

5
the heightened debt sustainability concerns following the downturn in the cotton sector as this
sector represents a significant share of Burkina Faso's exports. In view of these competing
objectives, my authorities opted to maintain a prudent fiscal stance by targeting a deficit of
5.4 percent of GDP for 2008. To achieve their goal, my authorities plan to increase revenue
collection, while prioritizing spending.
On revenue collection, they plan to further modernize tax administration, reinforce public financial
management and implement an ambitious revenue administration reform agenda, in order to raise
the revenue-to-GDP ratio by 0.2 percentage point in 2008. They also plan to front-load tax reforms
aiming at broadening the tax base and preserving competitiveness, including by lowering corporate
income tax to a level in line with regional standards. On the expenditure side, my authorities plan
to increase health- and education-related spending as well as infrastructure outlays. They are
committed to work with development partners, including the World Bank, to increase the efficiency
of public spending, by conducting public expenditure reviews and project effectiveness analyses
and by improving budget preparation and execution. Notably, they plan to take steps to better track
expenditures and improve internal and external expenditure controls. They welcome technical
assistance received from the IMF, especially the recent FAD mission, which will is a valuable input
to their reform strategy.
On Structural Reforms, my authorities intend to finalize a strategy to reform and liberalize the
cotton sector, improve governance and the business climate and promote financial sector
development. They are closely consulting stakeholders, in order to define a comprehensive strategy
for the cotton sector. The price smoothing fund (fonds de lissage) is expected to be finalized with
the help of the Agence Française de Développement (AFD). However, key operating principles in
this endeavor are already agreed upon, including self-financing, sustainability and transparency. As
regards governance and the business climate, my authorities take good note of the reports of
Transparency International, the World Bank's GICC and Doing Business Report, and the UNDP's
Human Capital Index. While they had wished the reports' methodologies were improved to ensure
comparability across countries at different income levels as well as consistency overtime, my
authorities nevertheless consider the reports as informative and valuable inputs in identifying
priority areas in need of improvement. On the upside, the reports show that, in areas within the
Fund's core mandate, Burkina Faso's ranking is outstanding. Moreover, the country's rating in the
IFC's Doing Business Report has significantly improved and ranked well on many indicators of
quality of governance and corruption. Nonetheless my authorities reiterate their commitment to
work closely with development partners to further improve on the current performance.
On governance, my authorities are committed to a steadfast implementation of the PNGB's which
they hope will benefit from the comprehensive Governance and Anti-Corruption Diagnostics
planned for 2008 with support from the World Bank. On the business climate, my authorities plan
further reforms, in order to improve the economy's competitiveness, with an the aim of diversifying
the sources of growth and increasing the role of the private sector in the economy. As for the
financial sector, my authorities will build on the results already achieved to continue to ensure the
soundness of the banking system and reinforce the role of financial intermediation in promoting the
private sector.

6
III- CONCLUSION
My Burkina Faso authorities have demonstrated steadfast commitment to implementing the policies
and reforms of their PRGF-supported program, even as they faced significant challenges. Although
they expect many of the reforms to yield results in the medium-term, my authorities have made
significant progress in tax and customs administration, taken steps to combat corruption, and
continued to improve the business climate.
Going forward, my authorities are engaged in accelerating the pace of reforms, with the view to
making progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, while preserving
macroeconomic stability. As recently as last week, President Compaoré reiterated his objective to
significantly improve the country's human capital in 2008, which will contribute to progress
towards meeting the MDGs and sustaining a broad-based economic growth. In view of the strong
track record of my Burkinabè authorities in program implementation and their commitment to, and
ownership of, sound economic policies and reforms, I will appreciate the Board's support to their
requests.
