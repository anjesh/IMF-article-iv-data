STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 1, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Medium-term prospects. Removing impediments to trade and investment, building healthy
financial institutions, and improving governance will help achieve inclusive and broad-based
growth. Developing a comprehensive social safety net will complement these efforts.
Near-term growth outlook. The economy is recovering faster than anticipated, driven
primarily by exports of oil and minerals, as well as public spending. The strong recovery is
expected to continue in 2011, with growth becoming more balanced.
Recent macroeconomic policies. Consistent with the recommendations of the 2010 Article
IV Consultation, the authorities have started a gradual withdrawal of crisis-related stimulus,
and the official exchange rate band was abandoned. However, a transparent and
comprehensive strategy to resolve banks’ problem loans has not been implemented, and
banks continue to be burdened by a large share of impaired assets.
Bank soundness. The authorities’ new plan to reduce problem assets would benefit from a
comprehensive forward-looking assessment of asset quality to determine possible
recapitalization needs. Proper valuation and accounting of restructured loans, as well as
resolution of tax and legal shortcomings, will be crucial to restoring the health of the system.
Inflation pressures. The surge in inflation is mainly driven by rising global food and fuel
prices, but planned wage increases also pose risks. Inflation should be closely monitored, and
further tightening is likely to be needed. The use of administrative measures to limit price
increases should be phased out in favor of targeted assistance to low income groups.
Non-oil deficit reduction. A medium-term fiscal framework, with intermediate targets for
non-oil deficit reduction, will be helpful. This framework should reflect the optimal balance
between the use and saving of oil revenues, and incorporate the enlarged government,
including public and quasi-public enterprises.
Greater exchange rate flexibility. Increased tenge flexibility would enhance the economy’s
responsiveness to external shocks and improve monetary policy traction.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
The recovery has gained speed, and the external and fiscal positions have strengthened with
the rebound in commodity prices. Higher foreign inflows resulted in appreciation pressures
on the tenge, but the central bank continued to limit its rise. Banks remain burdened by
problem loans. Inflation pressures have emerged with rising food prices. Supported by
favorable terms of trade, the economic outlook is promising, but subject to risks posed by
changing external conditions, and a potential further deterioration of the financial system.

A. The Recovery is Gaining Momentum
1.

An early presidential election took place

on April 3, 2011. The snap election, which was not

financing.

due until late 2012, followed the Constitutional
Council’s rejection of the parliament’s proposal for
legal changes to allow President Nazarbayev to remain
in office until 2020. The president was re-elected to a
new 5-year term, winning over 95 percent of the vote.
The election was followed by modifications in the
composition of the government, although the Prime
Minister remained in office. Economic policies are not
likely to change, and the policy agenda is now focused
on the implementation of a medium-term plan—the
Strategic Development Plan to 2020.

3.

The economic recovery gained speed in

2010. Aided by favorable commodity prices and
continuing public sector support, real GDP expanded
by 7 percent, up from 1¼ percent in 2009. Growth
was substantially higher than expected by the
authorities, the Fund, and most market analysts.1 The
recovery continued to be driven by oil and minerals as
well as related services, in particular transport and
communications. Agriculture contracted due to a
severe drought, while activity in construction and real
estate remained flat.

2.

The medium-term plan aims at achieving

inclusive and broad-based growth. It envisages

share of manufacturing and agriculture in GDP—

living standards. Samruk-Kazyna (SK), the state

significantly in recent years, from 13½ percent in 2005
to 5¼ percent by end-2010. However, there are
concerns related to hidden unemployment2 and selfemployment. The latter accounts for over 30 percent
of the labor force and includes many rural poor. The
official poverty rate also continued to decline, but
poverty remains relatively high in rural areas,
contributing to the migration to large cities (Box 1).

6.

The external position strengthened, and

foreign inflows began to pick up. The current
account returned to surplus in 2010 (3 percent of
GDP), as exports and imports rebounded in response
to rising external and domestic demand. Trade with
Russia expanded following the creation of the customs
union; even though some of this trade may no longer
be captured by the statistics (see Chapter II of the
Selected Issues Paper). Part of this increase may reflect

Kazakhstan’s Social Safety Net

Poverty and Inequality
Kazakhstan has succeeded in reducing the official
poverty rate (the share of population with incomes
below the subsistence level) from 40-50 percent in
1990s to 6½ percent in 2010. Nonetheless, the official
subsistence level is low (KZT 15,338, or $105 a
month), and poverty remains relatively high in rural
areas. Inequality is on a declining trend, with the Gini
coefficient falling by 24 percent since 2001.

A pay-as-you-go pension system was inherited from
the Soviet era. This was replaced in 1998 by an
accumulative pension system (including compulsory
and voluntary elements) that covers the whole
population. A minimum basic pension equal to 40
percent of the subsistence level is guaranteed by the
government. The current pension age is 58 years for
women and 63 years for men.

0

Targeted Assistance
Cash transfers to individuals or families with monthly
incomes below 40 percent of the subsistence level, or
$42. The amount provided is the difference between
household income and 40 percent of the subsistence
level times the number of people in the household.
These transfers are currently received by 200,000
people, or 20 percent of the population with incomes
below the subsistence level.
Housing assistance for low-income families with
monthly expenses on housing (including utilities)
above the maximum level, expressed as percentage of
income. This benefit covers 200,000 families.
Unemployment benefits (equal to average monthly
earnings of the last two years) cover employed and
self employed residents, making them eligible after 6
months of coverage. The duration of the benefit
depends on the period for which the insured was
covered.

State social benefits provide periodical transfers to
persons in need due to disability, loss of breadwinner,
or old age. The size of benefits is tied to the minimum
wage.
Other benefits include sickness, work injury and
maternity benefits (paid by employers), as well as
family assistance for the birth of a child and for caring
for a child.
Is There Room for Improvement?
Government assistance would benefit from better
coverage and more appropriate levels and
organization. Reports from UNDP and the World Bank
emphasize the need to improve the household income
databases and increase awareness of existing social
benefits, especially in rural areas. Targeting could also
be improved, as some benefits (such as child support)
are not dependent on income. The authorities
recognize these issues, and are setting up local
committees in rural areas to monitor the beneficiaries,
verify the needs for targeted assistance, and improve
awareness of the population.

as existing fields approach their capacity. The non-oil
sector is projected to continue recovering, notably
agriculture with an expected return to more normal
weather, retail trade favored by improved incomes,
and mineral and oil-related activities. The direct
benefits of higher hydrocarbon prices on other
domestic sectors are limited, as windfall revenues
above the fixed budget transfer are saved (see Chapter
III of the Selected Issues Paper). With global food
prices remaining high and potential demand pressures
beginning to emerge, inflation is likely to exceed the
objective range, reaching 9-10 percent by the end of
the year. The external current account balance and the
oil fund assets are projected to strengthen further. In

A deterioration of external and financial

sector conditions presents the main downside
risk to the outlook. Kazakhstan would be particularly
affected by negative developments in major trade and
financial partners (Box 2). A fall in commodity prices
would undermine the improvement of the fiscal and
external positions, and the recovery of incomes.
Furthermore, renewed volatility in global financial
markets could adversely affect the ability of banks and
corporations to access international markets, impairing
their ability to service maturing external liabilities
(estimated at $13 billion for 2011). A potential
deterioration of financial sector conditions would be
another key risk to the outlook.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

External Spillover Risks for Kazakhstan

China
Economic linkages with China have grown in recent
years. China is now Kazakhstan’s biggest trading
partner (24¼ percent of total trade) and the fourth
largest foreign investor (nearly 10 percent of total
foreign investment). It is also a strategic lender to
projects in key sectors such as oil refining, energy
generation, chemical production, transport and
communications. Given the influence of Chinese
demand on global commodity prices, a deterioration
of economic activity in China would lower
Kazakhstan’s commodity-related investment and
exports.
Euro Area
While Kazakhstan’s financial exposure to the euro
area periphery is limited, more widespread problems
in Europe could have significant implications.
Kazakhstani holdings of assets in Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and Spain account for only 1½ percent of
total assets abroad, and recent experience shows that
the impact of adverse developments in these countries
on Kazakhstan’s spreads appears to be short-lived.
However, the eurozone as a whole remains an
important financial and trading partner. Kazakhstan’s
trade with the eurozone accounts for 23 percent of
total trade, and euro area investors account for 33
percent of the stock of foreign investment in
Kazakhstan. Furthermore, about 30 percent of foreign
assets held by Kazakhstani residents are eurozone
claims.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Therefore, more widespread problems in Europe could
translate into weaker demand for Kazakhstani exports
and higher borrowing costs at both the sovereign and
corporate levels. In addition, intensified banking sector
problems in the eurozone could undermine the
foreign asset positions of Kazakhstani banks.

Russia
Kazakhstan’s significant trade and financial linkages
with Russia are expected to deepen. The customs
union has begun to enhance the already strong
economic ties between these countries, and the
Common Economic Space (planned for 2012) will
deepen the exposure of Kazakhstan to the impacts of
commodity price developments on the Russian
economy. This prospect is clearly reflected in the rapid
convergence of Russian and Kazakhstani CDS spreads.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POLICY PRIORITIES
The main policy priority is to restore the health of the banking and corporate sectors. In
parallel, there is a need to maintain macroeconomic stability by continuing to withdraw the
accommodative bias in monetary policy, pursuing greater exchange rate flexibility, and
strengthening the fiscal position. Over the medium term, structural reforms are needed to
ensure broad-based and inclusive growth.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

New Conceptual Plan to Reduce Problem Loans in Kazakhstan

The Plan

Valuation

The Council for Financial Stability has approved a new
conceptual plan to improve the quality of banks’
assets. The plan aims to remove NPLs with an
approximate face value of $6 billion (about 37½
percent of the total) from banks’ main balance sheets
in order to facilitate a resumption of lending, while
limiting costs and mitigating moral hazard. If
successful, the plan is expected to be expanded,
drawing the participation of both domestic and
foreign investors. Although details remain preliminary,
the plan is designed to proceed in three
complementary directions:









Establishment by banks of special purpose
vehicles to act as private asset management
companies (AMCs). These AMCs would receive
problem assets related to real estate and land
assets with a face value of around $4 billion.
Establishment of a distressed asset fund. This fund
would be owned by the NBK, and capitalized with
$1 billion raised through a restricted domestic
debt placement (among pension funds, banks,
and the NBK). The fund will purchase and dispose
of other NPLs worth $2 billion (with an assumed
average discount of 50 percent). The interest rates
on the bonds would vary, favoring pension funds
as the senior bondholders.
Enhancement of prudential regulations and
capital adequacy. Regulatory standards would be
harmonized with best international practice and
the Basel III framework, including by
strengthening core capital and reducing systemic
risks through dynamic provisioning and enhanced
capital buffers.

Institutional and Funding Structures



The AMCs would be owned by banks, either
singularly or collectively. No new funding would
be involved.



The distressed asset fund would be time-bound
(with a maximum five year life) and consolidated
into the balance sheet of the NBK.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Under both schemes, asset valuation would be
undertaken by independent external advisors,
including the big four accounting firms, and
based on an assessment of cash flows and net
realizable values.

Management



The AMCs would be managed by both bank staff
that is familiar with the loans and outside
professionals.



The distressed asset fund would be managed by
external managers who would report to the NBK.

Governance



Transparency of the bank level AMCs would
depend on the extent to which they are
consolidated into the main balance sheets of
banks.



The distressed asset fund would be audited, and
the results made public.

Net impact



Under the AMCs, assets would be transferred at
an agreed valuation. However, they will be
subject to more lenient provisioning requirements,
which may boost capital positions under local
accounting rules. Under IFRS accounting there
would be no change. The better focused and
more professional management of bad assets
should allow a higher rate of recovery.



Under the distressed asset fund, banks would
swap provisioned NPLs for bonds at a value
determined by independent assessors. To the
extent that the valuation differs from the net
book value, the balance sheet would be
impacted. Banks would gain extra liquidity as they
could use the bonds in repurchase agreements
with the NBK.

While

recommending

a

comprehensive

approach, staff stressed the need for an accurate
valuation of problem assets and full recognition of
bank losses. This will require an independent and
forward–looking diagnostic assessment of banks’ asset
quality. The authorities are confident that banks
currently meet prudential norms, mitigating the need
for an additional diagnostic assessment. They
explained that asset valuation will be determined by
independent professional appraisers, and that the
improved prudential standards contemplated in the
plan would help strengthen bank positions. Staff
supported the authorities’ plan to remove the existing
tax impediments to the recognition and writing-off of
problem assets. Staff also stressed that ownership and
partial financing of the centralized fund by the NBK
pose risks to the integrity of monetary policy, and may
create conflicts with the NBK’s new supervisory
responsibilities.

17.

In tandem with rehabilitating banks’

balance sheets, the system would benefit from a
more

effective

prudential

framework

to

minimize the risks of boom-bust cycles. To this
end, staff emphasized enforcing existing regulations
and

refraining

from

regulatory

forbearance;

implementing prudential standards that limit banks’
vulnerabilities (including macro-prudential measures to
limit foreign currency borrowing and credit expansion);
and assessing the new business models of the
restructured state-owned banks to ensure their
viability. This should be supported by additional legal
and governance reforms. Coordinated action across
government entities, led by the Council for Financial
Stability, should facilitate these efforts and ensure
independence between the operational aspects of
regulation and supervision and monetary policy. In
addition, it is crucial that supervisors have sufficient
legal protection, enforcement capabilities, and the
budgetary resources to credibly perform their role.

16.

A contingency plan needs to be put in

place if bank capital is eroded by a fuller and
proper recognition of losses. Rapid action should
be taken to attract new capital if it is needed, ideally
from existing shareholders and other private investors.
Staff reiterated the complementary findings and

The Role of the Public Sector in Kazakhstan’s Economy

Enlarged Government

The role of the general government is relatively
limited. Revenues and expeditures (including on social
services) remain lower than in major trading partners.
According to the World Bank, spending on education
stood at 2¾ percent of GDP in 2007, below the
median level of 4¾ percent among emerging
economies. Similarly, spending on public health in
2009 stood at 2⅔ percent, lower than 4⅓ percent
more typically seen in other emerging economies.

Public and quasi-public enterprises dominate the
economy. Samruk-Kazyna controls $77½ billion in
assets, or nearly 55½ percent of GDP in 2010 (45
percent of GDP in 2007). Its holdings include interests
in mining, finance, energy, transportation, property
and construction. The agency is also the sole
shareholder of the Development Bank of Kazakhstan.

Samruk-Kazyna not only safeguards the public sector’s
interests in its companies, but also supports economic
stabilization and development. It has engaged in
significant quasi-fiscal spending since 2009, mainly by
taking majority stakes in banks and placing significant
deposits in the banking system. It also has a catalytic
role in promoting economic diversification by
supporting specific sectors. Through joint-ventures
with investors from China, Russia, Korea and
European countries, the agency plans to invest up to
$40 billion in the coming years in strategic projects in
transport,
energy,

chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and related infrastructure. Its national
gas company has doubled its stake in the large

The possibility of transferring the agency’s

foreign assets are closer to the largest reserve
holders. Kazakhstan’s international reserves rose
by $5¼ billion in 2010, while the oil fund

large. As a result, total official foreign assets are
anticipated to rise to $131½ billion, and stabilize

ANNEX V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 2011)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
most affected areas are monetary and balance of payments statistics, with remaining
deficiencies in national accounts.
National accounts: The quality of GDP statistics is affected by the limited coverage of small
businesses in selected activities such as retail and construction. While some progress has been
made in compiling and reporting GDP by final expenditure consistent with output-based
measures, dissemination of quarterly GDP series data is conducted on a discrete basis only.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal
accounts consistent with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001).
However, as a result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of
budgetary units, difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of
expenditure arrears. In addition, statistics on the enlarged government (including public
enterprises) is not available.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs)
complied by the central bank have a few inconsistencies, and a technical assistance mission in
January 2009 provided several recommendations.
Balance of payments: In general, the balance of payments is compiled in concordance with
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). However, foreign direct
investment statistics are not fully in line with the standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch
offices of foreign companies operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident
entities. This leads to discrepancies with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated
as domestic production. In addition, the errors and omissions have been large and increasing.
The technical assistance mission in April 2010 addressed these issues.
II. Data Standards and Quality

System (SDDS) since March 2003. Metadata
need to be updated.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan
On June 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Kazakhstan, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal under the lapse of time procedure.2
Background
The economic recovery gained speed in 2010. Aided by favorable commodity prices and
continuing public sector support, real GDP expanded by 7 percent, up from 1¼ percent in
2009. Growth was substantially higher than expected by the authorities, the Fund, and
many economic analysts. The external position strengthened, with the current account
returning to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2010, and foreign inflows began to pick up.
Driven largely by rising global food prices, inflation pressures intensified, and annual
inflation was 8½ percent at end-April 2011, exceeding the official objective range of 6-8
percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by

the Board that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

The official unemployment rate was not affected by the crisis, and resumed a declining
trend as the economy started to recover. The official poverty rate also continued to decline,
but poverty remains relatively high in rural areas, contributing to the migration to large
cities.
The banking and corporate sectors have not recovered from the crisis despite the return of
strong economic growth. Nonperforming loans on a 90-day overdue basis remain high at
over 25 percent of total loans. Banks have been reluctant to write off bad loans, given
expectations of economic recovery, difficulties of managing collateral, and tax
disincentives. As a result, banks’ lending activity remained weak, lagging the pace of
economic recovery.
The authorities began to adjust policies to the increase in commodity prices and related
inflows. The NBK raised its policy rate by 50 bps to 7½ percent in March, signaling a
reversal of the easing cycle implemented during the crisis. The overall fiscal balance went
back to a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP in 2010. Emergency support to the financial sector
was significantly reduced, although deposits in the banking system, subsidized lending to
priority sectors, and increases in wages and pensions continued.
Staff projects real GDP growth to remain strong at about 6½ percent in 2011 and the
medium term. Growth is expected to become somewhat more balanced, as the non-oil
sector continues to recover. With global food prices remaining high and potential demand
pressures beginning to emerge, inflation is likely to exceed the objective range, reaching 910 percent by the end of the year. The external current account balance and the oil fund
assets are projected to strengthen further. A deterioration of external economic conditions,
particularly developments in major trade and financial partners and/or a fall in commodity
prices, presents the main downside risk to the outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Executive Directors welcomed the swift pace of economic recovery, which is now more
broad based and mainly driven by favorable external conditions, but noted that a full
recovery of non-oil sector activity remains restrained by banking sector difficulties.

3

Directors commended the authorities’ appropriate response to the increase in commodity
prices and related inflows by tightening the fiscal stance and signaling a move away from
monetary accommodation toward a more neutral stance. A combination of decisive action
to resolve banks’ nonperforming loans, sound macroeconomic policies to address the
emerging inflationary and spending pressures, and structural reforms to encourage
economic diversification are the key pillars for success of the ambitious and commendable
medium-term development plan.
Directors stressed the need for action to forcefully resolve banks’ problem assets, which
has become a protracted problem and poses risks to the outlook. They noted that the new
plan to address this problem is a step in the right direction. However, it needs to ensure in
a more comprehensive way that loans are adequately provisioned and properly valued,
banks’ losses are transparently recognized, restructuring is undertaken by professional
managers, and tax impediments to the writing off of band loans are removed. This process
should be based on a forward-looking, independent and rigorous assessment of banks’
balance sheets, accompanied by strong supervision, and followed by credible plans for any
needed recapitalization. Ownership and partial financing of the envisaged centralized
distressed asset fund by the NBK poses risks to the integrity of monetary policy, and may
create conflicts with its new supervisory powers.
Although domestic demand-based price pressures appear relatively contained, Directors
urged the authorities to continue to keep inflation under control by gradually withdrawing
monetary accommodation, and tightening policies more forcefully if headline inflation keeps
increasing or core inflation starts to rise. They emphasized the importance of fully
implementing the announced macro-prudential measures and enhancing liquidity
management practices to manage a possible increase in capital inflows.
Directors noted that there is no clear evidence that the tenge deviates significantly from its
long run equilibrium, although the real exchange rate appears slightly undervalued given
the prospect for medium-term capital and oil related inflows. Looking forward, greater
exchange rate flexibility would enhance the economy’s ability to absorb shocks and support
monetary policy. In the short term, however, the likely implications of further flexibility for
the balance sheets of banks and corporates should be carefully assessed.
Directors supported the plans for fiscal consolidation through better tax administration and
expenditure restraint. Fiscal management should incorporate the enlarged government,

4

including all public and quasi public enterprises, while giving priority to investment and
social outlays, including enhancing existing social safety nets. This would allow reduced
reliance on administrative measures to contain price increases. Directors stressed the
importance of efficient public financial management, and a medium term framework that
ensures that the use of oil resources and accumulation in the oil fund are aligned with
appropriate intermediate targets for the non-oil balance.
Directors welcomed plans for economic diversification, and noted the importance of
structural reforms to ensure positive spillovers of Kazakhstan’s mineral resource wealth to
the domestic economy. These reforms include improving the business environment,
removing barriers to trade, building institutions, and enhancing governance in the banking
and corporate sectors. Similarly, large public and quasi public enterprises should be
commercially oriented and professionally managed, and statistics transparently
disseminated
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
