Discussions. Discussions were held in Sarajevo and Banja Luka during May 5–17 and
August 17–September 1. The mission met with: (i) at the State level: the Chair of the Council of
Ministers Špirić, the Minister of Finance and Treasury Vrankić, and Central Bank Governor Kozarić;
(ii) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Prime Minister Mujezinović and Minister of
Finance Bevanda; and (iii) in the Republika Srpska: Prime Minister Dodik and Minister of Finance
Džombić. Staff also met with other senior officials, High Representative Inzko, ambassadors, trade
unions, and representatives of the private sector. The mission team comprised Mr. Christou (head);
Mr. Iossifov and Mr. Abdelkader (all EUR), Ms. Karpowicz (FAD), Mr. Darbar (MCM), and
Ms. Khachatryan (SPR). Mr. Cuc (resident representative) assisted the mission. Mr. Tomić (OED)
attended policy meetings. The mission coordinated closely with World Bank staff on structural issues.
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). To date two purchases totaling SDR 304.38 million have been made
under the 36-month, SDR 1,014.6 million (600 percent of quota) SBA approved on July 8, 2009. The
authorities are requesting rephasing of purchases and completion of the second and third reviews,
after which a purchase in the amount of SDR118.4 million will be made available. Of this amount,
the authorities intend to draw SDR33.82 million for budget support, while given the strong reserve
position they will not draw the remainder at this stage.
Program status. All end-March 2010 targets and end-June 2010 (the controlling test date for the
reviews) performance criteria were met, except for the one on non-accumulation of domestic arrears.
Progress was also made on the program’s structural reform benchmarks, albeit with delays.
Context of past surveillance. Prior to 2009, Fund advice noted the rising external imbalances and
pointed out that expansionary fiscal and public wage policies could threaten competitiveness and
increase risks to external stability. The program supported by the SBA incorporates policies
consistent with Fund advice, although implementation of structural reforms has been slow.
Exchange system. Currency Board pegged to the euro at a rate of KM1 = €0.5113. Bosnia and
Herzegovina has not accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Statistics. Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance.

I. CONTEXT—GROWING IMBALANCES, THE CRISIS, AND THE PROGRAM
1.
The global economic and financial crisis found the economy of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH) in a vulnerable position. Prior to the crisis, like elsewhere in the region,
with capital inflows driving a domestic demand boom, internal and external imbalances
worsened. Loose fiscal and public wage policies also contributed to the overheating of the
economy. The crisis triggered a collapse in the demand for BiH exports and severely
curtailed cross-border financial inflows. The banking system came under strain, as the spate
of negative news about foreign banks with subsidiaries in BiH triggered a mini-deposit run in
late 2008.
2.
Faced with increasing financing pressures in early 2009, the authorities put
together a comprehensive program supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement. The
program was designed to safeguard the currency board and cushion the effects of the
deteriorating external environment, while adopting policies to redress fiscal imbalances and
strengthen the financial sector. The authorities’ approach included: (i) gradual fiscal
consolidation accompanied by structural fiscal reforms to bring public finances on a
sustainable path; (ii) steps to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector alongside
commitments by foreign parent banks to maintain their external exposures to BiH and keep
their subsidiaries capitalized; and (iii) substantial financing from the Fund along with funds
from the World Bank and the EU.

The persistently high current account deficit
contracted sharply and financing pressures were
alleviated. The steep decline in domestic demand along with a
slump in international prices of BiH imports led to a rapid
narrowing of the current account deficit in 2009–10. At the
same time, the multilateral financial support package and the
commitment of parent banks to maintain their exposures to the
country helped contain the impact of a drop in external
balance-of-payments financing on international reserves.
Current transfers declined sharply and remain depressed, due
to the worsening economic situation in the EU, where most
migrant and seasonal workers are located.

demand and supply-side factors in 2009 brought inflation into
negative territory. The weakness of domestic demand is
keeping core inflation in check.

adjustment strategy that accommodates a slightly higher deficit for 2010 (4.5 percent of
GDP) compared with the original program.

The global financial crisis tested the resilience of the domestic banking system,
and signs of stress are emerging. Banks weathered the October 2008 mini-deposit run with
the help of liquidity injections from parent banks and the lowering of reserve requirements by
the central bank. Confidence building steps, such as the negotiation of the 2009 SBA, BiH’s

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON THE PROGRAM
A. Outlook and Risks
8.
Economic growth is set to resume. The economy seems to have bottomed out in the
first half of the year and staff projects a moderate recovery already under way leading to a
rebound in 2011. Domestic demand will remain subdued, held in check by stagnant real
wages and ongoing fiscal consolidation. Underlying inflation is projected to remain low.
Private sector credit will pick-up slowly, as banks have yet to absorb the full losses due to
non-performing loans in their portfolios (Tables 7 and 8). The authorities were in broad
agreement with staff views.
9.
The adjustment of the current account is expected to continue, while the
financial account will likely strengthen. In 2010–11, the narrowing of the current account
deficit will be driven in part by lower than pre-crisis domestic demand and an improved
outlook for BiH’s key export commodity prices. Net transfers are projected to stabilize at
12 percent of GDP, reflecting a recovery in the EU and higher labor mobility in the region.
Capital inflows are expected to recover, mainly due to an increase in foreign direct
investment—initially driven by privatization and later on by an improvement in the business
environment. The resumption of consumption and investment growth will restore private
sector foreign borrowing and the European Bank Coordination Initiative will facilitate further
increase in bank foreign liabilities.
10.
Risks to the outlook appear balanced, but the political situation could complicate
program implementation. A further deterioration of credit quality could hamper the fragile
recovery in bank lending, and thereby restrain the real economy. Moreover, the authorities
may find it difficult to keep the momentum for structural reforms, as the general elections
approach (presidential and parliamentary (entity and cantonal) elections will take place in
early October 2010). Further complications may arise from delays in formation of new
governments, and especially at the State level. Nevertheless, all policymakers the mission
met with, including opposition politicians, recognize the need to adhere to the policies

7
envisaged under the program. On the upside, a faster economic recovery in BiH’s trading
partners may boost external demand and private capital inflows.
11.
Medium-term prospects depend critically on the implementation of structural
reforms to improve the country’s growth potential. Reforms aimed at enhancing BiH’s
human capital and speeding-up the pace of technological change would boost productivity
and export prospects, helping achieve medium-term growth of 4½ percent. Still, the
post-crisis growth rate of the BiH economy is likely to be, on average, slightly below its
pre-crisis value. Domestic demand is expected to remain below pre-crisis levels relative to
domestic income, reflecting fiscal consolidation and the end of the credit boom funded from
abroad. Inflation is projected to remain low in line with developments in the euro area.
Maintaining a sustainable level of the current account over the medium-term requires further
diversification of the economy, enhancement of capacity and productivity in export sectors,
and improvement of the business and investment environment. If these reforms proceed
slowly this could deter FDI and tighten the external financing constraint, which would
adversely affect BiH’s growth prospects. The authorities broadly agreed with the analysis
and pointed to the need for ambitious structural reforms to help attract FDI and raise growth
to pre-crisis levels.

adjustment and internal devaluation. Staff emphasized that
preserving external competitiveness over the medium term would require fiscal consolidation
and wage restraint, and structural reforms to overcome long-standing labor market rigidities
and impediments to entrepreneurship. The authorities concurred noting their commitment to
the SBA’s medium-term fiscal adjustment path and the ongoing initiatives to further align the
labor market and business environment regulatory framework with international best
practice. Staff also discussed prerequisite actions needed for accepting the obligations under
Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4, and urged the authorities to remove the existing restrictions
on the transferability of balances and of interest accrued on frozen foreign-currency deposits.
The authorities indicated that they have initiated procedures to deal with this over the coming
period based on advice provided by IMF Legal Department

In light of this, staff argued that foreign-funded projects

integration and potential EU convergence, the equilibrium current account deficit is estimated at 4.1

deficit, which would stabilize the net foreign liability position at around 8 percent of GDP (average of
the previous 5 years), would be 4.4 percent of GDP. Based on the estimated alternative equilibrium

under the equilibrium CPI-based REER approach to about 18 percent overvaluation under the pooled
estimate of the macrobalance approach.

Non-model analysis of competitiveness demonstrates the need for structural reforms to foster private
sector-led growth in BiH. An IMF staff survey1 of private sector reaffirmed the findings of the other
studies which suggest that the key factors impeding FDI and access of companies to foreign markets
are: (i) political instability; (ii) complicated and expensive bureaucracy; (iii) lack of clear vision for
economic development; (iv) corruption and weak legislative framework; and (v) poor quality control
(i.e., local certification and standardization). Substantial opportunities lie in enhanced productivity via
bigger investment in R&D and human capital.

The IMF team met five companies in each entity, the Chamber of Foreign Trade and Commerce, the
Foreign investment Promotion Agency.

C. Maintaining Fiscal Discipline
15.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal consolidation through
fiscal reform, while smoothing the pace of adjustment in line with their social
objectives. With monetary policy assigned to maintain the currency board arrangement,
fiscal policy was the only available instrument to soften the economic downturn. However,
given the starting unsustainable fiscal position, a discretionary fiscal stimulus was not a

10
policy option. As elsewhere in the region, the authorities chose to allow automatic stabilizers
(primarily on the revenue side) to play out. The disbursements under the SBA and the new
SDR allocations helped the authorities broadly maintain the provision of public services and
initiate structural fiscal reforms aimed at putting public finances on a sustainable footing.
16.
Attaining the program’s 2010 fiscal target requires efforts by all governments.
Revenue performance to date has been broadly in line with the program, with
better-than-budgeted VAT and excise collections largely offsetting shortfalls in the other
revenue sources. Total expenditures remained significantly below the program target, due in
part to slow execution of the capital budget and delays in the adoption of the Federation’s
cantonal budgets. However, both entities have exceeded the half-yearly targets for war
disability benefits, which are the largest rights-based transfer program, while the Federation
cantons have failed to implement envisioned wage cuts. The authorities acknowledged the
need for stronger efforts to contain the wage bill and reduce rights-based transfers to stay
within the program’s overall deficit target of 4½ percent of GDP.

Federation. The size of the cantonal budgets and the delays in carrying out eligibility
audits of war-related cash benefits could threaten the Federation’s 2010 fiscal target.
Eligibility audits commenced with a six-month delay and at their current pace will take
more than five years to complete. At the same time, some cantons have approved
expansionary budgets based on large expected transfers from the central government and
unrealistic revenue projections. The central authorities concurred with the assessment and
proposed a set of corrective measures to be included in a rebalanced budget (approval of
which is prior action and has been met). Measures focus on containing the wage bill,
expediting eligibility audits of beneficiaries and improving the audit process (prior action,
LOI¶10—met), and making transfers to the cantons conditional on cantonal budget
rebalances to reduce current expenditures (prior action, LOI¶10—met).

RS. On current trends, the program’s fiscal deficit target for the RS should be within
reach. However, progress on the second stage of eligibility audits of war disability benefits
recipients has proved challenging, and as a result only KM1.2 million of savings have been
realized through June. The authorities have taken steps to expedite audits and expect to
complete the second stage by end-2011 instead of three years. In addition, the mission
cautioned the authorities about the financial situation of the Pension and Health Funds. The
government has addressed liquidity problems through allowing increased transfers to the
Pension Fund and commercial bank borrowing by the two funds, ahead of the planned
pension system and health care reform(LOI¶12 and 13).
17.
There was agreement that the program’s 2011 fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of
GDP remains appropriate. The authorities have made progress in preparing the
medium-term budget framework elaborated by the Fiscal Council, which will underpin the
2011 budgets. However, no agreement has been reached on how the State’s budget will be
financed next year, resulting in delays in the budget preparation process at all levels of

11
government. With State and Entity budget approvals now envisaged after the formation of
new governments following the October elections, staff and the authorities agreed that the
details of the 2011 budgets will be discussed at the time of the next review. As revenues are
projected to remain broadly unchanged relative to GDP, fiscal efforts will continue to focus
on expenditure, aiming at increasing the gains from the reforms initiated this year. Public
sector wage restraint will continue, and savings on transfers to individuals and other current
spending will provide room to finance infrastructure projects.
18.
The authorities are committed to strengthen their efforts on structural fiscal
reforms. The Federation will improve the process of eligibility audits for war disability,
pension, and other benefits (prior action—met). Since there have been delays in the reform of
privileged pensions (end-March benchmark), the Federation authorities have agreed to
refrain from the introduction of new privileged pensions (continuous benchmark) and to
consider this reform in the context of the overall pension system reform. In addition, a new
round of audits of civilian disability benefits will commence in 2011. In the RS, eligibility
audits of war disability and pension benefits will be expedited, and a medical re-examination
of all recipients of disability pensions granted in the last three years will begin immediately.
The BiH authorities will also conduct an analysis of expenditures across all governments
with the objective of identifying possible savings that would help reduce the total
expenditure envelope (currently at 50 percent of GDP); the results of the analysis will be
incorporated into the 2012–14 global fiscal framework.
19.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to protect vulnerable groups and
safeguard public investment. As part of the social sector reforms supported by the World
Bank, social benefits and social assistance programs are being reformed to improve their
efficiency through better targeting of the poor and most vulnerable. Also, the financial
integrity of the pensions and employment funds will be preserved. The program envisaged
increases in capital spending, but capacity constraints have led to underexecution of big
infrastructure projects. Going forward, efforts will be made to improve implementation
capacity.
D. Strengthening the Financial Sector
20.
Although the banking system managed well the initial spillover from the global
crisis, vigilance is needed for new signs of stress. Staff commended the authorities for their
swift and effective response to the crisis, noting the full recovery of household deposits to
their pre-crisis level in 2010 (Box 2). The return to normalcy has allowed parent banks to
withdraw their emergency liquidity support. However, there was agreement that credit risk
remains a concern as NPLs are yet to peak. Higher provisions against NPLs and the slump in
lending activity have stretched banks’ capital. Supervisors have asked banks to retain profits
to increase their capital buffers, but with 2009 profits being significantly lower, banks will
have to look to their owners for any additional capital. The absence of local subsidiaries of
Greek banks has shielded the domestic market from market anxiety about Greece’s

12
creditworthiness. The authorities also noted that Hypo Alpe Adria Group’s (HGAA)
restructuring, which has two systemically important subsidiaries in BiH, is not likely to affect
the local market because HGAA considers the BiH market as a core business.
21.
Staff encouraged the authorities to follow up with banks participating in the
European Bank Coordination Initiative. Stress tests results based on end-2009 data
indicate that in the stress scenario, five banks face some shortfall in capital, including two
systemically important banks. The authorities have

declined only marginally through end-March 2010
compared with end-2008, individual parent bank exposure varies considerably from bank to
bank, particularly vis-à-vis their subsidiaries. Given that the banks are liquid, demand for
credit is still weak, and the overall balance of payments is stable, the decline in some
individual bank exposures is not of immediate concern. Staff urged the authorities to
continue to monitor developments in exposures and follow up with the banks as necessary.
Furthermore, it was agreed that the stress tests would be updated using end June 2010 data
and, following a second round of discussions with the banks, a meeting with the participating
parent banks to review and renew their commitments would be convened later this year
(LOI¶20).
22.
Progress is being made in strengthening the monitoring of financial stability, the
crisis management framework, and banking supervision. Staff welcomed the increased
cooperation and data sharing among the members of the Standing Committee on Financial
Stability. The Banking Agencies are receiving technical assistance from USAID as part of a
multi-stage program to gradually adopt risk-based supervision and move to Basel II, which
will help harmonize supervisory practices and regulations in the two entities. Ongoing Fund
technical assistance has helped the CBBH and the Banking Agencies increase their capacity
to conduct bank stress tests. Domestic bank supervisors regularly participate in supervisory
colleges of foreign banks. In particular, there is close cooperation and regular exchange of
information with the Austrian supervisors. At the same time, staff noted that despite progress,
formal memoranda of understanding (MoUs) have not yet been signed with the Austrian and
Italian supervisors. The authorities indicated that they aim to finalize shortly these bilateral
MoUs (LOI¶19). Staff reiterated its earlier recommendation to unify the two Banking
Agencies, but the authorities indicated that this would need a political resolution.
23.
The authorities have started to address the recommendations in the 2009
MONEYVAL anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) mutual evaluation report. The CBBH is coordinating work on amending the
banking law and the law governing foreign currency operations was amended to bring it in
line with the 2009 AML/CFT law. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), housed in the State
Protection and Investigation Agency (SIPA), increased its staff from 18 at the time of the

13
evaluation to 25 employees and targets a total of 30 staff. The authorities are preparing
amendments to the SIPA law and the AML/CFT law that would enable them to establish a
more independent FIU. Nevertheless, many areas, such as Customer Due Diligence,
insurance sector supervision, the filing of Suspicious Transaction Reports and national
coordination, still need to be addressed and staff encouraged the authorities to continue their
efforts in strengthening the AML/CFT regime.
Box 2. BiH: Policy Response to the Global Financial Crisis
Bank reserve requirements were relaxed from 18 to 14 percent in October 2008 with a further
reduction of the reserve requirement on long-term liabilities to 10 percent and 7 percent in
2009.
A Standing Committee for Financial Stability (SC) was formed comprising representatives of
the Fiscal Council, the CBBH, the two banking agencies, and the Deposit Insurance Agency
(DIA). Participants signed a Memorandum of Understanding that formalizes the cooperative
arrangement for crisis management and crisis preparedness. The SC is expected to meet at least
once every quarter to monitor vulnerabilities in the financial sector and to exchange views and
information.
The deposit insurance coverage was increased in December, 2008 from KM 7,500 to KM
20,000 (€10,000). The authorities have signed an agreement with the EBRD to enable the DIA
to access emergency credit (up to €50 million) in case its funds are insufficient to cover a
payment event. This has enabled the DIA to increase insurance coverage to KM 35,000 in
April, 2010. In addition the authorities have amended the regulation to allow all banks,
regardless of ownership, membership in the deposit insurance scheme.
To support credit growth in a tightening credit environment the authorities relaxed temporarily
the prudential rules on restructuring. Under certain conditions enterprises and households could
apply and banks could restructure credit so that the borrower did not default.
Following meetings in Vienna in June 2009 and in Sarajevo in September 2009 nine parent
banks committed to maintaining their exposure to BiH and ensuring that their subsidiaries are
adequately capitalized under the European Bank Coordination Initiative (EBCI). The nine
parent banks have 13 subsidiaries in BiH, which account for 85 percent of banking sector
assets at end 2009. A status meeting was held in February 2010 and a follow up meeting is
planned for later this year.

E. Improving Data Quality
24.
While data are adequate for surveillance purposes, staff analysis is being
affected by certain shortcomings. The timeliness, quality, and comprehensiveness of fiscal
data need significant improvement. Budget execution data does not include transactions for
projects financed by external loans or directly by foreign donors. There are delays in
reporting by lower levels of government, particularly in the Federation. In addition, the BOP
data has insufficient detail, including on foreign grants, workers’ remittances, and changes in

14
foreign currency cash holdings. Discrepancies between the production and expenditure GDP
measures are large.
25.
The authorities have made concerted efforts to improve the quality of statistics
in recent years, leveraging on technical assistance provided by the Fund and the EU.
The authorities have established a coordinating group to provide data for monitoring of the
SBA. With the help of a peripatetic PFM advisor, the State, Federation and RS are working
to transition to GFS 2001 reporting standards and shorten reporting delays. Staff commended
the authorities’ progress, including their commitment to apply international accounting
standards for the public sector and other international standards of financial reporting
(LOI¶22). Staff emphasized the need for further improvement in the timeliness and coverage
of consolidated general government accounts, which should incorporate foreign-financed
investment projects and their funding and a complete accounting of financing operations. The
authorities concurred and noted their plans to implement these recommendations starting
with the 2012 budgets (LOI¶16). Finally, the mission urged the authorities to join GDDS.
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
26.
The attached Letter of Intent summarizes the progress in implementing the
economic program.


All quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2010 were met except the one on
non-accumulation of domestic arrears. The nonobservance of this PC is based on the
nonobservance of the sub-ceiling for arrears by the RS, as a small amount of arrears
(less than 0.1 percent of GDP) was accumulated during the first quarter of 2010,
mainly on account of liquidity difficulties in the Health Fund. All those arrears have
now been cleared and the authorities are asking for a waiver of nonobservance. In the
Federation, the collection of detailed information on arrears of lower levels of
government has proved very difficult within the reporting deadline, owing to capacity
constraints, the decentralized government structure, and the lack of enforcement
powers on the part of the central government. Based on final information for the
central government and preliminary information for lower government levels, the
zero-ceiling on accumulation of domestic arrears by the Federation has not been
exceeded. Staff discussed with the authorities steps to improve the data collection
process and put together a detailed template to be adopted by the Ministry of Finance
and transmitted to all lower levels of government for regular reporting. In addition,
the authorities will increase the staff in the Ministry of Finance unit responsible for
the collection of fiscal information from lower levels of government, in order to be
able to meet the reporting deadlines in future program reviews.



Progress on structural reforms has been uneven (LOI¶ 2). Fiscal reporting has
improved and quarterly consolidated general government data are now regularly
published on the government’s website. The Federation government approved with a

15
delay the pension reform strategy in June 2010, and parliament adopted the public
wage legislation in July 2010 (both end-March structural benchmarks). Eligibility
audits of war benefit recipients started only in July and are yet to produce any
tangible results (continuous benchmark from start of year). The end-March structural
benchmark on the reform of privileged pensions, which was missed by the
Federation, was also redesigned (¶18 above). In Republika Srpska, all end-March
2010 benchmarks—related to eligibility audits, the reform of privileged pensions, and
the pension reform—have been met.
27.
The Letter also sets out policy commitments for the remainder of 2010.
Quantitative performance criteria are proposed to be established for September and
December 2010, including a ceiling on new guarantees and the assumption of enterprise debt
to banks by government (to accommodate a Federation government guarantee to the Railway
company, which is restructuring with financing from the EBRD). New structural
conditionality will continue to focus on the fiscal area, and it is deemed necessary to address
long-standing structural problems, ensure a return of public finances to a sustainable
medium-term path, and improve fiscal reporting.
28.
Rephasing of purchases is requested. The second review under the SBA (based on
the observance of end-March 2010 performance criteria) was delayed to give the authorities
more time to come up with corrective measures to address emerging fiscal pressures. Since
the conditions prescribed by the SBA for the authorities to request the purchase of the
tranche that becomes available on September 10, 2010 (based on the observance of end-June
2010 performance criteria and satisfactory progress under the program) have been met, the
authorities would be eligible to purchase two tranches for a combined disbursement of
SDR169.1 million (100 percent of quota), under the program’s original phasing. However, in
light of the stronger-than programmed reserve position, the authorities request rephasing of
purchases making available a disbursement of SDR118.4 million (70 percent of quota). Of
this available amount, the authorities intend to purchase SDR33.82 million (20 percent of
quota) in support of the Entity budgets. Going forward, it is envisaged to stick to the
program’s exit strategy from temporary budget financing using Fund resources.
29.
BiH’s capacity to repay the Fund remains good. By the end of the SBA, the level
of Fund credit outstanding is projected to reach 8.5 percent of GDP (29.2 percent of gross
international reserves), and Fund repurchases and charges would peak at 63 percent of total
debt service in 2014 (Table 10). The country’s excellent record of meeting Fund financial
obligations, the expectation that the program would lay the foundations for the return to a
sustainable medium-term growth path, and a strong political commitment to the program
provide assurances that BiH should be able to discharge its Fund obligations in a timely
manner. Additional comfort stems from the fact that the public debt will remain below
43 percent of GDP even at its peak in 2011, reflecting the government’s commitment to
sound fiscal policy (Appendix II).

16
V. LOOKING BEYOND THE CRISIS
30.
Discussions focused on policies that could bring about sustainable growth. Staff
argued that a shift is needed to a growth model based on productivity increases supported by
strong macroeconomic policies. The authorities broadly shared this view and a rich exchange
of views with the authorities also came in a seminar organized jointly between the IMF and
the central bank in May 2010.
A. Advancing Growth-Enhancing Structural Reforms3
31.
Post-crisis, the growth of the BiH economy
will likely become more dependent on gains in human
capital and technological change. Staff analyzed the
BiH economy’s production process to quantify the
contributions of physical and human capital and
technological change to real GDP growth. Results show
that the pre-crisis growth of output was mostly driven by
rapid accumulation of factors of production. Post-crisis,
the projected return to normalcy of credit growth—
reflecting the switch of banks’ funding from foreign
borrowing to domestic deposits—suggests that, unless
private and public savings increase significantly relative
to the baseline projection, the pace of capital
accumulation and its contribution to real GDP growth
will be lower. Future growth will hence need to rely to a
greater extent on gains in human capital and total factor
productivity.

There was agreement, however, that existing
BiH
Balkans
Euro Area
labor market rigidities and red tape handicap BiH’s
economic potential. Among the main constraints holding back the development of the labor
market are the low labor force participation rate; the sizable skill gaps; the market distortions
created by the large informal sector; and the ineffectiveness of the labor mediation public
services—which collectively keep the unemployment rate high. Corporate sector
performance is hampered by limited progress in creating a single economic space within the
country; excessive red tape; the stalled privatization of strategic enterprises in the Federation
and of medium-size public companies in both entities; poor corporate governance and
unfinished rationalization of staffing in many state-owned and voucher-privatized
enterprises; and inadequate infrastructure.

3

See Selected Issues Paper “Post-crisis Growth Prospects and Supporting Policies”.

17
33.
Enhancing BiH’s human capital and speeding-up the pace of technological
change, hence, requires a renewed emphasis on structural reforms:


Among labor market reform priorities, staff highlighted the need for: better
alignment of the systems of collective bargaining and wage determination with the
principles of market economy; public sector hiring and benefits restraint; refocusing
the work of Employment Funds to active job placement policies; and conditioning of
all non-insurance cash benefits on recipients’ income and ability to work and rigorous
carrying-out of eligibility audits to weed out fraud. The authorities concurred with the
brunt of the analysis and reiterated their commitment to reforming the system of
social benefits with help from the World Bank. They noted the recent adoption by the
Federation and RS governments of employment strategies that define the broad
objectives of public policies in the labor market. The authorities also highlighted
ongoing initiatives to improve the employment protection legislation in both the
Federation and the RS.



To speed-up the pace of technological change, staff reiterated the importance of
increasing the efficiency of the regulatory system to allow quicker business startups,
fewer authorizations for business operations, and a reduction in the number of
different tax payments. Corporate sector performance can be boosted by speeding up
the privatization of large strategic enterprises in the Federation and medium-size
public companies in both entities, and restructuring of underperforming
voucher-privatized companies. The authorities noted that the 2010 World Bank’s
Doing Business report showed progress in reducing the cost of starting a business and
the time needed to register property. They also pointed to the liberalization of the
trade regime with the EU, since the entry into force of the Stabilization and
Association Agreement in July 2008. The European Commission’s formal
recommendation in May 2010 to lift the visa-regime for BiH citizens opens the
prospect for further integration of the local economy in the larger European
marketplace.
B. Achieving Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation

34.
Credible medium-term fiscal consolidation will require ambitious structural
fiscal reforms. The initial low level of public sector indebtedness should allow financing of
the projected modest medium-term deficits without jeopardizing the sustainability of public
finances. Staff emphasized the need to reduce the tax burden (by focusing mainly on a
reduction in social contributions) and the total expenditure envelope, while re-orienting
expenditures towards capital spending; this will help boost growth through better
infrastructure and less waste of public resources. Key elements of the medium-term fiscal
strategy should include:

18


Rights-based benefits reform. Much of the spending pressure affecting the fiscal
accounts over the past few years stems from poorly targeted and inefficient
rights-based benefits. There was agreement on the need to press ahead with the
implementation of the reform of the system of rights-based benefits according to the
action plan prepared in consultation with the World Bank.



Pension reform (Box 3)4. Faced with increasing demographic pressures, the
authorities have initiated reforms of the pension systems. The Federation approved a
pension reform strategy, which still needs to be fleshed out in greater detail and to
incorporate an overhaul of privileged pensions. In the RS, with the pension reform
strategy already approved by parliament, the authorities need to follow through with
the preparation and adoption of pertinent legislation.



Reforms to rein in the wage bill (Box 4). BiH’s government payroll has grown
substantially in recent years and is very high compared with other countries.
Although the public wage reforms in the State and the RS during 2006–08, and the
recent approval of the Federation Wage Law are welcome, there is still a need for
comprehensive reform of public administration. Staff urged the authorities to look
into this reform in the context of the comprehensive analysis of government
expenditure to be launched in the coming months and to come up with concrete
measures with the objective of reining in the wage bill.



Fiscal coordination. Since its establishment in 2008, the role of the Fiscal Council in
coordinating fiscal policy across the country has been limited. It is important that the
authorities take steps to improve the Council’s operational framework and involve it
in the design of medium-term fiscal policy and fiscal targets.

4

See Selected Issues Paper “The Case for Pension Systems Reform.”

19
Box 3. BiH: Pension System—Case for Reform
The two entity pension funds, administered on a pay-as-you-go principle, have been under increasing
financial pressure—mainly from demographic trends, but also from deterioration of the general fiscal
situation and the design of the pension systems themselves. Expenditure on public pensions has been one
of the fastest-growing components of public expenditure in the two entities. In the Federation, this
spending rose from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 10.0 percent in 2009; and in the RS, from 7.8 percent
of GDP to 9.0 percent over the same period.
One symptom of the weakness of the system are the high and rising system dependency ratios—too few
paying contributors relative to the number of pensioners. In the last two years, these ratios rose by
10 percent in the Federation and 8 percent in the RS. Staff estimates that another increase of 10 percent
would require additional budget funds equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP in the Federation; and
2.6 percent of GDP in the RS.
In the Federation, the system of privileged pensions (with early retirement benefits for selected groups of
beneficiaries) poses risks to the contributory pension system. The quadrupling in the number of
beneficiaries in the last three years and the corresponding increase in budget co-financing requirements
have strained the Entity budget and resulted in a run-up of arrears in payment obligations of the budget
toward the pension fund in the amount of KM 180 million at end-2009.
Putting the public pension systems on a sound footing should encompass a number of complementary
steps: tackling disincentives to formal sector employment and taking measures to raise contribution
payment compliance; introducing further parametric changes, including an increase in the retirement age
and in the length of required contributory service; and, reforming the system of privileged pensions.

20
Box 4. BiH: Government Employee Compensation
Over 2004–09, annual real growth of
government employee compensation (the
wage bill) averaged 6.3 percent. In 2007
alone, the real wage bill increased by 15
percent. By 2008, the share of the wage bill
in total spending was almost a quarter,
while more than a quarter of domestic
revenues were spent on this category of
outlays. The average general government
wage bill in percent of GDP was higher
than the average for Europe and other
regions during 2000–08, and substantially
higher than the average of middle-income
countries.

General government, consolidated central government, or budgetary central government, annual averages for
2000-08 depending on availability.

The government wage bill has increased both because of hiring and because of wage increases. Partly
due to competition among various parts of administration and to indexation practices that have linked
wage increases to economy wide wages of two years before, wages increased substantially. These
practices have created an inflationary spiral contributing to a large differential with private sector
salaries of 50 percent in 2010. Indexation was suspended in 2009 when further adjustment became
unsustainable.

Employment is high partly due to the constitutional set up of the country. However, employment in the
education sector which usually constitutes a large share of total employment is below comparators,
suggesting that the core of “excess” employment is at the level of administration in the State and
Entities.

VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s stabilization program has helped mitigate the impact
of the global financial crisis on the economy. The crisis found BiH in a vulnerable position:
external imbalances were rising, loose fiscal and incomes policies exacerbated the
overheating of the economy, and the banking sector came under strain. The authorities’
policy package—gradual fiscal consolidation, steps to strengthen the resilience of the
financial sector, and structural fiscal reform—along with substantial Fund financial support

21
and commitments by foreign banks to support their subsidiaries, has limited the output loss
and alleviated financing constraints. Performance under the program has been encouraging:
fiscal restraint is addressing large imbalances of recent years and structural fiscal reforms
have advanced, albeit at a slower pace than initially envisaged.
36.
Attaining the program’s 2010 fiscal target should be the first step toward
restoring fiscal sustainability. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to expenditure
restraint and the measures to ensure that the 2010 general government deficit objective will
be met. This objective strikes an appropriate balance between fiscal policy’s response to the
cycle and medium-term consolidation, and is also supported by measures that would secure a
permanent reduction in recurrent government spending. Staff welcomes that public
investment is protected and the social safety net is being reformed to protect vulnerable
groups.
37.
With the economy now emerging out of the recession, policy continuity is
important in the period leading up to and immediately after the October elections.
Although the short-term economic and financial outlook has stabilized, continued efforts are
needed to ensure fiscal and external sustainability. The current juncture presents a unique
opportunity for the new governments that will come in power following the October
elections to advance fiscal consolidation and tackle structural problem. However, successful
implementation of bold structural reforms will require broad political support and societal
consensus.
38.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by reforms in current
spending, while making room for capital expenditure. Staff endorses the envisaged fiscal
deficit of 3 percent of GDP for 2011, which is consistent with the country’s medium-term
consolidation objectives. With expenditure exceeding 50 percent of GDP, the focus of
policies should be on reducing current expenditure by persevering with the systemic reforms
of rights-based benefits and untargeted transfers, reining in the wage bill, and reforming
pensions systems.
39.
The authorities’ response in the financial sector to the global crisis has been
appropriate. The banking system withstood the initial impact of the crisis but is now facing
some stress with rising NPLs and declining profitability. The authorities need to remain
vigilant and monitor closely developments in credit quality and spillover risks from regional
developments. Staff welcomes steps to enhance the monitoring of financial stability, and
improve crisis preparedness and management, and urges the authorities to further increase
cooperation between the central bank and banking agencies. The commitments by foreign
parent banks to maintain their exposure vis-à-vis BiH and keep their subsidiaries well
capitalized should help contain external financing gaps and support market confidence. The
authorities should continue to further strengthen their cooperation with home supervisors,
including by completing the MoUs with remaining home supervisors.

22
40.
BiH has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, but
maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on
foreign-currency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Staff does not
recommend approval of these restrictions.
41.
On the basis of BiH’s performance under the SBA and the corrective actions
taken to address the causes of the non-observance of the performance criterion on
non-accumulation of domestic arrears, staff supports the request for a waiver for
nonobservance of the performance criterion and completion of the second and third
reviews, establishing performance criteria, and rephasing of purchases as specified in
the LOI¶23 and Table 13.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month
cycle, subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX I. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
43.
BiH’s external debt continues to remain manageable, notwithstanding the
increasing external financing needs of government and limited borrowing opportunities
of the private sector due to global crisis. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase
from pre-crisis 48 percent to about 60 percent in 2011–12. The main contributor of the
increase is the public sector, including the loans from IFIs and other multilateral and bilateral
creditors aimed at supporting financing of the fiscal gap and implementation of essential
investment projects. The crisis has prevented the increase of private sector borrowing
opportunities: while non-bank sector borrowing increased at a modest pace, the banking
sector borrowing abroad has declined substantially.
44.
In the baseline scenario, the dynamics of external debt indicators remain
manageable and consistent with the macroeconomic framework under the SBA. The
baseline scenario assumes gradual improvement of public sector debt indicators driven by
fiscal adjustment, expected inflows from privatization of public companies (in FBiH).
Nevertheless government borrowing will remain at higher level compared to pre-crisis
indicators, driven by the investment needs of government. The borrowing of the private
sector (including bank and non-bank) will stabilize at around 30.5 percent of GDP during
2011–2015.
45.
Bound tests reveal that BiH’s external debt remains vulnerable to a number of
shocks. The tests suggest that BiH’s external position is particularly vulnerable to a real
depreciation shock, a noninterest current account shock, and a slowdown in GDP growth. An
interest rate shock seems to have a relatively moderate impact. For instance, a depreciation of
the exchange rate by 30 percent would push external debt to above 85 percent of GDP,
though debt would eventually return to a declining path in subsequent years reaching about
68 percent in 2015. A negative shock on the current account balance would also lead to an
unsustainable debt path, with the external debt ratio reaching 59 percent of GDP through
2015.5
46.
Managing debt sustainability and reducing the risks of rapid debt accumulation
will depend on maintaining macroeconomic policies conducive to sustainable growth,
continuous fiscal consolidation and maintenance of external stability consistent with the
currency board arrangement. The dynamics of external debt will be influenced
substantially by the pace of economic recovery throughout the next few years, the quality of
current account adjustment and reforms conducive to increase in FDI, including the
promotion of healthy business and investment environment.

5

The CAB shock assumes that noninterest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations.

APPENDIX II. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
47.
The financial pressures on government finances resulting from the global crisis
have increased substantially Bosnia and Herzegovina’s public borrowing needs. Public
debt is expected to increase to 39 percent of GDP by end-2010 driven by external borrowing
from IFIs and bilateral government financing for financing both current and capital
expenditures. The external borrowing of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009 was split almost equally
between budget support and investment projects. In the medium-term, debt service is
projected to increase from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 4.4 percent by 2015.
48.
Under the baseline scenario, BiH public debt appears sustainable. The program’s
medium-term scenario envisages fiscal consolidation; and BiH’s debt level is projected to
decline in nominal terms to 27 percent of GDP, close to its 2005 level. In line with declining
primary deficits, gross financing needs are expected to decline as well, despite larger
resources dedicated to debt servicing.
49.
BiH’s public debt is susceptible to shocks. Standardized shocks indicate that lower
growth, exchange rate depreciation and higher primary deficits would substantially worsen
debt sustainability, with debt-to GDP ratios increasing between 5 and 11 percentage points
by 2015. In addition, a contingent liability shock is calibrated to reflect a potential cost to
government of bank restructuring amounting to 10 percent of GDP in 2011. The probability
of occurrence of such a shock is very low, as nine foreign banks, which subsidiaries account
for 85 percent of BiH’s banking sector assets, have committed to maintaining their exposure
to BiH and ensuring that their subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the European
Bank Coordination Initiative. In this scenario public debt to GDP increase by over 8 percent
of GDP by 2015.
50.
An alternative country-specific scenario points to sharply-increasing debt levels
in the case of a complete lack of adjustment. In this hypothetical no-adjustment scenario,
overall balances are kept over the medium term at the level projected for 2010 (4.5 percent of
GDP). The gross financing need in 2015 would increase from the currently projected
4 percent to 10 percent of GDP by 2015 with a corresponding worsening of the public debt
burden.
51.
Debt sustainability depends heavily on a sustained growth recovery, in 2011 and
beyond, as well as on sound macroeconomic management, including continuous fiscal
consolidation. Dynamics also crucially depends on current account adjustment and increase
in FDI (including privatization in the Federation).

ATTACHMENT I. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: LETTER OF INTENT
Sarajevo and Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina
September 17, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Despite the challenging external environment, the strengthening of our policies and
the substantial financial support provided by the IMF since the approval of the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) in July 2009 have helped stabilize the economy of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH) and set the stage for sustainable growth over the medium term.
Macro-financial vulnerabilities have been reduced, as public confidence in banks has
returned following the 2008 mini-deposit run, the decline in the foreign exchange reserves of
the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) has been contained, and foreign banks
have maintained their overall exposure to our country.
2.
Implementation of the IMF-supported program has been in line with our
commitments (Tables 1 and 2):


Quantitative performance criteria. All end-March targets and end-June 2010
quantitative criteria were observed, except the one on the accumulation of domestic
arrears.



Structural benchmarks. We have met the structural benchmark for the publication on
the State government’s website of quarterly consolidated general government data for
end-March and end-June 2010. In the Federation, the implementation of end-March
2010 structural benchmarks fell behind schedule, but the authorities have now
advanced the program’s reform agenda. Specifically, parliament adopted public wage
legislation in July, the government approved a pension reform strategy in June, and
eligibility audits for war benefit recipients began in early-July. The reform of
privileged pensions and the latest round of eligibility audits of civilian disability
benefit recipients will now take place in 2011. In Republika Srpska (RS), all
end-March 2010 benchmarks—related to eligibility audits, the reform of privileged
pensions, and the pension reform—have been met; and the end-June 2010 benchmark
related to publication of results from eligibility audits was met with a few days’
delay.

48
3.
Overall budget implementation by the Institutions of BiH (State), Federation, and the
RS has been in line with the program. At the same time, in the Federation, there are worrying
signs that the reforms of rights-based cash transfer programs are not delivering the expected
savings. In the RS, the finances of the pension and health insurance systems continue to be
under pressure. In response, Entity governments have identified additional revenue sources
and measures to contain expenditures, elaborated in this Letter.
4.
In view of this performance and our continued commitment to the program, we
request completion of the second and third reviews under the Stand-By Arrangement. On the
basis of the corrective measures being taken, we request a waiver of non-observance of the
performance criterion on non-accumulation of domestic arrears. In the RS, the zero
sub-ceiling on accumulation of domestic arrears was exceeded during the first quarter of
2010, mainly on account of liquidity difficulties in the Health Fund, but since then
outstanding arrears have been eliminated. In 2011, we will address this issue in the context of
the planned reform of the health insurance system. In the Federation, the collection of
detailed information on arrears of lower levels of government has proved very difficult
within the reporting deadline, owing to capacity constraints, the decentralized government
structure, and the lack of enforcement powers on the part of the central government.
Available final information shows a reduction in the existing stock of domestic arrears for the
central government and the cantons during January–June 2010, and preliminary information
indicates that the zero ceiling on arrears accumulation was not exceeded by municipalities
and cantonal extrabudgetary funds. To deal with these difficulties, we have prepared a
template which will be introduced for reporting of arrears of all levels and we will increase
the staff in the Ministry of Finance unit responsible for the collection of fiscal information
from lower levels of government, in order to be able to meet the reporting deadline in future
program reviews.
5.
The policies set forth in this Letter and our previous letters (of June 16, 2009 and
March 5, 2010) are adequate to achieve the objectives of our economic program, and we
stand ready to take additional measures as appropriate to ensure the attainment of these
objectives. We will consult with the IMF before modifying measures contained in this letter
or adopting new measures that would deviate from the goals of the program, and provide the
IMF with the necessary information for program monitoring.
A. Macroeconomic Framework
6.
Our macroeconomic framework has retained cautious assumptions. We continue to
believe in a gradual return to positive growth, with real GDP gaining about 0.5 percent in
2010 and 3 percent in 2011, aided by the recovery in the euro area. Inflation is expected to
pick up to 2½ percent this year. Weak domestic demand in 2010 will keep the current
account deficit considerably below pre-crisis levels. We expect the external financing
situation to remain favorable. Foreign parent banks are expected to broadly maintain their
total exposure to BiH, taking into account residents’ direct borrowing from parent banks.

49
Other private flows, along with financing from the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, should
be sufficient to meet all external financing needs in 2010.
B. Fiscal Policy
7.
In support of our commitment to the currency board, continued fiscal consolidation
and structural fiscal reforms will remain the cornerstones of our policymaking. When the
crisis hit, our fiscal position was threatened. The disbursements under the Stand-By
Arrangement and the SDR allocations allowed us to maintain continuity of public services
and gave us time to elaborate ambitious fiscal reforms aimed at putting public finances on a
sustainable path. Our adjustment efforts focus on controlling current expenditure, while
protecting transfers to vulnerable population groups and spending on much-needed
infrastructure. In particular, public sector wages, which have grown very rapidly over the
past few years, are being kept in check, while the system of social transfers is being reformed
to improve its efficiency through better targeting.
8.
The program’s overall consolidated fiscal deficit objective of 4½ percent of GDP for
2010 remains appropriate. Although performance during the first half of the year is in line
with the program, continued efforts will be needed to stay within the program targets.
9.
The State has exercised prudence since the beginning of the program. In 2009, we
accomplished an overall reduction in expenditures of KM 100 million compared to budget,
and recorded a KM 12 million surplus. We implemented restrictive measures this year, and
are targeting a deficit of KM 173 million, which will be financed from surpluses from earlier
years, succession receipts, and funds from the budgetary support loan by the EU.
10.
The Federation resisted expenditure pressures. Benefiting from better-than-budgeted
revenue, it recorded a consolidated deficit of KM 97 million compared with the program’s
objective of KM 293 million in the first half of the year. However, due to delays in the
implementation of the reforms of benefits, without additional efforts, expenditure pressures
will continue to threaten the sustainability of our finances. We are thus determined to deal
with these pressures with strong and concrete measures, which have been incorporated in a
rebalanced 2010 budget (adoption by Parliament is a prior action and was met on
September 14). Specifically:


Wages. The Federation parliament adopted the Law on Wages in July (end-March
structural benchmark) aimed at harmonizing and making more transparent the
remuneration policies across levels of government. This Law along with a hiring
restraint in the remainder of the year will ensure that the Federation central
government’s wage bill will not exceed the 2010 budgetary allocation; in fact, we
expect to generate at least KM 3 million savings.

50


War-related cash benefits. After some delay, we have started eligibility audits of
beneficiaries (continuous structural benchmark). During July–August 2010, we
audited 2,185 beneficiaries and referred 469 cases for further verification of
documentation in military records. We will immediately suspend payments in cases
of confirmed lack of adequate documentation. Owing to the delay in initiating the
audit process and its complexity, we expect that savings will begin to materialize only
toward the end of this year, but under current procedures the generated savings will
be insufficient to allow us to stay within the budgeted allocation for war disability
benefits. We will improve the audit process by giving priority to certain groups of
beneficiaries (e.g., those who became eligible by proving their status and membership
in the armed forces through administrative procedures, beneficiaries who exercised
their rights without providing payroll certificates from the armed forces, the most
recent beneficiaries, and those entitled on the basis of mental illness). We will also
amend the Rulebook on the establishment and work of audit teams to allow the
possibility for establishing up to 20 audit teams (instead of the current 15). The
government will issue a decision to incorporate the aforementioned changes in the
audit process by September 10, 2010 (prior action) and the Federation Ministry of
Veterans’ Affairs will issue the amended Rulebooks by end-September 2010. In
addition, in October 2010 the FBiH government will evaluate the budget
implementation and, if necessary, will apply an appropriate rationing coefficient in
the last quarter of 2010 for all budget users. Finally, we will publish on a government
website detailed results from the eligibility audits performed through August and will
continue to publish these results quarterly.


Medal holders’ benefits. We have introduced income tests for war medal
holders effective May 1, 2010. Payments of benefits were suspended pending
the outcome of eligibility audits and means-testing. We have removed from
the beneficiary list 196 individuals who have failed to re-apply for benefits as
of May 1, 2010, and following the income tests we will also remove from the
beneficiary list by end-2010 the 20 percent of beneficiaries with the highest
income. All these measures will result in savings of at least KM 1 million
relative to the 2010 budget allocation.



Demobilized soldiers’ benefits. The repeal of the Law on Demobilized
Soldiers effective May 1, 2010 has resulted in cessation of all cash transfers to
demobilized soldiers. Realized savings of KM 4.1 million relative to the
budget allocation on this expenditure item have been used to settle arrears on
unemployment benefits of demobilized soldiers accumulated in 2009. In the
future, the social needs of demobilized soldiers will be addressed through
existing programs of the social safety net.



Privileged pensions. We will overhaul the system of privileged pensions in the
context of the implementation of the pension system reform in 2011. In the

51
meantime, no new privileged or special rights for retirement will be
introduced (continuous structural benchmark). We will tighten eligibility
criteria and expedite audits of beneficiaries, and publish results quarterly. No
one will be eligible to retire and use privileged or special provisions for
retirement without the completion of an audit. Benefits will cease immediately
in cases of fraud. To control the overall fiscal cost and improve equity of the
public pension system, we will aim at aligning the average level of privileged
pensions to that of pensions earned through full contributions.


Regularization of outstanding obligations. We will resolve problems arising from
weaknesses in budgeting, fiscal reporting and cash management, which have given
rise to ad hoc treatment of outstanding obligations to final beneficiaries and those
arising between various levels of government. We have already established and will
publish an inventory of all outstanding obligations by level of government as of
end-June 2010 toward beneficiaries under main transfer programs. As a next step, we
will regularize and clear all outstanding obligations by planning funds for these
purposes in the budgets of the FBiH starting from 2011, including by submitting to
parliament a draft law for settlement of outstanding obligations to non-war invalids
with the view of full payment in the course of the next two years, and by exploring
different options for settlement of the FBiH Central Government debt to the Pension
Fund, debt to demobilized soldiers, and other beneficiaries under main transfer
programs.



Cantons. Reflecting large expected transfers from the Federation government and
unrealistic revenue projections, some cantons have approved expansionary budgets,
and increased current spending compared with 2009. We will urge cantons to
rebalance their budgets in line with the objectives of the Law on Savings. To this end,
the Federation government will issue a decision to condition the transfers for deficit
financing of cantons on cantonal budget rebalances to reduce current expenditures
(prior action—met on September 8).

11.
The RS exercised prudence in the first half of the year, recording a consolidated
general government deficit of KM 199 million compared with the program’s objective of
KM 303 million. The government is committed to making strong efforts to limit the 2010
consolidated general government deficit to KM 503 million in line with the program. With
better-than-projected revenue performance, our efforts will concentrate on keeping
expenditure in check.
12.
Ahead of the implementation of our comprehensive pension reform strategy, the RS
government has begun addressing the liquidity challenges of the Pension Fund in the current
year through increased transfers and borrowing from commercial banks. Parametric reforms
have been initiated and the third pillar has been introduced during the past several years. The
transition to the second pillar has been ruled out as too costly and difficult in the near term.

52
Future envisaged steps include: further increase in the effective retirement age of men and
women; transition to the system of points similar to the German model; and indexation in
line with the Swiss model (50 percent to CPI and 50 percent to wage growth). To this end,
the RS government will, by end-2010, adopt the draft Law on Pension and Disability
Insurance and forward it for adoption to the RS National Assembly in accordance with the
adopted Strategy of the Pension System Reform (structural benchmark). Eligibility audits of
veterans’ and social benefits will continue.
13.
The RS Government will initiate a reform of the health insurance system in
accordance with the Strategy of Primary Health Care and the Strategy of Secondary and
Tertiary Health Care in the RS. The reform will entail cost rationalization, introduction of a
new payments model to health care institutions, and upgrades in information technology.
14.
We have taken steps to strengthen the revenue side. We have amended the Law on
Income Tax to: (i) make the costs of hot meals prepared by the employer and those delivered
to the employer by a company registered for catering services tax free in the maximum
amount of KM 3.5 a day per employee, or the maximum amount of KM 77 monthly per
employee; (ii) reduce the amount of tax-exempt personal income from KM 3,600 to KM
3,000 annually; (iii) tax capital gains from the sale of property that was used for personal use;
and (iv) tax pensions paid out from voluntary pension insurance plans up to KM 1,200. In tax
administration, efforts to improve collection of revenues will focus on amending legislation
and regulation with the view to improve control and broaden the coverage of taxpayers.
15.
By end-2010, we will pass a new rulebook on financial reporting for budget users of
the republic, municipalities, cities and funds; and, by end-September 2010 we will publish a
new rulebook on the chart of accounts for budget users of the republic, municipalities, cities
and funds, with application starting on January 1, 2011.
16.
All governments are committed to maintaining fiscal discipline over the medium
term. We therefore intend to reduce the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP in
2011. Fiscal efforts will continue to focus on the expenditure side, which will benefit from
the impact of the reforms undertaken this year.


The Fiscal Council (FC) will adopt the Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and
Policies in BiH consistent with the SBA to ensure that the 2011 State budget
expenditures will remain at the 2010 level. This Framework will provide the basis for
the preparation of the budgets of the State and the Entities for 2011.



To improve the transparency of government operations, the 2012 budgets of the State,
Federation, and RS will include foreign-financed investment projects financed from
external loan drawings and grants, excluding technical assistance, that pass through
the Treasury, as well as complete accounting of financing operations.

53


Medium-term fiscal planning in the Federation will have to address substantial needs
for capital investments in infrastructure. The consolidation of the wage bill, transfers
and other current expenditures will continue. Restructuring and privatization of
state-owned enterprises will be one of the important sources of financing.



In the RS, the main challenges ahead will be containing pressure on social benefits
arising from unfavourable demographic trends, transitioning to lower financing
available for capital projects, and building up savings to service foreign debt
obligations. This will imply strict control over the wage bill and other current
spending. The RS government will adopt a Development Strategy (by end-May 2011)
aimed at correcting the unfavourable economic structure inherited from the past and
underutilization of the economy’s comparative advantages and natural resources. The
objective of the Strategy is to ensure competitiveness of the economy, increased
employment, increased standard of living and improved social security of citizens.

17.
We recognize the important role of the Fiscal Council in coordinating fiscal policy
across BiH. We will establish common methodology according to which the State and the
Entities will undertake a comprehensive analysis of expenditures. The results of the analysis
will be presented to the FC in the context of the preparation of the 2012–14 Global
Framework. We will continue to strengthen the Council’s operational framework, including
by improving fiscal methodology and multi-annual planning for the Global Framework,
drafting proposals for short-term and long-term macroeconomic projections, and
implementing established goals and criteria when adopting and executing the budget.
18.
The unfavorable economic situation may have an impact on the vulnerable groups of
our population. Thus, the envisaged reforms by the Entities are critical to ensuring that
financial public support for households is better targeted toward the most vulnerable groups
of the society, and that financial integrity of public pension and unemployment insurance
schemes does not become jeopardized.
C. Financial Sector Policies
19.
The banking system withstood the immediate impact of the global financial crisis
well. However, nonperforming loans increased to 5.8 percent at end 2009 and continued to
rise in the first half of 2010 reaching 8.7 percent at end June; and profitability has declined
over the same period. The two Banking Agencies (BAs) are closely monitoring banking
sector developments and are taking steps to ensure that banks continue to have adequate
capital. To this end, banks were encouraged to retain profits, and use them to strengthen their
capital buffers. In addition, the Banking Agencies will ensure that banks have
forward-looking capital plans that will show how any potential deterioration in capital levels
will be addressed. The BAs and the banks will review and, if necessary, revise such plans
periodically, to account for changing macroeconomic environment. The BAs have
strengthened their cooperation with foreign home supervisors including through their

54
participation in colleges of supervisors, and they hope to soon finalize bilateral Memoranda
of Understanding with Austria’s and Italy’s banking supervisors.
20.
We will follow up with parent banks on their pledge to continue to support their
subsidiaries in BiH by keeping them adequately capitalized and maintaining their exposure to
our country. As per the Bank Coordination Initiative, the CBBH along with the BAs prepared
stress tests based on end-2009 data and discussed the results on a bilateral basis with each
participating bank. We plan to update the stress tests using end June 2010 data and review
with banks the need for additional capital based on the updated results. We will continue to
monitor the exposure of parent banks vis-à-vis BiH, both directly to their subsidiaries and to
the economy in general based on data provided to us on a regular basis by the parent banks.
On an aggregate level, the parent banks’ overall exposure at end-March 2010 was 1½ percent
lower compared with end-2008. Following the second round of bilateral discussions with
banks regarding the adequacy of their capital base and developments in the parent banks’
exposure, we plan to convene another meeting of the parent banks to review and renew their
commitments to BiH.
21.
We have strengthened our framework for crisis preparedness and management. To
this end we have established a Standing Committee for Financial Stability (SCFS), which
consists of members of the Fiscal Council, the CBBH, the two Banking Agencies, and the
Deposit Insurance Agency. A Memorandum of Understanding that establishes the formal
framework of cooperation among the various parties has already been signed. The first
meeting of the SCFS was held in May 2010, and we plan to meet at least once every quarter
to discuss and exchange information related to financial stability. Prior to the meeting the
CBBH and the Banking Agencies will prepare brief reports on the conditions in the financial
sector. The reports will provide the basis of our discussion which will focus on identifying
risks to the system and the appropriate response. Moreover the CBBH plans to increase the
resources available for its Financial Stability Unit to enhance its capacity to monitor and
analyze financial sector developments, and the BAs will continue to upgrade their
information systems so that banking sector data can be readily processed and analyzed.
D. Data Issues
22.
We have continued to make important progress in improving the quality of statistics.
This has allowed us to meet the structural benchmark on the publication of preliminary
consolidated general government fiscal data for the first and second quarters of 2010. At the
same time, we are mindful of the significant gaps in the quality of published data, due among
other things to the fact that budget execution data do not include transactions related to
foreign-financed projects, accrual accounting has not yet been fully introduced in all
government institutions; and the long delays in reporting by lower levels of government,
particularly in the Federation. To address these serious problems, we are working with the
help of TA from the regional TA advisor to transition to GFS 2001 reporting standards and
shorten reporting delays. To this end, the Fiscal Council will establish a working group that,

55
by December 31, 2010 will make recommendations, and propose guidelines and a timetable
for application of international accounting standards for the public sector and other
international standards of financial reporting, including a harmonized fiscal reporting
template, at all levels of government in BiH (structural benchmark).We will make progress
towards improving data collection and reconciliation of external grants and loan
disbursements at the level of donors, state, and Entities. At this stage we will improve
statistics of project-tied grants that are extended through central governments and take steps
to measure foreign in-kind grants.
E. Program Issues
23.
The program will continue to be monitored through quarterly reviews, prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria, and structural benchmarks. Revised quantitative targets for
2010 are set out in Table 1; and prior actions and structural benchmarks are set out in
Table 2. We request that the end-September, and end-December 2010 targets be established
as performance criteria. The understandings between the authorities of BiH and IMF staff
regarding the quantitative performance criteria discussed in this Letter are further specified in
the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding. In light of our
stronger-than-programmed reserve position, we also request rephasing of purchases
envisaged for the second year of the arrangement to a smoother disbursement schedule
(50 percent of quota at the completion of each quarterly program review). As a result, the
amount of purchases that can be made upon successful completion of this review will be
SDR 118.4 million (70 percent of quota). Of this amount, we plan to draw SDR 33.82 million
to support the Entity budgets; and, given our strong reserve position, we will not draw the
remaining amount at this stage and will consult with Fund staff should a need for further
purchases arises.
24.
IMF resources under the arrangement will be disbursed to the central bank, which
acts as the fiscal agent for BiH, and credited to an account of the State. Resources earmarked
for the budget will be allocated to the two Entity budgets on the customary 2/3:1/3 split.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Technical Memorandum of Understanding on Definitions and Reporting Under the
2009–12 Economic Program
September 17, 2010
This memorandum supplements the Letter of Intent dated September 17, 2010. The
memorandum updates and replaces the technical memorandum of understanding included in
the IMF Board document for the 1-st SBA Review (Country Report 10/101). It sets out the
understanding between the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the IMF mission
regarding the definitions of quantitative performance criteria and targets and structural
benchmarks for the stand-by arrangement (Tables 1–2) as well as data reporting requirements
for program monitoring (Table 4).
I. DEFINITIONS
In the following definitions, the end-quarter test dates apply to the last working day of each
quarter for both banking and budgetary statistics.
A. Ceiling on the Cumulative Change in Net Credit from the Banking System to the
General Government
Definitions


The general government is defined to include the governments of the State, the
Republika Srpska Entity (RS), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Entity
(Federation) and the District Brcko. The Federation government is defined to include the
central government, the cantonal governments, the municipal governments, the
extrabudgetary funds and the road fund. The RS government is defined to include the
central government, the municipal governments, the extrabudgetary funds and the road
fund. Extrabudgetary funds include, but are not limited to, the pension funds, health
funds, unemployment funds, and children's fund in the two Entities. Any new budgetary
and extra budgetary funds, created during the program period will also be included in the
definition of the general government consistent with the definitions of the IMF Manual
on Government Finance Statistics 2001. The BIH authorities will inform IMF staff of the
creation of any such new funds.



The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)
and the commercial banks in both Entities and the District of Brcko.

58



Net credit of the banking system to the general government (net bank claims on general
government) is defined as all banking system claims on general government (e.g., loans,
securities, bills, and other claims in both convertible marka and foreign currencies) minus
general government claims on the banking system (deposits, loans and other claims,
including deposits in entities’ escrow accounts) as defined in the Table 3 below.1 For
program purposes, those components of claims that are denominated in foreign currencies
will be converted into convertible marka at current exchange rates.

Application of performance criteria


The value of net bank claims on general government will be monitored from the accounts
of the banking system, as compiled by the CBBH, and supplemented by information
provided by the Ministries of Finance of each Entity and the State. Table 3 shows the
banking system net claims on the general government as of end-December 2009.



The ceilings on the cumulative change in net bank claims on general government will be
defined, for each test date, as the cumulative change from the level existing on
December 31 of the previous year.



The ceilings on the cumulative change in net bank claims on general government will be
defined in terms of three sub-ceilings that, together with the net bank claims on the
District of Brčko,2 sum to the ceiling for the general government. These sub-ceilings will
be on the cumulative change in net bank claims on the government of the State, the
governments of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Republika Srpska.
For the purposes of program monitoring, compliance with the ceiling on net bank claims
on general government will require that each of these three sub-ceilings be observed
independently.

1

Excluded from the definition of the general government claims on the central bank will be government
deposits at CBBH counterpart to any future SDR purchases under the Stand-By Arrangement used for increase
of the foreign reserves of the central bank.
2

The net bank credit to the District of Brčko is not monitored individually because of its small size.

59
Adjustors to performance criteria


The targets on net bank claims on general government will be adjusted upward
(downward)3 by the full amount of any shortfall (surplus) in programmed
disbursements of budget support loans and grants. Program budget support
disbursements are defined as external disbursements from official creditors (e.g.,
World Bank, IMF, and European Commission) used for financing of general
government budget deficits.



The targets on net bank claims on general
government will be adjusted upward
(downward)4 by the amount by which
reported change in float is arithmetically
smaller (greater) than its targets in the fiscal
program. Float is defined as accrued but
unpaid purchases of goods and services,
wages and salaries, pensions, social benefits,
and investments that are not in arrears (as
defined in the text below). The upward
adjustment is limited to 10 percent of the
absolute value of the respective
change-in-float target.

B. Operation of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Under the Central Banking Law and the program, the CBBH is required to ensure that the
value of its domestic liabilities does not exceed the convertible marka counter-value of its net
foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, the CBBH will pay a dividend only if its initial
capital and general reserves exceed 5 percent of its monetary liabilities.
Definitions
3

In the case of both positive and negative targets on net bank claims on general government, upward means
resetting of the target to an arithmetically bigger number, whereas downward means resetting of the target to an
arithmetically smaller number.
4

In the case of both positive and negative targets on net bank claims on general government, upward means
resetting of the target to an arithmetically bigger number, whereas downward means resetting of the target to an
arithmetically smaller number.

60



Net foreign exchange reserves of CBBH are defined as the value of foreign assets
less the value of foreign liabilities, including short-term liabilities denominated in
convertible currencies or convertible marka.



Foreign assets are defined to include: (i) any gold, other precious metal and stones
held by or for the account of the Central Bank; (ii) any banknotes and coins in freely
convertible foreign currency held by or for the account of the Central Bank;
(iii) convertible foreign exchange notes; (iv) credit balances in convertible foreign
exchange—including SDRs—on the books of foreign central banks or other financial
institutions; (v) liquid debt securities issued by the government and the central bank
of the country on whose currency the securities are denominated; and (vi) officially
guaranteed forward and repurchase contracts of different types providing for future
payments in convertible foreign exchange by nonresidents. Excluded are (i) assets in
nonconvertible currencies; (ii) any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered; (iii) claims on residents; and (iv) foreign exchange claims arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency.



Foreign liabilities are defined to include: (i) foreign exchange and convertible marka
balances on the books of the CBBH due to nonresidents, including foreign central
banks and international financial institutions; (ii) credit balances due to foreign
central banks, governments, international organizations, and foreign financial
institutions; (iii) forward and repurchase contracts of different types providing for
future payments in foreign exchange by the CBBH to nonresidents; and (iv) any other
liabilities due to nonresidents.



Monetary liabilities are defined as the sum of (a) currency in circulation, (b) credit
balances of resident banks at the CBBH, and (c) credit balances of other residents at
the CBBH.



Capital and reserves are defined as (a) initial capital, (b) accumulated profits of the
CBBH since the beginning of its operation on August 11, 1997, (c) shares, (d) other
reserves.



Free reserves of the CBBH are defined as foreign exchange reserves not utilized as
backing for the currency. They therefore consist of the stock of CBBH net foreign
exchange reserves less the stock of CBBH monetary liabilities.



Foreign currency holdings will be converted into convertible marka at the exchange
rates of April 30, 2009, as published in the IMF International Financial Statistics.

61
Valuation changes will therefore be monitored from the accounts of the CBBH, with
information on net foreign assets provided monthly by the CBBH.5
C. Ceiling on External Payment Arrears
Definitions


External payment arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising in respect of debt
obligations incurred directly or guaranteed by the the State, Republika Srpska, and the
Federation governments or CBBH, except on debt subject to rescheduling or
restructuring.



Debt obligations are defined as all current liabilities, which are created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which require the State, Republika Srpska, and the Federation
governments or CBBH to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency), at some future point(s) in time to discharge principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. In effect, all instruments that share the characteristics of debt
as described above (including loans, suppliers' credits and leases) will be included in the
definition and be subject to the ceiling.

Application of performance criterion


The ceiling on the change in external payments arrears applies to the change in the stock
of overdue payments on medium- and long-term debt contracted or guaranteed by the the
State, Republika Srpska, and the Federation governments or by the CBBH. This criterion
will apply continuously.



The limit on the change in external payments arrears also applies to the change in the
stock of overdue payments on short term debt in convertible currencies with an original
maturity of up to and including one year.



D. Ceiling on Domestic Expenditure Arrears
Definition
The performance criterion established on the stock of domestic payments arrears
contemplates a zero ceiling on the increase in the stock of arrears compared with the stock as
of December 31 of the previous year. The stock of arrears is defined as the sum of payments
obligations (accounts payable) past the due date stipulated by the contractual or legal
payment period for each expenditure item and are nondisputed. They can arise on any
expenditure item, including transfers to individuals, debt service, wages, pensions, energy
payments and goods and services. Past-due payments obligations on inter-governmental
transfers (i.e., transfers between Entity central governments and local governments, and
extrabudgetary funds) are not included in the stock of arrears.
Application of performance criterion
The zero ceiling on the increase in the stock of arrears applies to the State, the Federation,
and the Republika Srpska governments. This criterion applies continuously. Thus, if, in any
given day any of the three governments exceeds the zero ceiling on the change in the stock of
its arrears compared with the stock of the same government’s arrears as of December 31 of
the previous year, the performance criterion will be missed.
E. Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional Short-Term External Debt
Governments will consult with the IMF before contracting or guaranteeing any new external
debt.
Definitions


The term "debt" is defined to include all current liabilities to non-residents, which are
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which require the State, Republika Srpska,
and the Federation governments or CBBH to make one or more payments in the form of
assets (including currency), at some future point(s) in time to discharge principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract (No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, Decision No. 6230–(79/140), August 3, 1979, as
amended by Decision Nos. 11096–(95/100), October 25, 1995, 12274-(00/85), August
24, 2000, and 14416-(09/91), August 31, 2009, effective December 1, 2009). In effect, all
instruments that share the characteristics of debt as described above (including loans,
suppliers' credits and leases) will be included in the definition.

63


New nonconcessional external debt is defined as including all debt (as defined above)
contracted or guaranteed by the State, Republika Srpska, and the Federation governments
or the CBBH during the program period that is not on concessional terms.



Concessional loans are defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent of the
value of the loan, using currency-specific discount rates based on the commercial interest
rates reported by the OECD (CIRRS). For short-term loans, the average CIRRs of the
proceeding six-month period (plus a margin of 0.75 percent) will be used.



Short-term external debt is defined as debt contracted or guaranteed with an original
maturity of up to and including one year.

Application of performance criteria
The ceiling on contracting new short-term external nonconcessional debt applies to
obligations of the State State, Republika Srpska, and the Federation governments, and
CBBH. This criterion will apply continuously.
F. Ceiling on the Increase in the Total Value of Outstanding Commitments by the State,
Republika Srpska, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina under Guarantees of
Private and Public Sector Enterprises’ Debts to Domestic Banks plus the Value of
Enterprise Debts to Domestic Banks Assumed by these Governments
The authorities will consult with the IMF before guaranteeing to domestic banks the
repayment of loans by private and public enterprises and before assuming enterprise debt to
domestic banks.
Definition
The increase in the total value of outstanding commitments of the State, Republika Srpska,
and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina under guarantees for the repayment by private
and public sector enterprises of debts to domestic banks plus the value of enterprises debts to
domestic banks assumed by these governments will be limited during the program period.
Application of performance criteria
This criterion will apply continuously. This ceiling on the increase in the total value of
outstanding commitments under the above-referred guarantees by the State, Republika
Srpska, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina plus the value of enterprise debts to
domestic banks assumed by these governments will apply relative to the total value of such
commitments and assumed debts existing as of December 31 of the previous year.

64
II. DATA REPORTING
The Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities will report the following data to the Fund within the
time limits listed below. The authorities will also provide, no later than the first week of each
month, a summary of key macroeconomic policy decisions taken during the previous month;
a summary of regulatory changes in the area of banking and financial sector, report any
revisions to monthly and annual fiscal reports as well as any amendments to the Entity and
state budget and local government budgets within a week after their approval.
Any revisions to past data previously reported to the Fund will be reported to the Fund
promptly, together with a detailed explanation. The data will be provided in an electronic
form.
All magnitudes subject to performance criteria or indicative targets will be reported in
millions of convertible marka where the corresponding target is in convertible marka, or in
millions of euro where the target is in euro.
The Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities will supply the Fund with any additional
information that the Fund requests in connection with monitoring performance under the
program on a timely basis.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
2010 Article IV Consultation, Second and Third Reviews under the Stand-By
Arrangement, Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of a Performance Criterion, and
Rephasing of Purchases—Informational Annex
Prepared by the European Department
September 21, 2010


Relations with the Fund: Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has been a member of
the International Monetary Fund since 1992. BiH has not accepted the obligations
under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4 and, therefore, avails itself of the
transitional arrangements under Article XIV. A three-year, SDR 1,014.6 million
(about US$1.6 billion, 600 percent of quota) Stand-By Arrangement with the
IMF, was approved on July 8, 2009. The Executive Board completed the first
review under the SBA in March 2010.



Bank-Fund Collaboration: The Fund and World Bank BiH teams meet regularly
to consult on and coordinate the two institutions’ activities and plans. They have
identified seven areas of structural reform as macrocritical in light of their
importance for fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability. These include
social safety nets and rights-based benefits, public sector pay and wage bill
management, labor taxation, budget planning, fiscal reporting, tax administration,
and financial sector supervision and contingency planning.



Exchange rate regime: The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the
convertible marka (KM), introduced on August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002,
the State parliament approved an amendment to the CBBH law that changed the
peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro under a currency board arrangement. The
KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro.



Statistical Issues: While data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes,
staff analysis is being affected by shortcomings in certain areas. The timeliness,
quality, and comprehensiveness of fiscal data need significant improvement. The
BOP data has insufficient details. The discrepancies between the production and
expenditure measures of GDP are relatively high. Nonetheless, BiH authorities
have made concerted efforts to improve the quality of statistics in recent years,
leveraging on TA provided by the EU and the IMF.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(CBBH) was subject to an assessment in the context of a potential successor for the 2002
arrangement. The assessment was completed on January 24, 2005 and recommendations
were made to address weaknesses identified in the Bank's safeguards. Based on the
information received from the authorities, all the recommendations have been implemented.

4
An update of safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)
was conducted in connection with the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved on July 8,
2009. The update found that the CBBH has further improved its safeguards framework since
the 2005 assessment. Developments include the adoption of a bank wide risk assessment
methodology, strengthening of the internal audit function, and amending the Audit
Committee’s (AC) by-laws to limit the number of its members and assure their independence
from executive activities at the bank. The CBBH has also adopted a formal policy for the
appointment and rotation of external auditors. This update assessment found that the Central
Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (CBBH) financial reporting, control and audit practices
generally comply with international standards and best practices. However, some aspects of
the audit oversight mechanism should be strengthened.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment to the
CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro under a currency board
arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BiH) has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4 and therefore
avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. BiH no longer maintains
restrictions under the transitional provisions of Art XIV. It maintains restrictions on the
transferability of balances and interest accrued on frozen foreign-currency deposits, subject
to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.
IX. FSAP
Two FSAP missions took place in December 2005 and March 2006, and an Aide Mémoire
was presented to the authorities. The FSAP assessed risks to financial stability and
weaknesses in banking supervision using a Basel Core Principles assessment. It also
considers financial sector development needs in the areas of insurance, access to finance, the
insolvency regime and corporate governance, drawing on a detailed assessment of the OECD
Principles of Good Corporate Governance. The FSSA was presented to the Board along with
the 2006 Article IV consultation (SM/06/335).
X. Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on September 17, 2008 (IMF Country Report
No. 08/327).
XI. Resident Representative
The IMF currently has a resident representative office in Sarajevo. Mr. Milan Cuc assumed
his position as a resident representative in October 2009.

APPENDIX II. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
1.
The Fund BiH team meets on a regular basis with the representatives of the World
Bank BiH team to consult on and coordinate the two institutions’ activities and plans.
2.
The Fund and Bank BiH teams share the view that economic recovery has started in
BiH, but the country faces substantial internal and external macroeconomic challenges.
While the crisis has reversed a long lasting trend of slow economic growth, it has caused no
major disturbances. The currency board arrangement and the whole banking sector have
weathered the crisis well. In 2010, exports have resumed growth, but access to foreign
private capital (both FDI and credit) has been very limited and investment growth has not
resumed yet. National savings are inadequate to finance pre-crisis investment levels. The
reforms to improve the efficiency of the public sector and restore fiscal sustainability (which
are expected to increase public saving) have been launched, but have yet to be implemented.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified seven areas of structural reform
as macrocritical in light of their importance for fiscal sustainability and financial sector
stability.


Social safety nets and rights-based benefits. The social safety net is complex, with a
large number of overlapping programs that are not well-targeted and fail to reach some of
the most vulnerable groups in society. This is especially the case for the panoply of
transfers directed at war veterans and demobilized soldiers. The authorities have launched
an ambitious reform agenda to overhaul the benefits system.



Public sector pay and wage bill management. In 2009, BiH spent around 13.1 percent
of GDP on public sector wages. The wage bill has grown significantly since 2006 (about
2 percentage points) and has been one of the main contributors to a widening fiscal
deficit. Furthermore, while significant improvements have been made to reform very
compressed salary scales in public administration, reduce the number of non-wage
benefits and increase transparency in line with good international practice, there is still
significant scope for improvement in this area.



Labor taxation. Social contribution rates levied on formal employment, particularly in
the Federation, are high (41.5% of gross wage). Social contribution payments, which are
higher than in the majority of OECD countries, increase the cost of labor, hinder
competitiveness, and contribute to informality. Reducing the rates of social contribution
through a combination of efficiency improvements in the health and pension systems and
substituting a share of financing with less distorting revenue sources is needed to improve
the competitiveness of the BiH economy, while reducing informality.

8


Budget planning. Accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts are needed to ensure
realistic budgets and avoid supplementary budgets and under-execution of the budget that
result from revenue underperformance or underestimation of expenditure. Moreover, a
medium-term fiscal framework would help to anchor fiscal policy around the goal of
public debt sustainability. There is an urgent need to strengthen medium-term budgeting
and improve the effectiveness of the Fiscal Council including via ensuring accurate and
timely fiscal reporting by all levels of government (see below).



Fiscal reporting. Progress in this area should help improve fiscal policy coordination,
fiscal planning, and performance monitoring. The multi-layer system of government and
lack of common reporting standards have hampered efforts to present a consolidated
picture of government finances to date. The Fund program and provision of technical
assistance are expected to provide sufficient leverage for renewed efforts on this front.



Tax administration. Improvements in tax administration should aim at better control and
a broadening of the tax base. As a first step, an overall diagnostic mission could assist the
authorities to identify priority areas for follow-up.



Financial sector. Stronger financial sector supervision and contingency planning should
help ensure that the authorities are able to monitor the health of the system and respond
appropriately to any emerging problems. Following substantial support for strengthening
the stress-testing capacity of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH),
further efforts are needed to strengthen the capacity of the Banking Agencies. A
framework for cooperation between the CBBH, the Finance Ministries, and other
agencies, along the lines recommended by the February 2009 IMF technical assistance
mission, has already been put in place and the Standing Committee for Financial Stability
has been established. It is essential that the Committee meets on a regular basis for a
discussion and exchange of information on financial stability issues.

4.


The teams agreed on the following division of labor:
Social safety net and rights-based benefits. The Bank will continue to advise the
authorities and provide implementation support for measures to consolidate various
programs and improve targeting. The Social Safety Net and Employment Project,
approved by the World Bank Executive Board in February 2010, is financing technical
assistance and capacity building services related to the reforms of the social protection
system. The project will also continue to support active labor market programs for active
job seekers among vulnerable categories. In addition, the Public Expenditure
Development Policy Loan (DPL), approved by the World Bank Executive Board in April
2010, supports increased assistance to the poor while reducing the fiscal deficit via more
effective, efficient and equitable social protection policies. Future priorities include
introducing a registry of programs and beneficiaries, implementing recently-introduced
legislation, introducing means testing and other targeting mechanisms for a number of

9
social and veterans’ benefits, conducting eligibility audits, reviewing new programs to
ensure proper targeting and affordability, and supporting the design of pension reform
strategy.


Public sector wages. The Bank will continue to provide assistance to the authorities in
improving the wage bill management and public sector pay practices with the aim of
increasing transparency, improving the link between pay levels, job complexity, and
performance, and contributing to fiscal sustainability. The DPL aims to reform public
expenditures that have been the main driver of pro-cyclical fiscal policies, notably the
high wage bill and excessive and regressive social transfers.



Labor taxation. The Bank will support the authorities in efforts to reduce the burden of
social contributions on formal employment and harmonizing the bases for payment of
income tax and social contributions between the two BiH Entities with the aim of
increasing competitiveness in the formal sector and strengthening the single economic
space across the BiH. To this end, the DPL will aim at lowering social contribution rates
to encourage formal sector employment and enhance competitiveness and private sector
development.



Budget planning. Both the Fund and the Bank will encourage the authorities to
implement realistic, predictable, and transparent budget procedures. The Fund and the
Bank will also continue advising the authorities to improve the medium-term budget
planning. To this end, the Fund and the Bank will continue urging the authorities to
strengthen the Fiscal Council’s operational framework by improving fiscal methodology
and multi-annual planning for the Global Framework, drafting proposals for short-term
and long-term macroeconomic projections, and implementing established goals and
criteria when adopting and executing the budget, and incorporating foreign-financed
projects. Medium-term fiscal planning in the Federation will have to address substantial
needs for capital investments in infrastructure.



Fiscal Reporting. The Fund will continue to advise the authorities and provide technical
assistance to improve fiscal reporting. The priority for the coming year is putting in place
a coherent system of fiscal reporting for all levels of government which will permit quick
and flexible consolidation. For FY 2011, technical assistance will continue to be provided
by the Center in Ljubljana through visits by a peripatetic PFM advisor. The objective
would be to set up processes for timely data reports by lower levels of governments and
for consolidation of source data into general government accounts.



Tax Administration. In response to the authorities’ request, the Fund will provide
technical assistance in the area of tax administration. As a first step, a diagnostic mission
to take place in early-2011 will help the authorities identify priorities going forward.

10


Financial sector. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance in the area of
stress testing of bank balance sheets. To this end, an MCM mission on stress testing has
already visited the country in June 2010 and provided assistance to the two Banking
Agencies, and follow-up missions could be scheduled for 2011. Finally, a joint
MCM/LEG TA could help put in place recommendations for strengthening the
framework of bank resolution.

APPENDIX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, staff analysis is being
affected by shortcomings in certain areas. The timeliness, quality, and comprehensiveness of
fiscal data need significant improvement. Budget execution data does not include
transactions related to projects financed by external loans or directly by international donors.
Accrual accounting has not yet been fully introduced in all government institutions, so
transactions are recorded on a mixed accrual/cash basis. There are also significant delays in
reporting by lower levels of government, particularly in the Federation. As a result, the
published quarterly consolidated general government accounts are beset by delays and spotty
coverage, particularly of financial operations. In addition, the BOP data has insufficient
detail on foreign grants, workers’ remittances, income received by residents working for
international organizations in the country, spending by their nonresident staff, trade credit by
suppliers, informal trade, and changes in foreign currency cash holdings. The discrepancies
between the production and expenditure measures of GDP are relatively high. At the same
time, BiH authorities have made concerted efforts to improve the quality of statistics in
recent years, leveraging on TA provided by the EU and IMF.
2.
The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly gave responsibility for
statistical functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Republika Srpska (RS)). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the
Bosnia & Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS), with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally-accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities’ Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating agency
for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance has been provided in
recent years, mainly by the European Union. An IFS country page has been in existence
since July 2001. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of
Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH) during May 1999–June 2004 to provide technical assistance
in the development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics. An STA resident real sector
statistical advisor was appointed in the period November 2005–November 2007. A mission
to prepare the ROSC Data Module took place in March 2007 and the report was published in
February 2008.
A. Real Sector Statistics
3.
Efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector statistics. The
Federation and RS have both published nominal GDP estimates using the production
approach consistent with the 1993 SNA, since 1998 and 1999, respectively. Compilation of
the GDP by production approach for both entities and the country as a whole at constant
prices (at prices of previous year) started in 2006, with technical assistance from the IMF.
Expenditure-based GDP data at current and constant prices have been published for the

12
period 2004-2008. However, discrepancies between the production and expenditure measures
of GDP are relatively high and more work is needed to reconcile these estimates.
4.
A consumer price index (CPI), based on internationally- recommended practices, has
been implemented with the technical and financial support of the Italian government. This
CPI was released in 2007, and consistent series are available monthly countrywide and for
each entity, with the series starting in January 2005. The CPI weights are derived from the
household budget survey, which has been conducted since 2004. Also, producer price indices
(PPI) are now available for both Entities. Industrial production indices are prepared in each
Entity. The Industrial Production index at the country level has been made available in 2009
with historical time series going back till 2006. Whereas the statistical institutes of both
Entities compile data on employment, unemployment, and wages based on questionable
methodologies, the annual Labor Force Survey follows international methodological
standards and provides data on employment, unemployment, population and labor force for
the country and the entities since 2006.
B. External Sector Statistics
5.
Despite resource constraints, continuing improvements have been made to the quality
of the balance of payments data, particularly in terms of services and financial transactions.
Concepts and definitions follow international standards, as stated in the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), including the residence concept. Nevertheless, many
shortcomings remain. Some of these shortcomings arise from intrinsic measurement
difficulties, such as the frequent small transactions and workers’ remittances. As a result, a
degree of uncertainty remains about several important components of the balance of
payments, where source data are inadequate due to the lack of comprehensive surveys on
services and remittances and to the difficulty of recording the large number of small cash
transactions.
6.
Trade data are published by the BHAS and balance of payments statistics by the
CBBH. Merchandise trade is recorded using the Automated System for Customs Data
processing system. The customs administration for the whole country has been reorganized,
and a trade classification system introduced. BHAS now produces export and import data
from customs records, but needs to produce the data on a general trade basis and not on a
special trade basis. Trade data may also be subject to incomplete coverage and underinvoicing. The data coverage remains poor in areas of foreign grants, workers’ remittances,
income received by residents working for international organizations in the country, spending
by their nonresident staff, informal trade, and changes in foreign currency cash holdings. All
foreign grants, loans, loan repayments, and interest payments for which the state government
has assumed responsibility, are consistent with the balance of payments data, as the same
source data are used for the compilation of GFS and the balance of payments. However, the
balance of payments data also include an estimate of foreign-financed projects which are
currently excluded from GFS. Data are consistent with monetary statistics.

13
C. Government Finance Statistics
7.
The CBBH compiles government finance statistics (GFS) in accordance with the
definitions and concepts of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The periodicity
and timeliness of data on government operations and quarterly consolidated central
government operations meet or exceed GDDS recommendations. While the institutional
coverage of the GFS is broadly consistent with international guidelines, its scope does not
cover all economic stocks (balance sheet data) and flows (cash flow data). In addition, the
GFS does not include transactions related to projects directly financed by international
donors, and quarterly statistics exclude all transactions in financial assets and liabilities due
to incomplete quarterly source data. Because accrual accounting has not yet been fully
introduced in all government institutions, transactions are recorded on a mixed accrual/cash
basis.1 External government debt data are published quarterly, and data on domestic debt
were published for the first time in the annual Global Fiscal Framework document in 2009.
GFS data are broadly consistent with the balance of payments, but can not be reconciled with
monetary statistics, due to differences in sectorization and data gaps, and are not reconciled
with national accounts data.
8.
Authorities are making concerted effort to improve the quality of the GFS. They have
established a coordinating group, including representatives of the central bank and ministries
of finance of the two Entities and the state institutions, to provide data for monitoring of the
stand-by arrangement. With the help of a peripatetic PFM advisor, the State, Federation and
Republika Srpska are implementing bridging tables from the existing chart of accounts to
formats compatible with GFS 2001 and ESA 95 to improve the quality of consolidated
general government data.
D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
9.
The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on a countrywide and Entity basis.
The CBBH is in the process of switching its reporting of monetary data to the Fund to the
Standardized Report Forms developed by STA that embody the methodology of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBBH already collects data using the
standardized report forms 1SR (Central bank), 2SR (commercial banks), and 4SR (Other
financial institutions) and is in the process of validating the received data against the
information collected by the existing reporting system for the period January 2006 – March
2010. Furthermore, the CBBH expanded the coverage of the weighted average interest rates
from 4 indicators to 26 indicators (14 active interest rates and 12 passive interest rates with
breakdown by maturity, currency, and sectors). Finally, the CBBH extended the coverage of
1

At the State level, some earmarked revenues are not recorded until the corresponding expenditure takes place.
In the Federation, expenditures are not entered into the Treasury payment system if there are no available funds
to pay them out or if obligations exceed the budgeted amounts.

14
its annual financial sector statistics to encompass approximately 120 financial institutions
(investment funds, insurance companies, microcredit institutions, leasing companies,
brokerage houses, and stock exchanges).

Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation, Second and Third Reviews Under the
Stand-By Arrangement, Request for Waivers of Nonobservance and Applicability of
Performance Criteria, and Rephasing of Purchases—Supplementary Information and

Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Adam Bennett and Jan Kees Martijn
October 14, 2010
This supplement provides information on developments and performance since the
issuance of the staff report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation, Second and Third
Reviews Under the Stand-By Arrangement, Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of a
Performance Criterion, and Rephasing of Purchases (EBS/10/183). The information
contained in this supplement does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal, and
supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of applicability of the end-September 2010
performance criterion on net bank credit to government, which has become controlling
in view of the October 15, 2010 date for Board consideration of the second and third
SBA reviews.

II. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND MODALITIES
2.
The performance criteria relating to short-term external debt, external debt
service arrears, and debt guarantees were met. In particular, there has not been any
accumulation of external debt service arrears and no new short-term non-concessional
external debt was contracted or guaranteed by the central bank, State, Federation, or RS
governments. Furthermore, the State, Federation, and RS governments did not extend any
guarantees of enterprise debt to domestic banks and no debt under such guarantees was
assumed by these governments. The margin by which the performance criterion on domestic
expenditure arrears was breached (in the first quarter of 2010)—for which the authorities
request a waiver of nonobservance—remains unchanged (Table 1 of the Supplementary
Letter of Intent).
3.
Although there is no information on the quantitative performance criterion on
net bank credit to government for end-September 2010, the authorities are confident
that it has been met. As of end-August, the separate sub-ceilings on net bank credit to the
BiH general government, State, Federation, and RS governments were all less than twothirds of their respective programmed values for end-September 2010. Based on this fact and
the continued strength of indirect tax revenues, the authorities are confident that the endSeptember performance criterion has been met.
4.
Further progress was made on structural reforms of war-related transfers. In the
Federation, following the adoption by government of measures to improve the efficiency of
eligibility audits (which was a prior action and was met), the government approved related
changes in the Rulebook on the establishment and work of audit teams. In addition, the first
quarterly report on eligibility audits of war-related cash benefits was published on October 8,
2010. In the RS, the eligibility audits of war-related benefits are proceeding as planned.
5.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of applicability of the endSeptember 2010 performance criterion on net bank credit to government, for which
data is not available. A revised proposed decision, granting the requested waiver of
applicability, is attached.

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Further to our letter of September 17, 2010, which reiterates our commitment to the
economic program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the Fund, we hereby
request a waiver of applicability for the end-September 2010 performance criterion on net
bank credit to the government, which has become controlling in view of the October 15,
2010 date for Board consideration of the second and third SBA reviews. While we do not
have the full information to assess the performance under this criterion, we are confident that
it was observed. The continuous quantitative performance criteria on external public debt
service arrears, short-term non-concessional external public debt, and public guarantees and
assumption of enterprise debt to domestic banks have been observed. The margin by which
the performance criterion on domestic expenditure arrears was breached (in the first quarter
of 2010)—for which we had requested a waiver of nonobservance in our September 17, 2010
letter—remains unchanged (Table 1).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
On October 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.1
Background
After several years of strong growth, increasingly accompanied by external and internal
imbalances, the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina fell into recession in 2009. Like
elsewhere in the region, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s pre-crisis growth relied on booming
domestic demand financed from abroad. Sharp increases in government spending on
wages and social transfers in 2008 added to demand pressures, which manifested in
widening current account deficits and a spike in inflation. The global economic and
financial crisis triggered a collapse in the demand for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s exports
and severely curtailed cross-border financial inflows. Private investment and spending
on consumer durables collapsed, while private consumption softened to a lesser extent,
on the back of moderate growth of wages and social benefits. The pre-crisis credit boom
came to a sudden stop.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Faced with increasing financing pressures in early 2009, the authorities put together a
comprehensive program supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement. The program was
designed to safeguard the currency board and cushion the effects of the deteriorating
external environment, while adopting policies to redress fiscal imbalances and
strengthen the financial sector. The authorities’ approach included: (i) gradual fiscal
consolidation accompanied by structural fiscal reforms to bring public finances on a
sustainable path; (ii) steps to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector alongside
commitments from foreign parent banks to maintain their exposures to BiH and keep
their subsidiaries capitalized; and (iii) substantial financing from the IMF along with funds
from the World Bank and the European Union (EU).
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s stabilization program has helped mitigate the impact of the
global financial crisis on the economy. The IMF’s financial support package has helped
minimize the impact of revenue shortfalls on government spending, thus limiting output
losses. It has also helped stem the loss of foreign reserves by the central bank and
shore up investor confidence. Confidence building steps, including Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s participation in the European Bank Coordination Initiative, and the
increase of the scope and limit of deposit insurance coverage helped restore depositors’
confidence in the banking system. Performance under the program has been
encouraging: fiscal restraint is addressing large imbalances of recent years and
structural fiscal reforms have advanced, albeit at a slower pace than initially envisaged.
The economy appears to have bottomed out and is projected to stage a modest
recovery in 2010, paving the way for a rebound in 2011. Domestic demand will remain
subdued, held in check by stagnant real wages and ongoing fiscal consolidation. This
will contribute to a further narrowing of the current account deficit. Underlying inflation is
projected to remain low. Private sector credit will pick-up slowly, as banks have yet to
absorb the full losses due to non-performing loans in their portfolios. The program
targets a general government deficit of 4.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Bosnia and Herzegovina’s satisfactory performance
under the program amidst a challenging economic and political environment. Fiscal
restraint is addressing large imbalances of recent years and structural fiscal reforms
have advanced, albeit at a slower pace than initially envisaged. Directors emphasized
that important challenges remain in ensuring that the economic and policy adjustments
are sustainable. They encouraged the newly-elected governments to accelerate
structural reforms to ensure fiscal and external sustainability, and to provide the basis
for robust, sustainable growth.
Directors noted that attaining the program’s 2010 and 2011 fiscal targets will pave the
way to restoring fiscal sustainability. Directors encouraged the expenditure restraint
demonstrated to be maintained, stressing that meeting the 2010 fiscal target hinges on

3
steadfast implementation of reforms of war-related benefits and a reduction of current
expenditures by the Federation’s cantons. Directors welcomed the authorities’
confirmation of the program’s overall fiscal deficit target for next year, and encouraged
them to finalize discussions on the 2011 budgets in the Fiscal Council expeditiously.
Directors underscored that medium-term fiscal consolidation needs to be accompanied
by a shift from recurrent to capital expenditures. This will require perseverance with the
reforms of rights-based benefits to improve their efficiency through better targeting of
the poor and the most vulnerable, reining in the public wage bill, and putting the
pensions systems on a sustainable footing. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to carry out comprehensive expenditure reviews at the State and Entity
levels. They noted that the resources freed-up by these reforms would help finance
much-needed infrastructure investments.
Directors commended the authorities for vigilant financial sector policies which helped
the financial system weather well the spillovers from the global financial crisis. They also
welcomed the commitments by foreign parent banks to maintain their exposure vis-à-vis
Bosnia and Herzegovina and keep their subsidiaries well capitalized. Directors noted
that rising nonperforming loans and declining profitability in the banking sector require
continued vigilance and close monitoring of developments in credit quality and spillover
risks from regional developments.
Directors underscored that medium-term prospects depend critically on the
implementation of structural reforms to improve the country’s growth potential. Reforms
aimed at addressing labor market rigidities, speeding up the pace of technological
change, and improving the business environment would set the stage for robust,
sustainable growth.
Directors called on the authorities to take the necessary steps to accept the obligations
under Article VIII. They also encouraged further efforts to address data quality issues.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Completes Second and Third Reviews under Stand-By Arrangement with Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Approves €132.8 million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
and third reviews of Bosnia and Herzegovina's economic performance under a program
supported by a 36-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the reviews
enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 118.37 million (about
€132.8 million or US$187.1 million), of which the authorities intend to draw SDR
33.82 million, bringing total disbursements under the program to an amount equivalent to
SDR 338.2 million (about €379.4 million or US$534.6 million). In completing the review,
the Executive Board approved request for waiver of nonobservance of continuous
performance criterion on the accumulation of domestic payment arrears and waiver of
applicability of the end-September 2010 performance criterion on net bank credit to the
government.
The SBA was approved on July 8, 2009 (see Press Release No.09/258). Following the
Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, stated:
“Bosnia and Herzegovina’s satisfactory implementation of policies supported by the
Stand-By Arrangement is proceeding amidst a challenging economic and political
environment. Fiscal restraint is addressing large imbalances of recent years and structural
fiscal reforms have advanced. Strong implementation by the newly-elected governments of
the structural reform agenda is needed to ensure fiscal and external sustainability and
provide the basis for robust, sustainable growth.
“Attaining the program’s 2010 fiscal target is the first step towards restoring fiscal
sustainability. The authorities have demonstrated expenditure restraint and have adopted
measures to ensure that the 2010 general government deficit objective will be met.
Implementation of reforms of war-related benefits and the reduction of current expenditures
by the Federation’s cantons will be essential in this regard.

2

“The 2011 fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP strikes an appropriate balance between
the need for fiscal tightening and promoting the incipient economic recovery. Medium-term
fiscal consolidation will need to be accompanied by a shift from recurrent to capital
expenditures. With government expenditure now in excess of 50 percent of GDP, policies
should focus on reducing current expenditure by intensifying reforms of rights-based
benefits to improve their efficiency through better targeting of the poor and most vulnerable,
reining in the public wage bill, and putting the pensions systems on a sustainable footing.
Freed-up resources will help finance badly needed infrastructure investments, which
alongside reforms to tackle labor market rigidities and improve the business environment,
will set the stage for a robust, sustainable growth.
“The authorities’ financial sector policies have been appropriate, helping preserve financial
stability in the face of the global financial crisis. Foreign parent banks’ commitment to
maintain their exposure vis-à-vis Bosnia and Herzegovina and keep their subsidiaries well
capitalized further strengthened market confidence. Rising non-performing loans and
declining bank profitability call for continued vigilance and close monitoring of
developments in credit quality and spillover risks from regional developments”.

Statement by Mr. Yakusha and Mr. Tomic on Bosnia and Herzegovina
October 15, 2010
The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) would like to thank staff for a constructive
policy dialogue and an excellent set of papers which correctly describe the recent economic
developments and major policy challenges ahead. Two staff visits were necessary to
conclude the discussions on the program reviews, and with hindsight, staff’s consistent and
strict insistence on adhering to the program’s strategy and tackling politically sensitive spots
(such as the high public sector wage bill, non-targeted benefits, pension and health system),
were beneficial for maintaining credibility. Program performance remains satisfactory,
despite some delays on the structural reform front. There was a breach of one performance
criteria, namely non-accumulation of domestic arrears that occurred in the Health Fund of the
Republika Srpska (RS) as a consequence of liquidity constraints during the first quarter of
2010, for which a waiver is requested based on corrective action already taken.
The program helped to limit the impact of the crisis on the economy, and contributed to a
return to positive growth territory, as signaled by the leading indicators already in 2010. Most
notably, the program, while providing short-term financing at favorable terms that helped
dampen the fall in GDP, also raised the awareness of policy makers to structural issues, a key
for medium-term developments. Unemployment has remained the biggest economic
problem. Despite an expected revival of growth in 2011, the solution for unemployment, the
growth model that will create jobs, is still to be found.
Developments since the last Article IV Consultations held in September 2008 provided
ample opportunity for testing the strengths of the financial system. Faced with a decrease in
deposits in late 2008, the Central bank of BiH (CBBH) reduced reserve requirements in
several instances, while domestic, mainly foreign-owned banks, received liquidity injections
from parent banks. Apart from a sudden stop in credit activity during 2009, which negatively
reflected on banks’ profitability, a substantial increase in non-performing loans’ (NPLs)
share in total loans from 3.1 percent in 2008 to 8.7 percent currently, is the most discernible
deterioration. However, it is not expected that this figure will further increase significantly,
signaling that, in comparison to regional peers, the banking system preserved soundness.
The Fund program contributed significantly to the stabilization of the banking system by
securing commitment to the exposure under the European Bank Coordination Initiative
(Vienna Initiative), requiring establishment of the Standing Committee on Financial Stability,
and improved surveillance through stress testing introduced under technical assistance
provided. Similarly, entity banking agencies benefited from the USAID technical assistance
that will help introduce Basel II standards. With a strengthened institutional framework, the
monetary authorities carefully monitor developments in the banking system, currently
characterized by surplus liquidity, and stand ready to act should there be any need.

2

Reinforced credibility in the financial system served as a strong support also for the currency
board, which remains widely perceived as the best nominal anchor. With inflation pressure
kept in check, partly also due to subdued domestic demand, the authorities remain fully
committed to the current arrangement. Finally, there is no evidence of currency
over/undervaluation. Improvements observed in the current account so far, and stronger
revival of exports compared to imports, bode well for further reduction in external
imbalances. The external debt position, despite some increase, scores favorably compared to
regional peers.
The prospects for reaching a deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP target in 2010 are good. Further
adjustment of at least 1.5 percent of GDP is expected in 2011, and this objective serves as a
major input for budget planning at the different levels of government. Since the expenditure
to GDP ratio remains high, the authorities are determined to thoroughly review expenditures
across the different levels of government with the objective of identifying possible savings,
already for the period 2012–14.
Important legislation that should help contain current expenditures (such as the wage bill law
in the Federation BiH, the government’s decision to speed up the audit process of
beneficiaries, or pension reform strategies adopted by the entity parliaments) was enacted
under the program and its contribution to the return to a more appropriate fiscal stance is
expected in the medium term. More importantly, the sheer process of the laws’ adoption and
the public debate initiated, have prepared the stage for fiscal adjustment envisaged in the near
term. Although public debt sustainability analyses reveal a still relatively comfortable
position, the authorities are aware of the projected increase in debt servicing in the medium
term and increase in borrowing needs in the absence of continued fiscal adjustment.
Securing sustained recovery will depend on the success in further improving the labor
market, including a collective bargaining mechanism, enhancing technological change and
amelioration of the business environment. Staff has contributed to internal discussion on
growth promoting possibilities that will be useful for the governments that assume office
after the recent elections.
Irrespective of the fact that it may take some time before the new cabinets are formed, the
immediate task on budget 2011 preparation is going according to schedule. Finally, in light
of the limited balance of payments needs, the authorities intend to purchase only part of the
available tranches at this stage.
