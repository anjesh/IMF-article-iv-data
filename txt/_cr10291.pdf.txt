EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Economic conditions have stabilized, and the economy is projected to bottom
out in 2010, giving way to a mild recovery in 2011 followed by stronger growth. However,
global financial risks remain elevated and muted growth prospects in trading partners weigh
on the outlook. The government has taken steps to stabilize the fiscal deficit, but further
measures will be needed to reach the official deficit target for 2012 of 3 percent of GDP.
Challenges and staff views. The foremost policy challenge is to achieve the official fiscal
consolidation targets so as to put debt ratios on a declining path and provide more space to
guard against risks to the financial sector. Further old-age pension reform is also essential.
Preserving financial sector stability through early detection of risks remains a top priority in
light of the difficult economic and financial environment, and the supervision of cooperative
credit societies needs to be strengthened as a matter of urgency. Structural reforms are
needed to preserve competitiveness and enhance medium-term growth.
Authorities’ views. The government largely shared the staff’s assessment, while projecting
growth to turn positive as soon as 2010 and being more confident that the fiscal targets can
be met through general spending restraint and with less focus on the public payroll. The
Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) expressed confidence in the ability of banks to withstand
pressures, and this is supported by stress test results. Moving to a single independent
supervisor for all credit institutions—a much desirable objective—is not on the political
agenda, but strengthening the supervision of cooperative credit societies seems feasible.
Mission team and interlocutors: B. Laurens (Head), W. McGrew, V. Flamini (all EUR)
and M. Saiyid (MCM) visited Cyprus during June 25-July 5, 2010. Y. Friedman (OED) and
a representative from the European Commission also attended. The mission met with
Minister of Finance Stavrakis, Governor Orphanides, senior public sector and parliamentary
officials, private banks and businesses, and labor unions. A press conference was held and
the concluding statement published.

I. THE CONTEXT: MACROECONOMIC IMBALANCES BUILDING UP PRIOR TO THE CRISIS1
1.
Cyprus is being affected by the global crisis with a lag, as it entered into
recession in early-2009, about a year after the euro area as a whole. In the wake of euro
adoption in early 2008, domestic consumption remained strong, buttressed by buoyant credit
growth—mainly channeled to a

booming real estate market— and a

relaxation in the fiscal stance (Box 1).

out (Figure 1).
2.
Home-grown imbalances are set to weigh on the recovery. Prior to the crisis, rapid
credit growth drove private sector indebtedness up (Figure 2) and led to overheating.2 Above
euro-area average real wage and price dynamics exacerbated external imbalances and the
related loss in competitiveness and necessary adjustment in saving patterns will moderate
growth going forward. Meanwhile, tax revenue buoyancy during the upturn, especially
related to asset prices, proved cyclical and the fiscal position took a sharp turn for the worse
in 2009.

This report reflects data until July 15, 2010 and discussions with the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus
(ROC). It does not cover areas not under the effective control of the ROC and assumes no change in the status
quo. Political development in the non-government controlled areas of Cyprus following the April 2010 victory
of the presidential contender known as firm supporter of Turkish Cypriot independence has raised uncertainties
regarding the outcome of the reunification talks.

Households hold debt of about 130 percent of GDP at end-2009 is one of the highest levels in Western
Europe, although their net asset position, boosted by rising real estate prices over the last 5 years, has remained
strong. Looking forward, downward adjustment in housing prices particularly in coastal areas in 2010 and staff
projection of no positive portfolio investments until 2012 may weigh on the net position. Corporate debt is also
among the highest in Western Europe, having increased during the boom years, but a reversal was initiated as
the economy entered recession. Private agents responded to the combination of falling asset prices and rising
uncertainty by raising their saving rates from lows reached in 2008.

translated into a parallel improvement of the structural balance,

2007. General government debt also declined from 68.9 to 48.4

percent of GDP in 2008. This virtuous path was supported by
favorable cyclical conditions and tax-rich activities from the real

Most of the consolidation was reversed in 2009, following a 7 percent deterioration in the overall balance
compared to 2008, pushing up gross debt to 56.2 percent of GDP. The increase in debt resulted from a 7.3 percent
deterioration in the primary balance and a debt increasing snowball effect due to GDP contraction. Stock flow
adjustments also contributed to the increase, following accumulation of government assets at the end of 2008 to meet
financing needs in early 2009 (Table). Beside less favorable cyclical conditions, resulting in falling tax revenue and
increasing expenditures due to the activation of the automatic stabilizers and public investment and the fading away of
the asset boom, the reversal was the result of a highly expansionary expenditure policy. In addition to a deliberate fiscal
stimulus through higher investment spending of 1.4 percent of GDP, higher wages and social transfers led to a 4.1
percent increase in total expenditure. However, a reduction in the overall surplus occurred already in 2008 ─when the
economy was still overheating─ driven by a marked decrease in total revenues as the tax-rich real estate and tourism
sectors were hit from the global crisis affecting the main foreign counterparts, namely UK and Russia.

Note: The table shows contributions to the change in gross public debt according to the following decomposition:
Where D, Y, PD and SF indicate the stock of public debt, real GDP, the primary
balance, and the stock flow adjustment respectively, and i and y are the cost of debt and nominal GDP growth.
The April 2010 Stability Programme projects a reduction of the overall deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2013.
The consolidation is based on expenditure-reducing measures (i.e., a significant reduction in personnel and operational
expenses and better targeting of social schemes) and the enhancement of revenues through improved tax compliance
and a town planning amnesty. Some of the measures, however, still need to be agreed with stakeholders or have not yet
been passed by the Parliament. On May 12, 2010 the European Commission initiated an Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP) for Cyprus based on the consideration that the current deficit, although exceptional given the adverse cyclical
conditions, cannot be considered temporary, and the debt ratio could not be considered as sufficiently diminishing and
approaching the reference value of 60 percent at a satisfactory pace.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE OUTLOOK
A. Macroeconomic Developments
3.
The economic slowdown has only partially corrected existing imbalances
(Figure 3). After experiencing average growth of 4¼ percent over 2004-08, the economy
contracted by 1.7 percent in 2009, weighed down by a correction in the real estate market and
a sharp decline in the tourism sector. Private consumption growth, the main driver of the
expansion in the recent past, evaporated, reflecting leveraged balance sheets, rising
unemployment and slowing household credit growth. In the backdrop of weakening demand
prospects and deteriorating financing conditions, fixed investment contracted sharply. The
inventory cycle was particularly pronounced, as firms reacted with delay to the slowdown in
trade partners’ economies. Nonetheless, the domestic correction was partially cushioned by a
substantial fiscal relaxation and the reversal in the net export contribution; the current
account deficit moderated—although it remained high, at above 8 percent of GDP.
4.
Slack has emerged but cost dynamics have not fully responded to the recession
(Figures 4 and 5). Inflation moderated substantially to ¼ percent in 2009 from 4½ percent in
2008, as the economy slowed and oil prices plummeted. The labor market lost pace, with
wage growth slowing down to 4.1 percent from 5.8 in 2008 and the unemployment rate rising
by 1.7 percentages point to 5.3, although from a level substantially below the euro area
average. While the output gap is estimated to have turned negative in the second quarter of
2009, a positive inflation differential with the euro area has reopened since the beginning of
2010 owing to price developments in the non tradable sectors. Real wage growth, which had
exhibited significant buoyancy since 2004, moderated in 2009, but remained above euro area
levels as wage contracts did not incorporate the entire drop in inflation due to the backward
looking inflation-indexed wage adjustment mechanism (COLA, Box 2).
5.
The recovery has so far remained elusive, and staff projects slightly negative
growth for 2010 to turn only moderately positive in 2011. Short-term indicators suggest
that the turnaround in activity has only started to materialize (Figure 6): the construction
sector remains depressed; firms continue to be reluctant to invest, constrained both by soft
orders and tighter lending conditions; and green shoots in the tourism sector and industrial
production have only emerged recently.

1/ The substantial drop in consumer credit growth in January 2010 is due to a major reclassification from consumer credit to
other lending causing the reported negative rate for consumer loans. Taking this reclassification into account, consumer credit
growth decelerated but remained positive, reaching 3.8 percent in June 2010.

Box 2. Cyprus: Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA) System
An important element of the wage determination process in Cyprus is the costof-living allowance (COLA). Through COLA salaries in the public sector and many
salaries in the private sector are linked to average CPI inflation (excluding excise tax
increases since the second half of 1999) in the preceding six months twice a year, on
January 1 and on July 1. The share of “COLA employees” in the private sector has
been on a downward trend, in particular due to an increasing number of foreign
workers not covered by the COLA; recent estimates by the Central Bank of Cyprus
place at approximately 50 percent the overall share of such employees.
The COLA system is a fairly controversial issue in Cyprus, and it is only in
times of real crisis, such as after the military conflict in 1974, that a temporary
suspension of the COLA has been possible. COLA is strongly supported by the
trade unions, and considered as having contributed to long-term contracts and labor
market peace. On the other hand, employer organizations have argued that it has
resulted in large increases in real wages and deterioration in competitiveness of
domestic firms due to second round inflationary effects, and have expressed
concerns that the system undermines flexibility and competitiveness as it impedes
relative wage adjustments across firms and sectors in line with productivity
differentials. The COLA also imparts inertia to the public sector wage bill, making it
more difficult to reverse the excessive growth of public sector wages and salaries.
Finally, while there is no firm evidence that COLA contributed to wage-prices
spirals, this might have been a result of the prevailing stable inflationary
environment of the last years.
The shortcomings of the COLA become more evident in the current low-growth
economic environment. By linking wages to CPI rather than productivity, COLA
undermines competitiveness and labor flexibility, in addition to exacerbating the
level and persistence of price shocks. In addition, downward wages stickiness
resulting from the COLA may become an impediment to the economy’s ability to
respond to the current low-growth environment. In particular, in the presence of
long-duration wage contracts the COLA constrains the markets’ ability to correct an
overshooting of wages that may result from too optimistic an outlook at the time of
the contract’s inception.

14
part permanent rather than one-off or cyclical. Meanwhile revenues fell by 3 percent of GDP,
reflecting the economic downturn and the unwinding of exceptional revenues associated with
the real estate boom of preceding years. The result was a fiscal deficit of 6.1 percent of
GDP—a 7 percent of GDP widening over 2008. The cyclically adjusted primary balance
declined by some 6 percentage points in 2009, imparting a large fiscal stimulus.
7.
The government plans to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012,
consistent with its EU obligations. Under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the EU
has asked Cyprus to bring its fiscal deficit down to 4.5 percent GDP in 2011 and 3 percent of
GDP in 2012. Cyprus is due to report back to the EU in January 2011 on its plans for
achieving this consolidation.

The authorities have taken steps to stabilize the deficit, but additional and as yet
unidentified measures will be needed to

9.
While the social security system is currently in surplus, despite the 2009 reform
it is unsustainable over the long term (see Annex), and even in the medium term
declining surpluses will put pressure elsewhere in the budget. The social security system
surplus is currently 3-4 percent of GDP, as contributions by employers, workers, and the
government exceed outlays. Over the coming decades to 2060, pension outlays are projected
to rise by some 10 percentage points as the system matures and demographic changes play
out. Unless other area of government spending are curtailed, this would raise total
government spending to some 60 percent of GDP in 2060—a very high level that could be
sustained only with a heavy increase in the tax burden.

General wage increases agreed in collective agreements are independent from COLA adjustments.

15
10.
Pressures in Euro zone sovereign
debt markets have spilled over to some
extent to Cyprus, but the risk of imminent
financing pressures appears contained.
There has been a modest widening of credit
spreads over the past year, though by less
than Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Also,
adverse market conditions led the authorities
to postpone until late 2010 a European
Medium Term Note (EMTN) issuance
originally planned for the summer. The
authorities do not view sovereign funding
pressures as a significant risk, in light of a
relatively light amortization schedule. They are
also confident that, if external markets remain
difficult, they can issue domestic debt to the
local financial sector. Staff broadly share this
assessment, although access to domestic
funding sources could become more difficult if
risks to the financial sector from exposure to
Greek assets (Box 3) and to the local real
estate market materialize.

incorporated locally but operating
internationally dominate the sector. The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the
commercial banking system is adequate (11.9 percent at the end of March 2010), but
profitability has declined due to low interest margins (partly induced by competition on
deposit rates with Greek banks and, more recently with cooperative credit societies, Figure
8), mark-to-market losses on assets, and provisions for non-performing loans (NPLs).

16
Box 3. Cyprus: Spillovers from Greece
While the Cypriot economy is exposed to developments in Greece through several channels the
main spillovers will be felt through the banks’ balance sheets.
 Trade channel. Greece is Cyprus's third-largest tourism market and the largest market for exports
of goods. However, the trade effects are expected to be limited given that Greece only accounted
for 6.2% of tourist arrivals in 2009 and while it accounted for 18 to 20 percent of total exports,
exports of goods account for less than 6 percent of GDP.
 Interest rate spreads channel. Greek banks have a significant and growing presence in Cyprus. As
they have had to compete with the high interest rates offered by their own government for funds,
they have increased interest rates on deposits, both in Greece and in Cyprus. In order to maintain
market share, the Cypriot banks have also had to respond with higher rates, which has contributed
to higher deposit rates in Cyprus compared with the euro zone average.
 Banking sector channel. The main spillovers will be felt through the banks’ balance sheets in view
of the high level of cross-border activities. As of end of 2009 overseas operations of Bank of
Cyprus, Marfin Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank represented 45 percent, 63 percent and 24 percent
of their consolidated group assets, respectively. Moreover, loans and advances granted by these
banks to Greek customers reached 38 percent, 53 percent, and 22 percent of total group loans,
respectively, corresponding to direct lending of €23 billion. Additionally, local commercial banks
were holding €5.5 billion of Greek government bonds and €0.5 billion of Greek bank bonds as of
March 2010. Furthermore, subsidiaries of foreign, mostly Greek, banks have high exposures to
Greece as well: these are €1.3 billion in direct loans, €6.6 billion of Greek government bonds and
€6.5 billion in Greek bank bonds. Finally, local commercial banks have €1.5 billion worth of
interbank exposure to Greece, while subsidiaries of foreign banks have €11 billion of such
exposure representing placements with their parents. Overall gross exposure to Greece, not
including interbank loans, is estimated to be 260 percent of GDP.
Staff estimates suggest that under an adverse scenario cumulative losses on Greek exposure for
local banks could be of the

While the banking sector has continued to weather the crisis relatively well
NPLs are rising. Despite recent decline in profitability return on equity remains high
compared to other euro area banking sectors. Liquidity ratios also appear comfortable. A
business model with high reliance on retail deposits has helped to shield the sector from the
global crisis and in recent months banks have gained non-resident deposits largely owing to
weaker conditions in Greece. Nevertheless, negative growth in Cyprus has led to rising NPLs
in commercial banks (4.9 percent at end March 2010 compared with 3.6 percent at end2008), and they may rise further until growth resumes. Furthermore, exposure to Greece is
significant (estimated to be at least as high as 260 percent of GDP) which creates additional
pressure on NPLs. NPLs reported by cooperative banks (9.2 percent at end-March 2010) are
higher, and weaker classification norms than for commercial banks strongly suggest that they
are significantly understated.4
13.
In anticipation of deteriorating asset portfolios banks have acted defensively.
They have lowered dividend payout ratios, although the tax regime favors dividend payouts
over retained earnings; cut operational costs, strengthened non-interest margins, and
bolstered fee-based activities to support net income; increased loan loss provisions and
tightened underwriting standards; and have been able to attract deposits from Greece owing
to perceived safety of the banking system.
14.
The government has facilitated the securing of cheap ECB funding by issuing to
the banks close to €3.0 billion worth of bonds (equivalent to about 18 percent of GDP, but
only 2 percent of the assets of eligible institutions) against high-quality collateral consisting
of performing loans which must be replaced if they become non-performing. The bonds,
which banks have pledged at the ECB in part to obtain cheap funding and lower their average
cost of funds, are recorded as a securities lending transaction. In the event that the loss for the
government becomes large, or if the scheme is extended beyond its original date, the bonds
may have to be recorded in the government debt.
15.
Regular stress tests conducted by the CBC indicate that commercial banks have
the capacity to absorb further shocks,5 but the resilience of the cooperative credit

NPLs in the cooperative credit societies are compiled on the basis of a 270-day rather than 90-day delinquency
rate.
5

In addition, stress tests on Bank of Cyprus and Marfin Popular Bank in the context of the 2010 EU-wide stress
testing exercise showed that as a result of the assumed shock under the adverse scenario, the estimated
consolidated Tier 1 capital ratio for Bank of Cyprus would change to 9.4 percent in 2011 compared to 10.5
percent as of end of 2009 and for Marfin Popular Bank it would change to 8.5 percent in 2011 compared to 9.4
percent as of end of 2009. An additional sovereign risk scenario would have a further impact of 1.4 percentage
points on the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio of Bank of Cyprus, bringing it to 8.0 percent at the end of 2011 and
1.4 percentage points to 7.1 percent for Marfin Popular Bank. Published results include sovereign exposures of
individual banks. Furthermore, Hellenic Bank, the third largest domestic bank, voluntarily carried out the stress
test and has announced that its Tier 1 ratio would change to 8.9 percent compared to 9 percent at the end of

societies is harder to assess. According to the CBC, the average CAR would remain above
the regulatory minimum even in the event of a doubling of NPLs and assuming a 50 percent
recovery rate, which is slightly lower than current levels. On the other hand, stress tests
carried out by the supervisor for cooperative credit societies are less stringent and results are
difficult to compare with those for commercial banks due to the differences in the definition
of NPLs, the size of the shocks, and recovery rate assumptions.
16.
Progress in strengthening financial supervision, crisis management and
contingency planning has been uneven. The deposit insurance schemes were strengthened
in July 2009, placing them on a par with similar schemes in the EU; a number of
improvements in the supervisory framework for commercial banks have been adopted; a
draft law facilitating government intervention in case of a financial crisis is expected to be
passed in early 2011. However, no progress was made regarding a previous Fund
recommendation to move to one single independent supervisor for banks and cooperative
credit societies.
D. External Position
17.
The current account deficit moderated to -8.3 of GDP in 2009 as the economy
contracted, from a peak of -17.5 percent in 2008. Although temporary and technical
factors6 partly explain the large headline numbers in 2008, the foreign trade figures in 2009
reflect the weakness of domestic import demand and lower global commodity prices as well
as sluggish demand from Cyprus’s main trading partners. As a result the goods trade deficit
improved substantially and the service trade surplus worsened. The value of imports for
domestic consumptions fell by 21.1 percent with the steepest decline recorded by transport
equipment, fuels, and intermediate goods, reflecting a decline in car registration and lower
international oil prices compared to 2008. Total exports fell by 11.9 percent, with
construction and information services accounting for most of the drop in the services balance
while insurance and financial services increased.
18.
Persistent current account deficits point to competitiveness problems while the
reliance on short-term bank-related inflows to finance the deficit is a source of macrofinancial vulnerabilities. While Cyprus’ market share in the export of services has remained
broadly constant, large surpluses in the service sectors have only partially offset persistently
large goods trade deficits. The rapid rise in labor cost has hurt manufacturing production
more than the services sector. Bank related inflows, including non-resident deposits with
resident financial institutions, have been the main source of financing of the current account

2009; after additional sovereign risk scenario it would decrease to 8.3 percent. Finally, all the Greek banks
operating through subsidiaries in Cyprus have passed the stress tests.
6
About one-third of the headline current account deficit can be attributed to temporary and technical factors,
e.g. drought-related water imports, higher reinvested profits (with an FDI counterpart in the financial account),
and a one-time increase in car imports following the reduction in excise tax to EU levels ahead of euro entry.

20
deficit, thus making the external position highly vulnerable to a shift in market sentiment
towards Cyprus.
19.
Although Cyprus real exchange rate appreciation follows the trend in Southern
Europe (Figure 9), it was particularly harmful for the manufacturing exports and also
affected the tourism industry. Wages have outstripped productivity gains in recent years,
leading to an appreciation in the ULC-based real exchange rate and pricing Cypriot goods out
of international markets. However, wage increases reflect to some extent the labor shortages
and low unemployment rates that prevailed before the crisis. Tourism exports are also on a
declining trend, reflecting comparatively high prices, heavy dependence on a weakened
British market and increased competition from other destinations in the Mediterranean.
However, other services sectors, including finance and shipping, continue to be competitive
and profitable.

large current account swing in 2009 (from -17.5 to- 8.3 percent of GDP) suggests that
significant current account adjustments can occur in Cyprus without major changes in the
exchange rate (or slower growth relative to trading partners). Moreover, CGER type analysis
needs to be interpreted with care for services exported-oriented economies, since service
exports may be less responsive to exchange rate dynamics.

E. Outlook and Risks
21.
Modest growth is projected to resume in the second half of 2010. Staff forecasts a
further 0.2 percent contraction of activity in 2010, with below-potential growth returning in
2011. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) projects positive growth to resume in 2010 but the
CBC is less sanguine. The domestic recovery is likely to be driven by the global economic
upturn, private consumption and investment. Domestic demand growth would remain
modest, though, as private balance sheets remain leveraged, leaving little buffer against
future shocks. In particular, while households’ debt servicing capacity remains relatively
adequate, it could rapidly deteriorate if downside risks to growth and the labor market
outlook were to materialize, and at the corporate level a combination of weak profits and
high leverage is a source of vulnerability. As a consequence, demand for foreign goods is
expected to remain subdued.

22.
Inflation is projected to accelerate in 2010 driven by the higher cost of imported
oil and commodity prices, against the backdrop of a still depressed domestic demand.
Despite a widening negative output gap in 2010, harmonized consumer price inflation is
expected to increase to 2.2 percent due to a base effect, the increase in oil and commodity
prices, rising health and education costs. Such factors, along with Cyprus’ high dependency
on imported energy will drive headline inflation higher in Cyprus than the expected level for
the euro area. While the reopening of the inflation differential with the euro area (Figure 4)
will erode the competitiveness of Cyprus, given last year’s near zero inflation and the
backward looking inflation-indexed wage adjustment mechanism, wage inflation should
remain subdued in 2010.

23
23.
Staff forecasts the current account deficit to follow a gradually improving trend
over the medium term after a realignment of more than 9 percent of GDP in 2009.
Although commodity prices will contribute to inflate imports in 2010, import volumes are
projected to decrease due to declining domestic demand while the recovery in foreign
demand will induce a turnaround in exports. If the exchange rate overvaluation persists,
however, a shift from domestic to foreign goods and services, with consequent trade balance
deterioration, cannot be ruled out. Unless market sentiment towards Cyprus were to
deteriorate significantly, bank related short-term capital inflow can be expected to provide
the necessary current account financing based on actual developments in the first quarter of
2010, where Cyprus benefited from increased short-term capital inflows, in particular from
residents of the euro area. However, such a structurally precarious nature of current account
financing reinforces the need for fiscal consolidation, as well as high capital buffers in the
financial sector to anchor foreign investors’ confidence.
24.
Medium-term growth may suffer from deterioration in potential output
following the global crisis, and it is expected to remain sluggish. Subdued private
consumption and investment, in tandem with hesitant foreign demand for Cyprus’ exports,
will weigh on growth. Cyclical conditions are projected to feature negative output gaps until
2015 as growth return to its potential. The latter, however, is likely to have suffered from the
fall in economic activity in 2009, reflecting a decrease in labor contribution and lower capital
stocks as a result of obsolescence and the drop in investment. Unemployment, which climbed
to 5.6 percent in 2009, is expected to rise to 7.8 in 2010 and stay above its historical average
for some time. Fixed investment growth is forecasted to remain in negative territory this year
after plummeting in 2009. Productivity, on the other hand, is unlikely to positively contribute
to potential growth given its pro-cyclical nature and the already low levels of private
investment on R&D in Cyprus due to the small size and service orientation of the economy.
25.
Staff sees downside risks to the outlook on account of five main risk factors.
First, the projected recovery for 2011 is vulnerable to spillovers from Greece due to the high
exposure of the financial sector to Greek assets (about 260 percent of GDP). Second, the
fiscal consolidation that is needed to reverse the structural deterioration will weigh on an
already sluggish domestic demand. On the other hand, if the consolidation measures
proposed by the government were not to materialize, increased levels of public debt in the
current market environment could undermine investors’ confidence about fiscal
sustainability, in turn making it difficult for the government to finance the deficit. Third, a
rebound in the tourism and construction sector (which contributed significantly to growth in
recent years) could fail to materialize if the demand from UK and Russia residents remained
tepid due to a weaker than anticipated recovery in these countries. Fourth, medium- and longterm growth prospects could weaken if the 2009 recession has structurally lowered potential
growth, and Cyprus could be facing years of more subdued potential as well as actual
growth. Finally, public debt levels could increase significantly if the government securities
that have been issued to the banks had to be recorded in the government debt.

24
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
26.
The main policy priorities should be to stabilize public debt at a more prudent
level and boost competitiveness, while safeguarding the stability of the financial sector.
Cyprus entered the crisis in a position of strength, including public debt below 50 percent of
GDP and a positive net international investment position (IIP). But to continue to benefit
from euro area membership and prepare for aging-related spending pressures will require
reversing the recent structural deterioration in public finances, rebalancing the private saving
– investment disparity, and addressing the structural causes of the competitiveness gap.
Strong financial sector oversight and early detection of problems is also needed given the
size of the banking sector in relation to the economy and a weakened outlook for the sector.
Structural reforms are needed to preserve competitiveness and enhance medium-term growth.
A. Adopt a Credible Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation Strategy
27.
Staff believe the authorities’ goal of reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2011 and 3 percent in 2012 is appropriate. This consolidation is needed to
minimize the risk that fiscal financing pressures will emerge, provide more space to guard
against risks to the financial sector, and stabilize debt ratios. Further action will be needed to
put debt ratios on a declining path.


Public debt (56 percent of GDP in 2009) is moderate relative to the Euro area average
(79 percent of GDP), but it has risen sharply over the past two years. Achieving the
fiscal targets would stabilize debt at 63 percent of GDP in 2012. Further consolidation
in future years would be needed to put it on a downward path.



Although public financing pressures do not appear to be an imminent threat, the
growing pressures in Euro area sovereign debt markets and the increased focus of
investors on fiscal imbalances argue for decisive consolidation.



The large size of the financial sector and risks to its balance sheet suggest the
government should maintain fiscal space so that it is positioned to provide support to
banks, if needed.

population ages, and the need to maintain a favorable tax regime to attract investment (Box

wages and salaries and social transfers in the budget, these sectors will need to absorb the
bulk of adjustment. Options that should be pursued include adjustments to the incremental

restraint on other goods and services. Finally,
if expenditure measures are inadequate to close the gap, an increase in the VAT from 15
percent (the lowest in the EU) to 16 percent would contribute some 0.6 percent of GDP.
29.
The authorities recognized the need for additional measures to reach their
targets, but they had not yet formulated a specific strategy. They also were more
optimistic that consolidation could be met through general spending restraint, with less focus
on the public payroll.
B. Enhance Early Detection of Problems in the Financial Sector
30.
The outlook for the financial sector has weakened. There was broad agreement
that commercial banks are exposed to further deterioration of loan portfolios in Cyprus and in
foreign markets. However, stress test results suggest that they have the capacity to absorb
further shocks. Furthermore, information provided by the systemically important commercial
banks indicates that managers have incorporated in their business plans a significant increase
in NPLs and are taking appropriate actions (see paragraph 13) in response to deteriorating
market conditions which should support capacity for credit extension.
31.
Cooperative credit societies may be more at risk than commercial banks. While
they would only be affected by conditions in Cyprus, a combination of weak underwriting
standards as evidenced by high NPLs using a weak definition, lower overall CAR, and
significantly higher NPLs ratios net of provisions suggest that risks for the sector are higher
than for commercial banks.
32.
The authorities are confident that the banks should be in a position to exit ECB
funding smoothly. They indicated that the use of the special government bonds had been
limited to 7 percent of individual banks’ customer deposits. They noted that the special
government scheme was designed to help banks secure cheap ECB funding in the absence of
covered bond legislation at a time when banks in other euro area countries had been able to
use covered bonds to access funding from markets or the ECB. Covered bond legislation is
expected to be passed in late 2010, allowing Cypriot banks to avail themselves from such
funding sources and providing for an exit strategy to unconventional ECB funding.

26
Box 4. Cyprus: Tax Regime
Cyprus’ favorable tax regime, together with an open stance toward foreign investors, is a key
feature of the country’s business model. It has been an important factor behind the transformation
of the economy from an agricultural base in the 1960s, to an industrial base until the mid-1980s, and
a services base economy thereafter, with services accounting for 79.3 percent of GDP in 2009. Key
features of the tax regime are as follows:
 Personal income tax. Cyprus has a personal income tax with a progressive rate structure. The top
rate of personal income tax is low, at 30 percent, and the tax-free threshold for income is high, at
€19,500. Capital gains, dividends, interest income and income from the sale of securities are
exempt from income tax. Dividends and interest are taxed under the Special Contribution for the
Defense of the Republic Law and a capital gain tax is levied on the realized profit from the disposal
of immovable property in the Republic and/or securities.
 Corporate income tax. With a flat corporate tax rate of 10 percent, Cyprus (together with
Bulgaria), has the lowest corporate tax rate in the EU. Seventy percent of undistributed corporate
profits of year t-2 are subject to a 15% tax.
 Defense Contribution. All residents are subject to the Defense Contribution, which is applied with
different rates on dividends, interest and rental payments.
 Value-added tax (VAT). In 2003 the standard VAT rate was raised to the EU minimum of 15
percent for most categories of goods and services. But in 2009 VAT on hotels and restaurants was
reduced from 8 to 5 percent on a temporary basis and in 2010 the reduced rate still applies to hotels
only; to alleviate the negative effects of the crisis on the tourism sector; airport landing fees levied
on airline companies were decreased; and overnight stay fees levied by local authorities cancelled.
VAT rate on certain locally produced labor intensive services was lowered to the reduced rate of
5% on a permanent basis. Under EU rules, Cyprus was due to introduce VAT on residential land
during 2008 but has yet to implement the legislation. Cyprus is also due by 2011 to introduce the
reduced VAT rate on foodstuffs and pharmaceutical that are currently zero rated.
 Social security contributions. Employers’ social security contributions are due for the Social
Security Fund, redundancy fund, central holiday fund and for the Human Resource Development
Fund. Altogether, the employers’ contribution rate amounts to 8.5 percent of gross wages.
Employers must also pay a payroll tax (2 percent of gross wages) to the social cohesion fund,
which is not deductable for corporate income purposes. Employees pay 6.8 percent of their salary
and the self-employed pay 12.6 percent of their notional income. Social security contributions of
employed and self-employed are augmented by a 4.3 percent payment of the state, although total
contributions will rise by 1.3 percent every five years until 2039.
 Other features of the tax regime that have attracted foreign companies include the fact that Cyprus
International Trusts, a type of offshore holding company, are exempt from tax in Cyprus, and there
is no taxation on dividends for non-residents. A special tax regime applies to shipping companies.
 Cyprus also has double taxation agreements with over 40 countries.

33.
The authorities may wish to consider boosting the size of the deposit insurance
facilities in view of the recent increase in coverage. Given the increase in the size of
insured deposits from €20,000 to €100,000 per depositor per bank, and the extension of
coverage to deposits denominated in all currencies and to deposits of non-euro area residents,
the present size of the deposit insurance facilities, €100 million for commercial banks and
€20 for cooperative credit societies, are below a threshold of 1 percent of coverage provided,
which is generally used as a guiding principle. The authorities have indicated that, in case of
need, banks may be requested to pay additional capital, which would raise the size of the
facility to 3 percent of coverage provided. However, the authorities may wish to take steps to
bolster the size of the facility proactively.
34.
Staff and the authorities agreed that preserving the stability of the banking
sector through continued strong supervision and early detection of risks should remain
a top priority. Given the large size of the banking sector relative to the economy if problems
emerged they could escalate to systemic proportions with spillover to the economy and to
public finances. Policies should therefore focus on addressing areas of potential concern
early. The following points were noted:


Ongoing initiatives for cross border cooperation with Greece and other Southeastern
European supervisors should be pursued purposefully. In that context, supervisors
should agree to procedural mechanisms for the coordination of cross-border
resolution actions, including procedures for information sharing and rules to
determine which jurisdiction’s competent authorities would assume a lead role in
resolving a particular cross-border bank.



The draft law facilitating government intervention in case of a financial crisis
submitted to Parliament should be passed as soon as possible; an operational manual
spelling out the process to be followed in a crisis situation should be developed at the
CBC.



Measures to bolster the supervision and transparency of the cooperative credit
societies are needed to help reduce risks and to ensure a level playing field in the
financial sector. That should include aligning the definition of NPLs, and the stress
test and financial reporting frameworks in place for cooperative credit societies with
the regime applied to commercial banks. Ultimately, a single independent supervisor
for all credit institutions operating in Cyprus would help achieve these objectives.
C. Implement Structural Reforms to Boost Competitiveness

35.
The authorities agreed with staff that growth of wages and labor costs in excess
of productivity increases has reduced competitiveness, particularly in the
manufacturing and tourism sectors. They also acknowledged the need to reverse the
steady growth of public sector wages and employment so as to protect the low tax
environment needed to attract investment, and reduce wage pressures in the economy. Staff

28
also noted that wage settings mechanisms ensuring a closer link between wages and
productivity development than currently provided by the COLA system should be promoted.
36.
Staff noted that measures to increase labor market flexibility, streamline the
regulatory framework, reduce red tape and enhance the business climate would bolster
potential growth over the medium term. In particular, improving the functioning of the
labor market through active labor market policies targeted to young workers and low skilled
immigrants would help address the current increase in unemployment and support long-term
growth potential, while measures to reduce the high gender pay gap would contribute to
improve the overall business climate. The authorities’ policy agenda in this regard includes
measures to support employment, raise expenditure in R&D, increase the share of population
having completed tertiary education, and reduce early school leavers. The authorities are also
implementing measures to enhance energy efficiency.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The foremost policy challenge is to reverse the large structural fiscal deficit that
has emerged. Cyprus compares favorably compared to other euro area countries (Box 5), in
particular with relatively moderate public debt levels, but it must act forcefully to preserve
this favorable legacy, protect debt sustainability, and provide more space to guard against
risks to the financial sector. While the official fiscal target of a 3 percent of GDP deficit in
2012 is appropriate, the government needs to confront the hard choices required to realize
this objective so as to stabilize debt ratios, and to build public support for the necessary
measures. Further action will be needed to put debt ratios on a declining path over the
medium term.
38.
Further reforms of the pension system are needed. The 2009 reform was a first
step, but absent more fundamental reforms, the pension system will be a growing strain on
public finances. A lasting solution requires bringing outlays more in line with contributions,
through lower replacement rates and higher retirement age.
39.
The banking sector remains sound for now, but risks have significantly risen.
This calls for continued efforts on the part of the authorities for early detection of problems,
close cooperation with other supervisors, and enhanced contingency planning. The
supervision and transparency of the cooperative credit societies need to be strengthened as a
matter of urgency with a view to put in place a regulatory regime that is consistent with that
for commercial banks. Until this is achieved, it will be difficult to assess the risks to the
economy that the sector generates as well as the actions that may be warranted to mitigate
those risks. Furthermore, ensuring a level playing field in the financial sector would help
contain the potential for unhealthy competition for deposits, contribute to lowering deposits
rates in Cyprus, and reduce the incentives for recourse to ECB liquidity.
40.
Structural reform to preserve competitiveness will support the recovery and
enhance growth potential. A key part of this agenda will be restraining public sector wages

29
and employment. Ensuring real wage flexibility is also essential to deal with the current
exchange rate overvaluation. Improving labor market functioning through active policies will
help address the increase in unemployment.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 5. Cyprus: Comparison with Selected Euro Area Countries

This box compares Cyprus to Euro area averages and other peripheral Euro area (EA)
countries whose sovereign debt markets have come under stress. It concludes that Cyprus
compares favorably on balance across several indicators of vulnerability.

other countries in
the Euro zone. Cyprus GDP growth has averaged 3.2
percent since 2000 against 1.4 percent in the overall EA
and unemployment was at 4.4 percent compared to 8.4
in the EA. Even during the global financial crisis,
Cyprus outperformed its peers: unemployment increased
to 5.4 percent in 2009 from 3.7 in 2008, compared to 9.4
percent in the EA, and the decrease in real GDP was
only 1.7 percent versus 4.1 in the EA.

Despite large current account deficits in
international comparison, Cyprus IIP remains
positive. Cyprus current account has recorded
recurrent deficits over the last decade ─ -6.9 percent
of GDP on average in 2000-08 versus -0.2 in the Euro
zone ─ and it deteriorated significantly (to 17.5
percent of GDP) during the economic boom in 2008,
and narrowed to 8.3 percent when the crisis hit Cyprus
in 2009. While the current account deficit as a percent
of GDP was high in international comparison in 2009
(-0.75 percent of GDP in the Euro zone), Cyprus IIP
was still positive at 4 percent versus significantly
negative IIPs in other EA countries.

Annex 1. Cyprus Pension System 1
Overview of the pension system
1.
The current pension system in Cyprus comprises the following schemes: (i) the General
Social Insurance Scheme; (ii) the Social Pension Scheme; (iii) the Special Allowance to pensioners;
(iv) the Government Employees Pension Scheme; (v) Other Public Sector Employees Pension
Schemes; and (vi) the Voluntary Provident Funds and other similar collective arrangements.
2.
The General Social Insurance Scheme was introduced in 1957 and since 1964 it
imposes mandatory contributions to all individuals gainfully employed in the public and
private sectors, including the self-employed. Following a reform in 1980, the previous flat-rate
contributions and benefits scheme has been replaced by an earnings-related insurance scheme.
Annual contributions are deposited in a Social Security Fund (SSF) and surpluses are invested
almost exclusively in non-tradable government securities which are not part of the public debt.
3.

Key features under the current General Social Insurance Scheme are as follows:



Universal pension benefits at age 65 for men and women. Early retirement is encouraged: full
pension at the age of 63 years is possible when contributions reach a given threshold, bringing
the effective overall retirement age to 63.6 years (57 years in the public sector).



The level of pensions depends on the length of the contribution period and the level of insurable
income. Benefits have two components: a basic and a supplementary pension based on the level
of insurable earnings. The basic pension is indexed yearly to annual increase of the average
insurable earnings; the supplementary is indexed to the CPI.



Contribution rates differ according to categories of employees: 12.6 percent for employed
persons, shared equally between the employer and the employee; 11.6 percent for the selfemployed. In addition, the central government contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of
pensionable earnings2.

Prepared by Valentina Flamini (EUR). The Annex draws on: (i) European Commission (2009), “Pension Schemes
and pension Projections in the EU-27 Member States ─2008-2060” Volume 1─Report. Occasional Papers 56, October
2009; and (ii) Cyprus (2009), “Republic of Cyprus Stability Programme 2009”.
2

The March 2009 pension reform introduced the gradual increase of contributions by 1.3 percentage points (1 percent
equally shared between employee and employer and 0.3 from the Government) every five years beginning in April 2009
until January 2039.

36



Being at an early stage of its maturity, with a small number of pensioners, the system currently
generates a surplus (the size of the SSF was in the order of 40.4 percent of GDP at the end of
2009). However, as the system matures, it will move into deficit and long-term sustainability is
not ensured.

4.
Beside the General Social Insurance Scheme, supplementary schemes provide
additional pension benefits to particular individuals:


The Social Pension Scheme provides pensions to those residents, of 65 years or more, who did
not participate in the labor market and as a consequence have no pension income from the
general Social Insurance Scheme. Social pensions are guaranteed as a percentage of the basic
pensions and, as a consequence, are also indexed to earnings.



A Special Allowance is payable to pensioners whose total pension income from the General
Social Insurance Scheme does not exceed a minimum threshold per year.



Beside the basic Social Insurance pension, public servants and semi-government employees are
entitled to separate pension payments up to 50 percent of the last salary. This system is universal
and fully financed by the employer side.



Provident Funds provide defined contribution lump-sum benefits agreed within the framework
of the free collective bargaining system and financed by joint contributions from employers and
employees. Members usually receive their entitlements at the time of changing of employer.

Pension expenditure projections
5.
Spending is projected to increase significantly over the next 50 years (Figure and
Table 1).3 The largest deterioration is projected to occur from 2030 onwards, with total expenditure

Projections are from the actuarial pension model of the Ministry of Labor and Social Insurance using Ageing Working
Group generally agreed assumptions, as reported by European Commission (2009). No results are presented on
occupational and private pensions due to lack of reliable data.

6.
The increase in pension expenditure is mostly explained by the deterioration in the
dependency ratio, and to a much less extent by an increased coverage ratio (Table 2). The
latter is due to the expected increase in the percentage of females who meet qualifying conditions
for receiving a pension at the age of 63 as a consequence of their greater contribution to the labor
force and longer contribution periods. Out of the 11.4 percentage point increase in total pension
expenditure, 10.8 points are due to the increase dependency ratio, and 1.6 points the coverage ratio.
Offsetting this positive contribution is a negative one due to : (i) a small increase in the employment
rate as a result of the high expected employment growth, particularly for females, in the first
decade; and (ii) a marginal decrease in the benefit ratio, primarily due to the price indexation on
benefits in the longer term ─in the first couple of decades, as the supplementary part of the social
insurance scheme matures, the annual average level of new pensions is expected to increase at a rate
higher than that of productivity.

7.
The increase in employment is mainly due to net immigration flows and the increase in
the female participation, both sizeable over the period. In line with this trend, a similar increase
in the number of contributors will occur. However, the support ratio ─the ratio of the number of

38

contributors over the number of people aged more than 65─
will decline significantly primarily due to the ageing effect.
8.
Reserves of the SSF are projected to turn
negative from 2033 onwards. Accumulating debt
obligations will increase up to 182 percent of GDP by 2060.
On a positive note, however, a factor relevant for the
sustainability of Cyprus’ pension system is the low level of
social security contributions.

9.
Following extensive dialogue with the social partners, in 2009 the government took
measures to strengthen the long-term financial sustainability of the pension system. The
measures aim primarily at increasing revenue through higher contributions and higher investment
returns and, to a lesser extent, at reducing expenditure through stricter eligibility conditions to oldage pension, including: (i) gradual increase of contributions by 1.3 percentage points every five
years beginning in April 2009 until January 2039; (ii) increase of the minimum contribution
requirement from three to ten years of paid contributions; (iii) stricter eligibility conditions to
receive unemployment benefits and old-age lump-sum payments; and (iv) increase of presumptive
incomes of self employed workers in order to be more adjusted to their real incomes.
Under the post-reform scenario, the April 2010 SGP forecasts that the SSF will hold assets
over 10.1 percent of GDP in 2060, compared with liabilities of 182.1 percent under the prereform scenario. Taking into account the adopted parametric reforms, the authorities estimate that
pension spending will still increase considerably over the next 50 years, albeit by around 1
percentage point of GDP less than before the reform. However, revenues will also increase in line
with the phased increase in social security contribution rates: according to the authorities’ estimates,
under the post reform scenario, total annual contributions will increase by 3.5 percent points of
GDP.

Annex II. Cyprus: Statistical Information
(As of July 15, 2010)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA
1995) has complicated the analysis of national accounts and fiscal data. The new national
accounts do not provide information on the disposable income of households, thus hindering
the calculation of the household saving ratio.
Financial sector data: The currency-linked and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are
classified as domestic instead of foreign liabilities.
External debt: The authorities have recently decided to include non-resident deposits in
resident banks in gross external debt.
Other: The Central Bank has started to compile data on property prices and household sector
assets in 2009.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Cyprus subscribed to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on December
1, 2009 and has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Cyprus’ economic database is comprehensive and of generally good quality. Data are
provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see attached table). The authorities
regularly publish a wide range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates
for the main statistical releases. Cyprus is also subject to the statistical requirements and
timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), and
has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). No data ROSC is available.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Cyprus
August 27, 2010
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on August 9, 2010. This information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Real GDP increased in the second quarter of 2010 by 0.4 percent quarter-onquarter. Furthermore, two successive upward revisions of the growth rate for the first quarter
of 2010 have resulted in a real GDP increase for that quarter of 0.3 percent, compared to an
initial estimated decline of 0.2 percent. In view of these developments, we now expect
economic growth in 2010 to be flat instead of slightly negative.
3.
The Authority for the Supervision and Development of Cooperative Credit
Societies has indicated that from December 31, 2010 non-performing loans (NPLs) in
cooperative credit societies will be compiled on the basis of a 90-day delinquency rate
instead of the current 270-day rate, placing it on a par with the definition which applies to
commercial banks. As of end 2009, NPLs in the cooperative credit societies sector on a 90day delinquency rate reached 12 percent, against 8.1 percent on the basis of the 270-day
definition.
4.

Other developments:



The HICP inflation for July 2010 reached 2.7 percent compared to 2.1 percent in June
2010 and -0.8 percent in July 2009.



The unemployment rate increased to 7.3 percent in June 2010 from 7.1 in May.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus
On August 27, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Cyprus.1
Background
Following the economic downturn of 2009 when the global crisis began to affect Cyprus, the
economy is projected to bottom out in 2010, giving way to a mild recovery in 2011 and
stronger growth thereafter. After experiencing average growth of 4¼ percent over 2004-08, the
economy contracted by 1.7 percent in 2009 as trade partners became increasingly affected by
the global slowdown, leading to a sharp contraction of the tourism and construction sectors.
Looking forward, increased unemployment along with decelerating consumer credit and the
negative confidence shock will weigh on private consumption; investment is expected to be
subdued due to continued weakness in the property market and construction sector; and
public consumption will be restrained due to fiscal consolidation. Growth is expected to be flat
in 2010, followed by a modest recovery in 2011 and a gradual acceleration in later years. The
current account deficit, which was cut by more than half in 2009, will likely stabilize in 2010,
and decline gradually toward more sustainable levels over the medium term.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.


The fiscal deficit widened sharply in 2009, mostly reflecting structural factors. In particular,
expenditures rose sharply on the back of higher wages and salaries, social transfers, and
investment spending. These increases were for the most part permanent rather than one-off or
cyclical. Meanwhile revenues fell, reflecting the economic downturn and the unwinding of
exceptional revenues associated with the real estate boom of the preceding years. The
cyclically adjusted primary balance declined by some 6 percentage points in 2009, imparting a
large fiscal stimulus and resulting in a fiscal deficit of 6.1 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Consequently, Cyprus was placed under the Excessive Deficit Procedure of the
European Union, which prompted the government to adopt a program of fiscal consolidation
aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and below 3 percent in 2012.
The government has already taken steps to stabilize the deficit in 2010; additional measures
will be needed to reach the 2011 and 2012 fiscal targets.
The financial sector has continued to weather the impact of challenging regional and global
market conditions relatively well due largely to a traditional business model for banks, which is
based on lending mostly funded by deposits; relatively high banking system capital and
liquidity; and strong supervision by the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC). However, although the
outlook for the sector has weakened somewhat over the past year owing to a deterioration of
loans granted in Cyprus and in foreign markets (particularly Greece), stress tests suggest that
they have the capacity to absorb further shocks. While cooperative credit societies would only
be affected by conditions in Cyprus, a combination of weak underwriting standards and lower
overall levels of capital suggests that risks for that sector are higher than for commercial
banks.
In the absence of a legal framework for covered bonds in Cyprus, the government has
facilitated banks’ and co-operative credit societies’ access to liquidity by issuing government
bonds to them against high-liquidity collateral. Banks and co-operative credit societies have
used these bonds to access funding by the European Central Bank (ECB), in part to lower
their average cost of funds, at a time when deposit rates in Cyprus are higher than the euro
zone average.
Growth of wages and labor costs in excess of productivity increases has eroded
competitiveness particularly in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Furthermore, the steady
growth of public sector wages and employment poses risks for the low tax environment that is
needed to attract investment and generates wage pressures in the economy. These
developments point to the need to promote wage settings mechanisms which link wages to
productivity developments rather than the current inflation-indexed wage adjustment
mechanism, starting with the public sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed signs that the Cypriot economy is beginning to bottom out in 2010, leading
to a modest recovery in 2011. The near-term outlook is still fragile as global financial risks
remain elevated and growth prospects in trading partners muted, while a positive inflation
differential with the euro area has reopened. Returning the economy to its potential growth


depends critically on a credible fiscal consolidation, continued market confidence in the
financial sector, and structural reforms to improve competitiveness and the business climate.
Directors agreed that the immediate policy challenge is to reverse the large structural fiscal
deficit following the sizeable stimulus in 2009, with a view to preserving debt sustainability and
creating fiscal space to guard against financial sector risks. They welcomed the government’s
commitment to reduce the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2012, consistent with its EU
obligations. Noting that this would require more forceful action, Directors encouraged the
authorities to lay out specific measures to achieve their goal. Containing the wage bill and
better targeting social transfers were seen as important elements. More fundamental reforms
of the pension system would also be needed to lessen the burden on public finances, through
lower replacement rates and higher retirement age.
Directors observed that the banking sector remains sound and retains a capacity to absorb
further shocks, as suggested by stress test results, including those conducted in the context of
the EU-wide exercise. However, risks have risen significantly both in Cyprus and in the region.
In light of the relatively large size and external exposure of Cyprus’ financial sector, these risks
call for continued vigilance, close cooperation with foreign supervisors, and an enhanced
framework for crisis management and contingency planning, including for cross-border banks.
Consideration could be given to enlarging the deposit insurance facility. Directors also
highlighted the urgency of strengthening the supervision and transparency of cooperative
credit societies. The recent modification of the definition of nonperforming loans for
cooperative credit societies was a welcome step toward aligning it to the norm in place for
commercial banks. Directors encouraged further progress in creating a level playing field in the
financial sector.
In light of the still large current account deficit, Directors stressed that structural reforms aimed
at boosting competitiveness would be crucial for supporting the recovery and enhancing
growth potential. Key priorities include restraining public sector wages and employment to free
resources for the private sector, and phasing out the wage indexation system to allow wages
to reflect productivity gains. Active labor market policies, aimed particularly at addressing skill
mismatches, should help reduce unemployment.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Age Bakker, Executive Director for Cyprus, and Yoav Friedmann, Senior Advisor to
Executive Director for Cyprus, submitted the following statement:
The Cypriot authorities would like to thank staff for fruitful discussions in Nicosia. The
authorities share many of staff’s views and broadly agree with the staff appraisal.
The hurricane that hit the global economy has only mildly affected Cyprus directly, but its
repercussions for the Cypriot economy are significant and pose substantial challenges to the
Cypriot policy makers. Preserving the pre-crisis potential growth in Cyprus requires a
credible fiscal consolidation and structural reform package, which will maintain the
confidence in the economy and Cyprus’ competitiveness in the global markets. The
authorities are aware of these challenges and are making their best efforts to achieve these
goals within the Cypriot political environment.
The economy of Cyprus depends strongly on its external sector. In the long-run, its success
depends on the ability to maintain competitiveness in the global markets (the supply side),
while in the short-run, Cyprus’ growth depends heavily on economic developments in its
trading partners (the demand side). The recent developments in the EU and other trading
partners leave uncertainty regarding the pace of recovery of the Cypriot economy in the
coming months.
The Ministry of Finance projects positive growth for 2010, while the Central Bank of Cyprus
(CBC), like staff, is less optimistic regarding the growth figure for 2010. For 2011, the
Ministry of Finance growth projection (1.5 percent) and the CBC’s growth projection (1.3
percent) are somewhat lower than staff’s forecast, based on the assumption that some of the
downside risks staff mentions in the report will materialize. That said, the authorities do not
see fiscal consolidation as weighing on growth. Cyprus is a small open economy that
suffered in the last two years a deteriorating structural fiscal balance. Hence, fiscal
consolidation aimed at enhancing growth could have a confidence-boosting effect with a
positive growth outcome even in the short run. There is increased confidence that negative
spillover effects from Greece are now being contained owing importantly to the joint IMF –
EU program concluded with Greece.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are committed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and
below 3 percent by 2012. Cyprus’ track record shows that this goal can be achieved, although
there is no political consensus yet on the necessary measures to achieve this. The authorities
agree with staff that the new fiscal measures, to be spelled out as part of the 2011 budget,
need to add up to around 2¾ percentage points of GDP over the next two years. They expect
that a widespread consensus on the fiscal consolidation path will be reached as part of the
budget approval process in parliament. The authorities plan to include measures on both the
expenditure and revenue sides.
In light of the authorities’ recognition that fiscal consolidation, going forward, is of utmost
importance, and, in order to contain the 2010 fiscal deficit, the government began to restrain
expenditures already at the beginning of 2010. The number of public sector employees was

50
reduced in the first half of 2010 by 500 and is expected to be reduced by another 500
employees by the end of 2010. The government’s goal is to reduce the total public sector
employment by another 1000 employees per year in the following two years. The
implementation of this decision is expected to have a significant effect on the total public
sector wage bill. In addition to the efforts made to contain the total expenditure, the
government imposed excise taxes on fuels at the minimum EU level prescribed by the acquis
as of mid 2010. Stimulus measures that were part of the countercyclical policy in 2009 will
be withdrawn in 2011, in line with the ECOFIN and European Council Decisions.
Results of the government efforts to reduce the deficit in 2010 can already be seen. The fiscal
deficit for 2010 is now projected by the Ministry of Finance to be at most 6 percent of GDP,
lower than the 7 percent projected in the budget under a no policy change scenario. This
mainly reflects the reduction in intermediate consumption, a freeze in general contractual
wages and salaries, a reduction in public sector employment, and a one-off Central Bank
dividend income.
Fiscal consolidation efforts focus also on dealing with the medium to long-term challenges.
One of the important challenges for Cyprus, as for many other countries in Europe and
elsewhere, is to address the issue of population ageing. The authorities realize that the longterm trends may develop a large burden on the fiscal budget, and hence gradual steps to
reduce this burden need to be taken. One such reform is the 2009 reform of the social
security benefit scheme. According to the reform there will be a gradual increase of the
contribution rate over the next 30 years, and an increase in the required years of contribution
in order to become eligible for the old-age pension or the old-age lump-sum. A limit on the
number of education/training credits that can be granted was also imposed. The reform is
estimated to extend the actuarial equilibrium by at least thirty years.
Inflation
Cyprus’ 12-month harmonized consumer price index inflation remains low (2.7 percent in
July 2010), but since November 2009 it has been somewhat higher than in the euro area. The
re-opening of the inflation gap between Cyprus and the euro area in 2010 reflects the
imposition of excise taxes on fuels and increases in electricity prices in Cyprus, and the fact
that economic activity in the euro area remained subdued. Excluding energy, inflation in
Cyprus during the 12 months to July 2010 was 0.1 percentage point lower on average than in
the euro area.
Particularly in view of its importance in affecting competitiveness, inflation is being
monitored closely by the authorities. Even though, as the staff point out, services exports,
which are important for Cyprus, may be less responsive to exchange rate dynamics, recent
developments in the current account deficit underline the need to improve Cyprus’
competitiveness as well as the role of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.
The Financial Sector
Resilience of the Financial Sector
The banking sector is sound and resilient and remained profitable despite the global crisis. As
banks are broadly based on a traditional banking business model, the rise in NPLs was the

51
main channel through which the crisis negatively affected the banks. The Cypriot banks did
not invest in “toxic assets” and, in fact, the confidence in the healthy banking sector and the
deterioration of some economies in the region, have led to a continued growth in nonresident deposits in Cypriot banks. Anticipating the rise in potential losses due to the rise in
NPLs, banks have reduced the share of profits distributed as dividends from around 50
percent before the crisis to about 30 percent in 2009. Stress tests conducted by the CBC, and
in the context of the EU-wide exercise, show that the banks can withstand a significant
increase in NPLs arising from further deterioration in economic activity, including spillover
effects from Greece. Furthermore, CBC conducts, twice a year, stress tests under scenarios
involving withdrawals of a high percentage of both resident and non-resident deposits. It is
also noted that Cypriot banks are not dependent on interbank markets funding.
Sound Banking Supervision
Comfortable capital buffers and a high liquidity position of the banks is a result of internal
practices as well as banking supervision requirements. Cyprus’ large banking sector dictates
a strict banking regulatory framework and a proactive banking supervision to ensure the
banks’ health and resilience to shocks. Three examples of this framework are a) the 20
percent liquidity requirement for all euro customer deposits plus other short term (up to 12
months) euro obligations, in addition to the maximum mismatch ratios for maturity time
bands, up to 7 days and up to 1 month, calculated on a contractual basis; b) the 70 percent
liquidity requirement on foreign currency deposits (these are mainly from non-residents); and
c) strict limits on banks’ open positions in foreign exchange.
The banking supervision closely monitors the banks’ assets and liabilities portfolios and
promptly reacts to changes that raise the banks’ vulnerabilities to shocks. An example of
such prudent response is the imposition of a maximum LTV ratio of 70% for property
financing (80% for the permanent residence) that was triggered by the increase in such
financing by the banks since 2003. Also the banking supervision is currently considering
ways to address the issue of liquidity requirements for non-resident deposits in euro. That
was triggered by the recent sharp increase in these deposits which mainly reflects temporary
weaknesses in the economic situation of neighboring countries but also the use of euro as a
deposit currency by those non-resident depositors that in the past were using exclusively
foreign currencies.
Covered Bond Legislation
The covered bond legislation, which would facilitate in making liquid the illiquid bank
assets, is expected to be passed by the end of the year. In the interim, and in order to enhance
liquidity in the economy, the government issued close to €3.0 billion worth of bonds to the
banks that could be used as collateral for obtaining liquidity via the Eurosystem monetary
operations. The bonds were issued to the banks against a fee and collateral with a haircut,
which depends on the quality of the collateral. The government as well as the CBC see the
risk of having to record the special government bonds as part of the government debt as
negligible, as the risk for the government that the bonds will not be returned is very small due
to the arrangements in place for the valuation and substitution of the assets provided in
exchange for the special government bonds.
FSAP recommendations

52
The authorities have been making many efforts to fulfill the 2008 FSAP recommendations,
and indeed, many key recommendations were achieved. Regarding the recommendation to
unify the banking supervision authorities, the Ministry of Finance agrees that this may have
some advantages on the banking supervision in Cyprus, however, it is of the view that the
consensus in Cyprus is for maintaining the status quo. The CBC, like staff, is of the view
that unifying the banking supervision authorities would significantly strengthen banking
supervision and enhance the financial stability of the banking sector, especially during a time
of financial turmoil. In the current framework, commercial banks are supervised by the Bank
Supervision and Regulation Department at the central bank and the cooperative credit
societies are supervised by the Co-operatives Societies’ Supervision and Development
Authority (CSSDA). The regulation framework is almost fully harmonized, and the CSSDA
is committed to adopting the CBC’s definition of NPLs by the end of this year. The CBC and
the CSSDA closely collaborate and jointly monitor (on-site and off-site) individual cooperative banks. That said, it is noted that the CBC in not empowered to supervise directly
individual cooperative credit institutions and cannot take remedial action against individual
institutions.
Contingency Planning
Contingency planning is crucial in enhancing confidence in the financial sector. To enable a
swift government intervention in case of an insolvent bank, a draft law setting up a
comprehensive framework of such an intervention was prepared and submitted to the
parliament for approval. Establishment of the framework would enable the Cypriot Council
of Ministers, taking into account the opinion of the Governor of the CBC, and with the
approval of the parliament, to implement measures intended to address liquidity or
insolvency problems affecting financial institutions. It is agreed that parliament will examine
such a request by the Council of Ministers in a speedy procedure.
Regarding the staff recommendation to seek written commitments from other regional
supervisors regarding their responsibilities in a crisis, there are extensive provisions in the
EU directives on home / host banking supervision cooperation both in normal and in crisis
situations, and the issue of crisis management arrangements for failing cross border banks in
EU is currently debated. Therefore, at the current stage, the bank supervisory authority is of
the view that it is premature to raise such an issue.
Exposure to Greece
While staff estimates the overall exposure of the banking system to Greece (not including
interbank loans) to be at a high level, we note that a large part of the exposure to Greece cited
relates to Greek subsidiaries and are the result of transactions booked in Cyprus for tax
reasons. These transactions are fully financed by the parent banks and, should a loss arise, it
will be borne by the parent banks (through a set-off against the amount currently due to
them).
