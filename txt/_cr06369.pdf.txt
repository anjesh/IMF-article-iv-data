BELIZE
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Belize
Approved by Christopher Towe and G. Russell Kincaid
October 5, 2006

• Discussions: A staff team comprising Andreas Bauer (Head), Gamal El-Masry, Pelin Berkmen
(all WHD), Yingbin Xiao (ICM), and Axel Palmason (PDR) visited Belize during August 17–30,
2006. The mission met with the Prime Minister and his team of economic advisors, the Cabinet’s
Public Finance Committee, the leader of the opposition, representatives of the private and public
sectors, and labor unions. Mr. J. Fried, Executive Director for Belize, and Ms. Y. Alvarez, Advisor to
the Executive Director, participated in the concluding meeting.
• Recent developments: Fiscal and monetary policies have been considerably tightened, and nonoil GDP growth has continued to decelerate. The current account deficit is expected to narrow in 2006,
reflecting both a moderation in import growth and strong exports of goods and services. However,
despite this progress, there remain substantial fiscal and balance of payments financing gaps in 2007
and beyond. In view of this situation, the authorities announced in early August 2006 their intention to
approach external commercial creditors for debt service relief.
• Main policy recommendations: Staff recommended additional fiscal and monetary policy
tightening in the short term. A return to external and fiscal sustainability will require a sustained
additional adjustment effort and closure of remaining financing gaps, including through a cooperative
debt restructuring. To bolster the credibility of this adjustment and to reduce vulnerabilities, the
authorities should implement supportive structural reforms in the fiscal, monetary, and financial
sector areas.
• Exchange system: The Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at BZ$2=US$1 since
1976. Belize has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and does not maintain
exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices. The central bank has not engaged in selective
sales or rationing of foreign exchange to the private sector since 2004, and there does not appear to be
an unsatisfied foreign exchange demand from commercial banks.
• Statistics: Belize’s statistics are adequate for surveillance, and the country has begun participating
in the Fund’s General Data Disseminations System (GDDS) in September 2006. Progress has been
made in increasing the frequency of data diffusion, but further improvements in data quality, coverage,
and timeliness are still needed.

•

Fund relations: Belize presently has no outstanding use of Fund credit. The authorities are
implementing a home-grown adjustment strategy, in close consultation with Fund staff.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
•

After several years of strong performance, real GDP growth (excluding oil) slowed in
2005 and 2006, while inflation rose moderately, owing mainly to higher fuel prices. The
external current account deficit is projected to narrow to 8½ percent of GDP in 2006,
because of slower import growth, and a strong pick up in tourism and export receipts.

•

The economic slowdown partly reflects the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies
over the past 18 months. Taxes were raised, capital expenditures cut, and monetary
conditions tightened. As a result, the primary balance shifted from a small deficit in
FY04/05 (April to March) to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in FY05/06.

•

Despite this progress in correcting macroeconomic imbalances, the outlook for 2007 and
beyond remains a concern. Scheduled debt service is very high and Belize faces large
fiscal and balance of payments financing gaps next year and beyond. Market financing to
fill the gaps is unlikely to be forthcoming, and bridging them through domestic
adjustment alone does not seem feasible. In these circumstances, the authorities have
approached their commercial external creditors for debt service relief. The authorities
have remained current on their debt obligations, but in mid-September they announced
that payments to two special purpose vehicles, which are part of an issuance of insured
bonds, had not been made.

Staff appraisal
•

Macroeconomic policies should be further tightened in 2006 to both mitigate immediate
vulnerabilities and demonstrate policy commitment, while a sustainable medium-term
framework is formulated and consultations with creditors take place.

•

The medium-term framework would need to include a combination of additional fiscal
effort, continued monetary restraint, bilateral and multilateral financing, and relief from
the envisaged debt operation. The latter is a key element in the government’s plan to put
public finances on a sustainable basis, and the authorities should seek to reach a
cooperative agreement with private creditors.

•

To help sustain the required policy effort over time, supportive structural reforms in the
fiscal and monetary areas should be implemented.

•

Belize’s banking system appears generally robust but further steps should be taken to
strengthen financial sector supervision.

•

Even in the best of circumstances, Belize’s economic and financial situation will remain
highly vulnerable and therefore leaves little room for slippage in the implementation of
the outlined policy framework.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Since independence in 1981, Belize has made important strides, but its present
macroeconomic situation poses significant challenges. Over the past 25 years, the country
has enjoyed strong growth, as well as price and currency stability. Real per capita income has
more than doubled, while social indicators, such as infant mortality and primary school
enrollment, have also made

2.
Belize’s current macroeconomic difficulties are the result of earlier aggressive
efforts to stimulate economic growth. Beginning in 1999, taxes were lowered, public
investment was increased, and cheap credit was provided to the private sector through the
state-owned Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Social Security Board (SSB).
As a result of these measures, the overall deficit of the central government rose from an
average of 3 percent of GDP during 1996–98 to almost 10 percent of GDP during 2000–02.
At the same time, lax monetary policy led to a sharp build-up of excess liquidity in the
banking sector and triggered an acceleration of credit to the private sector.
3.
Growth accelerated sharply in response to the stimulus, but at the expense of a
widening external current account
deficit.

At the same time, the external
current account deficit soared,
exceeding 20 percent of GDP a
year during 2000–03. These
deficits reflected rising resource
gaps in both the private and the
public sectors (Text Figure 1).
More recently, the current
account deficit has narrowed
somewhat, thanks to a tightening
of fiscal and monetary policies.

Concerns about the exchange rate peg and debt sustainability were raised in
earlier Article IV consultations. The government, however, was initially slow to address
the rising fiscal and external disequilibria, but the receptiveness to Fund advice increased
when Belize’s capital market access became impaired. In the second half of 2004, staff was
invited to assist the government in developing a home-grown adjustment strategy
(Text Table 3).

7

Box 1. Governance Problems
The government of Belize has been affected by several major governance scandals which contributed to
the sharp increase in external public debt since 1999. The most egregious cases involved failed privatizations
and questionable financial transactions, including:
•

Lending by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC): The state-owned DFC increased its assets by
about 25 percent of GDP during 1999–2003. However, by 2004 already 40 percent of its assets were either
unproductive or nonperforming, reflecting serious conflicts of interest, and poor corporate management and
oversight. After mounting losses, the government had to refinance and assume directly an estimated
US$210 million (more than 20 percent of GDP) in external guaranteed loans of the DFC. In late 2004, the
authorities announced their intention to wind up the DFC and later replaced its management. Since then,
loan operations have ceased and the balance sheet has been reduced by about US$200 million. The
authorities are currently working with the IDB on a strategy for an orderly liquidation of the remaining
DFC assets.

•

Mortgage securitizations: The DFC and the Social Security Board (SSB) were active in securing loans
against future mortgage receivables, raising about US$150 million in five operations between 1999 and
2002. The most controversial case involved a US$45 million loan from a U.S. bank, which was raised by
the DFC to be in part on-lent via a domestic financial institution to two local companies that had ownership
ties with senior DFC management, and which promptly defaulted on their obligations. The government is
still exposed to contingent liabilities of about US$28 million from this operation, while having already
assumed external liabilities of about US$65 million for the other four mortgage securitization operations.

•

Telecommunications privatization: After the privatization of the national phone company BTL and the
expiration of its monopoly in 2003, the government awarded an exclusive service contract and loan
guarantees to a private telecommunications company (INTELCO), whose founder and owner was the
chairman of the DFC. To enable INTELCO to actually operate, the government re-acquired BTL,
established an interconnection agreement between INTELCO and BTL, and re-sold BTL to a private U.S.
company. However, this company later defaulted on its payments, forcing the government to acquire BTL
for a second time. The government finally sold BTL back to its original owner, albeit at a significant
discount. INTELCO failed, and the government assumed its foreign obligations of US$20 million. Legal
disputes related to the involved transactions are still ongoing.

Two high-profile investigations were initiated in 2005 to shed light on the operations of the SSB and the
DFC, respectively. While the investigation of a Senate commission on the SSB was completed in July 2006,
the work of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the DFC is ongoing. The Report of the Senate
Select Committee Investigating the Social Security Board can be accessed under www.belize.gov.bz. One of the
report’s key recommendations was the removal of the SSB’s Chairman and General Manager, which the
government promptly implemented.

Key IMF Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

y Undertake a comprehensive and sustained fiscal
correction and maintain tight monetary policies to
reestablish a viable external position and avoid a
disorderly exit from the exchange rate peg.

y The authorities were initially slow in addressing the
imbalances. However, in FY05/06 (April to March) the
central government’s overall deficit fell sharply and
monetary policy was tightened.

y Develop and implement expeditiously a medium-term
debt strategy.

y A financial advisor was hired in 2005, and the
authorities decided on a debt strategy, which includes
offering a debt exchange to external private creditors
later this year.

y Close the DFC and put in place a transparent and
orderly mechanism to dispose of its portfolio.

y The DFC has stopped lending and begun to divest
its assets. The authorities are currently working with
the IDB on a strategy for an orderly liquidation of the
remaining DFC assets.

y Strengthen financial sector supervision.

y Resources for bank supervision have been
increased, and credit unions have been brought under
central bank oversight. However, the independence of
bank supervisors remains weak, and there are very
few resources for insurance supervision.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Forceful stabilization policies were implemented in the context of the 2005/06
budget (April to March). The overall deficit of the central government fell sharply from
8.6 percent of GDP in FY04/05 to 3.3 percent of GDP in FY05/06, while the primary balance
shifted from a small deficit to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP. These improvements stemmed
from revenue measures taken in May 2005, as well as from cuts in capital expenditures and
lower debt service costs.1 On July 1, 2006 a general sales tax (GST) was introduced to
replace the existing sales tax, which was applied on goods and services for importers and
domestic producers and suffered from cascading effects and lack of buoyancy.2 The
authorities also tightened liquidity by channeling social security deposits to the central bank
starting in May 2005, and by increasing the cash reserve and liquid asset requirements in
three steps of 1 percentage point each between May 2005 and September 2006 to 10 percent
and 23 percent, respectively. These measures have helped slow the growth rate of credit to

Some 2¾ percent of GDP in exceptional fees and commissions on external loans that were incurred in
FY04/05 were not repeated in FY05/06. The authorities also corrected a number of misclassifications in their
fiscal records, which led to a shift of about ¼ percent of GDP in expenditure items from capital to current
expenditure.

the private sector to about 6 percent during the 12 months ending in July 2006, from
10 percent during the previous 12-month period.
6.
Partly in response to the tighter policy stance, the external current account
deficit is expected to narrow in 2006. The projected improvement is driven by a reduction
in the trade imbalance, as merchandise exports are expected to grow by some 30 percent
while import growth decelerates. Moreover, tourism earnings are buoyant, and the income
account has improved owing to lower commissions and fees from public debt operations.
7.
The remaining balance of payments financing needs for 2006 are likely to be
covered through inflows from foreign direct investment, bilateral financial assistance,
and some further reserves drawdown. Belize continues to attract sizeable foreign direct
investments, particularly in the expanding tourism sector, and bilateral financing at belowmarket terms of US$35 million has been obtained in 2006 from Taiwan Province of China
and Venezuela. Notwithstanding these inflows, the balance of payments is still forecast to
close the year with a deficit of some US$10 million, which would cause gross reserves to fall
below US$50 million, or about three weeks of import coverage by end-year.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on measures to contain the risk of a near-term payments
crisis, and on the development of a framework to accomplish a gradual return to
medium-term sustainability. Staff noted that Belize’s high public debt burden and fragile
balance of payments were a major source of vulnerability and a constraint on growth.
Although considerable progress had already been made in tightening policies, further steps
still seemed necessary to address the immediate risk of a balance of payments crisis. At the
same time, if the adjustment were to be sustainable, a collaborative resolution of the debt
burden facing the country seemed necessary, along with steps to strengthen the authorities’
fiscal and monetary policy implementation capacity and to facilitate strong growth.
9.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the balance of payments outlook for 2007
and beyond remains worrisome and that further measures were needed.
•

A passive scenario, assuming broadly unchanged policies, with a constant primary
surplus of about 3.3 percent of GDP, no new multilateral lending, and the current debt
service profile, shows that Belize’s balance of payments financing needs would
approach 10 percent of GDP in 2007 and average about 6¾ percent of GDP during
2008–11 (Tables 7 and 8). While the trade deficit is projected to remain relatively
contained, with the effect of the withdrawal of EU trade preferences for bananas and
sugar partly offset by a pickup in oil exports, scheduled public debt service

10
obligations are high and rising over time, and would weigh heavily on the overall
balance of payments.3
•

Market financing sufficient to fully bridge the large projected gaps is unlikely to be
forthcoming, given Belize’s already high external public debt burden. Moreover, even
if financing were to be available, at current market terms its cost would worsen the
debt dynamics and exacerbate the economy’s vulnerability to adverse shocks (Table 8
and Appendix VIII).

•

In the authorities’ view, bridging the remaining financing gaps through additional
policy tightening alone would be neither feasible nor advisable. The authorities’ main
concern was that further large domestic adjustment, beyond what had already been
achieved, would precipitate an excessive contraction of the economy and heighten
social tensions.

10.
In light of this difficult financing outlook, the government announced in August
2006 its intention to put the public debt on a sustainable footing through a debt
restructuring based on a cooperative agreement with external commercial creditors.4
In the announcement, the authorities
Text Figure 3. Bond Prices and Standard & Poor's Ratings
also expressed willingness to
recognize and work with a formal
creditors’ committee representing
holders of at least 51 percent of the
affected debt.5 Bond prices slumped
after the authorities’ announcement,
but recovered later to their preannouncement level of about 75–
80 cents to the dollar (Text Figure 3).
The authorities have remained current
on their debt obligations, but in midSeptember they announced that debt

The authorities do not intend to restructure their bilateral, multilateral, and domestic debt. However, as part of
their strategy they are seeking to mobilize additional financing at below-market terms from bilateral and
multilateral creditors. Private external commercial debt amounts to about 50 percent of GDP. For an overview
of the public debt structure see Table 3 and Appendix VII.

However, to date, creditors have not notified the authorities about the formation of such a committee. The
authorities’ communications with creditors are posted on www.centralbank.org.bz.

service payments to two special purpose vehicles, which form part of an issuance of insured
bonds, had not been made.6 The government explained that this action was driven by the
country’s acute liquidity difficulties and the need to conserve the very limited pool of useable
reserves. At the same time, the authorities reiterated their intention to use their best efforts to
continue normal debt service, pending an orderly restructuring of the debt later this year. The
authorities, through their financial advisors, have started a first round of consultations with
individual creditors, and hope to conclude the restructuring by the end of 2006.
A. Addressing Immediate Risks
11.
The mission emphasized the need for the authorities to take further steps in the
short term to contain domestic demand and demonstrate their commitment to sound
policies. Although it seemed unlikely that monetary and fiscal policy tightening alone could
be sufficient to close the balance of payments gaps projected in 2007 and beyond, some
additional effort seemed feasible and would provide important breathing room as
negotiations on the debt restructuring unfolded.

Staff welcomed the September 2006 increase in reserve requirements, but
cautioned that liquidity conditions may have to be tightened further. In particular, staff
expressed concern about some pick-up in excess liquidity and credit growth in the first half
of 2006 (Text Figure 4), and underscored the risks that a liquidity overhang posed to the
exchange rate peg. The team therefore called on the authorities to stand ready to take
additional action if the latest tightening of reserve requirements proved insufficient to mop
up excess liquidity. The authorities

of credit in the near term.

The structures of these two insured bond facilities was such that at inception, the government had to prepay
six months of debt service into reserve accounts. The government’s failure to make the scheduled payments
triggered the use of these reserve accounts to make the scheduled payments to bondholders. To date, ratings
agencies have not taken any action in response to the announcement.

13.
The team also urged the authorities to contain the fiscal deficit in FY06/07 to
below the budgeted level. Recent fiscal developments had been very favorable, as April–
June data showed that the FY06/07 budget target was well in hand, and initial estimates for
revenue collection from the GST suggested that the implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily. The oil sector was also beginning to yield tax revenue, and amendments to the
Business and Income Tax Act that are in the process of being approved by Parliament would
ensure that the government’s take from this sector will be more in line with international
comparators (Box 2). Staff called on the authorities to maintain the budget discipline shown
in the first quarter in order to attain a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP in FY06/07
(½ percent of GDP more than budgeted). This would require saving most of the additional
revenue from oil production, continued restraint in current and capital expenditures, resisting
pressures to dilute the GST base, and a willingness to take corrective measures should tax
yields fall short of projections. The authorities agreed on the desirability of exceeding the
budget target and felt that the proposed fiscal effort was feasible.
B. Medium-Term Framework
14.
The team stressed that even if the more immediate financing needs were met, a
long period of adjustment would still be needed to ensure debt sustainability. Especially
given Belize’s vulnerability to natural disasters and terms-of-trade shocks, the objective
should be to close fiscal and balance of payments financing gaps through 2012, rebuild a
reserve cushion of at least 2½ months of import coverage by 2015, and reduce the debt
burden to below 50 percent of GDP. The implementation of sound macroeconomic policies
under such a framework would set the stage for gradually higher levels of capital inflows and
investment, and more broadly a resumption of sustainable and steady growth.
15.
To illustrate these points, staff elaborated a scenario reflecting the impact of
active policies (Appendix VI and Table 9). Key elements of this framework include:

Box 2. The Oil Sector
After a long history of unsuccessful oil explorations, in 2005 a company owned by Irish and U.S. investors
(BNE) finally made the first commercial oil discovery in western Belize. Light sweet crude oil (comparable
to West-Texas Intermediate) is currently flowing from the field at a rate of about 2,700 barrels per day. The
proven recoverable reserves from this first find of about 10 million barrel—while small by industry standards—
are significant for a country of the size of Belize in terms of value added to the economy, government revenue,
and export earnings:
•

Contribution to growth: At the current rate of production, annual output is estimated to reach about
800,000 barrels in 2006 and about one million barrels in 2007. Thereafter, annual production is expected to
decline at a rate of about 10 percent per year through 2015, and production costs are expected to increase as
the field is depleted. The net contribution of the oil production sector to economic growth is estimated to be
4.3 percent in 2006 and 0.8 percent in 2007. As production declines in the years thereafter, the contribution
to growth will turn negative, ranging from -0.6 percent in 2008 to -0.3 in 2015.

•

Fiscal take: The fiscal regime for the extraction of oil is negotiated individually for each exploration
license on the basis of a production sharing agreement (PSA) that spells out tax and nontax payments. The
PSA with BNE includes an option for the government to acquire an equity share (“working interest”) of
10 percent, which the government has already exercised. The PSA also stipulates a royalty payment of
7.5 percent on BNE’s share of gross

Income Tax Act that are in the process
of being passed by Parliament set a special corporate income tax rate for oil production at 40 percent. These
amendments bring Belize’s otherwise low fiscal take from oil production more in line with international
comparators. Subject to a number of assumptions on price, production levels, exploration costs, and
ongoing investments, staff projects that the government’s total revenue from oil production will peak at just
under 2 percent of GDP in 2008 and gradually fall to ½ percent of GDP by 2015.

•

Export proceeds: Currently almost all of Belize’s crude oil is exported to neighboring countries in Central
America and the Caribbean. In line with expected production, export proceeds are projected to reach their
highest level of 5½ percent of GDP in 2007 and gradually decline to below 2 percent of GDP by 2015. In
terms of net retention, staff assumes that, particularly in the early years, most of BNE’s net profits will be
reinvested in exploration and development in Belize, and only about one-quarter will be transferred abroad
in the form of income repatriation.

•

Other exploration efforts: Geological conditions appear promising in a number of areas, bearing potential
for further oil discoveries in the future. There are currently seven foreign and two local firms undertaking
oil exploration across the country. However most of them are still at an early stage of taking geological
surveys.

14
medium term, an additional adjustment in the non-oil fiscal balance of about
½ percent of GDP would also be needed. Moreover, the quality of the fiscal
adjustment should be strengthened by keeping growth of non-interest current
expenditure, particularly the wage bill, below that of nominal GDP, while allowing
for a modest increase in capital spending for social sectors and infrastructure.
•

Continued monetary restraint: Monetary policy should aim at preserving the
exchange rate peg through controlling domestic demand growth. With broad money
assumed to rise in line with the economy’s expansion, the targeted build-up in net
international reserves would require containing private sector credit growth below the
growth rate of nominal GDP.

•

Mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral support: A credible mediumterm framework could be expected to garner additional support from bilateral and
multilateral lenders. In this context, the authorities are currently working on securing
approval of two policy-based loans of US$25 million each from the IDB and CDB to
be disbursed during 2006–08, as well as additional bilateral financing at belowmarket terms (Appendices III and IV).

16.
While this package would significantly reduce financing needs, remaining fiscal
and balance of payments gaps would still need to be addressed, including in the context
of the debt restructuring operation.

concurred with the thrust of the
staff’s analysis and the medium-term framework. They reiterated their strong
commitment to put the required policies in place that would allow a return to fiscal and
balance of payments sustainability. In their view, the revenue expected from the oil sector
would be used to achieve a further narrowing of the fiscal deficit in the short term, without
adversely affecting economic activity, and they were confident that this adjustment could be

15
largely maintained in the medium term, including as a result of prudent expenditure
management and some gradual improvements in non-oil revenue collection.
18.
Staff stressed that even in a favorable scenario substantial vulnerabilities would
remain for quite some time. In particular, oil-related revenues were uncertain as forecasts
for world prices and Belize’s reserves are subject to wide margins of error, and the team
strongly cautioned against over-optimism. In addition, the debt burden would remain
relatively high and its dynamics vulnerable to shocks, as shown in the staff’s debt
sustainability analysis (Appendix VIII). The mission therefore underscored, and the
authorities acknowledged, the importance of avoiding policy slippage and taking early
corrective actions in response to adverse changes in the domestic and external environments.
C. Supportive Structural Reforms
19.
The large fiscal and monetary effort that is envisaged in the active scenario
needs to be supported by structural reforms. The mission outlined reforms in the fiscal
and monetary areas that would buttress the required macroeconomic discipline, reduce
vulnerabilities, and add credibility to the adjustment plan.
Reforms in the fiscal area
20.
The mission pointed to the need to improve the buoyancy and stability of non-oil
tax revenue, including through modernizing tax administration, broadening the tax base, and
reforming fuel and oil taxation. In particular:
•

The tax administration’s organization should move away from the current “tax type”
model towards a more efficient functional model, in which activities and resources
are consolidated based on business processes and commonality of function, such as
audit, enforcement of tax collections, and taxpayer services. Such reform would
complement the implementation of the GST, and technical assistance from the IMF
and CARTAC for this purpose is already scheduled for later this year.

•

The tax base should be expanded through eliminating business tax holidays under the
Fiscal Incentives Act, terminating discretionary import duty exemptions, and
replacing cumbersome import licensing procedures with tariffs. These reforms would
also improve transparency, by removing some of the most discretionary elements of
the tax system.

•

The current variable revenue replacement duty for fuel imports should be replaced by
a specific excise tax on fuel consumption that would apply for both domestic and
imported fuel, coupled with the introduction of an automatic fuel price adjustment
mechanism to ensure that changes in international oil prices are passed on to the

16
consumer.8 While these changes would not be expected to generate additional
revenue, they would promote greater revenue stability.
The authorities expressed strong commitment toward strengthening tax administration and
recognized the need to bring the tax burden on the consumption of domestically produced oil
in line with that of imports. Given the volatility in oil prices, they also agreed that there was
merit in stabilizing revenue from the taxation of fuels.
21.
Although the proposed revision of the income tax regime for oil companies will
bring revenue from this sector closer to international standards, the fiscal regime for
the petroleum sector could be strengthened further. The mission advised the authorities to
consider changes to the standard production sharing agreement in order to increase its
progressivity.9 The authorities agreed, and explained that they were studying possible
instruments to achieve higher progressivity, such as a resource rent tax and others. In
addition, the authorities noted that they were considering the establishment of a petroleum
revenue fund. Staff agreed that a petroleum fund could be a useful device for accounting
transparently for oil-related revenues, but emphasized that the design of any such
arrangement should protect the integrity of the budget as the sole mechanism to allocate
public expenditure. More generally, any such fund should serve to facilitate rather than defer
the needed fiscal adjustment.
22.
On the expenditure side, staff cautioned that the noncontributory pension plan
for public officers (PPO) was creating large contingent liabilities and required urgent
reform (Box 3). PPO expenses have been increasing at an average annual rate of 15 percent
in the last six years, reaching

For a discussion of the current revenue replacement duty see IMF Country Report No. 05/352.

Under the current standard production sharing agreement, government revenue rises less than proportionally
with the profitability of oil production. This is neither desirable from a fiscal perspective, nor from the
standpoint of encouraging oil exploration.

17

Box 3. Belize’s Social Security System
Belize has two public pension schemes, one that is part of the general Social Security System (SSS) and a
pension plan for public officers (PPO).
The SSS is a contributory partially funded defined benefit scheme that is based on a scaled premium
system of finance (i.e., contributions are adjusted over time to ensure that expected premium and investment
income do not fall short of the cost of benefits and administration). It provides retirement pensions from age
60 for those with contributions of at least 10 years, up to a maximum of 60 percent of the highest three years of
earnings in the last 15 years. As of end-2005, the SSS had accumulated reserves of about US$150 million and
the most recent actuarial report (from 2002) indicated that the current financing bases of the scheme could be
maintained for several years. However, contributions and other parameters of the system, such as income
ceilings and possibly the retirement age, will need to be adjusted over time, if financial equilibrium is to be
maintained.
The PPO is an unfunded, noncontributory defined benefit scheme. It provides retirement pensions from age
55 for public officers with at least 10 years of service up to a maximum of 67 percent of the average earnings in
the last three years of service. Because the PPO is additional to the SSS, public officers may obtain combined
replacement rates of more than 100 percent of their average salary. Pension benefits are not indexed but
adjusted on an ad-hoc basis by the government. Between 1991 and 2005 the average compounded rate of
pension adjustment has been 4.4 percent per year.
The PPO harbors major liabilities for the government. Because of its non-contributory nature, all expenses
are covered from the central government budget. PPO expenses have been growing at an average annual rate of
15 percent in the last six years, reaching 1.8 percent of GDP (or 15 percent of total personnel expenditures and
8 percent of total tax revenue) in FY 2005/06. According to the most recent actuarial evaluation (of July 2004),
the present value of obligations from pensions already being paid was about 11 percent of GDP. The projected
total benefit obligations, which include future obligations for the currently active staff, were estimated at more
than 20 percent of GDP. If the system was to remain in place as is, these actuarial liabilities would rise fourfold
within 25 years, while pension expenses in the budget would increase to more than 9 percent of GDP.
Urgent reforms are needed to limit the accrual of additional government liabilities from the PPO. Ideally,
the PPO should be phased-out for new entrants, who would in the future be covered solely by the SSS. This
would avoid situations of exceedingly high income replacement ratios. If the replacement rates offered by the
SSS were deemed insufficient for attracting qualified personnel, the government could consider the introduction
of a complementary defined contribution scheme, as is in use by a number of other public entities in Belize,
including the central bank. In addition, the government should explore the feasibility of parametric adjustments
to the PPO. Measures that would have a more immediate financial impact include the introduction of
contribution payments and the establishment of a ceiling on combined PPO and SSS benefits. Other possible
adjustments that would likely reduce costs in the long run include increasing the minimum service period and
retirement age, and lowering the rate of pension accrual for each year of service.

18
consensus and would therefore be a challenging undertaking. Taking note, the staff
encouraged the authorities to initiate a public debate as a first step in a longer reform process.
The team also suggested that transition mechanisms could play a useful role in overcoming
resistance to reform.
23.
The mission stressed the importance of strengthening governance in quasi-fiscal
institutions to control contingent liabilities. It welcomed progress in this area, such as the
reform of the Finance and Audit Act, and the formal inquiries into the dealings of the SSB
and DFC. The priorities should now be to improve risk management practices at the SSB,
including prohibiting direct (first tier) lending and other quasi-fiscal activities; maintaining
close control over the financial performance of the recently renationalized water company;
and winding up the activities of the DFC.10 In this context, staff stressed the importance of
letting the DFC recover its loan portfolio without interference, and advised against granting
any further across-the-board discounts to borrowers.
24.
Staff also pointed to benefits that could be reaped from strengthening assetliability management. Weak debt management practices in the past—which have
manifested themselves in high financing costs, bunching of maturities, and currency risk—
have contributed to Belize’s debt problems. Therefore, the mission recommended that the
authorities establish a debt management office; clearly define the objectives of the office and
delineate the roles of its managers; establish an investors relations program; build over time a
portfolio and a risk management framework to balance the trade-off between costs and risks;
and develop transparent asset-liability management policies.11 Because of the limited
available resources, capacity building and technical assistance will be important, including
from the Fund.
Reforms in the monetary area
25.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to strengthen the central bank’s
capability for monetary policy implementation. Currently, the principal instruments of
monetary policy are the cash reserve and liquid asset requirements. More market-oriented
instruments would facilitate liquidity management, while improving the allocative efficiency
of the banking system. The team encouraged the authorities to consider introducing a
standing liquidity deposit window or a mechanism to auction either central bank or treasury
securities, and the authorities requested further technical assistance on these instruments.

10

The authorities are discussing with the IDB a strategy on dealing with the DFC, which would be part of the
conditionality of a program-based loan.

11

Chapter II of the companion Selected Issues paper discusses these proposals in more detail.

19
26.
Staff also suggested that the authorities either eliminate or at least sharply
reduce in due course the government’s overdraft facility at the central bank. This would
increase the central bank’s control over monetary policy, improve its independence, and
could strengthen its balance sheet, provided that the government retires the remaining
overdraft balance with marketable securities.
Sequencing of reforms
27.
The authorities generally agreed with the mission’s recommendations, but
cautioned that the country’s administrative capacity was limited and explained that
implementation would therefore need to proceed in a sequenced manner. Staff suggested
focusing initially on the areas of tax policy and monetary instruments, where measures could
be implemented fairly easily, while the modernization of tax administration, pension reform
and the strengthening of debt management practices was likely to take somewhat longer to
implement.
D. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
28.
Indicators-based analysis and sensitivity tests performed by staff suggest that
the domestic banking system is generally sound, and relatively robust to various shocks.
These included the direct impact of a public debt restructuring, since exposure of the
domestic banks to the sovereign is small, and banks do not hold any external debt
instruments that are potentially subject to restructuring. Moreover, stress tests reveal that
high levels of bank capital provide a significant buffer against simulated shocks, such as
sharp tightening of monetary policy, a sudden deterioration in the quality of loans, or even a
devaluation.12

However, staff noted that
loan-loss provisions were low by
international standards and should
be raised to provide a more realistic
picture of capital adequacy
(Text Figure 8). To address this
deficiency, the mission proposed
establishing a minimum provision of
20 percent for substandard loans, as
well as setting clear rules for the
valuation of loan collateral.13 The

The provisioning requirements for doubtful and loss loans, which are 50 percent and 100 percent respectively,

20
current levels of capitalization should allow banks to adjust to these changes fairly easily.14
The authorities indicated that they would promptly tighten the standards for loan-loss
provisioning, as suggested by staff.
30.
Staff welcomed the progress that had been made in strengthening bank
supervision, but noted that further steps were necessary to foster a sound and resilient
financial sector. Several recommendations of the IMF’s 2003 Module 2 Offshore Financial
Center Assessment have been implemented, such as substantially enhancing the resources of
the Financial Sector Supervision Department at the central bank.15 However, the authorities
still needed to further strengthen the operational independence of bank supervisors. Given
Belize’s vulnerability to natural disasters, the mission noted that a well-supervised property
and business insurance sector was critical, including to avoid financial spillovers to the
banking sector, and an increase in the resources for insurance supervision was urgently
needed. The authorities appreciated the staff’s assessment and noted that they were
committed to implement the still outstanding recommendations of the OFC assessment,
including through amendments of the Bank and Financial Intermediation Act and the
Insurance Act, which are currently in preparation.

The authorities’ commitment to maintain the currency peg requires strict policy
discipline. Overall, backward-looking analysis does not point to the existence of a major

21
expectations and inflation, especially given the country’s small size and limited integration
into international financial markets, and the fact that the United States is Belize’s major
trading partner and tourist market. Nonetheless, preserving the currency peg will necessitate
the early adoption of a sustainable medium-term macroeconomic framework.
F. Possible Fund Support
32.
The authorities remain committed to continue implementing a home-grown
adjustment strategy without a formal Fund arrangement. Although the authorities
recognized that a Fund-supported program would enhance the credibility of their reform
efforts and could catalyze additional lending from bilateral and multilateral donors, they
noted that their economic program had started to show tangible results in stabilizing the
economic situation, and that its country-owned nature was important for regaining policy
credibility and garnering domestic support. Therefore, the authorities’ preference was to
continue consulting closely with Fund staff and management, and to take advantage of Fund
technical assistance in areas that are critical to their program, such as tax policy, tax
administration, monetary policy, banking supervision, and economic data systems.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Belize’s economy has reached a critical juncture. Overly expansionary
macroeconomic policies during 1999–2004 contributed to a dramatic widening of current
account deficits, an unsustainable build-up of public debt, and the erosion of international
reserves. With large fiscal and balance of payments gaps projected to emerge from 2007
onward, there remains the need for policy action to address the still significant risk of
financial and currency crises.
34.
The authorities have already made commendable strides in correcting
macroeconomic imbalances. The 2005/06 budget has achieved a significant fiscal
correction, based on measures to increase tax collection, rein in discretionary current
expenditure, and cut capital expenditure. Monetary conditions were also tightened through
increases in the cash reserves and liquid assets requirements, which helped to slow private
credit growth in 2005.
35.
However, these efforts alone are not sufficient to bring the public finances and
the balance of payments back on a sustainable path. Assuming unchanged levels of fiscal
effort, large fiscal and external financing gaps are likely to emerge in 2007 and beyond,
mainly reflecting debt service obligations that are coming due in the period ahead. Closing
such large financing gaps in an orderly way through further macroeconomic tightening alone
does not appear feasible, and market financing of the required magnitudes is both unlikely to
become available and would increase the debt service burden further.

22
36.
Encouragingly, the authorities have recognized the sustainability problem facing
the country and are determined to address it. In this context, they have taken the difficult
step to approach their private external creditors for debt relief and are seeking to mobilize
multilateral and bilateral support, as part of a joint effort to bring Belize back on a path of
sustainability, safeguard the currency peg, and create conditions for durable economic
growth. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to reach a cooperative agreement with
private external creditors and notes that a sound strategy to achieve the outlined goals should
seek to eliminate fiscal and balance of payments gaps through 2012, while allowing only
modest gaps to prevail thereafter; reduce the public debt burden to less than 50 percent by
2015; and replenish international reserves coverage to about 2½ months of imports.
37.
Macroeconomic policies should be further tightened in 2006 to mitigate
immediate vulnerabilities and to demonstrate policy commitment. Staff welcomes the
recent increase in reserve requirements, but the authorities must be prepared to take
additional action if this proves insufficient to curb excess liquidity and contain private sector
credit growth. In the fiscal area, staff urges the authorities to continue to outperform the
budget target during the remainder of the fiscal year, in order to achieve a primary surplus of
at least 3½ percent of GDP. For this, restraint in current and capital expenditure will be
important, as will continued resistance to pressures to dilute the GST base.
38.
A sustainable medium-term framework could build upon a combination of
additional fiscal effort, continued monetary restraint, bilateral and multilateral
financing, and relief from the envisaged debt operation. The authorities should increase
the primary surplus by about 1 percent of GDP annually. This effort appears feasible and
would be achieved initially by saving the bulk of the projected oil revenues, and
subsequently by improvements in non-oil tax revenue collection and current expenditure
restraint, as oil revenue tapers off. Monetary policy will need to be firm to continue to anchor
the exchange rate peg, especially by keeping the growth rate of private sector credit below
the expansion of nominal GDP. Moreover, support from bilateral, multilateral and private
creditors will be key. The authorities should therefore seek to expeditiously reach a
cooperative agreement with private creditors on a restructuring of their debt, and secure
additional financing commitments from bilateral and multilateral lenders, as far as possible

To help sustain the needed fiscal effort and monetary discipline over time, a set
of supportive structural reforms should be implemented. In the fiscal area, these would
include modernizing tax administration, broadening the tax base by eliminating exemptions
and converting import licenses into tariffs, and reforming oil and fuel taxation. At the same
time, the pension system for public officers should be reformed to cap spending increases,
while the governance of quasi-fiscal institutions is strengthened, and an office for assetliability management and investor relations established. In the monetary area, the central
bank’s policy instruments should be broadened. Although administrative capacity limits may

23
mean that structural reforms will have to be carefully sequenced, early actions could be taken
in the areas of tax policy and monetary instruments.
40.
Belize’s banking system appears generally robust to a variety of shocks, but
loan-loss provisioning requirements and valuation rules for loan collateral should be
brought to international standards. While progress has been made in strengthening
financial sector supervision, further steps are needed to fully implement the
recommendations of the Offshore Financial Center assessment, particularly in the area of
insurance.
41.
The authorities are strongly committed to the fixed exchange rate regime, and
the value of the Belize dollar appears broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals.
The currency peg has served the country well and enjoys wide popular support, having
provided a helpful anchor for prices and expectations. However, safeguarding the peg will
ultimately depend on the durable implementation of a sustainable medium-term
macroeconomic framework.
42.
Even in the best of circumstances, Belize’s economic and financial situation will
remain highly vulnerable for quite some time, thus allowing little room for slippage in
implementing the outlined policy framework. International reserves are projected to
remain low and the debt burden high for several years, leaving the country exposed to
adverse shocks. In addition, revenue estimates from oil are subject to a wide margin of error,
and there is the risk that oil revenue dependency will develop. Therefore, it will be critical
that policymakers manage these risks carefully and adjust early to any changes in the
domestic and external environment.
43.
Staff welcomes Belize’s participation in the GDDS and encourages the
authorities to continue to strengthen the quality and timeliness of the country’s
economic statistics.
44.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ The total debt stock covers the central government and quasi-fiscal entities. The quasi-fiscal entities (other than the DFC) are assumed to roll over external debt
and cover interest payments from their own resources, while the central government will assume one-third of the DFC's external amortization payments.
2/ Includes assets recovery from the Development Finance Corporation.
3/ September 2006 World Economic Outlook assumptions.

Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at
the rate of BZ$2 per U.S. dollar. Belize does not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple
currency practices. The central bank has not engaged in selective sales or rationing of foreign
exchange to the private sector since 2004, and there does not appear to be an unsatisfied
foreign exchange demand from commercial banks.

X. Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 19,
2005; the relevant documents were published as IMF Country Report Nos. 05/352 and
05/353. Belize is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
XI. Recent Technical Assistance
In recent years, Belize has benefited from technical assistance in the areas of tax policy, tax
administration, economic statistics, bank supervision and macroeconomic programming, both
from IMF headquarters and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center
(CARTAC).
•

In January 2002 and July 2006, CARTAC experts visited Belize to advise the Central
Statistical Office on improving National Income Accounting.

•

During early 2004–June 2005, a long-term consultant from IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Systems Department (MFD) assisted the Central Bank of Belize in banking
supervision.

•

In March 2005, a joint mission from the IMF’s Legal Department and MFD visited
Belize to advise the authorities on strengthening their regime to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).

•

In October 2005, a mission from the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) visited Belize to
assist the central bank in strengthening monetary and financial statistics.

•

During 2005 and 2006, CARTAC provided extensive assistance through frequent expert
visits to help design and implement a General Sales Tax.

•

During 2006, experts from CARTAC conducted macroeconomic programming
workshops in Belize.

Further IMF technical assistance is planned in 2006 and early 2007. CARTAC experts will
continue to assist the authorities in the post-implementation period of the GST, while a
headquarters-based mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department is expected to provide
assistance in strengthening tax administration. A multisector mission on economic statistics
from STA is scheduled for early 2007, and the authorities have requested assistance from the
Monetary and Capital Markets Department in developing monetary policy instruments.

III. Economic and Sector Work
The 2004–08 IDB-Country Strategy with Belize, approved in September 2004, aims at
assisting the country in its transition towards private sector-led growth. Accordingly, the
Bank’s strategy focuses on the major objective of “supporting private sector-led growth”.
This is done by financing interventions oriented to (i) improving the public sector’s
institutional capacity to foster an enabling environment for private sector development; and
(ii) supporting private sector capacity-building and specific initiatives. Sustainable economic
growth and poverty reduction are considered the overarching goals of the Strategy.
From 1998 to 2001, the Bank approved seven operations for a total of US$84.1 million. No
loans have been approved since 2001 due to the unsustainable level of Belize’s external debt.
The Bank’s 2006 pipeline has a $25 million Policy-based Loan to support macroeconomic
and public financial sector reforms. In the absence of lending operations, the Bank has been
active in supporting Belize through Technical Cooperation (TC) projects. Targeting the areas
of particular concern in Belize, the Bank approved two TC operations in 2006 to strengthen
the national response to HIV/AIDS and to strengthen the Government’s capacity to combat
human trafficking. The pipeline for 2006 has a project for strengthening results-based
management in the public sector under the Bank’s PRODEV initiative that aims to improve
the quality of public investment. In addition, the pipeline of the Multilateral Investment Fund
(MIF) has a project for developing a mentoring model for young people interested in
becoming entrepreneurs.

40
The Bank’s nonfinancial products include a Financial Intermediation Study that explores the
options for an alternative mechanism for development financing, as part of the dissolution
process for the Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The Bank has also finalized Belize
Fiscal Study and Public Expenditure Review with recommendations on public finance
reforms. Finally, the Bank is contracting with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to develop
competitiveness indicators for Belize.

III. Economic and Sector Work
Much of the CDB’s country and sector work in Belize since 2003 has focused on helping the
authorities to address significant macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances, and sustainability
issues in the operations of the Development Finance Corporation. This has resulted in a
slower rate of loan approvals. A private sector loan to Belcogen was approved in 2005 and
appraisal work is currently ongoing on another private sector agriculture project.
Consideration of a request for loan funding for a public sector road infrastructure project
proposals has been delayed in light of the current macro-economic situation. Activity levels
on CDB’s main direct poverty reduction program, the Basic Needs Trust Fund, has been
maintained.
The Belize authorities have been making significant effort to address the difficult fiscal and
debt consequences that have resulted from the expansionary policies of recent years.
Currently, the CDB is preparing a Country Strategy Paper for Belize. One of the
interventions likely over the short term is a Policy-based Loan to assist Belize in making the
necessary adjustments to correct macro-economic imbalances.

42

Appendix V. Belize––Statistical Issues
In general, the coverage and timeliness of statistical information permit adequate monitoring
of economic developments. However, there are shortcomings in national accounts, prices,
external trade and debt, government finance, and labor statistics. The Central Bank of Belize
publishes, in irregular intervals, a quarterly bulletin covering developments in the real,
fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as an annual report and a statistical digest. In
September 2006, Belize began participating in IMF’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS).
Real sector
National accounts at constant and current prices are produced on a quarterly and annual
basis. The base year for the compilation of national accounts has moved from 1984 to 2000,
with consequent quality improvement of estimates at constant and current prices. Economic
transactions arising from the recent discovery of oil should be properly reflected in the
national accounts and other economic statistics, since they may be substantial. The CPI
market basket is based on a household expenditure survey conducted from June 1990 through
March 1991 and needs to be updated. Also, the CPI is calculated only four times a year
(February, May, August, and November), with a lag of about three months. Labor market
statistics are scant and available at irregular intervals.
Fiscal accounts
Classification of expenditure into current and capital does not conform to international
standards. Reporting annual data according to the methodology outlines in the GFSM 2001
for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and for sub-annual data for the International
Financial Statistics is highly recommended. The most recently reported annual data were for
1997.
Monetary accounts
The authorities submit monetary statistics based on standardized report forms to STA on a
regular and timely basis. However, the coverage of monetary data is incomplete, as data on
depository corporations include only the accounts of the central bank and commercial banks
and do not include credit unions. Data for other financial corporations are not reported.
Balance of payments
The compilation of the balance of payments is based on the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). Belize completed the transition to the BPM5 in 2004. In addition,
the authorities are refining the process for collecting relevant data that will enable the
presentation of quarterly balance of payments statistics. As for the coverage, currentness and
reporting of data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY), Belize has reported annual data, albeit
with a considerable lag. Belize does not compile International Investment Position (IIP)
statistics.

43
External debt
There are discrepancies between the data reported by the central bank and those reported by
the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross external disbursements of the
central government. In addition, the data reported by the central bank and the ministry of
finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are incomplete and inconsistent with the
information provided by the public enterprises. The authorities are seeking to reduce the
discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater cooperation among the agencies
involved.
Development Finance Corporation
The accounts of the DFC, which is a major instrument of the government’s economic policy,
are not well integrated into monetary or fiscal accounts.

Appendix VI. Medium-Term Scenario Assumptions
1.
This Appendix describes the main assumptions that are embodied in the staff’s
medium-term scenarios.
A. Medium-Term Scenario Assumptions
2.
For the analysis of the medium-term prospects of Belize’s economy, staff
simulated two scenarios. A first passive scenario was predicated upon the broad
continuation of current policies. The outcome of this scenario was contrasted with a second
(active) scenario based on significant additional policy adjustment, additional support from
bilateral and multilateral lenders, and the closure of remaining financing needs, including
through a restructuring of the commercial external debt.
3.
A number of assumptions are common to both scenarios. These include, most
importantly, the assumptions about the production and fiscal revenue from oil, as laid out in
Box 2 of the main text and based on oil prices as reflected in the September 2006 World
Economic Outlook (WEO). In addition, the price assumptions (consumer prices and GDP
deflator) are common and predicated to fulfill the purchasing power parity conditions in the
medium term under the fixed exchange rate regime.
Main assumptions under the passive scenario
4.
In broad terms, the passive scenario is thought to replicate a “muddle-through”
situation, in which policies remain essentially unchanged, and financing gaps are filled
through borrowing on market terms. Because this scenario implies a high degree of
uncertainty about the country’s external and fiscal sustainability, investment levels are
expected to be depressed and thus put a relatively low ceiling on growth.
•

Real GDP growth: Gross fixed investment is projected to decline to 14 percent in the
longer run, constraining the underlying real GDP growth rate to a modest 3 percent. This
underlying growth rate is adjusted for the expected impacts of cyclical factors, preference
erosion for sugar and bananas, and expected oil production (see Box below).

•

Fiscal policy: The passive scenario is based on an unchanged primary surplus effort of
about 3.3 percent of GDP. No significant fiscal adjustment will be undertaken beyond
FY 2006/07, and it is assumed that the introduction of the general sales tax (GST) on
July 1, 2006 will have a slightly negative impact on tax collection. In addition, the
constant primary surplus assumption implies that revenue from oil is not saved but used
to raise current expenditures.

46
•

Reserves accumulation: The passive scenario does not foresee any room to accumulate
reserves beyond a very modest level of US$10 million per year. As a consequence, the
reserves coverage of imports will remain very low throughout the projection period at
less than 1½ months of imports.

Main assumptions under the active scenario
5.
The staff’s active scenario is predicated upon a strong policy response by the
authorities, support from both bilateral and multilateral lenders, and closure of
remaining financing needs, including through a successful debt exchange. The absence
of uncertainty about fiscal and external sustainability is expected to foster confidence and
catalyze a recovery of private investment, including from abroad. The increased investment
flows are assumed to mainly benefit the tourism sector and, to a lesser extent, the nontraditional export sectors. Their effect in the short term will be to raise imports, while over
the longer term a higher rate of growth of goods and services exports is expected.
•

Real GDP growth: Higher gross fixed investment of about 17 percent of GDP in the
medium term is expected to raise the underlying real GDP growth rate to 4.2 percent.

•

Fiscal policy: The active scenario foresees an additional primary surplus effort over the medium
term, with some frontloading during 2007–09, to demonstrate commitment and reduce
immediate vulnerabilities. The primary effort declines slightly in the outer years as the additional
revenue from oil tapers off and is only partially substituted through additional non-oil tax
revenue and a decline in current expenditure. In FY 2006/07, additional expenditures for
exceptional interest fees and charges of about 0.5 percent of GDP are assumed to cover the costs
of the debt exchange.

•

Reserves accumulation: The active scenario targets a more ambitious recovery of gross
international reserves to about 2.5 months of imports by 2015. This is achieved through an
annual accumulation of reserves to the tune of US$25 million.

47

Box. Growth Prospects for Belize
Belize’s growth prospects depend to a large extent on the level of investment that the country will be able
to sustain in the medium and longer term. While growth has historically been strong, this performance rested
on very high levels of public sector investment, which over the past 15 years averaged 12½ percent of GDP (see
Table below).1 Because of relatively modest and declining public savings, these levels of investment proved
unsustainable and are therefore unlikely to be

in the longer term as a consequence of lower
private investment, while public investment would stabilize at about 4 percent of GDP. With estimated TFP
growth of 0.7 percent (around the average experienced in 1991–2005), this would allow Belize to grow at a real
rate of about 3 percent in the medium term. In the active scenario, the return to a sustainable position through
the restructuring of the foreign commercial debt and sound macroeconomic policies is expected to foster
confidence and catalyze a recovery of private investment, including FDI, to bring gross fixed investment to a
level of 17 percent of GDP. With somewhat higher

2 percent in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and the
impact of eroding trade preferences is assumed to depress growth by another ¼ percentage point over the next
four years. However, in the short term, these effects will be more than offset during 2006 and 07 by the impact
of oil production. In the outer years, oil production is set to decline and will push real GDP growth somewhat
below the estimated underlying trend rate.

The past level of public investment in Belize is somewhat overestimated because of a misclassification of current
expenditure as capital outlays.

Appendix VII. The Structure of Public Debt
1.
As of June 30, 2006, Belize’s public and publicly guaranteed debt stood at
US$1,088 million (93.5 percent of GDP). The main structural characteristics of this debt are
as follows:
•

The overwhelming majority of the public and publicly guaranteed debt is owed to
external creditors and denominated in foreign currency (Appendix VII. Figure 1).
As of June 2006, external creditors held over 90 percent of total debt (86 percent of
GDP). All external debt is foreign currency denominated and unhedged. The small
amount of domestic public debt consists mainly of loans and treasury bills and notes held
by banks. The marginal relevance of domestic debt reflects the underdevelopment of
Belize’s domestic financial markets.

•

Commercial creditors hold more than 60 percent of the external public debt
(Appendix VII. Figure 1). The remainder of the external debt is held by multilateral
creditors (23 percent), mainly CDB and IADB; bilateral creditors (16 percent), mainly
Taiwan Province of China; and export credit (1 percent).

Domestic Debt 8 %

Export Credit 1%
Bilateral 16%

Commercial 60%

Multilateral 23%
External Debt 92%

•

About 80 percent of the external debt to private creditors is made up by 5 large and
relatively recent bond and note issuances. These include two global bonds maturing in

49
2012 and 2015, for US$125 million and US$100 million, respectively; a US$76 million
10-year note due in 2014 but containing a put option that is exercisable starting from
October 2007; and two insured notes maturing in 2010 and 2015, in the amounts of
US$71 million and US$65 million at issuance, respectively. The remainder consists of
smaller bank loans and residual amounts of mostly older external bond and note
issuances.
•

The average interest rate charged by commercial creditors is substantially higher
than that charged by bilateral and multilateral creditors. The wide difference reflects
concessional terms from official creditors and to some extent, the market perception of
credit risks. The average interest rate of the commercial debt, however, is an
underestimated cost indicator of the government financing because of several explicit or
implicit credit-enhancement features (see below).

•

Several of the private commercial debt instruments include credit enhancement
features. These include:
(i) Embedded put options. When the DFC failed to service a loan from Royal Merchant
Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RMBTT), the government assumed the liability as part of
its guarantee agreement and refinanced it in 2004 by issuing a US$76 million note. The
note was scheduled to mature in 2014, but included a put option that can be exercised
starting in October 2007.
(ii) Guarantees and/or collateral. Examples of guaranteed debt include a US$6 million
loan to the Belize Airport Authority and a US$24 million loan by the Belize Port
Authority. Bonds issued by the DFC’s subsidiary Belize Mortgage Company (BMC)
under the so-called “North American Securitization” program, with a remaining balance
of US$31 million, carry a government guarantee and are collateralized by a pool of real
estate mortgages, and a loan from the former owner of the Belize water company is
collateralized by physical shares.
(iii) Insurance. Two notes with face values of US$65 million and US$71 million that
were issued by the government in March 2005 through a private placement, carry
insurance that would cover 95 percent of the principal and interest payments in case of a
default. In addition, the government was required to establish up front several reserve
accounts to cover the insurance premia for the lifetime of the bonds, the uninsured
5 percent of principal and interest payments, and 180 days of debt service. Class A of the
BMC bonds also carries insurance in case the government defaults on its guarantee.

50

The public debt-service profile of external commercial debt exhibits humps and an
uneven distribution of the debt burden. A cash-flow projection model, based on the
terms and conditions contained in each debt contract—including the schedule of future
coupon payments, principal repayments, collateral, reserve release, and other debt
properties such as options—indicates that the medium-term debt service profile displays
humps in 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2015 (Appendix VII. Figure 2). In addition, the monthly
debt service payments vary greatly in the near term, ranging from US$0.5 million to
US$13 million (Appendix VII. Figure 3).

Appendix VIII. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Staff performed debt sustainability analyses (DSA) for both the passive and the
active policy scenarios. Debt service projections in both scenarios are based on the
following data:
•

Data for debt service on bilateral and multilateral debt are taken from the Central Bank
of Belize (CBB).

•

Projections for commercial debt service are based on IMF staff files, which were
compiled on a loan-by-loan basis from the original documentation for central government
debt.

2.
The debt stock in the staff’s DSA covers central government debt and the
publicly guaranteed external debt of quasi-fiscal entities. Regarding the external quasifiscal debt, the DSA assumes that these entities will service interest payments from their own
resources. In the case of the DFC, the DSA assumes that amortization payments are fully
assumed by the central government, who is able to recoup two-thirds of them through the
sale of DFC assets (these are recorded as privatization proceeds, below the line). The other
publicly guaranteed debt is assumed to be rolled over and remains constant at its end-2005
level.
3.
As a way of simplification, the DSA assumes standard financing terms for
assistance from bilateral and multilateral lenders, and domestic financing. Such
financing is assumed to carry interest of 6-month LIBOR plus one percent, and a 20-year
term with amortizations occurring on a half-yearly basis after a grace period of three years.17
Domestic debt is assumed to be rolled over at existing terms and new financing is being
contracted at a flat interest rate of 8 percent, which is about the average cost of the past
5 years.
4.
The residual financing gaps are filled through external financing at market
terms. The DSA assumes that this occurs through the issuance of either 5-year notes (passive
scenario) or 10-year bonds (active scenario) with a bullet maturity. The projected interest
rates on these borrowings equals the current market projections for 5- and 10-year U.S.
Treasury bonds, plus a country risk premium, or spread (discussed further below). It is
assumed that ¼ of the annual interest payments will fall due in the year of contracting the
new loans (i.e., half the loans are taken up in the first half of the year, for which one halfyearly interest payment will be made in the second half of the year).

17

The simulations use WEO projections of future rates for 6-month LIBOR.

52

Debt sustainability in the passive scenario
5.
In addition to the macroeconomic assumptions that have been described earlier, the
passive DSA is predicated upon the following:
•

Bilateral and multilateral financing is expected to become available only in very
modest and declining quantities. Multilateral financing is limited to previously
identified lending, while bilateral financing is assumed to remain at a level of
US$10 million per year through 2015 on a gross basis. Domestic financing is
assumed to be available at about US$5 million per year in net terms.

•

Sovereign risk spreads would remain high, projected in the simulations at
900bps, given the large debt burden and market financing needs.

6.
Under these assumptions, the public debt would not stabilize in the longer run.
While the debt-to-GDP ratio would initially fall from about 98½ percent at end-2005 to about
84½ percent in 2012, it would shift back to a rising trend thereafter (Table 8 and
Appendix VIII. Table 1). The reason for this turnaround in the debt dynamics is that after an
initial decline in interest payments in 2006 and 2007, reflecting partly the absence of
exceptional financing fees and commissions, the public interest bill is projected to climb to
about 9 percent of GDP by 2015. This increase in interest payments is due to the fact that
more and more debt is being refinanced at (higher) market terms.18 As a result of this
process, the stable primary surplus translates into a gradually widening overall deficit in the
outer years, which starts adding to the debt stock.
7.
Sensitivity analysis highlights the extremely vulnerable debt position that Belize
would sustain in an unchanged policies scenario. Bound tests such as a higher real interest
rate of one standard deviation, a lower real GDP growth rate or primary surplus of one-half
standard deviation each, a one-time real depreciation of 30 percent, or a 10 percent increase
in the debt stock (reflecting situations such as an unexpected need to recapitalize the banking
sector or to finance large emergency and reconstruction spending following a natural
disaster) would lead to more explosive debt dynamics (Appendix VIII. Figure 1).

18

A significant amount of Belize’s external commercial loans are based on complex financial structures that
compensated very high upfront fees with lower coupon payments.

53
Debt sustainability in the active policy scenario
8.
Apart from the more favorable macroeconomic environment in an active policy
scenario, Belize would be expected to encounter a generally more benign financing
environment. In this context, the DSA assumes the following:
•

Bilateral and multilateral lenders are projected to provide additional support for
the envisaged adjustment. In particular, it is assumed that in addition to previously
identified lending, there will be policy-based loans from the IDB and CDB of US$25
million each, with disbursements during the last quarter of 2006 through early 2008.
Afterwards, it is assumed that Belize can secure a moderate flow of financial support
from multilateral lenders of about US$12.5 million per year (on a gross basis) through
2015. Bilateral lenders are assumed to provide more upfront support, through
additional lending to the tune of US$25 million in 2007. Domestic financing, by
contrast, is assumed to be lower than under the passive scenario, particularly in the
early projection years, as the government pays back on its overdraft to the central
bank to support the accumulation of international reserves.

•

Country risk is expected to decline gradually as the adjustment program takes
hold and the debt stock declines. Following a successful debt exchange, spreads are
assumed to decline from 550 bps in 2007 to 275 bps by 2015.

9.
The debt dynamics in an active policy scenario would be significantly more
favorable, although the precise trajectory would depend on the terms at which residual
financing needs are being covered. Closing the financing needs at estimated market terms
would lead the debt-to-GDP ratio to decline steadily from about 98½ percent in 2005 to
67 percent by 2012 and 54 percent by 2015 (Table 10 and Appendix VIII. Table 2). This
decline would be largely driven by the higher primary surplus to which the authorities would
commit in the active scenario. At the same time, the debt dynamics would also benefit—
compared with the passive scenario—from more favorable financing conditions due to the
mobilization of additional bilateral and multilateral financing, and lower risk spreads.
10.
However, even in an active scenario the Belize’s public debt burden would
remain high for a prolonged period of time, and there would be significant vulnerability
to adverse shocks. While the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain on a declining trend under all
of the performed bound sensitivity tests, the occurrence of such shocks would significantly
delay the return to safer levels of public debt (Appendix VIII. Figure 2).

Debt-stabilizing
primary
balance 9/

1/ Public sector debt includes central government, the DFC, and other parastatal bodies. External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in U.S .dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in U.S. dollars (change in percent)

Statement by Jonathan T. Fried, Executive Director for Belize
and Yvette Alvarez, Advisor to Executive Director
October 20, 2006
Key Points
•

The authorities moved to tighten policies in fiscal year 2004/2005 after a period of
fiscal and monetary expansion, which resulted in large fiscal deficits and growth in
external debt to unsustainable levels.

•

While significant progress has been made in correcting macroeconomic imbalances,
Belize continues to face acute fiscal and balance of payments gaps.

•

Government has entered into good faith consultations with creditors with a view to
restructuring the external debt.

The Belizean authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the cordiality and
frankness which characterized these consultations. These are difficult economic times in
Belize and these consultations provided an excellent opportunity for exchange of views on
the authorities’ ongoing program to control the fiscal and balance of payments deficits and
address the external debt on a collaborative basis with their creditors.
Late in 2004, the authorities recognized that, while the ambitious policy to promote growth
through fiscal and monetary stimulation had resulted in unprecedented rates of economic
growth, the fiscal deficit and the external debt had risen to unsustainable levels. In response,
they began to take corrective measures to restore balance to avoid a potential fiscal and
foreign exchange crisis so as to protect and sustain the exchange rate peg. These corrective
measures took the form of short-term corrective action through revenue and expenditure
measures as well as medium-term stabilization through fiscal reform and improved debt
management.
The corrective measures were designed by the authorities as a home-grown program, but one
which benefited from intensive consultations with international partners including the IMF.
These consultations have been undertaken in an open and frank manner and, in this process,
data flow and communication on policy and programming issues have been significantly
improved. This has greatly improved the external environment within which the authorities
are addressing the fundamental problems of medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability.
The short-term corrective action, which was implemented between October 2004 and March
2005, had the objective of halting the expansion in the fiscal deficit through an immediate
cutback in the capital expenditure program and a reduction in planned operating costs by
5 percent during that 6 month period.

2
The ongoing medium-term stabilization program, which began with the budget for fiscal year
2005/2006, has the objectives of reducing the overall deficit to sustainable levels, and of
attaining a sustainable external debt profile. The authorities recognized that this requires
strong expenditure controls, tax reform, streamlining of the budget process, and the
development and implementation of a comprehensive debt-management strategy. The
medium-term strategy therefore includes:
•
•
•
•

Strengthening of the public expenditure programming and management systems;
Comprehensive reform and modernization of the revenue system, including the
implementation of an ad valorem General Sales Tax on July 1, 2006;
Definition of a debt-management strategy to bring sustainability to Belize’s external
debt profile and strengthen public debt management capacity, and
Strengthening of the legal and administrative framework for financial accountability
and oversight.

Recent Developments
The implementation of this medium-term program has already resulted in a significant fiscal
correction. The primary balance has moved from a small deficit in FY 2004/2005 to a
surplus of 3 percent of GDP in FY 2005/2006 and the overall deficit has been reduced from
8.6 percent of GDP to 3.3 percent of GDP, over the same period. Some 2¾ percent of GDP
in exceptional fees and commissions on external loans that were incurred in FY 04/05 were
not repeated in FY 05/06. These improvements reflect additional revenue measures
implemented in May 2005 and strengthening in expenditure programming and controls.
The budget discipline which was shown last year is reflected in the outturn for the first
quarter of the current fiscal year and it is expected that by the end of the current fiscal year, a
primary surplus of 3 ½ percent of GDP will be attained (1/2 percent of GDP more than
budgeted).
This fiscal adjustment program has been supported by Central Bank action to tighten
financial sector liquidity. Social security deposits have been channeled to the Central Bank
and the cash reserve and liquid asset requirements were increased four times during this
period of adjustment.
Even with this strong adjustment underway, however, the low level of official foreign
reserves and the heavy debt burden which is projected to continue beyond the medium term
have signaled the urgency of the need to move quickly towards a sustainable external debt
profile. With this objective in mind, the Belizean authorities engaged financial advisors late
last year to support the preparation of a comprehensive debt management strategy. The
implementation of this strategy has begun with the announcement, in August this year, that
the Government was taking the very difficult step of approaching their private creditors to
seek a restructuring of the external debt.

3
This restructuring is being approached in a transparent and equitable manner. A detailed
analysis of the situation including financial and economic projections has been published on
the Central Bank of Belize’s website, where additional information is also posted from time
to time. The authorities are consulting extensively with the affected creditors to establish an
understanding on what form of relief is needed to put Belize’s external debt on a sustainable
path. Once these consultations have been concluded, the authorities will make a formal debt
restructuring offer in which creditors will be invited to participate.
Policy Responses
The Government’s medium-term strategy builds on the comprehensive reform program
launched in 2005. The authorities agree with the staff that long-term sustainability will
require an additional fiscal effort of about 1 percent of GDP annually. This will allow for the
achievement of an increase in the primary surplus to 4 ½ percent of GDP during the
2007-2009 period. In pursuit of this objective, the authorities are continuing to maintain the
tight macroeconomic policies which characterize the adjustment programme.
They will continue to implement measures to keep the growth of non-interest current
expenditure, including the wage bill, below that of nominal GDP, while allowing for a
modest increase in capital spending for social sectors and infrastructure. In addition, a Public
Expenditure Review, which was recently completed with the support of the IDB, has made
several important recommendations that the authorities have agreed to implement early.
These include the preparation of the annual budget in a multi-year context as well as the
introduction of programme budgeting.
On the revenue side, the emphasis is on enhancing tax collections through improved
efficiency. On July 1, 2006, a new General Sales Tax (GST) was introduced to replace the
existing Sales Tax, which was applied on goods and services for importers and domestic
producers and suffered from cascading effects and lack of buoyancy. The authorities are
resisting pressures to dilute the GST base and are reviewing the performance of the GST as
preparations are made to deepen the process of reform of tax administration.
With regards to monetary policy, the authorities are confident that the latest increase in the
reserve requirements is sufficient at this time but are prepared to tighten these requirements
further, should this prove necessary.
Structural Reforms and Governance Issues
The passage of the Finance and Audit (Reform) Act of 2005 crystallized the Government’s
commitment to strengthen and modernize the legal framework for the administration of the
public finances in keeping with global trends towards greater accountability. However, the
authorities recognize that they need to accelerate other structural reforms in the fiscal and
monetary areas to sustain the positive results beyond the medium term. To this end, several
reform efforts are of immediate priority. These include:

4
1. Modernization of customs procedures to increase administrative efficiency and
revenue
• Cabinet recently approved a project to modernize Customs administration to
maximize efficiency in the Customs clearance process, which would allow for
increased revenue collection, more timely and accurate trade statistics, and a
reduction in the costs to the business community. This project was prepared
with the assistance of UNCTAD.
2. Streamlining and improving the format of the budget and overall strengthening of
budget management and reporting
• Over the past 2 budget preparation cycles, the format of the budget was
streamlined to better conform to international standards of classification of
financial transactions. The economic data is therefore significantly improved
in quality at both the summary and disaggregated levels. Steps are being
taken to ensure that fiscal data is submitted for inclusion in the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics.
3. Creation of an autonomous Statistical Institute to improve the quality and timeliness
of data to monitor economic activity
• The Government is taking steps to transform the Central Statistics Office
(CSO) into an autonomous statistical institute with the support of international
partners. This is expected to be implemented by the end of this fiscal year.
• In addition, after several months of collaborative work between the CSO and
the IMF’s Statistical Department, Belize began participating in the General
Data Dissemination System in September 2006.
4. Introduction of a long term planning framework – Vision 2025
• Government has agreed to begin a process of consultation with all social
partners, including the private sector, labour unions, political parties, nongovernment organization and community based organization with a view to
building broad consensus on future policy direction.
The Staff Report (Box 1) notes that a lack of transparency and weak governance have
contributed to the build-up in external public debt since 1999. In addition to the structural
reform measures already outlined, the authorities have taken several steps to address issues of
governance.
The Social Security Board
The Senate Select Committee Investigations into the operations of the Social Security Board
(SSB) was concluded and submitted to the National Assembly in July 2006 and the
Government moved immediately to accept and to implement the Report’s recommendations.

5
The Development Finance Corporation
The work of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the Development Finance
Corporation is ongoing. Government has supported the work of the Commission of Inquiry
into the DFC and has pledged to receive and act on the report of the Commission, including
the forensic audit, as soon as it is submitted.
Recognizing the role of the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in rapid accumulation
of external debt, the authorities have begun an orderly liquidation of the institution. Over the
past two years, the assets and liabilities of the DFC have been reduced from over
US$300 million to approximately US$100 million at the end of July 2006. This has been
accomplished through a process of asset revaluation, sale of properties, offsetting amounts
owed between the Government and the DFC and return of non-income earning assets to the
Government. The balance sheet, therefore, now represents a more accurate picture of the
value of the DFC than previously. In this process, the Government assumed responsibility for
approximately US$210 million in liabilities. Over the period, the Government also received
from the DFC significant real estate and other assets.
Management of Petroleum Revenues
Following the recent discovery of oil in commercial quantities in western Belize, the
Government has sought to review and modernize the structure of Belize’s earnings from the
petroleum industry. This includes an amendment to the Income and Business Tax Act, which
is presently before the National Assembly, to re-instate the income tax on petroleum
operators at 40 percent of net income. Further work is being done at this time to determine
mechanisms to achieve a greater degree of progressiveness in the taxes on petroleum
operations.
As an urgent priority, the Government is working to establish a Petroleum Fund to bring full
transparency to the process of accounting, investment and use of revenues earned by Belize
from petroleum. This Petroleum Fund will also ensure that extraction of this non-renewable
resource benefits future generations.
Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
Belize’s banking system is generally sound and the staff’s assessment in the Selected Issues
paper indicates that it is relatively robust to various shocks. The authorities have
implemented many of the recommendations of the 2003 Offshore Financial Center (OFC)
assessment. They have tightened the standards for the loan-loss provisioning, as suggested
by the staff and will implement the remaining recommendations of the OFC assessment,
particularly in the area of insurance.
Conclusion
In summary, Belize continues to face a very difficult financing environment. The authorities
are fully aware of the challenges they face. They recognize the need for careful management

6
of these risks and are putting in place a comprehensive set of measures to address the
problems. They look forward to the continued support of the international institutions and a
successful conclusion of the debt negotiations so that they can chart the way ahead to a stable
and sustainable future.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 20, 2006

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On October 20, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
After a number of years of expansionary policies, stabilization measures were implemented
more forcefully in the context of the 2005/06 budget (April to March). Partly in response to a
tighter policy stance, economic growth slowed from 4½ percent in 2004 to 3½ percent in 2005,
while inflation rose marginally to just over 4 percent, mainly reflecting higher fuel prices.
The overall fiscal deficit fell sharply from 8.6 percent of GDP in FY04/05 to 3.3 percent of GDP
in FY05/06. During the same period, the primary balance shifted from a small deficit to a
surplus of 3 percent of GDP. The fiscal correction reflected revenue measures taken in May
2005, as well as lower interest payments and cuts in capital expenditure. The authorities also
tightened liquidity by channeling social security deposits to the central bank and increasing the
cash reserve and liquid asset requirements on three occasions by 1 percentage point each,
including most recently in September 2006.
Reflecting in part the tightening of macroeconomic polices, the external current account deficit
is expected to narrow considerably to 8½ percent of GDP in 2006, from more than 14 percent
of GDP in the 2005. This recovery has been driven by a reduction in the trade balance, thanks
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

to an increase in traditional exports, the onset of crude oil exports, and restraint in import
growth. Continued buoyant tourism earnings have also helped improve the external current
account, as did a lower interest bill, because exceptional fees and charges that were incurred
in 2004 and 2005 were not repeated in 2006.
Despite these welcome developments, the outlook for 2007 and beyond remains worrisome,
as scheduled debt service obligations are high and will rise over time, weighing heavily on the
overall balance of payments, particularly as access to voluntary market financing at affordable
terms is impaired. The authorities have recognized the sustainability problem and in August
2006, they approached external commercial creditors to seek a cooperative agreement on
restructuring public sector debt.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors welcomed the progress the authorities have made in addressing
Belize’s serious macroeconomic imbalances in the context of a home-grown adjustment
strategy. A significant fiscal correction has been achieved in FY 2005/06 by increasing tax
collection, reining in discretionary current spending, and reducing capital expenditure.
In addition, tighter monetary conditions have helped slow credit growth and keep inflationary
pressures in check. At the same time, Directors cautioned that large fiscal and balance of
payments financing gaps are likely to persist in 2007 and beyond in the absence of fiscal and
monetary policies to eliminate these gaps. To set the economy on a path to medium-term
sustainability, the authorities should aim progressively and on a firm timetable to close the
fiscal and balance of payments financing gaps, replenish international reserves, and reduce
significantly the public debt burden. In that vein, Directors welcomed the authorities’ strategy to
reform the revenue system, strengthen public expenditure programming and debt
management, and improve financial accountability and oversight.
Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere with disciplined macroeconomic policies in
coming months in order to contain domestic demand and support an orderly debt restructuring.
On the monetary side, the recent increase in bank reserve requirements is appropriate, and
Directors noted that the authorities stand ready to take further action, if needed, to curb excess
liquidity and contain private sector credit growth. On the fiscal side, Directors urged the
authorities to work to achieve a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year 2006/07.
Directors agreed that achieving balance of payments sustainability in the medium term will
require a greater fiscal effort, maintaining a prudent monetary stance, external financing, and
debt service relief. They recommended raising the primary surplus by about 1 percentage
point of GDP above that originally targeted, first by saving the bulk of projected revenues from
oil production, and in later years by enhanced non-oil revenue collection and restrained current
expenditures. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to pursue these objectives.
Directors stressed the need for a set of carefully sequenced structural reforms to support fiscal
and monetary discipline and foster stronger long-term growth, and were reassured by the
authorities’ commitment and ongoing efforts to move in this direction. In the fiscal area, the tax
administration should be modernized, the tax base broadened, and oil and gasoline taxation

3
reformed. Directors pointed to the importance of reviewing the pension system with the aim of
limiting the growth of spending and making the system actuarially sound. Debt management
practices should be improved. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to improve
governance of quasi-fiscal institutions, including winding up the operations of the Development
Finance Corporation. In the monetary area, the central bank should work to broaden its
market-based policy instruments in order to make monetary policy more effective. Also, the
government’s overdraft facility at the central bank should be eliminated to strengthen the
bank’s independence. Directors supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical
assistance to facilitate early actions in the areas of tax policy and monetary instruments.
Directors welcomed that Belize’s banking system is generally sound and bank supervision has
been strengthened. At the same time, they urged the authorities to consider implementing
those recommendations of the IMF’s 2003 Offshore Financial Center assessment that remain
outstanding. In particular, there is a need to strengthen insurance supervision and broaden
financial sector prudential regulations, especially with regard to loan-loss provisioning and loan
collateral valuation.
Directors concurred with the authorities that the fixed exchange rate regime has anchored
prices and expectations, and has generally served the economy well. Sustaining the peg will
require that the authorities continue to work toward implementing macroeconomic policies that
address Belize’s economic and financial vulnerabilities. These considerations increase the
importance of responding expeditiously to changes in the domestic and external environment
and avoiding policy slippages.
Directors observed that reaching a cooperative agreement with private creditors on
restructuring Belize’s external debt will be critical for regaining balance of payments and debt
sustainability. They welcomed the authorities’ continuing engagement with multilateral and
bilateral creditors as well, in order to promote an orderly adjustment process.
Directors welcomed Belize’s participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
and encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen the quality and timeliness of the
country’s economic statistics.
