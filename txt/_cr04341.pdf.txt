EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
A cyclical recovery, driven by strong external demand, is taking hold. However, a poor job
market is dampening confidence and demand, while demographic pressures are beginning to
affect supply. Fiscal consolidation is behind schedule and, absent further measures, the deficit
would remain above 3 percent of GDP in 2005. The implementation of structural reforms
under Agenda 2010 is on track despite significant popular opposition. The financial sector is
recovering but there has been little progress in fostering more market-driven restructuring.
Key issues
The outlook. There was agreement that the short-term outlook has brightened with a modestpaced recovery underway. The recovery remains unbalanced, with domestic demand still
dormant, but the external impulse is expected to lead to higher investment and employment,
and finally consumption, with a lag of a few quarters. Beyond the near term, however, the
growth of potential output is constrained by poor labor utilization.
Fiscal policy. The authorities believed that sufficient adjustment was in train to bring the
fiscal deficit below 3 percent in 2005. The staff supported the deficit objective but argued
that achieving it requires further measures. Moreover, adjustment would need to continue
beyond 2005 to attain the medium-run target of small structural surpluses. Consolidation
should focus on cutting tax expenditures and subsidies, and inefficient and costly labor
market programs.
Entitlement and labor reform. The authorities pointed to important strides under Agenda
2010 to strengthen incentives to work and reform entitlement programs. However, with
aging-related spending projected to accelerate sharply beginning in 2010, more reforms are
needed to bolster confidence in the long-run viability of the entitlement system and boost
labor supply. Steps to increase the effective and the statutory retirement age and improve the
efficiency of the supply of health care and funding, together with measures to improve further
the functioning of labor markets and increase labor force participation, will be important. The
authorities concurred that additional steps are needed, but noted that the significant Agenda
2010 reforms first had to be fully absorbed.
Financial sector restructuring. Financial sector strains have eased and some progress has
been made in addressing structural weaknesses. Augmenting current efforts by creating the
legal framework to facilitate restructuring within and across the private and public sector
pillars of the banking system would help foster innovation and improve the underlying
strength of the system. In the insurance sector, abolishing obstacles (e.g., mandatory profit
splits) to better management of capital will give firms additional flexibility and help attract
and retain additional capital. The authorities noted that banking consolidation was underway,
albeit at a measured pace, but that more far-reaching reform would require changes in Länder
laws.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The discussions took place as a cyclical recovery of economic activity was
gaining strength, but with continued concerns about longer run prospects. On the policy
front, the authorities have been implementing their three-pronged policy strategy initiated last
year, as discussed by Directors in the 2003 Article IV consultation. This strategy comprises
phased tax cuts, expenditure-based fiscal consolidation, and reforms laid out in “Agenda
2010” to begin addressing key structural weaknesses (Box 1). Parliament approved the last
major component of Agenda 2010, a far-reaching reform of long-term unemployment
assistance, in June 2004. The authorities remained committed to reduce the general
government deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2005 provided the upswing is sustained, but so
far fiscal consolidation has been elusive.
II. BACKGROUND
2.

After three years of stagnation, the German economy is showing signs of life:

•

Activity is up, albeit unevenly and at a moderate pace. The recovery is driven by export
growth, as the rapid pace of world economic activity has dominated the effect of euro
appreciation.

•

Profitability in nonfinancial firms has picked up and has been used to strengthen balance
sheets; firms remained cautious with their investment plans and again posted a financial
surplus in 2003. Profitability has also improved in the financial sector, placing banks in
a better position to support the recovery.

•

Nevertheless, with output static since 2000, the output gap is wide and inflation is low
(Table 1 and Figure 1).

3.
The latest trough followed a secular decline of the economy’s potential growth,
and was exacerbated by major shocks. For many years after World War II output grew
rapidly, making the generous entitlement system funded by payroll taxes appear sustainable.
However, convergence and adverse incentive effects for labor then led to a considerable
decline in potential output growth from 4½ percent a year in the 1960s to 1½ percent in the
1990s (see table on page 8), and overall growth is now below the rate of euro-area partner
countries (Figure 2). The underlying weaknesses mainly originated in the labor market and
were exacerbated by reunification. The structural rigidities made adjustment to the shocks a
drawn out process that was manifested in declining labor and capital input:

-7-

Box 1: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal consolidation: During the 2003 Article IV consultation, Directors endorsed the
government’s commitment to reduce the structural deficit by 1½ percentage points during
2004-06, focused on durable expenditure cuts in subsidies and ineffective labor market
programs. Although some measures have been implemented, they are not sufficient to meet
these consolidation goals given cumulative tax cuts of some 1 percent of GDP.
Structural reforms: The Agenda 2010 reforms put forward in March 2003 were in line with
longstanding Fund recommendations. Implementation status is as follows:
The labor market reforms have been adopted: (i) eligibility and maximum duration of
unemployment benefits have been tightened; (ii) long-term unemployment and social
assistance have been merged into a more narrowly targeted program with means testing
(commonly referred to as the Hartz IV law); (iii) part-time work has been deregulated;
(iv) job protection regulation has been streamlined; and (v) job intermediation is being
improved.
Pension reforms have also advanced, focusing mainly on the replacement rate. Pensions will
remain almost unchanged in 2004-05. Furthermore, benefit levels were linked to the old-age
dependency ratio (steady state savings: ¾ percent of GDP), and early retirement programs are
being phased out. However, the Rürup pension commission’s proposal to phase in a higher
statutory retirement age, which Directors supported, has not yet been adopted and remains
under review.
Important health care reforms were adopted in September 2003 and are being implemented
(steady state savings: ½ percent of GDP from 2005). They include increased patient
copayments; higher contributions for pensioners; cuts to some benefits; and the shifting of
funding of sickness pay to employees. Directors also called for measures to boost efficiency
and competition, which is now on the policy agenda.
Financial sector: Directors recommended a reduction in barriers to restructuring both within
and across the public and private pillars of the banking system, but only limited headway has
been made on this front due largely to legal impediments at the sub-national level. However,
supervision is being improved in line with FSAP recommendations.

•

The most troubling development in potential growth has been a decline in total hours
worked.1 High and inflexible labor costs, generous support for the jobless (high
reservation wages), and deliberate policies for early retirement in response to adverse
labor demand shocks played key roles in reducing labor utilization. These policies led to
sustained high unemployment rates and payroll taxes when the entitlement system was
fully extended to the new and less productive Länder of the former East Germany.

•

Growth in the capital stock has been decelerating, following convergence after World
War II—and, again, in the early 1990s after reunification—when the capital-to-GDP
ratio was relatively low. However, excessive wage growth, especially in the first half of
the 1990s, also played a role through its harmful effects on profit margins and
disincentives to expand capacity.

•

Total factor productivity (TFP) growth slowed over the past decades, a characteristic
shared by most industrial economies, although some have recently managed a reversal.

The economy is still in a process of adjustment, with adverse consequences for
4.
domestic demand.
•

Wage setting is becoming more flexible and increases have been moderate since the
mid-1990s, which is helping to address Germany’s comparatively high real wages
(Figure 3). However, domestic

In Germany, total hours worked fell by 0.4 percent a year during the 1990s, while in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States, they increased by 0.4, 1.3, and 1.4 percent a
year. Furthermore, if Germany had the same employment rate for the 60-64 year old cohort as the
United Kingdom, the labor force would be larger by about 1 million workers.

Nevertheless, slowing wage growth is improving competitiveness, and exports are
responding well to expanding world demand (Figure 4). This is visible in strong exports
of machinery and equipment, which are tied to investment spending in the global cycle,
a component that was slow to recover but is now rebounding. The external current
account has swung from a deficit to a substantial surplus (in line with Germany’s large
output gap and equilibrium savings-investment balance), and staff estimates of the
equilibrium exchange rate do not point to an external competitiveness problem.

Note: The demand effect measures Germany's share of world import demand, while
the price effect captures changes in the share due to changes in the REER.

Monetary conditions have been accommodating for the euro area, but low
5.
underlying inflation in Germany has resulted in real interest rates that are somewhat
above average (Figures 5 and 6). Loan growth has been anemic (Figure 7), reflecting a
combination of weak demand as firms continue to adjust their balance sheets, and supply
factors as banks tightened lending standards while rebuilding capital. Nevertheless, there is
no evidence of an outright credit crunch because firms’ cash flow has permitted increasing
dividends alongside improving the balance sheets (Figure 8). Loan margins are now easing
and asset prices have rebounded (Figure 9).
The fiscal stance is not weighing on activity. With tax cuts equivalent to 0.7 and
6.
0.2 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005, the structural deficit is expected to increase slightly in
2004 and decline by almost ½ percentage point of GDP in 2005 (Table 2). In any event,
emerging demographic pressure, a public debt ratio already exceeding 65 percent of GDP,
and a large structural budget deficit, leave no scope for expansionary fiscal policy.
All in all, a modest cyclical recovery is underway, driven by external demand.
7.
Real GDP increased at an annualized rate of nearly 2 percent in the first half of 2004,
marking four successive quarters of growth. However, consumption was flat—in line with

- 13 -

slow growth in disposable income—and investment (in construction) remained weak . Highfrequency indicators continue to show this mixed picture (Figure 10), with exports and
manufacturing output holding up and orders strengthening further, but with weak confidence,
retail sales, and construction spending still holding back domestic activity (Figure 11).

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

8.
The discussions took place against the backdrop of a difficult political
environment. Household confidence indicators and polls pointed to a sense of adjustment
fatigue and uncertainty among economic agents, rooted also in the poor job market, sluggish
wages, stagnant pension benefits, and rising health care costs. Following losses in regional
elections, the government no longer controls the upper house and there is little agreement on
how to proceed with fiscal consolidation. Although general elections are not due until the
autumn of 2006, the political landscape is already affected by a heavy schedule of regional
elections between September 2004 and May 2005.
In this setting, and to avoid any risk of undercutting the recovery, the authorities
9.
were reluctant to augment Agenda 2010 or announce additional fiscal measures.
However, they underscored their commitment to the full implementation of Agenda 2010
despite popular opposition (including large street protests), pointing to the fundamental
restructuring of support for the long-term jobless as evidence. The authorities viewed this as a
major policy change that needed to be absorbed by the public before embarking on new
reforms. They also stressed their intention to consider new budget measures later in 2004 if
required to reduce the 2005 fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP.
The mission argued that the improved short-term outlook provided an
opportunity to accelerate fiscal consolidation and deepen structural reforms. Public debt

is high and rising, and fiscal adjustment had already been postponed. At the same time, under
German law, higher entitlement expenditure eventually tends to trigger higher payroll taxes to
balance the social security system.2 Without welfare reform, efforts to raise labor utilization,
and fiscal consolidation, the impending demographic change and associated crippling payroll
tax hikes will further stifle growth. Thus, the policy response needed to be forward looking to
boost potential growth and deal with population aging, which will accelerate after 2010. As
past policy reversals were one reason for the uncertainty among economic agents, the mission
stressed the confidence benefits of casting the required policies in a coherent framework that
focuses on longer-term prospects.
A. The Economic Outlook

11.
There was agreement that the short-term outlook had improved. The official
forecast sees real GDP growth between 1½-2 percent in 2004-05, and there was concurrence
that growth is likely to be at the upper end of this range in both years. Adjusting for the
effects of additional working days in 2004 and fewer working days in 2005, this implies an
acceleration in underlying growth of ⅔ percentage points in 2005. This scenario is built on a
strong external impulse, consistent with the latest WEO forecast for global expansion, and
assumes that this impulse will only gradually spill over to investment and employment, and
then to consumption (Figure 12). Core inflation would remain subdued with continued wage
moderation, although headline inflation would be affected by the rise in oil prices and one-off
increases in health premia and tobacco taxes.
However, the unbalanced nature of the recovery, with domestic demand still
12.
dormant, adds uncertainty to the projection, and there was agreement that the
downside risks bear close watching. Specifically:
•

2

Disposable income might continue to be held back by weak employment and slow wage
growth, with adverse consequences for consumption (Figure 13). The reform effort may
also be causing uncertainty about future prospects, prompting households to save much
of the 2004-2005 tax cut. Furthermore, construction was seen to remain weak for some
time. At the same time, although the link between external and domestic demand was
assumed to be weaker than in previous upswings, there was no evidence that the passthrough would not come into play and boost investment and employment. Indeed,
interest rates continued to be moderate and banks were in better shape to support
growth. Firms’ balance sheets and profitability were also improving, which should
facilitate investment.

By contrast, most other countries do not have this close link between entitlement spending and
payroll taxes, making debt dynamics a priority in their long-term fiscal analysis.

The authorities noted that the external impulse might subside before igniting the
domestic economy in the event of even higher oil prices or new security disturbances.3
Although the latest WEO forecast for global expansion has indeed become more
cautious, it continues to point to strong world activity in 2005 (import demand growth
relevant for Germany in excess of 6 percent). The staff agreed, however, that exports
could slow if these risk factors were to disrupt the global upswing.

Beyond the near term, however, the mission saw the upside potential for output
growth constrained by poor labor utilization. In contrast to most other European countries,
Germany’s working age population had already begun to decline (Figure 14).4 After the
current slack is worked off, this would impede growth unless incentives are improved and
participation rates are raised to achieve better utilization of labor. The mission’s analysis
13.

Simulations suggest that a permanent US$5 per barrel price increase, at constant exchange rates,
reduces real GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points a year for three years. However, so far, the
euro appreciation has moderated somewhat the oil price increases in local currency.

4

Between 1999-2004, the working age population in Germany declined by 1 percent, whereas it
increased by over 2 percent in the euro area excluding Germany.

suggests that, based on the Agenda 2010 reforms so far, potential growth over the next five
years or so would accelerate from only about 1½ percent to 1¾ percent a year, and this
assuming that: (i) after the current cyclical slump, TFP resumes a 1 percent growth pace as in
the 1980s and 1990s; (ii) the drop in total hours worked slows to 0.2 percent a year, from
0.4 percent rate in recent years; and (iii) the growth rate of the capital stock rebounds to
2 percent, consistent with improved fundamentals. Therefore, reforms beyond Agenda 2010
needed to be developed and implemented to support higher potential growth, which would
also have important synergies with fiscal consolidation.
B. Fiscal Policy and Entitlement Reform
Fiscal consolidation

14.
There was agreement on the need to consolidate public finances as the upswing
unfolds. On real GDP growth of 1½ -2 percent in 2004-05, the authorities projected the
general government deficit at 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004 and just under 3 percent in 2005.
This adjustment would be driven by rising yields from past measures and tight budgeting.
New measures would not make a significant contribution: savings from the proposed
elimination of the subsidy for residential property––about ½ percentage point of GDP in the
steady state―were small in the short run and would serve partly to fund higher spending on
research and development. For 2006, the authorities targeted a deficit of 2 percent of GDP,
followed by further reductions in 2007-08.
The mission supported the authorities’ fiscal objective for 2005 but questioned
15.
its attainability without further measures. In 2004, the deficit would likely be somewhat
higher than the authorities’ estimate because of disappointing tax collections associated with
sluggish wages and consumption; the structural deficit would widen slightly. For 2005, the
mission’s estimates of the yield from measures and macroeconomic effects on tax receipts
were also more cautious than those of the authorities. Assuming a recovery of Bundesbank
profits––which were unusually low in 2004––the deficit would still be lowered only to
3.3 percent of GDP. Further, on current policies, a large structural deficit would remain over
the medium run.
The mission recommended reducing the structural deficit by at least
16.
1½ percentage point of GDP during 2004-06, in line with past advice. After compensating
for the 2004-2005 tax cuts (amounting to close to 1 percent of GDP), the carry-over impact of
expenditure measures already implemented with the 2004 budget and one-off effects will
yield a structural improvement of about ½ percentage point of GDP over 2004-06. Additional
measures equivalent to 1 percent of GDP would thus be needed in 2005-06. With the
adjustment in 2005 already sizable and the recovery still tentative, about two thirds of the
additional adjustment could be backloaded to 2006, when growth is projected to be above
potential. In any case, the automatic stabilizers should be allowed free play around the
resulting 2005-06 structural adjustment path of ¾ percent of GDP per annum. Structural

consolidation would need to continue beyond 2006, at a pace of ½ percentage point of GDP
annually, to reach the structural surpluses of about 1 percent of GDP foreseen in the
authorities’ June 2001 Guiding Principles of Fiscal Policy before aging accelerates in 2010.
The authorities believed that the 3 percent deficit goal was achievable in 2005 on
17.
present policies, but admitted that it would be a close call. They indicated additional
measures would be specified before the budget is passed in December if the upswing had
become entrenched and the achievement of the deficit goal remained in doubt. The
authorities agreed that further measures would be needed to attain the medium-run targets
and move to a small surplus over the cycle.
For adjustment measures, the mission proposed a continuation of the structural
18.
approach with durable expenditure cuts launched by the authorities in 2004. Under this
approach tax relief had been supported with cuts in entitlement expenditure, notably on
pensions and health care. But efforts to cut tax expenditures and subsidies had not brought
major savings. Using a broad definition, a bipartisan commission had estimated total
expenditure on these items to be as much as € 120 billion (6 percent of GDP). However, the
commission then proposed (and the government adopted) across-the-board cutbacks that
cumulated to only ¼ percentage point of GDP over 2004-06. The mission felt that much
deeper cuts were possible and warranted. Similarly, active labor market policies (ALMP) had
proven costly (1 percent of GDP) but not very effective, and could be streamlined.
The authorities agreed that the subsidies were good candidates for pruning and
19.
that across-the-board expenditure restraint was becoming increasingly difficult. After a
number of tight budgets, the room for further trimming of discretionary items had become
limited. They would try again to abolish residential property subsidies, a difficult endeavor in
the current political setting. Beyond that, they argued that the structural reforms to the
entitlement system and labor markets might well have larger-than-presently estimated
payoffs, as they might significantly alter the behavior of agents. These developments were
difficult to forecast and thus prudent assumptions had been made in the budgetary
projections.

The mission cautioned against embarking on further tax reform before the
requisite expenditure cuts and fiscal consolidation are well in hand. Several proposals are
being discussed in policy circles, aimed at reducing distortions in the tax system and lowering
tax rates. However, they also entail a significant risk of revenue losses in the short run,
raising questions about their sustainability. Furthermore, the mission argued that, in view of

- 25 -

the high labor costs, limits on growth in entitlements combined with payroll tax cuts would
be more effective in reviving labor markets and fostering employment and output.5
The authorities shared the staff’s position, explaining that their main priority
21.
was to limit the expansion of nonwage labor costs and improve labor utilization. In this
regard, several interlocutors saw merit in moving the funding of entitlement systems away
from payroll taxes to consumption taxes but this debate was ongoing and no decision was
expected soon. A specific area of discussion
Germany: Payroll Taxes in Percent of Gross Wages
involved two proposals for changing the funding
43
In percent
of health care to lessen the pressures on labor
41
costs. This debate considers whether: (i) to replace 39
the payroll tax with a lump-sum contribution per
37
adult, while using the income tax to compensate
35
33
those with low earnings (Gesundheitsprämie); or,
31
(ii) to widen the contribution base to include
29
capital income and individuals presently in private
27
health care programs to allow a lower average
25
payroll tax rate (Bürgerversicherung). However,
1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000
any agreement on these proposals across the
political spectrum was unlikely before the 2006
general elections.
Accordingly, the authorities’ efforts to slow the rise in payroll taxes were focused
22.
mainly on pension and health care expenditure. They elaborated that:
•

The recent introduction of a sustainability factor—which slows pension increases by
¼ percent for every percentage point increase in the old-age dependency ratio—would
lower expenditure by about ¾ percent of GDP in the long run. In addition, efforts are
underway to promote corporate and private (Riester) pension accounts, but these pillars
are still small compared to the public pay-as-you-go system.

•

The 2003 bipartisan health care reform, which was still under implementation, would
lower spending by about ½ percent of GDP. The introduction of co-payments for
doctors’ visits and various improvements related to pharmaceuticals had already shown
success. Moreover, limits on dental coverage would become effective in 2005. Steps to
liberalize the pharmacy sector and to allow hospitals more freedom in deciding what
services to offer were also under consideration.

5

General income tax cuts are less effective than payroll tax cuts as those in the lower income
brackets pay a very small share of income tax receipts.

- 26 -

23.
The mission supported these reforms but argued that additional steps are
needed to bolster confidence in the long-term viability of the entitlement system.
Various studies project that on current policies age-related spending would rise between
4-6 percentage points of GDP before peaking in 2050. Absent additional entitlement reform,
payroll taxes would need to rise significantly to compensate, stifling growth (Box 2). Cutting
discretionary spending further to offset higher entitlement outlays is not feasible either as it
would jeopardize the efficiency of government.6 Thus, further entitlement reform was
inevitable to avoid unsustainable increases in the tax or debt burden.
To help increase labor supply, the mission recommended linking the statutory
24.
retirement age to life expectancy rather than focusing narrowly on achieving benefit
cuts. Specifically, the 2003 Rürup pension reform commission had already recommended
increasing the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 years––by one month a year starting in
2011. Adopting this measure could contain future pension costs by another ½ percentage
point of GDP. With life expectancy projected to rise by about one year per decade, the
authorities acknowledged that raising the statutory retirement age would eventually be
inevitable, but preferred to work first on the effective retirement age, which stood just over
60 years. Accordingly, they would gradually lift the age at which unemployed workers
qualify for early retirement to 63 years, from 60 years presently. The statutory retirement age
would be reexamined following the publication of sustainability reports at regular intervals,
starting in 2006.
C. Budgetary Institutions and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations

25.
Budgetary institutions and intergovernmental fiscal relations have had a
significant impact on the pace of reform and consolidation. A background paper shows
that over the past three decades all of Germany’s governments faced an opposition-controlled
upper house––which has to approve most economic reforms—for lengthy periods of their
terms (Box 3). During such periods, little progress was made with fiscal consolidation,
particularly in curtailing expenditure.
Accordingly, the mission suggested measures to establish firmer commitments
26.
among different levels of government and introduce a degree of competition in fiscal
federalism, thereby improving fiscal discipline and the allocation of resources between the
levels of government and among Länder. In particular:

6

Staff analysis suggests that plausible scenarios of reduced discretionary spending and interest
saving would not be sufficient to absorb the future costs of aging (see, e.g., IMF Country Report
No. 2/239).

Box 2. Effects of Pension Reform on Growth

Most projections of social security finances
ignore feedback effects on labor supply and
capital accumulation and may hence
underestimate the costs of aging. This is
particularly important in Germany, where
social security deficits, by law, eventually tend
to lead to higher payroll tax rates. This could
slow real GDP growth more sharply than
currently envisioned.

demographic decline of the labor force (even
after allowing for immigration). With less labor input, GDP growth would slow. This would
lower capital accumulation, which slows GDP growth further. Fiscal revenues would fall and
require a further rise in contributions rates, leading to a downward spiral that could choke
output growth after 2020.

The recent pension reform links benefits to the dependency ratio. Although this dampens the
pressure on payroll taxes, it still leaves a substantial adverse growth effect, particularly from
2010 onward, when aging accelerates. The active generation still bears most of the financial
burden of aging, and real wages may barely grow over the coming 20 years. Employment and
GDP, and hence revenue, would be depressed, keeping pressure on contribution rates.
Raising the effective retirement age from
currently 60 years to 65 by 2030 would
support the labor force and output growth, and
would distribute the financial burden more
equally. Simulations suggest that with such a
policy, both wages and pensions would be
able to advance by about 10 percent in real
terms over the coming 20 years. The
employment ratio would stabilize, allowing
GDP growth to be higher by about 1
percentage point per year relative to the
“recent reform” scenario. The required
increase in payroll taxes would be cut in half.

Margin (left)
Structural fiscal balance (right)
1970

As discussed in the accompanying Selected Issues
Paper, the structural fiscal balance has tended to be
closely related to the government’s combined margin
of support in the lower and upper chambers of
parliament. The lower chamber selects the government
but the upper chamber can veto most tax laws and
many structural reforms. Staggered regional elections
change the majorities in the upper chamber in between
the general elections. As a result, structural balances
have usually improved in the early “honeymoon” years
of a new administration. However, they have then
eroded with losses in regional elections, as the central
governments needed to accommodate a more diverse
set of political interests.

1/ T he margin is the majority in votes for the
government in both chambers of parliament.

This phenomenon puts added emphasis on ensuring that budgetary institutions and
intergovernmental fiscal relations provide better incentives for fiscal management. Specific
measures in this regard are outlined in Section III.C.
It was also found that since reunification structural reforms have lacked consistency. For
example, new long-term care insurance was established in 1995, although the welfare state
was already being stretched by reunification-related challenges. Many benefits were then cut
back in 1997, including pensions through the introduction of a demographic factor. With a
change in government, these cutbacks were repealed in 1999, but then re-introduced again in
2003-04 as part of Agenda 2010. Such swings in policy have likely disoriented the public
about the direction and objectives of economic policy.
•

The mission supported the government’s plan to produce fiscal sustainability reports,
but noted that the report’s credibility would be boosted if it was prepared by a
nonpartisan independent body that reported to the legislature. These reports should
provide a comprehensive and long-run view of the general government accounts based
on current policies.

•

In framing its fiscal objectives, the government should make the accounting conventions
and rules more consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact (as opposed to the current
focus on a golden rule for the cash budget of the federal government).7

7

The receipts from the Russia credit-linked note launched in July 2004 will count toward meeting
the golden rule, but will not affect the Maastricht deficit.

- 29 -

•

The Internal Stability Pact (ISP) should be bolstered by spelling out and firming up the
commitments of various levels of government, including individual Länder.

•

The mechanism for allocating revenue across Länder could be reformed to provide
stronger incentives for fiscal consolidation by Länder.

•

Länder should be given leeway to attune their regional public sector wage and welfare
expenditures as well as revenues (through surcharges or discounts) to local
circumstances, thereby improving the business environment for new investment.

The authorities were sympathetic to these proposals and drew attention to the
27.
work of a parliamentary commission that was studying Bund-Länder relations. Amid a
perception that the federal system was contributing to reform gridlock, the commission was
seeking to reduce the overlap of responsibilities between the various levels of government.
Further, under the ongoing labor market reforms more scope would be given for innovative
policies at the local level. The authorities acknowledged that an agreement with the Länder
on how precisely to share the responsibility for conforming with the Stability and Growth
Pact, including possible sanctions, would be desirable. They thought that they had taken a
successful step in this direction with the ISP of 2002, and did not see much scope for further
progress at this time.
D. Labor Policies and Developments in the New Länder
Labor market developments and policies

28.
Rising wage flexibility has contributed to the increase in unemployment being
below previous peaks, unlike in earlier slowdowns. Continuing a trend since the mid
1990s, the vast majority of collective wage agreements concluded recently set pay increases
around 2 percent, with actual pay hikes likely falling below the agreed headline number
(Figure 15). The authorities observed that many collective wage bargaining agreements
included clauses that allowed adjustments in working conditions to address firm- or sectorspecific problems, flexibility they were actively encouraging. They also drew attention to
contracts concluded recently by some large firms that stipulate an increase in the length of the
workweek from 35 to 40 hours without additional pay, responding in part to intensified
competition from the new EU member states. More generally, the majority of companies and
close to half of all employees are no longer covered by collective wage bargaining.
Combined with improved wage flexibility, the authorities thought their reforms
29.
to lower reservation wages and strengthen job intermediation would boost employment.
In January 2006, the duration of unemployment benefits would be cut, from a maximum of
32 months to 18 months for people aged 55 and over; others would continue to receive
benefits for at most 12 months. Furthermore, as a key element in the Hartz IV reforms, in
January 2005 open-ended unemployment assistance (UA) would be merged with social
assistance into a new unemployment benefit II program (UB II). The authorities explained

- 30 -

that this reform entailed much tighter means tests for the 2.2 million UA recipients, probably
withdrawing support from some 500,000 individuals. Those who remain eligible would
receive lower benefits and would have to meet stronger job acceptance requirements. These
reforms are significant, and successful implementation will require far-reaching changes by
the Federal Labor Agency (FLA) and municipal agencies in charge of benefit administration
and job intermediation.

1/ Wage drift is the difference between negotiated and actual wage increases.

The mission supported these well-targeted reforms and cautioned against their
30.
dilution, noting also that there is still an unfinished agenda. The authorities underscored
their strong commitment to the full implementation of the UB II program, dismissing calls to
introduce legal minimum wages to soften the effect of tighter job acceptance criteria.
Nonetheless, they thought that regions with unemployment rates above 15 percent needed
special support within the framework of existing ALMPs to better manage the transition to
UB II. The mission stressed that ensuring a strict, rules-based, interpretation of the job
acceptance requirement—and sanctions for those who refuse a job offer—was key for the
success of the reforms. This required a proper incentive structure within the FLA and
municipalities. Regarding the next steps of the reform agenda, the mission noted that hiring
and firing regimes are still rigid and costly, and impede flexible labor management. Further,
more flexibility could be introduced in the legal framework for wage bargaining, which
currently restricts the right to conclude firm-specific and collective wage agreements solely to
trade unions.

- 31 -

31.
The mission also emphasized that labor force participation needs to be raised to
mitigate demographic pressure on growth and public finances. Labor utilization is
particularly low for workers older than 55 years, women, and the young. The authorities
explained that the few remaining early retirement schemes were being phased out and that the
cut in the duration of unemployment benefits would make it harder to focus downsizing on
older workers. The mission noted that this should be complemented by removing financial
disincentives and other obstacles to working beyond the statutory retirement age. Regarding
labor force participation of women, the authorities pointed to recent measures that lower
social security contributions on part-time work, thereby mitigating tax-related disincentives
for secondary income earners, and to programs that foster full-day schooling.
Developments in the new Länder

32.
Labor market problems are particularly acute in the new Länder but gradual
adjustment is underway. Union membership and collective wage bargaining are far less
widespread in the new Länder. Labor costs continue to fall relative to those in the old
Länder––in manufacturing they are now below western levels, fostering rapid expansion of
output––and per capita incomes are catching up. However, the bursting of the subsidyinduced construction bubble is still weighing heavily on activity.
Discussions focused on policies that might accelerate economic convergence.
33.
Enterprise surveys suggest that lower wages and longer workweeks are now key reasons to
locate in the new Länder, but a 2003 progress report points to public infrastructure gaps,
particularly in the area of transportation. Rather than replacing old special incentive schemes
for investment with new ones, the mission advocated allocating a larger share of public
expenditure to investment, which is presently being rolled back by many local governments.
Furthermore, in the context of the discussions on federalism, the mission also argued that
more freedom for individual Länder to shape their public sector wage and welfare policies,
together with some independence in setting tax rates, might allow them to improve their
business environment. The authorities viewed the sluggish growth in the old Länder as a key
obstacle to a better performance of the new Länder. Policies thus had to be the same across
Germany, targeting lower nonwage costs through entitlement reforms and less generous
support for the jobless. Ultimately, these reforms would create the room for more public
investment.

34.
The authorities pointed to progress in liberalizing network industries and agreed
on the need to reform crafts and services to boost more labor-intensive growth.
Competition in the telecoms sector was strong; in energy, difficulties with respect to network

barriers to entry in crafts. The mission
underscored that liberalizing the crafts and services sector provides a promising avenue to
foster more labor intensive growth. The authorities pointed to a recent reform that had opened
entry into crafts that accounted for roughly 10 percent of craft employment.
The authorities reiterated their strong support for multilateral trade
35.
liberalization and agricultural reform. They welcomed the EU initiative to put on the table
all export subsidies, to show flexibility on various Singapore issues, and to give the poorest
and most vulnerable WTO members a “round for free.” They were also pushing to liberalize
the trade regime covering bananas, rice, and sugar. Regarding the CAP, Germany had
strongly advocated decoupling support from production, most recently for tobacco, olives,
and cotton.

The authorities saw major benefits from EU enlargement, together with the full
adoption of Agenda 2010 reforms to foster speedy restructuring. Various studies found
that the catch-up of incomes of the new EU members would further boost trade flows and
incomes in Germany, particularly in the new Länder.

F. Financial Sector Developments and Policies

37.
The authorities reported that financial sector strains had eased and that
progress had been made in addressing structural weaknesses (Table 3). The rating
downgrades of major banks and insurance companies had ended and they had successfully
tapped capital markets over the past year. In the banking sector, operating income had risen
moderately within all three banking pillars in 2003, driven mainly by cost cutting.8 Falling
loan loss provisions had supported a recovery of earnings which, together with the disposal of
risky assets and recovering equity markets, had boosted capitalization. However, the
authorities acknowledged that raising revenue remained the “cardinal problem” for German
banks.9 Consolidation in the insurance sector was advancing too, although at a slower pace
than in banking. Balance sheets had benefited mainly from the recovery in equity markets but
also from lower payouts on life insurance policies.
The authorities also pointed to progress in preparing public sector banks for the
38.
phase-out of government guarantees in mid-2005. Although the German banking system
remains highly segmented along three pillars, they noted that increased cooperation across
pillars was emerging, mostly in back-office operations. The public banks (Sparkassen and
their head institutions, the Landesbanken) were preparing for the end of government guarantees, which would hit the Landesbanken particularly hard, by: (i) securing more capital from
8

However, most major banks still made large losses in 2003, partly reflecting large one-time
writeoffs, and their results remained below European peers.

IMF Occasional Paper 233 “Germany’s Three-Pillar Banking System: Cross-Country
Perspectives in Europe” found that German banks were lagging their European counterparts
mainly in revenue mobilization, rather than cost control.

- 34 -

the Sparkassen associations of their own Land;10 (ii) strengthening the institutional protection
scheme for Sparkassen and Landesbanken; or (iii) seeking partnerships or mergers with
stronger Landesbanken of other Länder. The authorities reported that these efforts had been
recognized by rating agencies with shadow ratings on unguaranteed obligations in the single
“A” range, except for a few institutions whose ratings were in the “BBB” range. Guaranteed
obligations––which can be issued until mid-2005––typically carry a “AAA” rating.
Although helpful, the mission noted that the moves by the Landesbanken were
39.
insufficient to fundamentally strengthen the banking system. Profits from current
business lines of most of the Landesbanken will be largely eliminated as their refinancing
costs begin to rise in line with the lower rating on unguaranteed obligations.11 A major
restructuring of business lines is thus crucial, driven by a wide set of market forces, including
greater transparency about the operations of public sector banks followed by private
ownership. Hence, the mission reiterated the key FSAP recommendations to facilitate
market-based restructuring by changing the legal framework so as to reduce barriers to
restructuring. For example, changing the public law structure of Landesbanken and
Sparkassen would permit their transformation into joint stock corporations, opening the door
for private capital and consolidation within or across pillars. The authorities agreed on the
desirability to open public sector banks to private capital, which also would allow more
flexible responses to financial stress. They acknowledged that the restructuring process,
especially cross-pillar consolidation, was constrained by legal obstacles, drawing attention to
an unsuccessful attempt by one municipality to sell its Sparkasse, but said that removing
these obstacles was a matter for Länder governments. The mission indicated that the Federal
authorities nevertheless needed to engage the local authorities if the reforms fell short, as
persistent inefficiencies in the banking system would have adverse fiscal and financial effects
beyond the local level.
In Germany’s insurance sector, which is one of the largest in the world, strong
40.
competition and large capacity in the life segment continue to weigh on profits.
Investment income and solvency recovered with equity markets and property and casualty
and reinsurance companies also benefited from rising premium income and falling claims.
But in the life insurance sector, large capacity and stiff competition stand in the way of a
sustained recovery of profitability, notwithstanding adjustments to the rate of return typically
guaranteed to policyholders.12 The authorities explained that the returns paid on life insurance
10

Together with the Land government these associations often are owners of the Landesbanken.

11

See IMF Occasional Paper 233 for a discussion of Landesbanken ratings and profitability and
other issues related to public sector banking in Germany.

12

The officially-set technical discount rate, which typically acts as the minimum rate of return
guaranteed by companies to new policyholders, was lowered from 3.25 to 2.75 percent on
January 1, 2004.

- 35 -

policies had finally fallen to levels in line with “economic” returns of the companies. With
the recovery of equity markets, the sector as a whole had moved from holding hidden losses
to hidden gains in 2003; regulatory solvency was met with an adequate margin. These
improvements had also been borne out by the results for the stress tests, which had been
passed by companies accounting for about 90 percent of life insurance business.
The mission noted that further adjustments are needed to strengthen the life
41.
insurance sector. In particular, it will be important to abolish the mandatory 90:10 profit
split (which stipulates that at least 90 percent of profits must be distributed to policy holders)
to allow companies to strengthen capital and prepare for the introduction of EU’s Solvency II
capital adequacy scheme. The authorities said that companies were already beginning to
adjust in anticipation of Solvency II, even if the related EU Directive would not be finalized
for several years. In their view, the 90:10 split did not constrain capital, but they agreed that
in the context of Solvency II a mandatory profit split had little rationale. Beyond work toward
Solvency II, the authorities expected self-supervision of the industry to improve matters. In
this context, they pointed to the introduction of Protektor AG––a joint-stock company held
by the industry that had the task of taking over insurance policies of insolvent members. The
authorities hoped that contributions to Protektor AG would become risk-based and assessed
by industry experts.
The authorities pointed to several supervisory improvements in response to the
42.
FSAP and highlighted initiatives to foster financial intermediation. Although they had
not repeated last year’s stress tests for the banking sector, the Federal Agency for Financial
Services Supervision (BaFin) and the Bundesbank were developing an early warning system.
The Bundesbank had begun publishing a regular financial stability report. BaFin had refined
the insurance industry stress tests in an effort to move toward more risk-based supervision. A
major project underway was to bring reinsurance business under the umbrella of the
supervisory authorities, a key FSAP recommendation. Furthermore, the authorities pointed to
the introduction or development of regulatory frameworks for various new financial
instruments, including hedge funds, asset backed securities, real estate investment trusts, and
inflation-indexed government debt. The goal is to deepen capital markets, providing firms
more financing options and allowing for better allocation of risk among market participants.
G. Other Issues

43.
A recent FATF Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes for AML/CFT
concludes that Germany’s system is comprehensive, effective, and efficiently implemented.
However, a few deficiencies should be addressed regarding terrorist financing, including
ratification of the UN International Convention of the Financing of Terrorism (1999);
criminalization of financing for individual terrorists who are not part of a larger terrorist
organization; and specifics related to the freezing of property and wire transfers.
Germany’s statistics are generally of high quality and conducive for effective
44.
surveillance. Collecting direct national accounts data on inventories and compiling quarterly

- 36 -

accounts for the general government would be an important enhancement. In response to an
FSAP recommendation to produce more comprehensive and timely data on financial sector
soundness, the authorities intend to participate in the IMF’s initiative to compile Financial
Sector Soundness Indicators.
45.

ODA was 0.3 percent of GNI in 2003.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

46.
Germany has made important headway over the past year in addressing deepseated structural problems. However, yet more difficult reform and fiscal consolidation
measures are needed if the improving cyclical conjuncture is to translate into more robust and
sustained medium-term growth. Strong German leadership in economic reform is also
essential because of the regional and global ramifications of its poor performance.
A modest cyclical recovery, driven by the rest of the world, is taking hold, but
47.
longer run prospects continue to be of concern. With sustained wage moderation and
efforts underway by social partners to make labor markets more flexible, competitiveness has
improved and exports are responding well to increased world demand. The recovery,
however, remains unbalanced, with domestic demand still dormant. The external impulse is
expected eventually to lead to a revival in investment and consumption, but these links may
be somewhat weaker than in previous German recoveries. In any event, the longer run is of
increasing concern as potential output growth is constrained by poor labor utilization
compounded by population aging, which will accelerate sharply after 2010—just one
business cycle away—and impose a crushing burden on the economy.
Agenda 2010 represents a forceful start of needed reforms in Germany but will
48.
need to be augmented to ensure that demographic changes do not stifle growth.
Managing a redistributive state is much more difficult in a slow-growing economy with an
aging population, increasing the urgency of taking action. It is encouraging, therefore, that
policymakers have started to focus on the need to adapt the welfare system and increase
potential growth by bolstering labor utilization through sharpened incentives to work.
At the same time, with public debt on a disturbing upward trend, fiscal
49.
consolidation should be given renewed impetus. The 2004 general government deficit will
remain well above the Maastricht reference ratio for the third consecutive year. Although
durable measures are being implemented to reduce expenditure, these have been offset by tax
cuts. Nonetheless, the high deficit is also a legacy of insufficient expenditure restraint during
previous upswings. Achieving small surpluses over the cycle will ease the pressure from debt
and put Germany in a better position to face looming demographic changes.
The improved near-term outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate fiscal
50.
consolidation and structural reform that should not be missed. Complementing fiscal
consolidation with labor market and entitlement reforms will not only stimulate important

- 37 -

synergies, but also provide the public assurance of the long-run sustainability of government
finances and the welfare state. Indeed, communicating a coherent forward-looking strategy
should also help revive confidence and support domestic demand in the near term.
The objective to reduce the structural deficit by at least 1½ percentage points of
51.
GDP over the period 2004-2006 remains appropriate. Measures that are projected to yield
about one-third of this improvement are already in the pipeline. Hence, additional durable
measures––yielding about one percentage point of GDP—still need to be implemented to
meet the 2004-2006 objective. Of this, policy measures totaling about ⅓ percentage point of
GDP need to be adopted before the 2005 budget is finalized to lower the deficit below
3 percent of GDP. Additional measures of this magnitude strike the right balance between
putting the deficit on a clear downward path and avoiding undue strain on the recovery. After
2006, further steps of at least ½ percentage point of GDP per year would then be needed until
a small structural surplus is achieved.
Larger cuts in tax expenditures and subsidies are the most promising avenue to
52.
obtain durable consolidation. Using a broad definition, these have been identified to
amount to as much as 6 percent of GDP by a high-level bipartisan commission, but the
agreed reductions so far have been very small. Equity and efficiency consideration call for a
more far-reaching approach and the plans to abolish residential property subsidies are thus
welcome. A targeted approach is also required because it will help reduce the reliance on
across-the-board expenditure restraint, which will be difficult to sustain over the medium run.
With the German entitlement system largely based on payroll taxes, and in view
53.
of population aging, entitlement reforms are key to creating jobs and growth. The
government’s caution about additional tax reforms is thus appropriate because entitlement
reforms that contain payroll taxes are the more pressing priority. Moderate budget surpluses
should be accompanied by pension and health care reforms to address the impending costs of
aging.
•

In the pension system, the recent adoption of the sustainability factor that links the
pension benefit replacement rate to the old-age dependency ratio, and steps to raise the
effective retirement age, were necessary and important, but are insufficient to balance
the system in the long run. Absent further reform, the payroll tax burden is still expected
to reach onerous proportions, likely stifling economic growth. Therefore, as is
increasingly accepted, the statutory retirement age will have to be raised in line with
longer life expectancy. Indeed, with weak domestic demand, greater emphasis needs to
be put on raising retirement ages rather than measures that reduce household income.
Employees should also be allowed to work longer if they wish to do so, without being
financially penalized.

•

In the health care system, efforts could usefully focus on improving supply and
funding. Progress so far has focused on transferring selected costs to users and
containing demand. The next stage of reform needs to target rigidities in the supply of

- 38 -

health care, and the measure being considered by the government, such as allowing hospitals
to decide for themselves what services they provide, and liberalizing the pharmacy sector,
deserve broad support. It will also be crucial to break the link between health care financing
and wages.
Improving budget institutions and intergovernmental fiscal relations can
54.
provide incentives for better fiscal management. The central tenets need to focus on
enhancing transparency, establishing firmer commitments among different levels of
government, and introducing a degree of competition in fiscal federalism, thereby improving
fiscal discipline and the allocation of resources between the levels of government and among
the Länder. Valuable steps in this direction would include the adoption of accounting
conventions and fiscal rules that are more consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact, and
allowing lower levels of government additional degrees of freedom to raise revenue and
pursue independent—but deficit-constrained—expenditure policies. The fiscal sustainability
reports to be produced in the near future can be expected to further the public debate about
the reform of entitlement programs; having these reports drafted by an independent body will
boost their credibility.
The labor market is becoming more flexible but wage moderation and longer
55.
working hours alone are not sufficient to boost labor supply. The willingness of social
partners to adopt innovative wage bargaining agreements that tailor pay and working time to
local labor market conditions and global competitive pressures are laudable. Although this
has undoubtedly played a role in improving external performance, high long-term
unemployment, particularly among older workers and the less skilled, remains a major
concern, as does the low labor force participation in general. Further labor market
modifications are therefore necessary to cut unemployment and increase participation—
especially relevant in view of the already declining working age population. The continued
development of flexible wage and employment contracts, including for small and mediumsized enterprises, will be important in this regard.
The labor market reforms under Agenda 2010 are path breaking but they are
56.
not the last word in this critical area. The shortening of the duration in long-term
unemployment benefits and the reduction of their replacement rate are well-targeted. The
administrative arrangements for the program now need to be made robust so that it becomes
fully functional in early 2005. Familiarity with local conditions and close cooperation among
the implementing authorities will be vital to maximize the prospects for reintegrating the
long-term unemployed. Strict enforcement of job acceptance requirements will be important
to improve work incentives. Complementing this far-reaching reform with further pension
and health care reforms that allow lower payroll taxes will encourage job creation and labor
demand. Beyond these measures, it will also be important to take further steps to make hiring
and firing more flexible, and to support the trend toward greater flexibility by reducing
remaining central controls on wage bargaining.

57.
Germany has made good progress in liberalizing network industries and product
markets, but crafts and service sectors still need far-reaching liberalization. Improving
entry and exit conditions in service industries is important to stimulate investment and
employment in these labor intensive sectors of the economy. The liberalization of fees for
selected professions and the removal of barriers to entry in crafts need to be accelerated.
Germany’s support for multilateral trade liberalization, including in agriculture, is welcome.
The financial system has benefited from the cyclical recovery but fundamental
58.
reform has progressed only slowly. Profitability has rebounded, write-offs have become
less pressing, and higher asset prices have improved balance sheets. Supervision is being
strengthened and broadened, notably to reinsurance companies. Furthermore, innovations are
being introduced in the capital market. Nevertheless, certain key concerns noted in the 2003
FSAP exercise remain, notably the need for banks to improve their revenue efficiency
through the development of new business strategies, and for further restructuring in the life
insurance segment.
Most importantly, legal and regulatory impediments to market driven
59.
restructuring need to be addressed to foster structural change in the financial system.
Efforts to strengthen public sector banks—notably the Landesbanken—are being guided by
short-term rating concerns and narrow interests of lower levels of government. Instead, it
remains vital for the Länder to create legal frameworks that transform public sector banks
into joint-stock corporations, which would allow a better harnessing of market signals for
restructuring and strengthen the resilience of the banking system to shocks. In the insurance
sector, it will be important to broaden the supervisory focus beyond solvency margins. In this
regard, the mandatory 90:10 profit split with policy holders is not consistent with the
upcoming provisions of risk-based insurance supervision, and this is an opportune time to
abolish this regulation.
Germany’s statistics are adequate for surveillance. The steps to enhance the
60.
production and timeliness of financial sector soundness indicators are welcome. However,
some improvements could facilitate the monitoring of fiscal policy.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
61.
cycle.

Since January 1, 1999, Germany has been a member of the European Economic and
Monetary Union; the deutsche mark entered EMU at a value of DM 1.95583 per euro.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for reasons related to
security. In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), effective
December 2001, the authorities put into effect a series of measures freezing the accounts of
and banning payments in favor of the Taliban, listed terrorists, and persons and organizations
related to terrorism. Pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions and/or EU regulations,
restrictions are imposed on payments and transfers to Iraq, Libya, Zimbabwe, and certain
individuals in the Myanmar. EU sanctions are maintained against the assets of 13 persons
associated with Serbia and Montenegro.
The restrictions against individuals, organizations, or countries have been modified since the
last No. 144-(52/51) notification to the Fund.
VIII. Article IV Consultations:
Germany is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The staff report for the last Article IV
consultation (IMF Country Report No. SM/03/341) was discussed at EBM/03/100
(November 3, 2003).

APPENDIX II

GERMANY: STATISTICAL INFORMATION

Germany has a full range of statistical publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The authorities make full use of the Internet to facilitate online access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in
1999. Four significant gaps remain:
•

The absence of any pre-1970 ESA95 data complicates time series analysis.

•

Statistics on inventories are unavailable, depriving Germany of a key economic indicator.
In the national accounts statistics inventory accumulation is derived as a residual and
lumped together with the statistical discrepancy.

•

Flow-of-funds data for the 1970s and 1980s remain patchy. Also, flow-of-funds data are
published on an annual basis only and with a nine-month lag. More timely data would
facilitate monitoring balance sheet developments.

•

A bridge table between the general government data in the ESA95 classification and the
public sector data on an administrative basis should be published to facilitate fiscal
analysis.

As other euro-area countries, Germany does not publish quarterly general government
revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95)––such data would
considerably facilitate fiscal analysis.
Following the adoption of the ESA95 standard for fiscal reporting by member countries of
the European Union, Eurostat advised the IMF that the member countries would no longer
report cash data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The IMF
Statistics Department is collaborating with member states, Eurostat and the European Central
Bank to develop a fiscal data reporting system that accords with the accrual methodologies of
the ESA95 and the revised Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. On a test basis, the
Government Statistics Yearbook 2002 Supplement (accessible at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/comp.htm) shows data for Germany using
the new framework of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001: Central Government,
State and Local Government, and General Government (1999-2001).
The 2003 FSAP mission found that the availability and timeliness of financial soundness
indicators was relatively weak. The Bundesbank and the Banking Supervisory (BaFin) should
publish relevant statistics, focusing mainly on credit institutions and insurance companies,
and including at a minimum core indicators of asset quality, capital adequacy, earnings and
profitability, and liquidity. It would be useful to publish more statistics on off-balance sheet
activities of financial institutions, including notional amounts, market replacement values,
and bilaterally netted credit exposures. It would also be helpful to consider publishing
regularly a financial stability review, which has been found valuable in an increasing number
of countries.

APPENDIX III

GERMANY: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Germany’s general government net debt/GDP ratio is projected to increase slightly over
the next five years. The medium-term scenario is based on a moderate recovery of real
activity, and a gradual consolidation of the public finances. Real growth is assumed to pick
up to 2 ½ percent over the next two years as the level of GDP catches up to potential, and to
slowly subside thereafter. Fiscal adjustment measures introduced in early 2004 are expected
to keep primary spending constant in real terms over the coming three years. Important
savings are assumed to result from reforms in pensions and unemployment insurance,
yielding a slowdown in benefit growth. Staff’s fiscal projections in this respect are more
cautious than the those contained in the authorities’ Stability Program. Finally, average
interest rates on public debt are projected to decline somewhat over the coming years, as
high-coupon bonds of the early 1990s are retired. Under the baseline scenario, the net debt
ratio stabilizes at 63 percent of GDP from 2006 onward.
A renewed slowdown of activity poses a risk over the medium term. Staff’s growth
projections are somewhat higher than the historical average of the past 10 years, which was
weighed down by the strains of German unification. However, in a stress test that assumes a
two-year recession in 2005 and 2006, the net debt ratio would rise to around 77 percent. By
contrast, fiscal slippages have a smaller impact on the debt dynamics, as a two-standard
deviation shock to primary spending would raise the debt ratio to 67 percent. The debt ratio
stabilizes soon after the shock, similar to the other stress tests.
Germany’s fundamental vulnerability stems from aging. Spending on pensions and health
will begin to soar after 2010, in particular between 2020 and 2030 when the aging trend
reaches a climax. A recent pension reform helps slow the growth of benefits somewhat but
will likely prove insufficient. Raising the effective retirement age in line with higher life
expectancies will be paramount to ensure fiscal sustainability and healthy GDP growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Martin Fetherston
October 20, 2004
1.
This supplement reports on information that has become available since the issuance
of the staff report and reflects contacts with the authorities during the Annual Meetings in
early October 2004 and more recently. The new information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
Economic developments and outlook
2.
Monthly economic indicators show some tentative signs of firming in domestic
demand but a slowing in net export growth:
•

Retail sales in the third quarter of 2004 were up slightly from the previous quarter,
but still below activity of a year earlier. Value-added taxes in real terms also
increased slightly in the third quarter.

•

Business investment in machinery and equipment has resumed growing, albeit at a
moderate pace, as profitability continues to strengthen. However, construction
spending is still falling.

•

Employment on a seasonally adjusted basis increased slightly in the last four
monthly observations from May to August. However, labor supply also increased and
headline unemployment has risen by 0.1 percentage point to 9.9 percent (ILO
definition).

•

Manufacturing output and exports have been closely linked and have provided the
impetus behind growth this year, reflecting strong global demand for German capital
goods and machinery. Orders for manufactured goods, however, have slowed
somewhat in recent months, alongside export orders, from high levels earlier in the
year—consistent with moderating expectations for the coming months.

-2-

•

The IFO business climate index has declined somewhat from the first quarter of the
year, reflecting an easing of the expectations component of the index, while the
current business conditions component has remained stable. This development is
consistent with strong orders already on the books for exporters, but with increasing
concern about oil prices and the pace of global economic expansion leading into
2005. Indeed, the ZEW index of investor and analyst sentiment fell sharply in
October and is at a 16-month low.

3.
The rise in oil prices will affect Germany via lower external demand growth and
also as a supply shock. Through about mid-2004, the growth impulse for Germany from the
global expansion surprised on the upside. However, early indicators for the third quarter
showed the emergence of some softening, and the new sharp rise in oil prices to above
US$50 a barrel (which has triggered an update of WEO baseline assumptions) is now causing
a downward revision in output growth for 2005 in many trading partners—suggesting some
slowing in Germany’s net export growth next year. In addition, although the appreciation of
the euro had dampened considerably the rise in domestic energy prices in the early part of the
year, this effect is now receding and oil prices are also rising in euro terms. Thus, the risk
factor for the outlook involving oil mentioned in the staff report is now materializing.
4.
On balance, with domestic demand still fragile and export growth likely to slow,
the projections for output growth have been revised downward. Specifically, the staff
projection for real GDP growth is revised from 2.0 percent to 1.9 percent for 2004; and from
1.8 to 1.5 percent for 2005 (in line with the latest consensus forecast of the main German
research institutes for 2005). Even with these revisions, the growth outlook remains within
the range of 1½-2 percent for 2004 and 2005 envisaged by the authorities.1 The underlying
expansion from 2004 to 2005, corrected for the number of working days, is now just under
½ percentage point of GDP, down from an estimate of ⅔ percentage point in the staff report.2
5.
Inflation and wage setting continue to be moderate. Headline inflation in the
period July-September 2004 (annualized) was 1.5 percent; excluding energy it was
1.1 percent. Moreover, there has been no evidence of oil price increases spilling over into
wage setting behavior so far.
Fiscal developments and outlook
6.
In early October, the authorities issued a supplement to the 2004 federal
government budget, and obtained authorization to widen the borrowing requirement
for 2004. The supplementary budget reflects that tax revenue had been below original
1
2

The authorities expect growth to be at the upper limit of the range in 2004, as does the staff.

Corrected for working days, real GDP growth is projected to be 1.3 percent in 2004 and
1.7 percent in 2005.

-3-

budgetary projections, and that expenditure on unemployment benefits had been above
projections, leading to a larger deficit than was embedded in the 2004 budget. These effects
were already anticipated in the staff report projection of the 2004 general government deficit
of 3.9 percent of GDP, which remains unaltered.
7.
The revision to the growth outlook does not alter the key fiscal policy
recommendations for 2005 outlined in the staff report. Germany needs to take the
opportunity of the upswing to bring down the structural deficit and stem the rise in debt. In
the staff report, the structural deficit was projected to be cut by ½ percent of GDP in 2005 on
the basis of measures already in the pipeline (implemented in the 2004 budget) and some
one-time effects such as the normalization of Bundesbank profits from an unusually low
level in 2004. To attain the goal of reducing the structural deficit by at least 1½ percent of
GDP over the period 2004-2006, the staff recommended adopting additional policy measures
totaling about ⅓ percent of GDP for 2005 before the budget is finalized. With the downward
revision to growth, the overall general government deficit would then likely be 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2005, reflecting the free play of automatic stabilizers.
8.
Although near-term prospects have weakened, the staff continues to believe that
a structural adjustment of ¾ percentage point in 2005 is appropriate. In assessing the
tradeoffs, the staff is of the view that longer run considerations dominate the restraining
effect this adjustment will have on the recovery in the short run. Further, the latest source of
weakness is linked to a supply shock (oil prices) that may well be lasting. And, to the extent
that the additional fiscal measures focus on corporate subsidies and tax exemptions, this
would affect mainly buoyant profit income, mitigating the contractionary implications. Thus,
reducing the structural deficit and bringing underlying debt dynamics under firmer control,
combined with reforms to boost potential output growth, remains the priority. A clear
indication that Germany is consistently tackling its long-run challenges could also have
positive confidence effects. As adjustment was not pursued with sufficient vigor during the
last upswing, and with 2006 being an election year, postponing the additional adjustment
recommended for 2005 could lead to another missed opportunity to consolidate as the growth
rate returns to potential and the economy continues to recover.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 2, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Germany
On October 25, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Germany.1
Background
After three years of stagnation, a cyclical recovery, driven by strong external demand, is taking
hold. Profitability in nonfinancial firms has picked up and corporate balance sheets are being
repaired. However, firms remain cautious with their spending plans, and a poor job market is
dampening consumption demand, while demographic developments are beginning to affect
supply. Further, the rise in oil prices is also having a negative impact. On balance, headline
growth is projected to be 1.9 percent in 2004 and 1.5 percent in 2005, but after adjusting for a
larger number of working days in 2004 this still implies a moderate expansion in underlying
growth.
On the policy front, Germany has made important headway over the past year in addressing
deep-seated structural problems. The implementation of structural reforms under Agenda 2010
is on track despite significant popular opposition. Combined with improved wage flexibility,
reforms to lower reservation wages and strengthen job intermediation are making the labor
market more competitive. Important progress has also been made in the areas of pension and
health care reform. Further reforms will be needed to raise potential output growth and prepare
for population aging.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2The 2004 general government deficit will remain well above the Maastricht reference ratio for
the third consecutive year. Cumulative tax cuts amounting to nearly 1 percent of GDP in
2004-2005 have been only partially offset by durable measures to reduce expenditure. In
2005, the fiscal deficit is projected to be reduced from its current high level partly on account of
measures already agreed in connection with the 2004 budget and because of a normalization
of Bundesbank profits, which were unusually low in 2004. However, given the still fragile
recovery, and on current policies, the 2005 fiscal deficit is likely to remain above 3 percent of
GDP.
The financial sector is recovering and updated stress tests confirm the system’s resilience, but
progress in market-driven restructuring has been slow. Nevertheless, the banking system is in
a better position now to support the economic recovery.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the German authorities for their steadfast pursuit of the
reforms under Agenda 2010 and the progress being made in tackling long-standing structural
impediments. Notably, important strides have been made in pension and health care reform,
and in reforming unemployment benefits. On the fiscal front, progress has been more limited
as substantial tax cuts have not yet been fully compensated with expenditure restraint.
Therefore, fiscal challenges remain large, especially as population aging will impose a
substantial burden on the social security system. Indeed, with impending demographic
changes, reforms will need to be augmented to ensure that Germany’s improved cyclical
situation translates into higher and sustained long-term growth. A few Directors noted that
increasing potential output growth and stronger domestic demand would contribute to an
orderly reduction of global current account imbalances.
Directors welcomed the resumption of output growth, driven by strong exports, after three
years of stagnation. They concurred that the upswing is still not fully established, with
insufficient support from domestic demand. Nevertheless, growth is projected to accelerate in
2005 after adjusting for working day effects, but this pick-up is likely to be subdued given oil
price developments. Under this cautious prognosis, the risks appear to be broadly balanced.
Many Directors saw Germany’s external competitiveness position as strong, and commended
efforts by the authorities and social partners to make employment conditions more flexible,
which would help in transmitting the external growth impulse to employment and domestic
activity.
Most Directors urged the authorities to take the opportunity of the upswing to make progress in
fiscal consolidation. In view of the rising public debt and demographic challenges, they
considered that the authorities should aim to reduce the structural deficit by ¾ percentage
point of GDP in 2005. A few Directors, however, cautioned that additional fiscal adjustment at
this juncture could have a restraining effect on the recovery in the short run. A number of
Directors underscored that postponing adjustment again in 2005 would imply back-loading of
the fiscal effort and would put substantial pressure on public finances in the election year
2006. Directors also supported the authorities’ medium-term objective of reducing the fiscal
structural balance by a cumulative 1½ percentage point of GDP over the period 2004-06, and

-3encouraged continued structural adjustment thereafter until a small surplus is reached.
Directors noted that more progress will be needed in achieving durable cuts in tax expenditure
and subsidies, and felt that these items should continue to be the focus of fiscal adjustment.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts in reforming entitlement programs, where
they saw the potential for important synergies between bolstering output growth and improving
the public finances. They welcomed the steps that have been implemented to anticipate the
pressures on the economy from an aging population, including raising the effective retirement
age and the introduction of the sustainability factor in the pension system, as well as the
introduction of co-payments in the health system. However, some Directors encouraged the
authorities to pursue additional steps to deepen the entitlement reforms and limit payroll taxes
and other nonwage labor costs to further strengthen incentives for better labor utilization. In
this regard, Directors emphasized the importance of increasing the statutory retirement age
and bolstering further supply-side competition in the health care system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve budget institutions and
intergovernmental relations, which would facilitate sound fiscal management. Several Directors
agreed that a measured degree of competition between the states, including some enhanced
autonomy in revenue raising and allocating resources according to local needs, could enhance
efficiency and serve to stimulate accountability and budgetary discipline. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ intention to publish periodic fiscal sustainability reports based on calculations
made by independent experts, beginning in 2006. This should raise transparency, offer
pointers to strengthen long-run sustainability, and help make the public more aware of the
need for reform.
Directors commended the authorities for their important efforts in labor market reform—
especially to reduce long-term unemployment and increase labor force participation.
These aspects of the Agenda 2010 were essential to strengthen potential output, and they
would need to be complemented by additional steps to lower the costs of job protection
regulations, and support the trend toward greater flexibility in the system of collective wage
bargaining. Directors noted that the ultimate success of the labor market reforms, notably the
Hartz IV reforms, would now depend on strong implementation that is well-coordinated with the
sub-national governments.
Directors noted that Germany has made good progress in liberalizing network industries and
product markets, but encouraged the authorities to proceed more vigorously in creating
employment flexibility in the crafts and services sectors—including through improved entry and
exit conditions.
Directors welcomed the recent improvement in the financial system’s profitability, which has
benefited from the cyclical upswing and increased asset prices. They also noted the continued
and successful efforts to reduce costs in the system, but remarked that further progress is still
needed to strengthen revenue mobilization and reduce non-performing loans. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to follow through on the FSAP recommendations, and
welcomed their intention to publish a broader range of financial soundness indicators in line
with the Fund’s work in this area. They were pleased that some progress is underway with

-4restructuring in the public sector banking system in response to the impending removal of
government guarantees, including through back office cooperation and some consolidation.
However, although the financial system is now in a better position to support output growth, a
number of Directors noted that steps taken so far have been modest and that more
fundamental reforms are still needed. Directors reiterated their support for creating a legal
framework that reduces barriers to restructuring, both within and across the various public and
private pillars of the system. This would allow a better harnessing of market signals and
strengthen the resilience of the system to shocks. For the insurance sector, Directors
welcomed the broadening of supervision to reinsurance companies, and encouraged the
authorities to expand the supervisory focus beyond solvency margins in anticipation of the
upcoming EU-wide risk-based insurance supervision. Directors commended Germany’s
adherence to international standards against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors welcomed Germany’s strong support to bring the Doha round to a successful
conclusion, in particular with a comprehensive liberalization of agricultural markets and
unilateral concessions by industrial countries to the poorest members of the World Trade
Organization. They also welcomed Germany’s intentions to increase its official development
assistance.
