Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation

Executive Summary
Growth is slowing and core inflation rising. Supply-side constraints are emerging, with real
wages growing well above productivity. GDP growth is set to ease from 6½ to 5 percent in 2008,
while inflation is projected to remain outside the upper end of the band in 2008–09.
Policy tightening is warranted. Monetary policy should retain a tightening bias to prevent higher
inflation expectations from becoming entrenched and a prolonged tightening bias from causing
excessive appreciation in the future. The 2008 budget will, at best, be neutral, but the government
plans to cut the structural deficit by about ½ percent of GDP annually over the medium-term. This
will help safeguard external sustainability and maintain the zloty within its equilibrium range as
the current account deficit otherwise will approach the limit of what is safe. Staff suggest a threeyear fiscal framework to protect against pro-cyclical policy and broaden support for fiscal targets.
There is no evidence of the current turmoil spilling over through financial channels. Banks
are very profitable, have scant exposure to US sub-prime assets and structured products, and the
corporate bond market is small. While systemic vulnerabilities are limited, the unification of
supervision comes at a sensitive time and vigilance is needed during the transition period.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to work. Downside risks arising from the possibility of
stronger-than-expected external spillovers are broadly offset by risks that domestic demand will
be more robust than assumed. Should downside risk materialize, monetary tightening should
pause and the fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to work.
Boosting labor participation is essential for long-term growth prospects. Participation is low
and the scope for increasing utilization is being exhausted. Reforming generous provisions for
early retirement and for disability payments is of highest priority, and reducing the tax wedge at
lower incomes and reforming the agricultural pension system could also boost participation.
The authorities will set a timetable for euro adoption once they deem that the conditions for
success have been established.

I. INTRODUCTION1
1.
Poland is experiencing strong and well-balanced growth, in large part because of
rapid financial deepening and an EU accession related investment boom. So far, the
recovery has resulted in only limited upward pressure on core inflation and the external
current account deficit. Similarly, the zloty remains within the estimated equilibrium range.
2.
Resource constraints are, however, beginning to emerge, especially in the labor
market, where real wage growth has outpaced productivity for some time. The recent
steady increase in core inflation suggests that scope for continuing to absorb unit labor costs
(ULCs) by squeezing profit margins is diminishing. And with limited observed spillovers
thus far from the slowdown in major industrial countries, GDP growth is set to remain at or
above potential, increasing the risk of a wage-price spiral. Cost pressures could also erode
competitiveness and lead to a faster deterioration in the current account than seen in recent
years.
3.
Against this background, discussions with the newly elected government focused
on the dual challenge of containing demand pressures and strengthening the economy’s
supply response. As to the former, the main topics included spillovers from the financial
market turmoil, the appropriate near-term monetary and fiscal policy stance, and the need for
fiscal consolidation over the medium term. On the supply side, the focus was on the role of
the financial sector, the scope for boosting Poland’s exceptionally low labor participation,
and the prospect for accelerating catch-up gains in productivity through liberalization and
privatization. Discussions also focused on the frameworks for fiscal policy and financial
sector supervision.
II. STRONG GROWTH CONTINUED IN 2007, BUT BOTTLENECKS HAVE EMERGED
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
After years of sluggish performance, Poland enjoyed a second year of strong
economic growth in 2007 (Table 1). The upturn has been underpinned by robust and wellbalanced growth as EU accession has bolstered business confidence and spurred a longawaited rise in investment. Meanwhile, private consumption has remained strong, driven by
rapidly rising real wages, increasing employment, and record-high credit growth, but also tax
cuts. The external sector, however, has become an increasing drag on the economy since
mid-2006. This, and incipient signs of a gradual slowing in GDP growth, likely reflect
emerging capacity constraints.

A team comprising of Mr. Thomsen (head), Mr. Hoffmaister, Ms. Allard, and Mr. Annett (all EUR) and
Mr. Galizia (MCM) visited Warsaw during January 14–21, 2008; an advance team arrived on January 9.
Messrs. Rosenberg and Sierhej, from the Warsaw Regional Office, supported the work of the mission. Poland is
an Article VIII country (Appendix I). Data provision is adequate for surveillance (Appendix II).

The output gap is closing and labor markets are tightening. Capacity utilization
indicators have reached record-high levels, and staff estimates that GDP growth is still
running above potential, despite the rise in investment in recent years. Pressures are
particularly evident in labor markets. Driven by plummeting unemployment, wage growth
reached close to 10 percent in the fourth quarter (year-on-year), and real wage growth
continues to significantly outstrip productivity gains. Labor shortages have been
compounded by continuous emigration to Western Europe since EU accession.

Demand pressures are beginning to affect inflation. Headline CPI inflation has
been increasing since 2006, reaching 4¼ percent (year-on-year) in January 2008, despite
some appreciation of the zloty. This lies not only well above the National Bank of Poland’s
(NBP’s) inflation target of 2½ percent, but also above the 1½–3½ percent band. Until the Fall
of 2007, this increase almost entirely reflected soaring food and energy prices, and core
inflation remained stable as rising ULCs were absorbed by lower profit margins, which had
been boosted by wage restraint in the first half of the decade. Core inflation has edged up
during the last six months, suggesting that the scope for squeezing profit margins is
narrowing. Consistent with this, market-based indicators suggest that inflation expectations
remained well-anchored through most of 2007, but began to pick up toward the end of the
year.

The underlying current account balance is defined as the balance that would result, at prevailing market
exchange rates, if all countries were operating at their respective potential output levels. It is estimated using
trade equations. The methodology is described in Bayoumi and Faruquee, 1998, Chapter V of “Exchange Rate
Assessment, Extensions of the Macroeconomic Balance Approach,” IMF Occasional Paper 167.

This assessment draws on preliminary CGER estimates suggesting that the estimated deviations from the
equilibrium real exchange rate are within the margin of error of the estimation.

B. Economic Policies
8.
Adjusting for cyclical factors, there was a fiscal tightening of about ¾ percent of
GDP in 2007 (Table 5). Expenditures were below budgeted limits at both state and local
levels, an under-execution that largely reflected difficulties in carrying out public
investments, including those related to EU funds. At the same time, strong cyclically-driven
tax collections contributed to a substantially lower-than-budgeted general government deficit
of 2½ percent of GDP, a full ½ percent of GDP below the 2007 Convergence Program target.

9.
A monetary tightening cycle is underway. Reflecting the Monetary Policy
Council’s (MPC)’s concern about rising inflation, policy interest rates have been raised six
times since April 2007 and now stand at 5½ percent. Simultaneously, the zloty has
appreciated in response to a widening spread of domestic interest rates over euro and dollar
interest rates. Nonetheless, monetary conditions have loosened, as the increase in nominal
rates have not prevented real interest rates from falling in the face of accelerating inflation.
Besides liquidity management operations (including repos), the NBP has continued

8
to refrain from directly intervening in foreign exchange markets although international
reserves have increased since 2004 as a result of EU transfers and re-evaluation.

III. OUTLOOK: GRADUALLY SLOWING OUTPUT GROWTH, BUT INFLATIONARY RISKS
REMAIN
12.
Economic growth is expected to continue to ease in 2008. Staff and the authorities
agreed that the slowdown evident in the data would continue. Staff’s baseline scenario shows
growth slowing to 5 percent, compared to the authorities’ projection of 5–5½ percent. In

Inflationary pressures will remain high, and could possibly increase. Pressures on
prices are expected to remain elevated, despite the growth slowdown, in line with emerging
supply-side constraints under the baseline scenario. Upward pressures could be magnified by
secondary effects from the large food and energy price increases last year still in the pipeline.
In view of these considerations, staff projects that, absent further tightening, inflation will
systematically exceed the upper end of the plus/minus 1 percent inflation band round the
NBP’s central inflation target in 2008–09. NBP projections also show such an overshooting.

14.
The outlook for growth is subject to increasing uncertainty, but risks appear
equally balanced. Staff agrees that there is some upside risk stemming from the possibility
that investments will not slow as much in face of cost pressures as assumed in the baseline
scenario. On the other hand, downside risks—arising from the possibility of larger-thanexpected spillovers from the weakening external environment, through both real and
financial channels—are also clearly present. At this juncture, staff believes that these risks
are broadly balanced, and that the problem already evident in the data of gradually emerging
resource constraints, with decelerating growth and accelerating core inflation, will most
likely remain the key challenge facing policy makers. This assessment drives staff’s
recommendations to tighten policies, as discussed below. Clearly, should the aforementioned
downside risks materialize—to such an extent that stronger-than-expected negative external
spillovers cause growth to fall below potential and inflationary pressures to ease—a pause in
the tightening cycle of monetary policy would be warranted. In that case, there would also be
scope for some fiscal support to activity, by allowing the automatic fiscal stabilizers to
operate.
15.
Looking to the medium term, the external current account deficit is expected to
widen (Table 9). While the deficit is currently well contained—and the zloty is within its
equilibrium range—it is projected to gradually increase but remain below the upper limit of
what is safe. In this regard, however, the experience of other countries in the region suggests
that some downside risks, especially if consumption growth fails to moderate. This could be
the case if expectations of persistently large income gains and increased access to consumer

12
financing, possibly fueled by large capital inflows, trigger greater consumption smoothing.
The additional fiscal consolidation discussed below would thus serve to reduce external
vulnerabilities.

labor market constraints.
17.
Staff felt that, on balance, a continuation of the tightening cycle was warranted
at this time. This was in line with the baseline scenario’s assumption of increasing resource
constraints. Staff was particularly concerned that the emergence of a wage-price spiral was
heightening the risk of increased inflation becoming entrenched in inflation expectations. In
this regard, it warned that the entrenchment of inflation around the upper end of the band
could fuel market expectations of a prolonged tightening bias, triggering additional capital
inflows and attendant upward pressures on the zloty. In advocating a tightening, staff was
guided by the assessment that the international capital market turmoil will neither prompt a
major tightening of monetary conditions nor pose any significant risks to the banking system.
V. SUSTAINED FISCAL CONSOLIDATION REQUIRED
18.
The 2008 budget implies a small fiscal stimulus. On unchanged policies, and
predicated on staff’s baseline growth scenario, the budget submitted to parliament by the
previous administration implies a widening of the fiscal deficit in 2008 by about ¼ percent of
GDP as the continued buoyancy of fiscal revenues is more than offset by a number of
expansionary measures. There was agreement that this stimulus was unfortunate under the
current circumstances. The authorities explained, however, that exacting constitutional
deadlines meant that only minor corrections to the inherited 2008 budget had been feasible.
While they ruled out a mid-year supplementary budget and saw little scope for underexecuting expenditures, they were confident of a better-than-budgeted outcome on account of
continued revenue buoyancy, suggesting that any fiscal stimulus would be small.

19.
The government intends to accelerate fiscal consolidation over the medium term,
targeting a deficit of one percent of GDP by 2011. Such a target would be consistent with
Poland’s commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. It would entail a reduction in the
structural deficit of about ½ percent of GDP annually, considerably more than the cumulative
reduction of ¾ percent of GDP over the four-year period envisaged under the previous
government’s Convergence Program The authorities noted that this, in combination with
stepped-up privatization, would secure a reduction in public debt of 4–7 percent of GDP by
2011.

The fiscal consolidation will be focused on the expenditure side. The new target
would be consistent with expenditure continuing to grow by about 4 percent a year. To
accommodate EU-funded capital spending and the government’s desire to cut taxes,
however, current spending will need to slow more substantially (Box 1). Moreover,
considering that non-discretionary spending amount to about 70 percent of total spending and
that wages in important parts of the public sector are subject to considerable upward pressure
due to shortages caused by emigration, staff noted that the consolidation would likely entail
streamlining benefit programs. Senior officials acknowledged that this would be desirable,
but cautioned that it was too early in the new government’s term for detailed plans to have
been developed and approved. They did, however, note that cutting taxes would be
subordinated achieving the medium-term deficit target.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Effects of European Union Transfer to the New Member States1/
European Union (EU) funds are poised to play a substantial role in macroeconomic outcomes
of the new member states. Estimates for eight new member states (NMS) in Central and
Eastern Europe—those that acceded in 2004—place EU transfers in excess of 3 percent of
GDP annually during 2007–13.
Simulation results using the Fund’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF)—
modified to account for ongoing income catch-up in NMS—shed light on the channels though
which these funds affect the economy and their impact on resource allocation:
•

Income convergence gains depend critically on the share of EU funds funneled to
productive public investment. Funds devoted to income support—a temporary
demand shock—have limited and short-lived output effects, while those resulting in
productive public investment—a long-lived supply shock—boost capital
accumulation, productivity gains and eventually long run growth.

•

Initially, as EU funds boost income, resources are shifted to the nontraded goods
sector, whose demand increases as income rises. Over time, however, productive
public investment increases domestic competitiveness, and thus gradually production
shifts back to the tradable sector. Meanwhile, the real exchange rate depreciates, as
the productivity gains give these countries a competitive edge on foreign markets,
thereby alleviating the potential for Dutch disease effects.

Poland, would also benefit from taking advantage of the period of EU funds inflow to
consolidate its fiscal position. Saving the fiscal revenue generated by the growth boost would
entail a substantial decline in the public debt ratio over the medium run. Moreover, by
gradually substituting other current spending with EU-financed public investment, the
authorities could rebalance public expenditure from non-discretionary spending toward capital
spending and thereby mitigate the negative macroeconomic impact of fiscal retrenchment.

21.
The more ambitious fiscal consolidation path will have numerous advantages.
The authorities underscored the need to establish appropriate cyclical safety margins in terms
of the Maastricht deficit, and create space for planned tax cuts and public investment within
the context of the adjustment program. Staff noted the added benefit of relieving pressure on
monetary policy by letting fiscal policy assume a greater share of the stabilization burden.
This is particularly important considering that an over-reliance on monetary policy to deal
with demand pressures could entice capital inflows, exacerbating upward pressures on the
zloty. Staff also argued that a more ambitious path of fiscal consolidation would help
safeguard external sustainability by dampening a medium-term current account deficit that is
currently envisaged to approach the upper bound of what is sustainable.
22.
There was agreement that Poland has room for allowing automatic stabilizers to
work in a downturn. Should the downside risks to the baseline growth scenario materialize
because of larger-then-anticipated negative external spillovers, the medium-term adjustment
trajectory could be lengthened to facilitate greater fiscal support to activity. The still
comfortable external current account deficit affords room for maneuver in this regard.
23.
The authorities recognized the need to strengthen the medium-term fiscal
framework. Staff noted that the current framework lags best practice. In particular, its focus
on annual budgets—with the medium-term targets agreed with the EU having little bearing
on annual targets—lends a somewhat myopic slant to fiscal policy. To guard against a procyclical policy, staff suggested rolling three-year nominal expenditure ceilings that would not
be adjusted as macroeconomic circumstances change. A three-year framework could possibly
also broaden political support for medium term targets and spending priorities, and
strengthen the efficiency of spending financed by EU funds, especially if lower levels of
government were included. The authorities agreed that the annual focus was a weakness, but
noted that fiscal policy is anchored by a constitutional limit on public debt and that strict
procedures prevent revenue windfalls from being spent. They also felt that the advantage of a
fully-fledged medium-term framework would be limited as long as non-discretionary
expenditures remain very high. Overall, they welcomed staff’s suggestions and expressed
interest in further exploring options in this area.
VI. LIMITED FINANCIAL SECTOR VULNERABILITIES AND SUPERVISION
24.
Financial sector risks are limited. The authorities noted that the rapid expansion of
credit has been associated with some reduction in capital adequacy ratios. However, they also
noted that the banking system remained well capitalized and profitable, the overall share of
foreign liabilities is small, and the current financial market turmoil has so far had scant
impact on Polish markets. Stress tests suggest only limited systemic risks from major
external shocks, with all but a small number of banks able to absorb losses fully from
income. A potential vulnerability arises from the mismatch between longer-term foreign
currency denominated-assets (mostly variable-rate mortgages) and shorter-term liabilities in
the banking system. In this regard, since some of the major international banks that are

16
affected by the turmoil are active in Poland, one concern is the risk that they could curtail
lending to their Polish subsidiaries. The authorities noted, however, that there was no
evidence of this so far and that the high profitability of the subsidiaries made it unlikely that
the parent group would pull back. While a few banks that have relied heavily on external
lending to expand credit could find difficult to rollover such liabilities, the authorities saw no
broader systemic risk in this regard.
25.
The recent consolidation of supervisory functions comes at a difficult time. The
unification was completed on January 1, 2008 when the NBP’s banking supervision
department was merged into the Financial Supervision Authority (KNF). In discussing
operational aspects of the new unified agency, discussions focused on two issues identified
during the 2006 FSAP:
•

Ensuring a smooth transfer of banking supervision from the NBP to the KNF.
Responding to staff concerns, the authorities noted that the two bodies had signed an
operational memorandum governing the exchange of information, and that existing
processes and procedures, safety net arrangements, and human resources had been
retained. Consequently, the ability to monitor and respond in a timely and
comprehensive manner had not been impaired. They also noted that a confidential
tripartite memorandum of understanding between the ministry of finance, the NBP
and the KNF on financial stability had been signed—this memorandum included an
agreement to update financial stability arrangements in line with EU-level
commitments.

•

Strengthening the autonomy and governance of the KNF. Staff argued that
appointment and dismissal procedures for members of the KNF’s board felt short of
best practice by providing few safeguards against political interference. Introducing
fixed terms of appointment would help ensure that board members, once appointed,
remained independent and served only in their technical capacity. While
acknowledging the issue in principle, the authorities felt that the autonomy of the
KNF was unlikely to be undermined in practice and that this was not the time to
address these governance concerns.
VII. ENHANCING GROWTH AND FLEXIBILITY, AND EURO ADOPTION

26.
Boosting the labor force holds the key to long-term growth prospects. The
authorities recognized that Poland’s exceptionally low labor participation—especially among
those above 50 years of age—was a major obstacle to long-term growth (Figure 2), and that
increasing labor supply meant reforming the generous provisions for early retirement, bettertargeting disability benefits, and further reducing the tax wedge, especially at lower levels of
income. They had not yet formulated concrete plans, however. Staff also pointed to the need
to reform the farmer’s pension scheme (KRUS), with the ultimate goal of merging it into the
general scheme. It noted that the experience of several EU member countries—including

17
Ireland and the Netherlands—has shown that incremental reforms can have a significant
long-term impact on labor participation, especially in the context of social partnership
frameworks (Box 2).
27.
Product market liberalization and privatization will be high on the agenda. The
authorities recognized that Poland lags its peers in this area. They explained that the new
government has given priority to cutting red tape and reinvigorating the stalled privatization
program, stressing that they intend to take early action in this regard to secure catch-up gains
in productivity. Staff welcomed this, noting that labor-supply enhancing policies tended to be
more effective in the context of liberal product markets.
28.
The authorities are committed to euro adoption as soon as circumstances permit.
They recognized that Poland’s preparedness to join and subsequently thrive in the EMU will
hinge on curtailing the economy’s susceptibility to country-specific shocks, and on furthering
its adaptability to such shocks. They felt that both their focus on macroeconomic stability and
their broad reform priorities meant that such preparedness was set to steadily improve. They
stressed, however, the importance of ensuring that all the necessary conditions were met on a
sustainable basis before establishing a rigid timetable for entering ERM2 (Figure 3). Staff
supported the authorities’ plans in this regard.

18
Box 2. What Can Poland Learn from Other EU Countries Regarding Labor Market
Reforms? 1/
Over the past quarter century, Ireland and the Netherlands have seen their unemployment rates
fall more sharply, and their employment rates rise more steeply, than any other EU country.
After an initial crisis, both countries propelled themselves to the top of the class in terms of
labor market outcomes. They did this on the back of an internally consistent nexus of reforms
that complemented and reinforced each other. Interestingly, Poland’s situation today in terms
of employment, unemployment, and participation is similar to that of Ireland in early 1980s, on
the eve of its reform program.
The reform program in Ireland and the Netherlands focused on boosting labor supply. In both
countries, this was attained by coordinated agreements between the social partners, where the
effects of lower nominal wage growth were mitigated by labor tax cuts. Both countries had
legacies of relatively liberal labor and product markets.
These results are supported by cross-country econometric evidence. Wage moderation tends to
be affected by such factors as the tax wedge, benefits, the government wage bill, and degree of
coordination or centralization in the wage-setting process. At the same time, low levels of
product and labor market regulation allow this wage moderation to kindle vigorous private
sector employment growth.
Poland could benefit significantly from a strategy of boosting labor supply in the context of a
social partnership framework, especially in light of its high tax wedges and benefits, as well as
its extensive product market regulation. As a simple thought experiment based on the panel
econometric results, if Poland moved instantaneously to the position of Ireland for the key
institutional variables—tax wedge, disability benefits, government wage bill, product market
regulation, employment protection legislation, and wage bargaining coordination/
centralization—the private sector employment rate would climb by 9½ percentage points over
three years, erasing 60 percent of the difference between the two countries in this variable. In
terms of magnitude, product market regulation and the tax wedge are the most important
variables contributing to the employment increase.

VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Poland is enjoying strong and well-balanced economic growth with no serious
domestic and external imbalances so far. Core inflation remains low, the external current
account deficit is comfortable, and the zloty is within its estimated equilibrium range.
30.
But emerging supply constraints point to a dual challenge of limiting demand
pressures while tackling obstacles to long-term growth. Slower growth and rising core
inflation suggest that the recovery is beginning to run up against supply-side constraints.

19
Preventing cost pressures from impairing investment and competitiveness while boosting
potential growth—not least through measures aimed at increasing the exceptionally low labor
participation—should be the overarching objectives as the new coalition government
formulates its economic program in the coming months.
31.
External spillovers are unlikely to eliminate the need for policy tightening. There
is no evidence of significant spillovers through financial channels at this stage. While exports
are likely to slow, growth is set to remain at or above potential, with real wages still running
well ahead of productivity. Thus, staff’s baseline requires policy tightening. While the risk of
a fundamentally different outlook—with below-potential growth calling for further policy
tightening to be put on hold—can certainly not be dismissed, there is little evidence of this at
this time.
32.
The MPC should move quickly to bring inflation back to target, by maintaining
a tightening bias in monetary policy. Staff is particularly concerned that inflationary
expectations could get entrenched at elevated levels if a wage-price spiral takes hold, making
it more costly—in terms of lower output growth—to bring inflation back to target. It is also
concerned that expectations of a prolonged tightening bias could exert upward excessive
pressure on the zloty. Thus, the uncertainty relating to the external outlook notwithstanding,
it is too early to pause the tightening cycle.
33.
In recommending further tightening, staff has taken into account that the
banking system remains strong and that the turmoil in international capital markets
poses no notably heightened systemic risks. Still, the unification of regulatory functions
under the auspices of the KNF comes at a difficult time, and the authorities should give
priority to ensuring that this does not impair timely and effective supervision. A particular
concern in this regard is the need to ensure that current operational procedures remain in
place and that existing staff are retained.
34.
The new government’s commitment to reducing the structural fiscal deficit to
1 percent of GDP over the medium-term is welcome. While it would have been desirable
for the 2008 budget to advance this process, the relaxation is small and the new government
admittedly had little time to approve a more appropriate budget. Looking beyond 2008, the
more ambitious consolidation path will increase the scope for automatic stabilizers to work.
In this regard, should external spillovers cause growth to drop below potential, there would
be a case for delaying the consolidation and allow the counter-cyclical impulse from such
stabilizers. The stronger consolidation will also provide an additional cushion against
excessive external imbalances, which is important since the current account deficit is set to
gradually increase to the upper bounds of what is sustainable from a long-term perspective.
35.
Fiscal consolidation would need to focus on the expenditure side. While the new
government is still in the process of formulating detailed plans, staff welcomes indications
that lowering the deficit will take priority over cutting taxes. Priority should be given to

20
streamlining socially sensitive benefit programs, considering the high level of nondiscretionary spending, and staff is encouraged by the support for this difficult task among
senior officials. In this regard, strengthening the fiscal framework by introducing three-year
rolling spending limits could not only provide a safeguard against pro-cyclical fiscal policy,
but could also help mobilize broader and more durable political and social support for an
expenditure-based consolidation program.
36.
Increasing the exceptionally-low labor participation is key to long-term growth
prospects. Reforming generous provisions for early retirement, reducing the tax wedge, and
reforming the farmer’s pension scheme should be a priority. In this area as well, staff is
encouraged by the ideas and preliminary plans of senior officials, although it understands that
changes will be socially sensitive. In this regard, the experience of other EU countries
demonstrate that incremental progress in all of these areas could result in a significant
increase in participation over the long run. The authorities should also be mindful that these
measures will have highly complementary effects in that they will also facilitate fiscal
consolidation.
37.
Structural reforms could boost productivity. Higher labor utilization has accounted
for most of the increase in output, with a relatively modest contribution from productivity
gains. It should, therefore, be a priority to ensure that the waning scope for increasing labor
utilization is offset by a gradual strengthening of productivity. In this regard, Poland is
lagging its peers as far as the business climate is concerned, and there appears to be scope for
realizing additional catch-up gains in productivity through further deregulation and
privatization. The authorities’ determination to restart the privatization program is therefore
much welcomed.
38.
Overall, the medium-term outlook is very favorable. The improvement in the
investment climate that has followed EU accession, the prospect of increasing EU funds, the
new government’s commitment to reinvigorate reforms, and—not least—its determination to
adopt the euro as soon as circumstances permit, all augur well for Poland’s ability to take full
advantage of its EU membership and ensure that income convergence continues apace.
39.

It is recommended that the Article IV consultation remain on a 12-month cycle.

1/ The main reasons for the increase in international reserves since 2004 are an accumulation of EU transfers held in euros in the
Ministry of Finance's account at the NBP, the appreciation of the euro against the dollar and, in 2007, a repo operation ($5.3 billion)
that will be reversed in 2008.
2/ By remaining maturity.
3/ Exports of goods and services.
4/ Excluding repurchase of debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent Euro and 45 percent
U.S. dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl 1 equaling old
Zl 10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around the
central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially appreciated
by about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate was allowed
to appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the central parity was
raised by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual exchange rate to
appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of crawl was
reduced to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its upper limit,

3
the newly-formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band from
±7 percent to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from one percent
to 0.8 percent per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of depreciation
was cut from 0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly rate of
depreciation was reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys trading
band was widened to 12.5 percent. On March 25, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was widened
to ±15 percent, and the rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On
December 31, 1999, the official rate was PLN 4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the
crawling band regime was abolished and the zloty has since floated freely.
Poland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed
by Poland solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been
notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). Those exchange
restrictions are contained in the following legal instruments:
•

Council Regulation (EC) No. 2488/2000 of November 14, 2000, as amended
(freezing of funds and economic resources of former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and certain other natural persons).

•

•

Council Regulation (EC) No. 1763/2004 of October 14, 2004, as amended (freezing
of funds and economic resources of certain persons indicted by the International

VIII.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on October 4, 2006. In concluding the
consultation, Directors welcomed the upswing in the Polish economy that has been
developing since mid-2005, but encouraged the authorities to move decisively to increase the
flexibility of the economy, resume the privatization process and help secure a favorable
setting for Euro adoption. Directors expressed concerns about governance in the new law on
financial supervision and urged the authorities to send a strong signal in the implementation
of the legislation by committing to high standards of supervision.

Appendix II. POLAND: Statistical Issues
1.
Poland has a comprehensive macroeconomic database that has been improving in
recent years and is adequate for surveillance. The authorities publish a full range of
economic and financial statistics, and cooperate fully in providing data to the Fund. Data on
the core indicators are available on a timely basis (see the attached Table of Common
Indicators Required for Surveillance). Consistent with its commitment to provide a
comprehensive set of high quality data, in an open manner, the country subscribes to the
IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics
2.
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles a wide range of real sector statistics,
most of which are published promptly in the monthly Statistical Bulletin. The main problems
for users include (i) the short span of comparable data series, reflecting the upheavals
associated with transition to a market economy; (ii) inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data, reflecting differences in weights and in coverage; and (iii) lack of
easy electronic retrieval of these data.
3.
The national accounts follow the concepts and definitions of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which is based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA
1993). The GUS compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates by the production and
expenditure approaches in current and constant prices, a full set of accounts by institutional
sectors, supply and use tables, input/output tables, annual financial accounts, and regional
accounts. The statistical techniques are basically sound. The constant price estimates are
compiled in average prices of the previous year, using deflation techniques that generally
follow international standards. However, national accounts data still have some problems—
the subannual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed. In addition, seasonal adjustment on
relatively short period leads to frequent and large backward revisions.
4.
The concepts and definitions of the CPI follow the ESA 95 standards and Eurostat’s
requirements for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index. The CPI does not cover the imputed
rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The weights for the index are obtained from the average
annual expenditures primarily taken from the national Household Budget Survey (HBS) of
the previous calendar year, and are updated annually. From 1999 onwards, the national
classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP). The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural
areas. Historical series are constructed using a chain method. Time series data are available
for the index with reference periods of 1990 and 1998.
5.
The producer price index (PPI) is based on the 1993 SNA concepts and definitions for
recording and valuation of product prices and weights. Its scope includes mining and
quarrying, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Output price indices are also
calculated for agriculture, construction, and business services such as transport, storage, and

8
communication. Since 2000, the index is classified by the Polish Classification of Activities
based on the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European
Communities, first revision (NACE, Rev.1), the Classification of Products by Activity, and
the List of Products of the European Communities. The PPI does not include any estimation
for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government finance statistics
6.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides detailed monthly state budget data on its
website, compiled on a cash basis. Fiscal data for other levels of government are published or
provided to IMF missions on a less frequent basis. Consolidated general government data are
published only on an annual basis, at the time of the budget, as an estimated outturn at the
time of the preparation of the next budget, and as the final outturn in late spring of the
following year. The limited breakdown of expenditure by category hinders fiscal analysis
and identification of priority areas for fiscal consolidation; consequently they play a very
limited role in the public policy debate, although non-state budget expenditure accounts for a
large share of general government expenditure.
7.
Data for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are reported to the
Fund on a regular basis and, since 2004, according to the framework of GFSM 2001. The
authorities have provided comparable data, compiled on an accrual basis, for 2001–03.
Monthly cash data on consolidated core operations of the central government are reported in
the GFSM 2001 cash flow statement for the IFS. The Central Statistical Office also produces
fiscal data according to the ESA95 methodology for submission to the EU and use in
Poland’s Stability Programs. However, GFS and ESA95 data, while providing a superior
classification of revenues and expenditure, traditionally became available with long lags and
only on an annual basis, diminishing their value for surveillance purposes.1
Monetary statistics
8.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) regularly reports analytically useful data to the
Fund with minimal delay. High-frequency data (every ten days) on the central bank balance
sheet and the monetary survey are also available with minimal delay. As a member of the
European Union, the country has adopted the recommendations of the European Central
Bank (ECB) for the compilation of monetary and financial statistics; data compiled from
March 2002 onward are generally consistent with the ECB framework, and previously
released data have been revised back to December 1996.
9.
The mission that prepared the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in January 2003 found that the concepts and definitions used
by the NBP to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the guidelines
outlined in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Nevertheless, the
following concepts and principles underlying valuation and classification of financial
1

In 2007, STA and Eurostat finalized bridging the annual ESA and GFS data for all EU countries.

9
instruments deviate from the MFSM: (i) financial derivatives are indistinguishably recorded
under other assets/other liabilities; (ii) accrued interest on loans and deposits are included as
part of other assets/other liabilities, but not with the respective underlying instruments;
(iii) similarly accrued interest on securities other than shares issued by the depository
corporations are included as part of other liabilities; (iv) loan-loss provisions are classified as
special reserves under capital accounts and reserves; and (v) valuation of shares and other
equity on the asset side of the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository corporations is
not at market prices. The first three practices differ from the MFSM guidelines, but are in
conformity with the ECB framework.
10.
Regarding financing data, the ROSC mission noted material differences between
government finance statistics and the corresponding monetary data. The data ROSC mission
recommended that the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and
government finance statistics and carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
11.
Compiled monetary data, based on the SRFs, have been published in the February
2008 issue of the IFS Supplement. The new data provide breakdowns of the claims on, and
liabilities to the central government and general government, which were previously not
available. However, breakdowns of the claims on, and liabilities to, other resident sectors are
not available.
External sector statistics
12.
While improvements have been made in the balance of payments data, some issues
need to be addressed. While there are valid differences in definitions between the customs
(GUS) and payment-based trade data compiled by the NBP, the two data sources need to be
further cross-checked for broad consistency. The NBP now reports net foreign assets rather
than the net international reserves previously shown in the monetary survey. Also, the
coverage and reporting of the stock of external debt, especially at maturities up to one year,
could be improved. The 2003 data ROSC mission recommended including interest on an
accrual basis, making explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of
payments statistics, separating insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b.
adjustment, publishing on a regular basis a reconciliation table between international
merchandise trade statistics and “goods” in the balance of payments, and undertaking
periodic revision studies.

POLAND
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
April 9, 2008
This supplement to the staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Poland provides
information on recent developments and discusses the implications of these developments for
the economic outlook and for monetary policy.
Summary
Recent data suggest that GDP growth, as well as inflationary and wage pressures, have been
stronger going into 2008 than assumed in the staff’s baseline scenario. There is also still no
evidence of a notable impact of the global market turmoil on Poland. However, in view of the
expected slowdown in major export markets, staff has reduced its GDP growth forecast and
slightly lowered its end-year inflation forecast for 2009. Following a further increase in
policy interest rates recently, the third increase this year, a continuation of the tightening
cycle will depend on whether wage pressures ease in the coming months.
Recent Developments
1.
GDP growth remains robust; inflationary pressures are not abating; and there
are no signs of substantial spillovers from the global turmoil through real or financial
channels:
•

High-frequency indicators point to stronger GDP growth than assumed in staff’s
baseline scenario. Growth in industrial production is slowing less than expected, retail
sales remain very strong, and exports have continued to grow.

•

Inflation is still rising. Head-line inflation increased to 4.2 percent (year-on-year) in
February. This is significantly above the central target of 2.5 percent and well outside
the NBP’s upper tolerance limit of 3½ percent for deviations from this target. Core-

2
inflation is estimated to have risen from 1.7 percent at end-2007 to 2.5 percent at endFebruary.
•

Labor markets have continued to tighten. Employment is still increasing, and nominal
wage increases rebounded to above 10 percent (year-on-year) in January-February,
having temporarily slowed in December.

•

The global turmoil has lead to some further increase in credit default swap and bond
spreads, with the latter increasing about 30 basis points since the beginning of 2008.
Credit growth, however, is still largely unaffected, with credit to the household and
corporate sectors growing by about 30 and 20 percent, respectively, in real terms.

Monetary and fiscal policies
2.
The monetary tightening cycle has continued. The Monetary Policy Council
(MPC) recently increased the policy rate by 25 basis points, the third such increase since the
beginning of year, stressing the further rise in inflation and pressures in the labor market. The
policy rate now stands at 5.75 percent, 175 basis points higher that in April 2007, when the
tightening cycle began. Despite the further tightening, the zloty has appreciated by less than
3 percent versus the euro since the beginning of the year.
3.
Fiscal policy is still set to add some stimulus in 2008. Recent data point to a betterthan-budgeted fiscal position in 2008, as anticipated in the Staff Report. In particular, March
CIT receipts were larger than projected, thanks to continuous strong corporate profits, while
expenditure execution has so far been lower than anticipated. Staff nonetheless now projects
a somewhat larger fiscal stimulus in 2008—of about ½ percent of GDP—because the fiscal
outcome for 2007 was somewhat better than anticipated. As to other fiscal issues, the
authorities’ updated Convergence Program targets a deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2011,
consistent with their commitment to a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path. Also,
following up on staff’s recommendation to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework, an
FAD technical assistance mission visited Warsaw in late March and left the authorities an
aide-memoire providing advice on implementing such a framework, including establishing
expenditure ceilings.
Revisions to the outlook
4.
Staff has reduced its projection for GDP growth in 2009. Driven by the downward
revisions to euro area growth projections in the Spring WEO, staff expects export growth to
slow moderately compared to the baseline forecast in the staff report, starting in the second
half of 2008. This slowdown is expected to largely offset the stronger GDP growth evident
from data going into 2008—staff has maintained its GDP growth forecast of 4.9 percent for
2008. In 2009, however, the slower export growth is expected to translate into a reduction in
GDP growth to 4.5 percent, which is a reduction of about ¼ percentage point relative to the
previous baseline.

3
5.
Despite the higher inflationary pressures at this time, staff expects a modest
easing compared to its baseline inflation forecast for 2009. In view of higher–thanexpected inflation in early 2008, staff has increased its forecast for 2008 from 3.8 percent to
4.0 percent (year average). However, consistent with the lowering of the GDP forecast for
next year, the projected rate of inflation by end-2009 has been lowered from 3.7 percent to
3.5 percent.
Staff assessment
6.
The change in external outlook poses a challenge for monetary policy. The
negative spillovers from the expected slowdown in export markets, together with the delayed
impact of the recent monetary tightening, will slow baseline GDP growth to slightly below
its estimated potential next year. This together with the projected stabilization of commodity
prices should eventually lead to a gradual easing of inflationary pressures. However, while
staff believes that the risks to its baseline growth forecast are equally balanced at this stage, it
is concerned about near term upside risks to its inflation forecast. In particular, the continued
tightening of labor markets and increase in core inflation evident from recent data point to
the risk, as discussed in the staff report, that the strong increase in ULC that has been under
way will increasingly be reflected in prices because the scope for compressing profit margins
might have run its course. In view of this, a continuation of double digit wage increases and
rising core inflation in the coming months would, in staff’s view, warrant additional
tightening. The slightly higher fiscal stimulus in store for 2008 will increase the burden on
monetary policy but not appreciably so.
7.
The weakening of the external outlook has not changed long-term challenges.
Most important in this regard is preserving competitiveness by containing demand pressures,
while raising potential growth by boosting the labor supply. From this perspective, Staff
welcomes that the update of the Convergence Program includes a more ambitious mediumterm target for fiscal consolidation than what was envisaged in the previous version.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland
The
On April 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background

After two years of sluggish performance, Poland entered its second year of strong economic
growth in 2007. Output expanded by 6.5 percent, underpinned by robust and balanced
growth in domestic demand. EU accession continued to bolster investors’ confidence and
private consumption was supported by several factors, notably rising real wages and
record-high credit for Poland.
The external sector has been an increasing drag on the economy. Still, the current account
deficit (3¾ percent of GDP) remains fully financed by FDI, and the underlying balance,
estimated to be 4½–6 percent of GDP, is consistent with external-debt stabilizing levels.
Moreover, staff estimates do not point to exchange rate misalignment, despite real
appreciation since mid-2006.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Inflationary pressures are mounting, most evidently in the labor market. Unemployment fell
by about 8 percentage points since early 2006 to about 9 percent—partly fuelled by
emigration to Western Europe—and real wage growth has outstripped productivity gains
starting in end-2007. So far, this has been largely absorbed through lower profit margins,
but core inflation is estimated to have risen from about 1¾ percent at end-2007 to
2½ percent at end-February. With fuel and food prices soaring, headline inflation picked at
4¼ percent (year-on-year) in February, far above the 2½ percent target and beyond the
1½–3½ percent inflation band.
Macroeconomic policies tightened in 2007. Adjusting for cyclical factors, fiscal tightening
reached about 1½ percent of GDP, underpinned by expenditure under-execution. The
general government deficit is estimated to have fallen to 2 percent of GDP. Meanwhile,
reflecting concerns about rising inflation, policy interest rates were raised seven times since
April 2007, to 5¾ percent. Still, the increase in nominal rates has been insufficient to
prevent real interest rate from falling in the face of accelerating inflation.
The turmoil in international capital markets has had only a limited impact in Poland. Spreads
in bond and credit default swap have only risen moderately. In contrast, the stock market
retrenchment has been severe, but it followed substantial gains since 2006. While strong
domestic credit has increasingly been funded from abroad—consistent with the rising
interest differential in favor of the zloty—the overall share of net foreign liabilities is still small
and the banking system remains well capitalized and highly profitable. Stress tests show
resilience of the banking system to a potential deterioration in the debt burdens of both
households and corporates, even in the face of international shocks.
Executive Board Assessment

Directors noted that Poland is enjoying strong and well-balanced economic growth, in
large part because of a boom in investment following EU accession. There have been only
limited upward pressures on core inflation until recently, the external current account deficit
is still relatively low, and the zloty has remained within its estimated equilibrium range.
At the same time, Directors noted that resource constraints are beginning to emerge.
This is especially the case in the labor market, where real wage growth has outpaced
productivity gains. The more recent uptick in core inflation suggests that there may be
diminishing scope for profits to absorb rising unit labor costs, and increased risks to
competitiveness. The challenge facing the new government is thus to contain demand
pressure, while boosting the economy’s supply response, in particular by raising the
exceptionally low rate of labor participation.
With output growth remaining robust and inflationary pressures continuing to be
relatively high, Directors welcomed the tightening monetary policy cycle under way since
last April. Looking forward, and noting that labor market pressures point to the risk of a

3

wage-price spiral, Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that higher inflationary
expectations do not get entrenched. They supported the authorities’ intention to maintain
the tightening bias in monetary policy in order to bring inflation back to target. Some
Directors encouraged the authorities to enhance their communication policy to further
strengthen monetary policy credibility. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
the adoption of the euro as soon as the necessary conditions are met on a sustainable
basis.
Directors noted the importance of strengthening Poland’s medium-term budgetary
framework in order to facilitate the needed expenditure-based consolidation and safeguard
against a pro-cyclical fiscal stance. They therefore welcomed the authorities’ determination
to speed up fiscal consolidation and reduce the structural fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP
over the medium term. This would help unburden monetary policy, create appropriate
cyclical safety margins, and reduce the risk to external sustainability in the event that the
private sector’s saving-investment balance deteriorates faster than expected over the
medium-term. Some Directors saw scope for automatic stabilizers to work in the event that
external spillovers cause growth to drop below potential, but a few others urged caution in
allowing full play of automatic stabilizers in such circumstances.
Directors noted that the negative spillovers on the Polish economy from the global
financial market turbulence have been limited so far. There have been some modest
increases in credit default swap and bond spreads, but no major slowdown in credit
volumes. Spillovers may have been contained because of the absence of exposure to the
US sub-prime market, the limited use of advanced structured products, and the generally
high profitability of banks, including the Polish subsidiaries of international banks. Directors
also noted that the banking system is well capitalized, and that the overall share of foreign
liabilities is small. Nevertheless, they called for continued vigilance.
Directors noted that the recent unification of supervisory functions under the
auspices of the Financial Supervision Authority has come at a time when extra vigilance is
essential. They called on the authorities to ensure that there are no disruptions in the
timeliness and effectiveness of supervision. The Financial Supervision Authority should give
priority to formalizing understandings with the National Bank of Poland and the Ministry of
Finance on future cooperation.
Directors stressed that the key to boosting long-term growth will be to increase the
exceptionally low labor market participation. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to
pursue reforms that would enhance work incentives, and encouraged them to move ahead
with the formulation of such policies. Directors took note of the experience in other EU
countries in which labor participation has been boosted with incremental improvements in
areas such as product market regulation and the tax wedge. Some Directors pointed to the

4

complementary effects of labor market reforms on medium-term fiscal consolidation.
Directors also welcomed the authorities’ determination to restart the privatization program,
and saw scope for further deregulation of the economy to catalyze more rapid productivity
growth.
Directors found that the authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic stability,
reinvigoration of structural reforms, and the adoption of the euro augur well for Poland’s
prospects of taking full advantage of its EU membership.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Directors welcomed the tightening monetary policy cycle under way since last April. Looking
forward, and noting that labor market pressures point to the risk of a wage-price spiral, Directors
stressed the importance of ensuring that higher inflationary expectations do not get entrenched.
They supported the authorities’ intention to maintain the tightening bias in monetary policy in
order to bring inflation back to target. Some Directors encouraged the authorities to enhance
their communication policy to further strengthen monetary policy credibility. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to the adoption of the euro as soon as the necessary conditions are
met on a sustainable basis.

Directors noted the importance of strengthening Poland’s medium-term budgetary framework in
order to facilitate the needed expenditure-based consolidation and safeguard against a procyclical fiscal stance. They therefore welcomed the authorities’ determination to speed up fiscal
consolidation and reduce the structural fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP over the medium term.
This would help unburden monetary policy, create appropriate cyclical safety margins, and
reduce the risk to external sustainability in the event that the private sector’s saving-investment
balance deteriorates faster than expected over the medium-term. Some Directors saw scope for
automatic stabilizers to work in the event that external spillovers cause growth to drop below
potential, but a few others urged caution in allowing full play of automatic stabilizers in such
circumstances.
Directors noted that the negative spillovers on the Polish economy from the global financial
market turbulence have been limited so far. There have been some modest increases in credit
default swap and bond spreads, but no major slowdown in credit volumes. Spillovers may have
been contained because of the absence of exposure to the US sub-prime market, the limited
use of advanced structured products, and the generally high profitability of banks, including the
Polish subsidiaries of international banks. Directors also noted that the banking system is well
capitalized, and that the overall share of foreign liabilities is small. Nevertheless, they called for
continued vigilance.
Directors noted that the recent unification of supervisory functions under the auspices of the
Financial Supervision Authority has come at a time when extra vigilance is essential. They
called on the authorities to ensure that there are no disruptions in the timeliness and
effectiveness of supervision. The Financial Supervision Authority should give priority to
formalizing understandings with the National Bank of Poland and the Ministry of Finance on
future cooperation.
Directors stressed that the key to boosting long-term growth will be to increase the exceptionally
low labor market participation. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to pursue reforms that
would enhance work incentives, and encouraged them to move ahead with the formulation of
such policies. Directors took note of the experience in other EU countries in which labor
participation has been boosted with incremental improvements in areas such as product market
regulation and the tax wedge. Some Directors pointed to the complementary effects of labor
market reforms on medium-term fiscal consolidation. Directors also welcomed the authorities’
determination to restart the privatization program, and saw scope for further deregulation of the
economy to catalyze more rapid productivity growth.
Directors found that the authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic stability, reinvigoration of
structural reforms, and the adoption of the euro augur well for Poland’s prospects of taking full
advantage of its EU membership.

Statement by Andrzej Raczko, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Poland
and Pawel Gasiorowski, Advisor to Executive Director
April 16, 2008
On behalf of the Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
policy dialogue with the new government, which took place during the staff’s visit in
Warsaw. Although the new cabinet took office in the end of 2007, the consultations were
held at a good time to exchange views about the prospects of the Polish economy and were
helpful for the new authorities in the policy formulation process.
Our authorities share the staff’s view that the Polish economy enjoys robust growth
without domestic and external imbalances. Four years since the EU accession, the GDP
growth rate has stabilized at a high level -exceeding 6 percent— and has helped Poland to
speed up the real convergence process. Core inflation has been reduced to an acceptable
interval of 2-3 percent. Moreover, the unemployment rate has fallen from 19 to 11 percent.
The current account deficit, although increased, still remains at a safe level and is mainly
covered by foreign direct investments and the inflows of EU funds. Strong economic
fundamentals have a positive impact on the exchange rate. Therefore, the Polish zloty has
been appreciating not only vis-à-vis the US dollar but against the Euro as well. Substantial
progress has been made on the fiscal front. According to the information published in the last
convergence program, the general government deficit reached 2 percent of GDP and the
public debt was reduced to 44.9 percent of GDP (ESA95 methodology). Hence, both
indicators satisfy the Maastricht Criteria.
Outlook and economic developments
Against this positive economic outlook, the key question is how much of the current
pace of activity reflects deep structural changes in the economy and can be sustained over the
medium term. In addition, the strong pick up in GDP growth will be tested by the worsening
external economic environment. Both issues should be examined from the perspective of the
macroeconomic and structural policies.
Our authorities share the staff’s opinion that growth will slow down in the next years
but the pace of adjustment allows for a soft landing. Hence, the growth rate will stay close to
the path of potential output. The authorities expect that the real GDP growth will slow to
5.5 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009 and 2010, which means that their projections are
higher than the staff’s estimations.
The authorities’ expectations for 2008 are supported by the recent data. The retail
sales have increased over 19 percent in real terms on a yearly basis in February 2008, and the
unemployment rate has fallen by an additional 2.1 percent since January. The consumption
demand, which is fuelled by still growing employment and an increasing wage bill, remains
strong in 2008. Investments, which rose over 20 percent in 2007, are supported by increasing
EU funds and robust economic prospects and are confirmed by growing business confidence

2
indicators1. The impact on investment demand of a gradual tightening of monetary policy
may be delayed because a substantial part of the projects is financed by the companies’ own
financial resources.
The impact of strong domestic demand on GDP growth will be partially offset by a
negative contribution of net exports, which is larger than before On the other hand, although
the Polish currency has been gradually appreciating since the EU accession, the market share
of Polish exports has increased substantially and both exports and imports grew at two-digit
rates. However, the positive foreign trade outlook may be changed in case of a substantial
increase of unit labor cost or recession in the EU countries.
Our authorities agree with the staff’s view that the current well-balanced economic
growth may be at risk if supply side constraints, particularly tightening of labor conditions,
and rising inflation are not reined in by an appropriate macroeconomic and structural policy
mix. The National Bank of Poland is fully committed to bringing inflation back to the target.
The new government announced fiscal plans aimed at reducing the public debt to GDP ratio
by 4-7 percentage points and achieving a structural government deficit of 1 percent in 2011.
Monetary policy
The average inflation rate was at a comfortable level of 2.5 percent in 2007, while an
increase of headline inflation in the last quarter of the previous year to 3.5 percent was
mainly related to the global increase of food and fuel prices. A year ago the Monetary Policy
Council (MPC) noted the increasing risk of medium-term inflation pick-up and began the
tightening cycle. By March 2008, the MPC had raised interest rates by 175 basis points in
seven steps. The MPC’s decisions mitigated the growth of core inflation, which still remains
at a relatively low level of 2.5 percent.
The rising headline inflation is currently driven by rising prices of food and oil in the
global markets followed by the increase in energy prices. The external price shock is beyond
control of the monetary authorities and may be partially offset by the appreciating exchange
rate. Hence, the tight monetary policy may only anchor inflation expectations and target the
second-round effects. However, if food and energy price shocks persist for a longer time, the
risk of inflation entrenchment over the upper end of the inflation target band will increase.
Against this backdrop, the monetary authorities assume in their projections a gradual
bringing down of inflation to the target in 2010.
The monetary authorities share the staff’s view that the main concern comes from the
tighter labor market and the potential risk of igniting the wage-price spiral. Hence, the MPC
is committed to a tight monetary policy stance until it is clear that inflation is returning to the

medium-term target. Taking into account the rising disparity of interest rates and large
inflows of EU funds, the authorities expect a further appreciation of the zloty and a widening
of the current account deficit in 2008. Even though the monetary authorities noted the cost of
tightening the monetary policy (in terms of external balance deterioration), the monetary
policy credibility, which is a corner stone of the inflation–targeting framework, needs a firm
decision by the MPC.
Regarding the Euro adoption, the National Bank of Poland launched a new project to
prepare an updated report analyzing the merits and risks of the Euro adoption. The report will
benefit from the already progressing broad consultations with social partners, academia,
business and the media.
Fiscal policy
According to the last convergence program submitted in March 2008, the general
government deficit was reduced to 2 percent in 2007 mainly due to buoyant tax revenues and
lower capital spending. The structural deficit was reduced from 3.7 percent in 2006 to
2.2 percent in 2007. Thus, Poland fulfilled the obligation to reduce the structural deficit by
0.5 percent, which was recommended by the EU a year ago. Our authorities are particularly
satisfied with the surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the social security system. Also, the central
government balance improved as the deficit was 1 percent of GDP lower than in 2006.
Despite the same level of central government fiscal balance (in terms of GDP) in
2007 and 2008, the general government deficit for the next year is projected to increase to
2.5 percent of GDP. The worsening of the fiscal stance is due to the cost of the reform of
payroll taxation. The reform, which was necessary to cut the high tax-wedge and increase
labor participation, has a substantial fiscal cost that exceeds 1 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2
percent in the next two years. In addition, the personal income tax rates starting from the
fiscal year 2009 will be reduced.
As staff rightly pointed out, given the legal procedure of budgetary bill preparation,
the new government did not have enough time to implement measures that might offset the
cost of the payroll tax reform. However, some adjustments on the expenditure side have been
implemented to reduce the planned central government budget deficit for 2008 by
0.1 percentage points. A more comprehensive program for restraining budget expenditure
will be implemented in 2009. The authorities plan to lower the cost of the central and local
governments by streamlining the administrative processes. Regarding social benefits
programs, our authorities consider measures that should better target social programs without
a nominal spending increase. The authorities see the merit of a rolling three-year budget
recommended by staff, particularly implementing a more flexible system of planning EU
funds expenditures. In this respect, our authorities welcome Funds’ assistance in improving
the budgeting process.

4
In the medium-term perspective, our authorities plan to reduce the structural general
government deficit to 1 percent in 2011. The ambitious 1 percent budget deficit is a de facto
equivalent of a fiscal surplus. In 1999, Poland implemented a pension reform which
gradually substitutes the pay-as-you-go system (FUS) by mandatory open pension funds
(OFE) managed by private firms. The new capital-based pension system will significantly
reduce the risk of the negative impact of population aging. On the other hand, the transfer
from the pay-as-you-go system to the capital-based system brings about temporary fiscal
cost. The cost equal to the difference between the social contribution paid by the workers and
the expenditures in the pay-as-you-go pension scheme is being phased out. Therefore, the
introduction of the new pension system has also two fiscal consequences. First, in the short
term, the positive outcome of the reduction of the aging cost is not visible in the balance of
the general government sector because the OFE’s surplus is not regarded as a component of a
public sector balance. Second, the negative outcome of the reform, i.e. transfers from the
state budget to the FUS (estimated at the level of 2 percent of GDP), has a substantial impact
on the current fiscal stance. Our authorities are committed to partially address this cost by
limiting access to “bridge” pensions, which allow workers in some occupational categories to
enjoy early retirement benefits. The list of professions will be restricted to people over
50 who are unable to perform their job until official retirement age due to special working
conditions.
Structural reforms
The improvement of labor market conditions is a top priority of the authorities. As
staff correctly pointed out, the increase of the very low labor participation ratio is a decisive
element to sustain high GDP growth. Our authorities plan to implement measures that focus
on increasing the employment of people over 50 (“Solidarity 50+” Program). Also, a
decrease of the tax wedge will reduce pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor market.
The introduction of degressive unemployment benefits is being proposed. The system of
early pensions will be reviewed to limit schemes to health-related cases. These measures will
be accompanied by a gradual equalizing of the retirement age of men and women. Moreover,
a reform of a separate farmer’s pension scheme (KRUS) is being discussed. In this respect,
the authorities would like to increase the contribution of the owners of large farms.
The authorities are preparing a reform package to improve the effectiveness of public
health care. The proposal for the new system was sent to social partners for consultation. The
package includes the introduction of co-payments for health services and promotes greater
participation in the voluntary health insurance.
Our authorities are fully committed to implement the EU product market regulations,
especially the new services directive. The new government declared to reinvigorate the
privatization process. Last but not least, the authorities plan to improve business confidence.
In January 2008, a parliamentary commission called “Friendly State” was created, with the
objective to eliminate the onerous administrative regulations and procedures that hamper the
conduct of business. Currently, work is underway on the amendment of the act on

5
accounting. A simplified tax and business law, reduced red tape and improved judicial
procedures for settling business disputes will also be covered by the reforms.
The authorities will submit the National Reform Program for 2008-2011, whose main
objective will be to boost labor productivity and improve competitiveness. The key element
of the program will be measures to support the innovation and R&D in high value added
sectors and highly competitive industries. Moreover, the program will aim at providing
competitive services and sufficient infrastructure in the network sectors.
Financial markets
The separate financial supervision authorities were consolidated into one office - the
Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF). The long lasting consolidation has been
completed by integrating the banking supervision with the KNF on January 1, 2008. The
continuity of the vigilant banking supervision was maintained and the introduction of Basel
II regulations is progressing. Despite some concerns noted in the staff’s report, in the
authorities’ opinion the current supervisory activities and fulfillment of the statutory
objectives by the KNF was not impaired by political influence.
The Polish banking sector has not been exposed to the sub prime credit crisis as the
sector was virtually not exposed to mortgage-based structured products. The sector continues
to be very profitable with a low level of non-performing loans and a very low recourse to
securitization. Although there was a significant increase of mortgage lending in 2007, the
level of total indebtedness remains low in relation to GDP and the rate of growth was still
lower than the one of regional peers. It should be noted that the sub prime mortgage market
does not exist in Poland and the borrowers are usually upper and middle income
professionals. In the meantime, as a result of stabilization of the housing market in the fourth
quarter of 2007 and tightening of lending standards in the second half of 2007, the demand
for mortgage lending decreased.
However, recognizing the increasing share of long-term mortgages in the banks’
portfolios, a significant majority of which is denominated in foreign currencies, the
Commission for Banking Supervision (predecessor of the KNF) two years ago introduced a
recommendation on good practices in mortgage-secured lending. The banks are
recommended to run stress tests assuming a sharp depreciation of the zloty and a
simultaneous interest rate increase. In effect, a borrower requesting a foreign currency
denominated loan can obtain a smaller loan compared to a zloty denominated loan.
Moreover, in March 2007 the Commission for Banking Supervision issued a regulation,
which promoted more vigilant practices of banks’ liquidity management.
