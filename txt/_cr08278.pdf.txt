SWEDEN
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Sweden
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Adnan Mazarei
July 10, 2008
Executive Summary
Developments. After robust expansion in 2004-06, growth slowed to 2.7 percent in 2007
with capacity constraints and external uncertainties. Employment growth has been strong,
wages have accelerated, and labor productivity has slowed. Inflation picked up; but the
fiscal and external current account surpluses remain high. Banks have been resilient to
global financial turmoil so far, but vulnerabilities are rising with large regional exposure.
Outlook. The economy is expected to slow below potential in 2008, with a recovery
beginning in 2009. Medium-term potential growth is projected to ease to 2-2¼ percent.
Financial sector. While bank risk profiles are increasing, interlocutors were confident
that capital buffers are sufficient to absorb stress, should it come—the staff still sees
risks. Sweden’s bank resolution framework is deficient and needs to be updated and
strengthened as a priority. The authorities are working on strengthening cross-border
supervisory coordination.
Exchange rate. The krona reflects market forces, but is below its estimated mediumterm value, and hence is expected to appreciate gradually. Competitiveness is strong.
Monetary Policy. The Riksbank has raised the policy rate by 2.75 ppts since 2006 to
roughly neutral. Policy should be biased up until inflation expectations drop.
Fiscal Policy. The balance exceeds the 1-percent-of-GDP surplus rule over the cycle. The
2008 budget reduces taxes and welfare benefits to sharpen incentives to work, and seeks
to privatize some public enterprises. The staff agrees that the 2009 budget has room to
support domestic demand and foster supply improvements. Increasing labor participation
to support the welfare state is well taken, given population aging.

I. CONTEXT
1.
The economy has performed well, reaching the peak of two recoveries—the
business cycle and a decade-long structural recovery following the banking crisis and
sharp downturn in the early 1990s. A structural recovery extending far beyond the business
cycle has also been observed in other industrial countries following a crisis—the Netherlands
after its “Dutch disease” in 1980-82; Germany after the unification cost blowout in 1991-95;
Finland after its banking crisis in the 1990s. Activity is now slowing with the two recoveries
easing, and demographics reducing potential growth.
2.
A center-right government took office in 2006, following three terms of the labor
party. The government is boosting labor participation and reducing reliance on the welfare
state. The reforms are politically sensitive, and support in the polls has declined somewhat.
3.
Swedish banks have been resilient to global financial turmoil, but risks are
rising. Share prices have dropped compared to Nordic indices, and average CDS spreads
have risen, reflecting repricing of risk and weakening growth in the Baltics. Vulnerabilities
have been mitigated by strong domestic economic conditions so far.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Activity is moderating. Industrial production is slowing (Figure 1) (Table 1). The
manufacturing PMI declined from 60 pts in 2006 to 50. Construction is also softening, after
strong growth. Exports benefited from sound competitiveness and strong foreign demand, but
euro-area and US slowing is causing a deceleration.
5.
Private consumption growth has been relatively smooth. Employment and wages
have picked up, and disposable income has benefited from tax cuts. However, recent global
financial turmoil has hit confidence and consumption slowed into 2008 (Figure 2).
6.
Investment expanded rapidly in 2004-07. Besides construction, Sweden has
invested to meet global demand for high value-added products in telecom, biomedicine, and
machinery. The competitive krona supported investment. Capacity use was high.
7.
The labor market performed well. Employment growth reached 2 percent a year
(Figure 3). Supply increased with a larger working-age population, immigration, and higher
participation. Unemployment declined from 8 percent in 2005 to 6 percent in early 2008.
8.
Tight capacity boosted prices and wages. Inflation increased from ½ percent in
2005 to 4 percent in May 2008. Energy and food prices boosted the headline, but the core rate
also rose to 2.9 percent. Wages firmed up, and the Riksbank is monitoring second round
effects. ULCs increased when labor productivity fell at the peak of the labor cycle (Figure 4).

Fiscal policy remained strong. Sweden continues its exemplary fiscal recovery since
the crisis in the 1990s when the deficit reached 10 percent of GDP. The turnaround has been
expenditure-led, but recent performance also experienced buoyant revenues. Debt is falling
below 40 percent of GDP (Figure 5).
10.
With the strong fiscal adjustment and high private saving, the external current
account surplus reached 8 percent of GDP. Sweden’s open economy is sensitive to global
activity, which has been buoyant. The trade surplus is 7 percent of GDP. Growing net
external assets and favorable returns contributed net factor payments of 2 percent of GDP.
Foreign aid exceeds 1 percent of GDP (Figure 6).
III. OUTLOOK
11.
Following global financial turbulence, the economy is projected to slow below
potential in 2008 and begin to turn up in 2009. Consumer confidence has weakened,
reducing retail spending. Business confidence has dropped less (Figure 7). The authorities
and staff project growth of 2 percent in 2008 and 1¾ percent in 2009 (Table 2). Consensus
growth forecasts are trending toward this outlook from above.

Sweden is well positioned to absorb some slowing. Softer growth has a silver lining
in view of the high capacity utilization, consumer prices, and tight housing markets. At the
same time, the strong fiscal position, the repo rate at 4¼ percent, and the external current
account surplus provide Sweden with policy room to respond. However, the banking system
is showing growing risks, requiring close monitoring.

Risks to growth for 2008 are balanced; those for 2009 depend on developments
in the banks. If funding costs normalize and the Baltics achieve a soft landing, stable credit
expansion should support growth. If turmoil persists, Swedish housing prices fall, and/or
Baltic exposures sour, a credit crunch could slow growth below forecast.
14.
Sweden’s long-run outlook appears sound. Long-run potential growth likely ranges
from 2-2¼ percent. Sweden’s population is projected to slow but not decline—the
dependency ratio will rise (Figure 8). The working-age population is expected to slow with
cohorts retiring. Further, TFP growth has been above average recently, which staff attributes
to the structural recovery from the 1990s. It is assumed to level off at 1.1 percent a year going
forward, akin to other high-income countries.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
With the economy in good shape, discussions focused on managing risks to
banks and the real economy. Financial sector surveillance focused on bank risks, and how
to strengthen Sweden’s deficient remedial and resolution framework. Exchange rate
surveillance focused on external and domestic stability as linked to the policy mix. Monetary
policy risks have increased with inflation expectations drifting above the inflation target.
Fiscal policy is strong, subject to monitoring contingent risks.

Bank soundness
16.
Swedish banks have performed well so far (Tables 3-5). Four dominant banks
(Nordea, SEB, Swedbank, and Handelsbanken) have significant cross-border exposures.
They enjoyed record profits while expanding aggressively abroad. Return on equity increased
as return on assets remained unchanged, signaling rising leverage. Tier 1 capital adequacy is
7 percent and overall risk-weighted CARs are 10 percent—adequate but not spectacular.

Sweden has little direct exposure to US subprime paper—instead exposure to the
Baltics is significant. Swedbank and SEB are dominant players in the Baltics, with up to
two-thirds lending market share (Figures 9 & 10). Each earns about a third of operating
profits in the Baltics with 11 percent of their total lending there (in euros and local currency).
Rising concerns over credit risks have led banks to cut loan growth. This is delicate, because
too fast a retrenchment could undermine the profits and assets the banks are trying to protect.
On the funding side (in euros, krona, and local currency), the global risk repricing has
increased liquidity risk, as wholesale and securities-related borrowing represent an important
source of the banks’ total funding. Funding has tightened up and become more costly. Banks
have responded in part by switching to covered mortgage bonds, which carry double
collateral (of the underlying mortgages and the bank guarantee) and permit longer average
maturities.
18.
Market signals indicate heightened risks. Stock prices have dropped and credit
default swap spreads have increased, notably for banks active in the Baltics (Figure 11). Staff
discussed its background work on banks’ default dependencies, using the latest nonlinear

techniques (Box 1). 1 The Riksbank has drawn increased attention in its Financial Sector
Stability Reports to the risks from the Baltics, as well as from the elevated Swedish house
prices. The banks, in turn, signaled their enhanced focus on credit quality in the Baltics. Staff
recommends that banks do not lower capital/asset ratios further (i.e. increase leverage), even
though having moved to Basel II may allow them to do so, given their high share of mortgage
lending that tends to have lower risk-weighting.

Box 1. Default Dependencies and Bank Stability
The soundness of one bank depends on overall system stability. As seen in a staff
application for Sweden, the probability of default of one bank is linked to that of others, directly
through interbank deposits and syndication, and indirectly through lending to common sectors
and exposure to capital markets and proprietary trades. This default dependency can be nonlinear when the financial system experiences stress. Looking at bank risk individually and
ignoring this interdependency overestimates financial sector resilience.
Staff analyzed the default dependency between the four Swedish banks with
nonparametric models with the following results:

•
The Swedish banking system remains stable but with a higher tail risk than six
months ago. The joint probability of default (JPoD) or tail risk that all four banks
default simultaneously has risen significantly, but less than the average probability of
default (PoD) of individual banks. This indicates a buffer of resilience. For comparison,
at the height of the global financial distress, the JPoD of 15 major international banks
increased faster than their average PoDs, indicating that weaknesses in one or several
institutions magnified risks for the entire system.
•
Banks exposed to the Baltics have higher risk. Banks with high Baltics’
exposure have seen their JPoD increase faster and their resilience depend increasingly
on the soundness of the entire Swedish financial system. This calls for vigilance
regarding their shock absorption capacity.

19.
The authorities’ and banks’ own analyses suggest that the banks are prepared to
cope with significant adverse events, should they come. For instance, the banks have
sufficient buffers to cover loan losses up to 20 percent of total Baltic exposure while still
meeting minimum CARs. Staff encouraged that stress-test assumptions also contemplate
1

See A. Maechler: “Assessing Banking System Stability, An Application for Sweden” and “Exploring Financial
Stability” (PPP) on the Sweden country website: http://wwwintranet.imf.org/departments/EUR/CountryInfo/Sweden/Pages/2008ArtIV.aspx

20
“tail” risks that combine effects from concurrent shocks (e.g., long stagnation in the Baltics
with maintenance of the currency pegs, or a recovery with valuation effects if a peg were to
be adjusted). Baseline scenarios posit soft landings in the Baltics, but banks cannot ignore the
possibility of tougher times. Indeed, spillovers from credit to liquidity risks would be
problematic given the substantial reliance by banks on capital market funding and since a
drying up of this funding could also cause a credit crunch in Sweden itself.
Bank supervision and resolution
20.
Against this background, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) is working
to enhance cross-border supervisory cooperation with Scandinavian and Baltic
partners. The FSA is moving toward replicating the supervisory colleges among
Scandinavian countries in the Baltics. Banks and the FSA are also proceeding with the
implementation of Basel II. Eight banks have permission to use internal risk-based models.
Staff sees room to use Pillar II and stress testing to bolster capital adequacy, even in the
absence of a coordinated effort at the European level. The FSA needs adequate resources to
address high staff turnover, and assess the quality of banks’ balance sheets with more on-site
inspections of credit policies and portfolios, and less reliance on auditors’ reports.
21.
Staff’s core recommendations centered on beefing up Sweden’s bank remedial
and resolution framework. The 1990s crisis was addressed with facilities that are no longer
in place. It would be risky to rely on a similar approach if new bank stress were to hit because
the banks are much larger today, operate cross-border, and rely more on capital markets.
Bank resolution in Sweden falls under regular corporate law, which is too slow for prompt
remedial action and to meet the special needs of the payments system.2 The responsibilities
between the FSA, Riksbank, Deposit Insurance Agency, and fiscal authorities are not clear,
which could lead to costly problems.
22.
The Ministry of Finance is drafting a new bank resolution framework. Staff
discussed key features:
•
The FSA needs the authority and tools to implement strict prudential measures in a
coherent, comprehensive, step-by-step, graduated framework. It should range from provisions
for special consultations for early stress assessment, to firmer measures in a remedial context,
all the way to decisive bank resolution measures.
•
It needs to be based on written code that defers to specialized courts to ensure
timeliness of judicial oversight, while preventing appeals from blocking the implementation
of supervisory decisions.
2

In 2006, a small bank experienced stress but could not be intervened. After nine months of court proceedings,
the owners finally entered the bank into bankruptcy to limit their own liability.

21
•
It would need to include all banks, as special treatment for systemic banks accentuates
moral hazard and adds legal complexity.
•
Immediately after a bank license is revoked, authorities should take effective control,
replace management, and trigger the deposit guarantee. The authorities should have a wide
range of tools to wind up a failing institution, from the partial sale of its assets to arranging
its acquisition or merger with another bank.
•
To minimize moral hazard, the owners of a failing bank should take the first hit. To
minimize the cost to the Treasury, authorities should have the legal option to facilitate a
merger into a stronger institution, or redeem shares of a failing institution at a price
corresponding to its value in the absence of state aid, subject to administrative procedures.
•
Legislation needs to prescribe a clear and credible priority of claims on bank assets,
with potential losses for some creditors to discourage excessive risk taking.
23.
The authorities were in broad agreement, but were investigating several details.
They noted that the legislation would need to remain under corporate law, but agreed that
specialized courts should be established for quick resolution. They were considering to
invoke the new framework only for systemic banks. And they were assessing the legal
possibilities for resolving a failing bank without contravening European law. An FSAP
update could further elaborate on these and other financial sector issues. 3
B. Exchange Rate Surveillance
24.
The Swedish krona is freely floating as determined by market forces. At constant
REER, the external surplus would remain high, and the IIP turn positive, bolstering net factor
earnings. However, the REER should increase in future as fiscal tightening ends and policy
interest rates are higher on average than in the past—supporting the krona and reducing over
time the large current account surplus (Tables 6-7). The velocity of this adjustment is difficult
to predict because it also depends on the behavior of trading partners.
25.
CGER analysis suggests that the krona is 10-15 percent below its expected
medium-term value (Box 2). 4 CPI and ULC REERs suggest similar conclusions (Figure 12).

Box 2. CGER Estimates
The macroeconomic balance approach reflects domestic absorption and saving-investment
balances. It estimates a Swedish (norm) current account surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP. Two
important variables are the current account and fiscal surpluses. These factors are offset
somewhat by the growing dependency ratio, which reduces saving. Using Sweden-specific
elasticities, the REER would need to appreciate 12 percent to lower the surplus to the norm.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach models the exchange rate on fundamentals,
including the stock of net foreign assets (NFA), return characteristics, etc.. By this metric, the
REER appears 16 percent below its estimated medium-term equilibrium value.

The external sustainability approach asks what the REER would have to be to stabilize
the NFA position going forward—finding 23 percent undervaluation. (This indicator is
mechanical and less informative—analysts comment that at its stage of demographics, Sweden
could be expected to have a positive IIP, instead of the actual negative one.)

26.
The authorities and staff considered the soft krona in the context of the fiscalmonetary policy mix. Sweden turned its fiscal balance from a large deficit to a surplus,
boosting saving and the current account, while cutting inflation. Monetary policy is an
inflation targeting regime—the dampened inflation induced the Riksbank to maintain low
policy rates for some time, relaxing the krona. The interaction of tight fiscal policy and loose
monetary policy contributed to softening the exchange rate and boosting the external balance.
However, the extended period of low interest rates eventually contributed to higher domestic
asset prices, rising wage demands, and a rebound in inflation. Thus, fiscal and monetary
policies should now recalibrate to continue securing domestic and external balance.
27.
This analysis has implications for future policy mix. Fiscal policy has room to
support domestic demand in a slowdown. Monetary policy should be tight to lean against the
wind of imported inflation and unwind elevated inflation expectations. While the authorities
need to guard against risks of excessive fiscal accommodation, as domestic demand finds
support and interest rates stay firm, the krona should strengthen and the external surplus ease.
C. Monetary Policy
28.
The Riksbank is an inflation targeter. The target is 2 percent CPI inflation with a
margin of ± 1 ppt (Figure 13). The Riksbank publishes policy committee minutes with
attribution of individual members, and a three-year inflation forecast and corresponding
policy interest rate path. Sweden is one of the most transparent inflation targeters.
29.
Staff discussed whether the Riksbank had been late in normalizing rates. During
2003-07, the Bank kept policy rates below a CPI Taylor rule or inflation targeting rule
(Figure 14). The economy gathered pace, as did asset prices, including housing (Figure 15).

Then, as the favorable international backdrop abated and with higher resource utilization,
inflation rose, core inflation ticked up, and wage settlements and inflation expectations
increased. The repo rate reached 4¼ percent in February 2008—late in the cycle. The
Riksbank stressed its steady rate increases since 2006, and that this was on target of policy
rules using the CPIX, which excludes interest rates to prevent perverse policy feedbacks.
However, since the mission, inflation has increased further and the CPIX has been
downgraded as underpredicting on trend headline inflation. The authorities now use several
indicators to gauge pressure.
30.
There was agreement that policy success means anchoring inflation expectations.
Inflation expectations are drifting up above the 2-percent target. The neutral policy rate is
around 4¼ percent, and actual rates should oscillate around that level. Since current inflation
pressures should not be allowed to slip into second round effects, the staff therefore
recommended that the repo rate should have an upward bias, weighing elevated inflation
indicators against some relief that should come with the economic slowdown. The authorities
did not disagree with staff.
D. Fiscal Policy
31.
Fiscal policy is subject to two rules: (i) an average surplus of 1 percent of GDP over
the cycle, and (ii) an expenditure ceiling for central government and social security outlays.
Local governments have little independent financing. This framework endeavors to address
Sweden’s demographic transition and commitments under the welfare state; and originated in
reaction to the scary deficits in the early-1990s. The framework is very valuable, but its
implementation requires cyclical dating and is not fully anchored in a long-run analysis.
32.
The 2008 Fiscal Policy Bill aims the surplus at 2.9 percent of GDP, with further
strengthening through 2011 on current policies. Its centerpiece is a SEK11 billion
expansion in the earned income tax deduction. Together with other measures, tax cuts are 0.6
percent of GDP. These are offset by lower disability and other entitlement outlays—so that
the structural surplus is little changed in 2008. On current policies, including these reforms
and subindexing of some allocations, the authorities project a fiscal surplus of 4 percent of
GDP by 2011.
33.
Given this strong fiscal position and slowing growth, the authorities are expected
to offer fiscal support in the 2009 budget (Table 8). They are expected to cut income taxes
further and increase spending on infrastructure, R&D, and preschooling. Staff believes the
stimulus should not exceed 1 percent of GDP. Such support would not undermine Sweden’s
strong fiscal stance, and would be prudent in view of contingencies worth noting:

28
•
The supply reforms 5 (see below) include entitlement cuts, which could lead to some
substitution between programs or displacement of beneficiaries from the central to lower
levels of government. The net fiscal savings are therefore difficult to estimate.
•
The earned income deduction is a variant of the earned-income tax credit, which in
some countries has proven costly. Also, support for household services has met with great
demand and could also turn out costly.
•

The sizeable surplus could trigger rent seeking and unproductive spending.

•
The slowdown, coupled with bank risks, could reduce revenue and lead to contingent
fiscal needs.
34.
The authorities explained their fiscal measures to boost labor supply (Box 3).
These include scaling back active labor market programs and tightening sickness and
unemployment insurance schemes. Further, in 2007, Sweden introduced a job and
development guarantee for young and long-term unemployed and immigrants. Some taxes
and social contributions were cut to boost participation.
•
The earned income deduction has removed important distortions in the marginal tax
schedule. Some of this benefit may be offset by income effects that vary along the income
distribution. Interlocutors explained that this involved careful compromises in view of the
unusual hump-shaped income dependent standard deduction—a feature unique to Sweden.
•
The targeted incentive programs have so far provided ample net savings for the
central government. However, over time, here too, there may be some netting out as agents
adapt their behavior or as some displacement occurs to other programs and levels of
government. If the economy stays strong, this effect should be limited.
35.
The interaction of the fiscal policy measures got some attention. The measures are
courageous and well taken in Sweden’s extensive welfare state. However, it is recognized
that the combination of targeted and broad-based measures can lead to complicated tax and
benefit system interactions that subtract from transparency. Going forward, it would be
important therefore not to multiply narrowly targeted programs—to benefit transparency and
reduce compliance costs. The authorities and other stakeholders actively monitor and
evaluate the labor supply and demand measures to track their impact on employment, hours
worked, and at different levels of government budgets, which is welcome.

36.
The Staff explored the possibility of a public sector balance sheet serving as a
long-run fiscal anchor. Indeed, the Swedish National Audit Office and the independent
Fiscal Policy Council have called for fuller disclosure of public assets and liabilities. While
the Budget Bill provides the annual budget constraint, Sweden faces a broader array of
obligations, including those for social spending and aging in the long run, which deserve
reflection in the annual accounts. Intertemporal net worth—which captures such
obligations—constitutes the ultimate budget constraint; it should be nonnegative (Box 4).
37.
The authorities agreed that aging costs are key for fiscal sustainability. They
initially estimated aging costs on pensions, health, disability, unemployment, and education,
to be 2.2 percent of GDP between 2004-50 (Figure 16). More recent estimates put this figure
even lower. However, an independent staff evaluation suggests that comprehensive aging

31
costs could be as high as 8.0 percent of GDP, reflecting higher health care inflation and lower
productivity growth with aging. These differences are too large for comfort, and the staff
recommended that the authorities request an independent evaluation of forecasting models
and assumptions for long-term aging costs and fiscal projections. While long-term
projections are invariably wide-ranging, monitoring them over time should lead to narrowing
of differences and building comfort with the analysis and policy implications. The authorities
concurred and would conduct further analysis.

Box 4. A Preliminary Public Sector Balance Sheet 6
Current net worth. The balance sheet in Table 9 records assets and liabilities of the
government. Sweden publishes data on financial assets and debt, but not on the public sector
capital stock, which was estimated by the staff. Subtracting liabilities from assets yields
government current net worth—public sector wealth. Sweden’s is around 60 percent of GDP,
higher than in most rich countries.
Forward-looking position. The public also needs information about forward looking policies,
especially liabilities in the welfare system. To estimate the forward looking net position, the
mission constructed a long-run potential output path and, with the inflation target, a long run
nominal GDP path. This permits projecting long-run fiscal balances under current policies, and
the evolution of assets, liabilities, and net worth. Net worth, 50 years hence, can be discounted
to arrive at intertemporal net worth—the net worth in current krona that would result if current
policies were maintained for 50 years, given expected demographics and aging costs.
Sweden’s long run position is satisfactory if aging costs are contained. With low aging
costs, the net worth constraint is amply met. With high aging costs, the net worth constraint is
just met, but difficulties would emerge in due course. Given these wide-ranging estimates of
aging costs, the results should be further analyzed by the authorities using their detailed data.
Financial net worth. It was agreed that further analysis is needed to assess whether a more
restricted net worth concept, such as financial net worth (i.e. excluding nonmarketable/nonliquid assets) would be a better indicator of long run fiscal sustainability.

32
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The Swedish economy has performed well. Output and employment growth have
been high, inflation has been moderate, the financial system is functioning well, public
finances are solid, and the external position is favorable. Sweden has addressed demographic
challenges with pension reform and now with labor supply measures.
39.
The future also holds promise, subject to risk management. Now is the time to
strengthen financial system resilience, before risks rise further. Inflation is ticking up, and
monetary policy needs to be firm to anchor inflation expectations. Sweden has fiscal space,
but contingencies in the public finances warrant monitoring.
40.
Linkages between the financial system and the real economy are gaining
importance. The recent financial turbulence has shown that markets can react to dents in
confidence with high speed, thereby increasing credit costs and pinching off growth. This
adds a premium to sound bank management, supervision, and regulation. Here too, Sweden
has made progress—with four large banks emerging from the crisis of the early 1990s to
become dominant players in the Swedish market, while diversifying in Scandinavian and
Baltic neighbors and beyond. This strategy offers opportunities, but also requires tight risk
management to minimize contingent claims on Swedish and foreign tax payers.
41.
Market signals indicate increasing banking risks. Stock prices have dropped and
credit default swap spreads have increased, particularly for banks active in the Baltics. Rating
agencies, the Riksbank, FSA, and the banks themselves are confident that they are able to
cope with adverse events, as shown in stress testing and internal risk models. Nevertheless,
increased interconnectedness in financial systems can greatly accentuate the impact of
shocks. With the strong current position, banks should bolster resilience, and the authorities
need to cement their ability to deal with stress, should it come.
42.
Sweden needs a dedicated remedial and resolution banking framework. The
special provisions used to manage the banking crisis in the early 1990s are no longer in place.
Markets are faster now, banks are larger, and regional cross-border dimensions add layers of
complexity. The Ministry of Finance is working on a draft law that formalizes the resolution
framework, and this effort should be completed rather sooner than later. Staff is mindful that
such legislation requires close legal scrutiny, but more delays would increase vulnerabilities.
43.
Sweden could benefit from an FSAP update. The authorities have made
meaningful progress in addressing the 2002 FSAP recommendations, but some deficiencies
remain given the growth and complexity of the financial system. An update appears
opportune for identifying policy priorities to bolster further financial sector resilience.
44.
The krona is freely floating with its value determined daily by market demand
and supply. The current position of the krona provides Sweden with strong competitiveness.
The staff expects the krona to appreciate gradually over the medium term, and the current
account surplus to decline as the saving-investment balance gravitates to a longer-term
equilibrium. A firmer krona would assist to lean against the wind of foreign price increases.

33
45.
The inflation targeting framework is working well. Nevertheless, with the jump in
energy and food prices inflation has risen above the upper limit of the band, and indicators of
core inflation and inflation expectations are picking up. Short-term pressures should not be
allowed to seep into second-round effects.
46.
Monetary policy should be biased upward. The repo interest rates is 4¼ percent—
only neutral despite rising imported inflation and inflation expectations. Since the mission
visited Stockholm, inflation has increased further and a quarter point increase should be
considered. Policy should not ease until inflation expectations clearly break and broad
indicators of capacity use and economic activity trend down.
47.
The fiscal performance continues to be impressive. For 2008, the authorities are on
track to produce another sound surplus, with an approximately neutral fiscal impulse. The
outlook for 2009 through 2011 continues to be favorable, especially in the official projections
that assume some constant nominal appropriations.
48.
Sweden has fiscal room to respond to a slowdown. The fiscal balance is running
above 1 percent of GDP surplus over the cycle. With the economy likely dipping below
potential next year, the staff supports reforms in the 2009 budget (not exceeding 1 percent of
GDP) to cut taxes and to increase public investment in infrastructure, R&D, and
preschooling. These steps should aim at strengthening further long-run supply conditions.
49.
The authorities continue to pursue an ambitious structural reform program to
increase employment. Staff supports the thrust of these measures. Going forward, it would
be important to limit distortions to benefit transparency in the tax and benefit system and
reduce compliance costs. Evaluations of labor supply and demand measures by the authorities
and stakeholders are welcome and warranted to track their impact on employment, hours
worked, and different levels of government.
50.
The government could include an intertemporal public sector balance sheet in
the Budget Bills, updated on an annual basis. Sweden’s demographic profile and aging
costs appear modest in comparison with other high-income countries, and it may even be
satisfying its long-run intertemporal budget constraint of positive net worth—few countries in
the world have such an enviable position. Such a balance sheet would provide additional
transparency into the fiscal position and forward-looking strategy, thereby enriching the
public debate. The balance sheet should include alternative scenarios on long-run
productivity, growth, and aging costs. An independent body could prepare estimates of aging
costs, which are key parameters driving the long-run outlook.
51.

It is recommended that Sweden remain on the 12-month Art. IV Consultation cycle.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 1, 2008

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the circulation of
the staff report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation. It does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Inflation rose to 4.3 percent in June (higher than expected by the authorities, staff,
and other analysts), and is now at its highest level since the mid-1990s.
3.
Monetary policy. In response, the Riksbank raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis
points to 4.5 percent, and raised its interest rate path forecast—i. e. signaling an upward bias
for the near term. The minutes of the policy meeting reveal that some committee members
would have preferred to retain a neutral stance, on expectations that the slowing economy
will soon start to reduce inflation.
4.
The labor force survey for June indicated that employment in persons and hours
worked continued to increase year-on-year, but unemployment nevertheless ticked up
noticeably, especially for younger workers.
5.
Consumer and business confidence both declined in June based on concerns about
employment prospects, the continued high energy and food prices, and the slowing external
environment.
6.
Banking developments. SEB and Swedbank, the dominant Swedish banks in the
Baltics, surprised with profits on the upside in the second quarter of 2008. Nevertheless, their
loan impairment is rising (from low levels) and funding conditions and market sentiment
have weakened over time. Swedbank was downgraded by Moody’s, reflecting its large
exposure to the slowing regional economies.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Sweden
On August 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Sweden. 1
Background
A center-right government took office in 2006 and is boosting labor participation and reducing
reliance on the welfare state. The government has cut some income taxes and reduced benefit
and active labor market programs. It is continuing strong fiscal policies to reduce debt.
Swedish banks have been resilient to global financial turmoil, but risks are rising. Share prices
have dropped, and CDS spreads have widened, especially for those banks exposed to the
slowing Baltic economies. Vulnerabilities have been mitigated by strong conditions in the
Swedish economy, so far, even though Swedish house prices also warrant monitoring.
The economy has performed well, but is sensitive to global demand and activity is now
moderating. Exports have benefited from sound competitiveness, but euro-area and US slowing
is causing them to decelerate. Private consumption growth has been relatively smooth, as
employment and wages have picked up, and disposable income further benefited from tax cuts.
Investment expanded rapidly in recent years, as capacity tightened and supported by a

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

competitive krona. Employment growth reached 2 percent, and the unemployment rate declined
from 8 percent in 2005 to 6 percent in early 2008.
Tight capacity constraints boosted prices and wages. Inflation increased from ½ percent in 2005
to 4 percent in May 2008. Energy and food prices boosted the headline, but the core rate also
rose to 2.9 percent. Wages have firmed up, and the Riksbank is monitoring second round
effects. Unit Labor Costs (ULC) increased when labor productivity fell at the peak of the labor
cycle.
The Riksbank has gradually raised the policy rate to 4.50 percent in July 2008. Fiscal policy
remains strong, and the general government balance is expected to exceed the 1-percent-ofGDP structural surplus rule in the next few years. The 2009 budget, expected this fall, has some
policy room to respond to the slowdown.
With strong fiscal adjustment and high private savings, the external current account surplus
reached 8 percent of GDP. The trade surplus is 7 percent of GDP, and growing net external
assets and favorable returns contributed net factor payments of 2 percent of GDP. Sweden’s
large foreign aid budget contributes outflows in excess of 1 percent of GDP.
Following global financial turbulence, the economy is expected to slow to 2 percent in 2008 and
1¾ percent in 2009. Risks to growth for 2008 are balanced. Risks for 2009 depend, among
other factors, on developments in the banks. If funding costs normalize and the Baltics achieve
a soft landing, stable credit expansion should support growth. If turmoil persists, Swedish
housing prices fall, or Baltic exposures sour, a credit crunch could slow growth below the
forecast. Sweden’s long-term outlook appears sound.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Sweden for its strong economic performance with high output
and employment growth, moderate inflation, a well-functioning financial system, solid public
finances, and a favorable external position. Directors welcomed that successive authorities
have addressed demographic challenges, first with pension reform and now with labor supply
measures. Although subject to some uncertainty, Sweden’s economic prospects are promising,
provided that the financial and economic risks are managed carefully. The main challenges
ahead are to continue to strengthen the financial system’s resilience to adverse shocks and to
firmly anchor inflation expectations.
Directors emphasized that the Swedish financial sector is performing well and that its financial
indicators appear to be sound. They stressed the increasing importance of financial-real
economy linkages, with the financial turbulence showing that markets react to dents in
confidence with high speed and increasing costs that can lower growth. This adds a premium to
sound bank management, supervision, and regulation. Swedish banks’ strategy of diversifying
into Baltic neighbors offers opportunities, but also requires tight risk management to minimize
contingent claims.
Directors noted that market signals were indicating that banking risks have increased. While
rating agencies, the Riksbank, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), and the banks

3
themselves are confident that they are able to cope with adverse events, Directors pointed out
that increased interconnectedness in financial systems could accentuate the impact of shocks
and spillovers. They encouraged the authorities to complete the draft law on a new banking
resolution framework as soon as possible, and recommended that it be applied in a
comprehensive manner. Directors welcomed the meaningful progress made by the authorities
in addressing the 2002 Financial Sector Asesment Program (FSAP) recommendations, and
agreed that an FSAP Update could help identify the policies and measures needed to bolster
further financial sector resilience.
Directors considered that the current position of the krona provides Sweden with strong
competitiveness, and noted the staff’s assessment that the krona is somewhat below its
estimated medium-term equilibrium value. With the krona likely to appreciate gradually over the
medium term, the current account surplus should decline toward a level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals. A firmer krona would also assist in mitigating foreign price
pressures.
Directors welcomed the Riksbank’s recent increase in the policy rate, given that inflation has
risen well above the upper limit of the target band, and indicators of core inflation and inflation
expectations had picked up. As short-term price pressures should not be allowed to seep into
second-round effects, Directors stressed that monetary policy should remain as firm as needed
to clearly break inflation expectations, and welcomed the upward bias in monetary policy.
Directors commended the authorities for their exemplary fiscal performance, and observed that
Sweden now has some fiscal room to respond to a slowdown. Directors considered that the
2009 budget could include some targeted tax cuts and moderate increases in public investment
in infrastructure, Research and Development, and pre-schooling to strengthen further long-run
supply conditions. They welcomed the authorities’ recognition that cautious policies remain
warranted, given the possible drop in revenues as the economy slows. Also, tax measures
could turn out more costly than expected over time and long-run aging costs remain uncertain.
Directors saw merit in further pursuing the intertemporal public sector balance sheet, which
could be included in the Budget Bills, updated on an annual basis. Such a balance sheet would
provide additional transparency to the fiscal position and forward-looking strategy, thereby
enriching the public debate and informing policy. Periodic independent updates of the estimates
of aging costs could also be useful.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to pursue structural reforms to increase
employment. Supply reforms in labor taxation should increase transparency in the tax and
benefit system and reduce compliance costs. Evaluations of the efficacy of the labor supply
measures by the authorities and stakeholders are welcome to make sure that these deliver the
intended effect.
Directors praised the authorities for the high level of official development assistance, noting that
it has exceeded 1 percent of GDP.

Statement by Jens Olof Henriksson, Executive Director for Sweden
August 1, 2008
First, the Swedish authorities convey their appreciation to staff for constructive discussions
in Stockholm, and for a well-drafted report.
Recent Developments
My authorities broadly agree with staff’s overall assessment pointing to sound long-term
prospects for the Swedish economy, but with a slowdown in growth in the near-term due to
the global financial turbulence and deteriorating confidence. The main differences between
staff and my authorities regarding the near-term outlook concern export growth, resource
utilisation and inflation, where my authorities have a more optimistic view on the support
from global growth and a more pessimistic view on the rate of potential growth.
On the support from global growth, staff’s forecast for export growth is below the Swedish
authorities’ projection for the years 2008-2010, while the forecast for import growth does not
differ over the period as a whole. This divergence follows from staff’s expectations of an
appreciation of the Swedish krona. Overall, compared to the Swedish authorities, the
divergence in the outlook for the current account surplus is matched by a divergence in the
opposite direction concerning domestic demand growth.
Staff’s more optimistic expectations about potential growth in the coming years in turn rest
on the idea of a relatively strong ongoing structural recovery following the crisis in the early
1990s. In keeping with this, staff also sees a higher unemployment rate and somewhat lower
inflationary pressures in the years ahead than the Swedish authorities.
Financial Sector Surveillance
My authorities are well aware of certain shortcomings of the possibilities of managing
distressed institutions, and agree with the staff report that improvements are needed in the
legislative framework for bank resolution. Therefore, a new framework is drafted by the
Ministry of Finance. The framework will respond to the issues raised by staff.
However, my authorities disagree with the statement in the staff report that all banks need to
be included in the new framework. The assessment by the Ministry of Finance is that the
largest risk, from a financial stability and society’s need for financial services perspective,
comes from corporate bank and credit-market companies that take deposits. Consequently,
the number of financial institutions potentially encompassed by the framework could be
limited.
The authorities mainly agree with staff’s assessment of how a crisis management framework
should function, and the new framework will include all the tools described in the staff
report, except for redemption of shares, which is viewed as redundant in this framework.

2
My authorities also agree that it is important that the supervisory authority has adequate
resources. The Swedish FSA has continuously been given increased resources from the
Government during the past years. For 2008 the resources were increased with more than 10
percent. It is, however, also important that the supervisory authority has the right focus. The
Government is, therefore, planning a review of the operations of the Swedish FSA in order to
prioritize future activities in this field.
The FSA plays, indeed, an important role in the initial stages of a bank crisis situation, and
also in the continued supervision of the bank subject to authority measures. However, should
the FSA handle all issues related to crisis management, its independence could be
questioned. Consequently, according to the drafted framework, a new designated authority
will be responsible for managing bank crisis resolutions.
The banks’ lending to corporates and households in the Baltic countries continues to be a
cause of concern. The Baltic activities account for a considerable part of the total earnings
and lending for Swedish banks. This makes banks vulnerable to the economic development
of these countries.
Exchange Rate Surveillance
Since, as noted by staff, the krona is floating freely and thus determined by market forces,
there are no clear policy conclusions to be drawn from exchange rate analyses in the Swedish
case. Given the established lack of short-term predictive power of equilibrium exchange rate
valuation models, it is also of limited interest as far as forecasting is concerned. However,
this does not imply a disregard for exchange rate considerations in the Riksbank’s monetary
policy decisions. On the contrary, the recent tightening of monetary policy and the upward
revisions of the Riksbank’s own policy rate forecasts were partially based on the assumption
that foreign price increases will have a smaller effect on the price level in Sweden if
monetary policy lends additional strength to the krona.
Monetary Policy
Staff raises concerns over the pace of policy rate normalization during the 2003-2007 period,
citing deviations from Taylor and other simple inflation targeting rules. However, given the
inflation target, and the low inflation and inflation expectations figures, reported at the time,
as well as relatively low levels of resource utilisation indicated by various negative output
gap measures during most of the period, there was little scope for tighter monetary
conditions. The inflationary pressures that eventually arose were primarily due to unexpected
developments in the world markets for food and energy, rather than domestic capacity
constraints. In this context, the link between low real interest rates and asset price increases
noted by staff is uncontroversial, but not necessarily a reason to accept persistent deviations
from the inflation target.

3
That aside, differences between the actual policy rates and benchmarks provided by simple
rules should be interpreted with great care, especially since the prescriptions of the rules are
highly sensitive to the choices of weights, measures of inflation expectations and what
amounts to a normal policy rate.
On monetary policy in the period ahead, the Riksbank’s July 2008 monetary policy report
reveals that it has drawn the same conclusions as staff about the need for a repo rate path
which is somewhat above the long-term neutral level, and thus, can forestall possible second
round effects of the current inflationary pressures from the food and energy sectors.
Since the previous Article IV consultation, the Riksbank has started publishing its own policy
rate path forecasts with a three-year horizon, intended to yield benefits in terms of clarity of
message and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of monetary policy considerations.
Predictability is also likely to be enhanced by the introduction of attributed comments and
positions of individual governors in the published minutes of monetary policy meetings.
Since last year, the Riksbank has also doubled the frequency of its reporting of key economic
indicators and forecasts supporting its monetary policy decisions to six times per year. In the
end, it is hoped that these improvements will make it easier to understand the Riksbank’s
decisions, including the small differences that it may have with the Fund.
In conjunction with discussions about the combined effects of fiscal and monetary policies, it
is worth noting that the far-reaching policy independence of the Riksbank, as well as
established traditions, precludes any explicit policy coordination between the monetary and
fiscal authorities. This makes the expression “policy mix” somewhat unfortunate as it may
give a different impression.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities have the opinion that the description and recommendations as regards fiscal
policy lack nuances and insight that is present elsewhere in the report. Appropriate fiscal
policy in the future is a function both of short-run macro developments and needs to be
related to long-run outlook including demographic changes.
Staff points out that the framework “requires cyclical dating and is not fully anchored in the
long-run analysis”. Cyclical dating is unavoidable, not a flaw of the framework, and it is true
that we need to improve long-run analysis and this is currently done. It is also worth
mentioning that Sweden’s fiscal position is relatively good compared to other EU-countries.
According to staff there is a risk for accommodative fiscal policy in light of the sizeable
surplus. The government’s overriding political target is enhancing employment. The policy
rests with a responsible economic policy and strong public finances. Strong public finances
create a demand for additional spending. The government is well aware of this risk and has
among other things initiated a fiscal policy council to conduct independent evaluations of the

4
Swedish Government’s fiscal policy. However, the fiscal framework with the expenditure
ceiling, set three years ahead, should imply that this risk is fairly small.
Staff also mentions a number of potential concerns regarding fiscal policy. For example they
point out that the earned income deduction may be costly. Estimates of long-run effects made
by the government, and others, suggest sizeable effects on employment and unemployment.
The very high income taxes in Sweden make sizeable employment effects more likely than in
many other countries. The increased labor supply increases tax revenues, as well as
diminishes benefit expenditures. It is also worth mentioning that entitlement cuts also have
effects on labor supply.
The costs related to the tax credit for household services have so far been smaller than
expected. And as with other tax expenditures these are continuously monitored.
Nonetheless, the authorities concur with staff that it is important to further analyze the
differences in the estimates of the ageing costs, and this should be done by the government
itself, as well as by other independent bodies, e.g. the fiscal policy council. My authorities
agree that the long-run sustainability is by far the most important issue. In order to estimate
the effects on the public finances of an ageing population, the government has strengthened
its efforts as a part of their overhaul of their fiscal framework, to improve and develop the
basic data and the long-run scenario calculations.
The government also agrees with staff’s recommendation to limit the targeted programs to
benefit transparency in the tax and benefit system. It should be noted, however, that the
targeted measures have been important in reducing the number of people being outside the
labor market. General vis-à-vis targeted measures are also a question about limited resources.
Even if the general rate of unemployment is quite low in Sweden compared to many other
countries, employment rates differ greatly for different groups in Sweden. For example, the
rate of unemployment is substantially higher for young, elderly and immigrants.
In addition staff recommends an intertemporal public sector balance sheet in the Budget
Bills, updated on an annual basis. My authorities agree that this would be valuable, and plans
to add such information to the extent possible. The need to develop such analysis must,
however, be considered vis-à-vis the need for other improvements of long-run analysis, e.g.
long-run analysis related to ageing.
The staff report also implies that the local governments have little independent financing. My
authorities would argue that the autonomy for local governments is sizeable as regards
taxation and many expenditure types, though the local governments are dependant on grants
from the central government. The tax base is set by the central government, but the local
governments have full control over the tax rate. The independence is also obvious on the
expenditures side where local governments apply different priorities. The most important

5
restriction is the balance constraint, which requires that if a local government runs a deficit
they are obliged to restore the deficit within three years.
Final Note
I look forward to conveying the outcome of the Board discussion to the Swedish authorities.
This will complete the constructive dialogue in which they have been involved with the
Fund’s staff during this consultation. On behalf of the Swedish authorities, I also look
forward to a fruitful cooperation in the years to come. The authorities intend to authorize
publication of the staff report, in accordance with normal Fund procedures.
