EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Mongolia’s economy has performed very well in recent years. Aided by the sustained
run-up in copper and gold prices, real GDP growth has averaged 9 percent over the past
four years, and per capita income has more than doubled. The external position also
remains comfortable, with gross international reserves reaching a record level of
US$1 billion (4½ months of nonmining imports) and the net present value (NPV) of
external public debt declining to 24½ percent of GDP at end-2007.

•

Inflation has increased sharply from 6 percent (y/y) in June 2007 to 21 percent in
March 2008, posing a risk to macroeconomic stability. The rise in inflation has been
spurred by rapid growth in government spending (particularly for wages and transfer
payments), credit to the private sector, and import prices. Transportation bottlenecks and
other capacity constraints have added to the price pressures.

•

Although the budget recorded significant surpluses over the past three years, fiscal
policy has become increasingly expansionary as government spending has
accelerated. The overall surplus narrowed from 8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2 percent
in 2007, and the 2008 budget projects a deficit of 2½ percent.

•

Monetary conditions have added to inflationary pressures. Broad money increased by
57 percent in 2007, while domestic credit expanded by 67 percent.

Key Issues and Policy Discussion
•

Both fiscal and monetary policies need to be tightened to contain inflation. The
authorities should aim at achieving a modest budget surplus in 2008 by avoiding further
wage increases, consolidating welfare programs, and eliminating low priority capital
projects. Monetary policy should aim at containing the growth of reserve money to
12 percent in 2008.

•

The real exchange rate is currently somewhat undervalued. Greater exchange rate
flexibility is crucial to help lower inflation and maintain external stability.

•

The authorities should move cautiously in tapping nonconcessional sources of
external financing. Nonconcessional borrowing should be considered only for projects
with clear economic viability that cannot be financed from concessional sources, and
only when inflation is under control.

•

Transparent, stable, and internationally competitive fiscal and investments regimes
need to be put in place in the mining sector to take full advantage of Mongolia’s vast
mineral wealth.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Mongolia’s economy has performed very well in recent years. Aided by a sharp
run-up in the international prices of copper and gold, real GDP growth has averaged
9 percent since 2004, while per capita income has more than doubled. Although the upturn
in performance was initially driven by developments in the mining sector, growth has
spread over time to other sectors, including construction, financial services, and other
private sector activities. High minerals prices and improvements in tax administration have
generated rapid growth in government revenues, and the budget recorded significant
surpluses over the past three years.
2.
Growth picked up to 10 percent in 2007, while signs of overheating became
increasingly apparent in the second half of the year. Inflation rose from 6 percent
(y/y) in June 2007 to 21 percent in March 2008. The inflationary pressures reflected a
relaxation of monetary and fiscal policies, large increases in import prices for food and fuel,
and transportation capacity constraints (Box 1).
3.
Monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly. Reserve money grew by
39½ percent in 2007, driven by a large increase in net foreign assets of the Bank of
Mongolia (BOM). With strong domestic demand and a cut in the reserve requirement, broad
money increased by 57 percent (y/y) at end-2007, while credit to the private sector
increased by 75 percent.
4.
The overall fiscal surplus declined from 8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2 percent
in 2007, as spending increased by 10 percentage points of GDP. The growth in spending
reflected a proliferation of overlapping and virtually universal social welfare programs (the
child money program, newly-wed benefits, and a newborn child allowance), a 49 percent
increase in the civil service wage bill, and more than a doubling of capital spending.
5.
Budget revenues also increased relative to GDP, although not as rapidly as
expenditure. In particular, minerals revenues rose from an average of 2½ percent of GDP
in 2001−05 to 10½ percent in 2006 and 14½ percent in 2007, reflecting the increase in
copper and gold prices and the impact of the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) on these products
that was introduced in June 2006.1 With improvements in tax administration and
compliance, nonmining revenues remained at 26 percent of GDP in 2007, virtually
unchanged from 2006 despite significant cuts in the VAT, personal income tax, and
corporate income tax rates at the beginning of 2007.2
1

A WPT of 68 percent was introduced on copper revenue from prices exceeding the sum of a base price
($2,600 per ton) and smelting costs, and gold revenues from prices exceeding $500 per ounce.
2

The 2007 tax reform package included reductions of 5 percentage points in both the VAT and corporate
income tax rates and unification of the personal income tax at a 10 percent rate.

CPI inflation increased rapidly in the
second half of 2007, rising from 6 percent
(y/y) in June to 15 percent in December.
In terms of contributions, food prices
accounted for two third of inflation, with
prices of bread and meat products rising by
38 percent and 20 percent, respectively, at
end-2007, contributing to nearly half of
inflation. Prices of utilities, transport,
education, services, as well as housing rents
also increased at double-digit rates.

Several factors have contributed to the rise in inflation. Rapid growth in government
transfer payments (90 percent in 2007) and the wage bill (49 percent) stimulated domestic
demand, as did rapid growth in broad money (57 percent) and credit to the private sector
(75 percent). On the supply side, the pick up in inflation reflected rising prices of food and fuel
products in China and Russia (Mongolia’s largest trading partners) and the depreciation of the
togrog against the Chinese renminbi (7 percent in 2007) and Russian ruble (8 percent). In
addition, capacity constraints due to transportation bottlenecks put additional upward pressure
on prices.

6.
With domestic demand accelerating, the external current account surplus
narrowed from 7 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2½ percent in 2007. Imports increased very
rapidly, reflecting the run-up in food and fuel import prices and large imports of capital
equipment for the mining sector, while export growth slowed as copper prices and export
volumes reached a plateau. However, the overall balance of payments position remained
comfortable, as imports of capital goods were largely financed by foreign direct investment
in the mining sector.
7.
The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated by 4 percent in 2007.
While the bilateral exchange rate with the U.S. dollar has been largely flat since mid-2006,
the togrog depreciated by 7 percent vis-à-vis the Chinese renminbi and 8 percent vis-à-vis
the Russian ruble in 2007. However, the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by
6 percent in 2007, reflecting the pick up in inflation relative to trading partners.
8.
The strong economic performance of recent years has helped reduce
Mongolia’s vulnerability to severe shocks, such as large swings in the terms of trade
and periodic episodes of drought and devastating cold. The net present value (NPV) of
external public debt was cut from 51 percent of GDP at end-2004 to 24½ percent at
end-2007, while international reserves of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) have increased
almost fivefold since 2003 to US$1 billion (4½ months of nonmining imports).3 External
debt is almost entirely concessional, and the debt service burden is low.
9.
The authorities have made progress in implementing recommendations made
by Directors in the 2006 Article IV consultation, particularly with respect to
establishing a sustainable debt position, strengthening central bank governance, and
improving financial sector soundness. However, further progress is needed to contain the
growth in government spending and ensure greater exchange rate flexibility, which are
important to help reduce inflation.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Main Policy Challenges
10.
Mongolia’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable. High minerals prices
have spurred minerals exploration and re-energized plans to exploit very large untapped
deposits of copper, gold, coal, uranium, and other minerals. With the expected opening of
the new Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in 2011, the staff’s baseline scenario envisages
that real GDP growth will pick up from around 7−9 percent in 2008−10 to 12−14 percent in
2011−12. Other large mining projects, including the development of huge coal deposits near
China, are on the drawing boards but not yet incorporated in the baseline scenario, giving

7
significant further upside potential to the outlook. With strong policy implementation, it
should be possible to bring inflation down to a single digit by end-2008 and to maintain a
rate of 5−6 percent over the medium term. The external current account is expected to move
into deficit during 2008−11, reflecting expected declines in copper prices and large
FDI-financed imports of capital equipment for the mining sector, but it is projected to move
back into surplus in 2012, after the Oyu Tolgoi mine comes on stream. The NPV of public
debt, the debt service burden, and international reserves are expected to remain at
comfortable levels.
11.
However, the mission team and authorities agreed that major policy challenges
need to be addressed if Mongolia is to fully exploit this potential. In the near term,
rapidly rising inflation poses the biggest risk to sustainable growth, and both fiscal and
monetary policies need to be tightened to maintain macroeconomic stability. The approach
of parliamentary elections in June 2008 could add to the political difficulty of this task.
Looking ahead, it will be crucial to put in place a medium-term fiscal framework that can
contribute to the maintenance of low inflation and fiscal sustainability, without sharp
disruptive swings in government spending. To take full advantage of Mongolia’s vast
mineral wealth, it will be equally important to have transparent, stable, and internationally
competitive fiscal and investment regimes. Continued progress in strengthening the
financial sector will also be critical for sustained growth.
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The budget calls for the overall balance to swing from a surplus of 2 percent of
GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 2½ percent of GDP in 2008. Despite a cut in the employer
social security contribution rate, revenues are budgeted to reach a record 44½ percent of
GDP, reflecting

rapidly to a record
47 percent of GDP. The growth in spending would be associated with large nominal
increases in the wage bill, social welfare spending, and capital expenditure, following
earlier large increases in each of those categories in 2007. In March 2008, a tax amnesty
program was put into effect, which provides an opportunity for taxpayers to correct their tax
information without penalty.

8
13.
The mission team argued that the fiscal stimulus in the 2008 budget risked
further aggravating inflation. To prevent higher inflationary expectations from getting
entrenched, the mission recommended maintaining a surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP
in 2008. Such a target could be achieved, even with the civil service wage increases granted
at the beginning of the year, by (i) strictly avoiding any further increases in civil service
employment and wages during the remainder of the year; (ii) reducing overlapping social
spending and improving its targeting; and (iii) curtailing low priority capital spending. The
mission also advised the authorities to avoid recourse to fiscal measures to control
inflation.4 Investment spending should be prioritized to ensure there is adequate room for
investment in human capital and basic infrastructure to help avoid the emergence of “Dutch
Disease” as the mining sector grows.
14.
The authorities shared the staff’s concerns about the potential impact of fiscal
policy on inflation. Although the scope for maneuver is limited in the run-up to elections,
the government decided to cancel plans already underway for further spending increases in
an amended budget. In addition, line ministries had been instructed in recent weeks to
identify cuts in their purchases of goods and services that could be implemented in the
second half of this year. On price stabilization measures, the authorities terminated
subsidies for petroleum importing companies after the small budget allocation (0.2 percent
of GDP) was spent. The temporary VAT and customs duty exemptions on wheat and flour
imports have also been lifted, and an agreement was recently reached with Russia that will
ensure wheat supplies at a stable price.
15.
Parliament has authorized the government to issue commercial foreign debt of
up to US$1.2 billion (25 percent of GDP). The mission stressed that borrowing and
spending on this order of magnitude could further aggravate inflationary pressures and, as
indicated in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), cause Mongolia’s debt burden
indicators to breach their indicative thresholds in the medium term (see Supplement on
DSA). The mission and the authorities agreed that Mongolia should continue to rely
primarily on concessional borrowing in the near term, while recognizing that Mongolia’s
infrastructure investment needs were very large and that the country’s eligibility for
concessional lending facilities would likely taper off in the coming years as per capita
income continues to rise. The authorities also indicated that capacity needs to be
strengthened and a comprehensive risk management framework needs to be put in place.
Any foreign financing should be fully consolidated with the general budget to ensure fiscal

Measures for price stabilization include a temporary exemption of VAT (10 percent) and customs duties
(5 percent) on wheat and flour imports, building up of wheat and flour reserves, and subsidies to reduce interest
expenses of petroleum importing companies.

9
transparency. The mission encouraged the authorities to continue the negotiations of
overdue obligations with bilateral creditors.5
16.
The staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the macro-fiscal framework
to help cope with the inherent volatility and uncertainty of a large mining sector. The
government’s current practice essentially targets a constant overall budget balance in
percent of GDP over the medium term, which can lead to highly procyclical spending. The
mission suggested that the authorities aim at reducing the nonmineral deficit (overall
balance minus mining taxes, dividends, and royalties) from 12½ percent of GDP in 2007 to
8 percent of GDP by 2010 and thereafter. This fiscal target would ensure intertemporal
smoothing of spending and result in a gradual further reduction in the NPV of public debt to
18 percent of GDP over the medium term (see Supplement on DSA). In addition, the
authorities should consider setting a separate overall limit on the growth of spending or the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio, reflecting the absorption capacity of the economy, to avoid
overheating pressures. This rule would provide an additional anchor to ensure
macroeconomic stability when total spending supported by the nonmineral balance targeting
exceeds the economy’s absorption capacity. The mission stressed that the tax amnesty
granted in early 2008 could adversely affect incentives for future tax compliance, and it
advised the authorities to strengthen tax enforcement to help achieve the intended goal of
tax base broadening.
17.
The authorities agreed that fiscal policy rules should be refined over time to
ensure macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, although the formal adoption
of these rules would be difficult in the near term. The authorities agreed about the need
for transparent, stable, and internationally competitive fiscal and investment regimes for the
mining sector. On the issue of state equity participation in the mining sector, they stressed
that public opinion was strongly in favor of greater state ownership, but they believed that
increased state equity in large strategic deposits could be acquired gradually over time.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
18.
The authorities and mission team agreed that the growth in monetary
aggregates should be slowed to help bring inflation down. Toward this end, the mission
recommended that growth in reserve money should be slowed to about 12 percent in 2008,
which should be consistent with bringing inflation down to about 9 percent by end-2008 and
5−6 percent thereafter. Given the fiscal target suggested by the mission, this would require
an increase in the volume of central bank bills (CBBs) equal to about ½ percentage point of
GDP during the year. Towards this end, the BOM raised the policy interest rate on
seven-day bills to 9.75 percent in March 2008, bringing the cumulative increase since July
5

Negotiations to settle overdue obligations with bilateral creditors (Bulgaria, China, Finland, Romania, and
Russia) are underway.

10
2007 to 335 basis points, and reserve money growth slowed sharply in the first three months
of the year. Should inflation not show clear signs of declining in the near future, the mission
argued that further increase in the policy interest rate would be appropriate. To help contain
liquidity expansion, the mission advised to put a hold on plans to transfer deposits of the
Social Security system from the BOM to commercial banks.
19.
With the level of international reserves now broadly comfortable, the mission
argued that a further large increase in international reserves was not needed and
could, indeed, complicate the task of reducing inflation. A flexible exchange rate policy
would, therefore, be an important component of a tightening of monetary policy. In line
with the recommendations of a concurrent TA mission by Monetary and Capital Markets
Department, the team recommended that the BOM widen its bid-offer spread, reduce the
scope of transactions taking place at the BOM’s reference rate, and require that a share of
mining taxes by the largest copper mine be paid in local currency.
20.
The authorities argued that Mongolia already had a floating exchange rate
regime. They explained that the situation in 2006-07 was atypical because some large
mining companies had decided to pay some of their sharply increased tax liabilities in
foreign currency. In terms of its operations in the foreign exchange market, the BOM had
been a significant net seller of international reserves. However, the authorities agreed that,
particularly with the structural changes that were taking place in the economy, there was a
need to strengthen the interbank foreign exchange market. Towards this end, they were
giving consideration to limiting the payment of taxes in dollars. They also noted that a
screen-based foreign exchange trading system is under development by the BOM and the
commercial banks, which should facilitate development of market.
21.
The staff’s assessment indicates that the real effective exchange rate may
currently be somewhat undervalued. In this connection, the mission reiterated the
importance of exchange rate flexibility to facilitate the maintenance of external stability
(Box 2).
D. Preserving Financial Sector Soundness
22.
The recent joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) found that the BOM’s framework for bank supervision is generally well
developed and that the BOM is aware of the risks faced by some individual banks. The
banking system’s risk-weighted capital adequacy, return on assets, and return on equity
were all at comfortable levels in 2007, and the share of nonperforming loans in gross loans
has been cut from 5.6 percent at end-2005 to 3.2 percent at end-2007. Nevertheless, the
authorities recognized that measures of loan quality could be distorted in the current
environment of rapid credit growth and said they would be vigilant in this regard. A few
small banks, which did not pose a systemic risk, were considered more vulnerable and
remained under an enhanced supervisory regime. The FSAP team advised the BOM to

11

Box 2. Assessment of Mongolia’s External Stability
Staff estimates using the reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate approach of the CGER
indicate that the togrog is currently somewhat undervalued. The estimated vector error correction
model based on 1992−2007 data shows that the coefficients of all fundamentals have the expected
signs and are statistically significant.1 The results suggest that the togrog may be somewhat
undervalued in relation to the medium term level of its fundamental determinants. These results are
consistent with the depreciations of the

with these results.
While the current account is expected to be subject to significant fluctuations over the medium
term, this reflects the time profile of large mining projects and is not expected to result in
external instability. The current account balance is projected to swing from a surplus of 2½ percent
of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 9−13 percent of GDP in 2008−10, reflecting large-scale imports of
capital equipment for new mining projects financed by foreign direct investment. When the mine
subsequently comes on stream, the current account would be expected to revert to a large surplus.
Despite these swings in the current account, however, international reserves would remain
comfortable and stable in terms of months of next year nonmining imports.
Under these circumstances, the exchange rate should not be expected to eliminate fluctuations
in the current account. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions about the
equilibrium exchange rate from the external sustainability approach, which implicitly makes such an
assumption. Likewise, the macroeconomic balance approach, in which the estimated current account
norm would be largely unaffected by the mining projects, could provide misleading results in the
Mongolian case. The large structural changes underway highlight the importance of a flexible
exchange rate regime both to promote macroeconomic stability and to support long-term structural
adjustment to a growing mining sector.

closely monitor the suitability of bank shareholders and managements in light of the recent
changes at some banks.
23.
The supervision of nonbank financial institutions is at an earlier stage, but
progress is being made. The Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC), established
in 2006, has been working to relicense savings and credits cooperatives (SCCs), insurance
companies, and other nonbanking financial institutions. With that process under way, the
mission advised the authorities to provide no further bailouts to SCCs. Significant steps
have been taken to strengthen the framework for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), including the establishment of a Financial
Intelligence Unit in the BOM. Remaining gaps, particularly with respect to the reporting of
suspicious transaction by banks and the capacity constraints in law enforcement, still need
to be addressed. The mission encouraged the authorities to proceed cautiously with
proposals to establish a development bank to avoid the risk of political interference. The
operations of the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation should remain narrowly focused so that
they do not impede the development of private sector housing finance.
24.
The BOM has made important strides in strengthening its own risk
management and governance structures by strategically managing and controlling
exposure to financial and operational risks. These efforts include the creation of an
investment committee in the BOM as well as a risk management unit responsible for
identifying and managing the BOM’s financial and policy risks. Since September 2007, the
risk management unit calculates the Value-at-Risk of its portfolio on a daily basis to
monitor market risks. Foreign reserves are divided into short-term and long-term portfolios
to manage liquidity risk, and the State Foreign Exchange Reserve Management Regulation,
revised in January, requires that counterparties are rated “AA-” or higher. By order of the
Governor, the BOM has discontinued dealing in gold and currency options for commercial
purposes, and all outstanding positions were closed upon expiration.
E. Other Issues
25.
The recent Review of Standards and Codes conducted by the IMF’s Statistics
Department found that Mongolia meets most of the recommendations of the General
Data Dissemination Standards. However, the scope and coverage of the national accounts
and government statistics need further improvement and the authorities need to broaden the
dissemination of macroeconomic data to the public. The staff welcomed Mongolia’s
participation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, and encouraged the
authorities to make progress in publishing government’s and companies’ reports and
completing the audit of government revenues from extractive industries.

13
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Mongolia’s economic performance in recent years has been impressive. GDP
growth has averaged more than 9 percent per annum since 2004, and per capita income has
more than doubled. The budget has recorded three consecutive years of surplus, the public
debt burden has been cut sharply, the external current account is in surplus, and
international reserves have reached record levels.
27.
Medium-term prospects are favorable, as high minerals prices have spurred
exploration and re-energized plans to exploit large untapped deposits of copper, gold,
and other minerals. However, major challenges need to be addressed for Mongolia to fully
exploit this potential. Inflation has risen sharply over the past year and is now posing a
threat to macroeconomic stability. In addition, delays have been experienced in finalizing
some new investment agreements in the mining sector. In this environment, policies should
focus on reducing inflation, keeping fiscal policy on a sustainable track, establishing a
transparent, stable, and internationally competitive mining regime, and continuing to
strengthen the financial sector.
28.
Fiscal policy should be promptly tightened to contain inflationary pressures.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision not to proceed with plans for substantial
additional spending in an amended budget. Nevertheless, given the continued high level of
copper and gold prices, the authorities should aim at maintaining a modest fiscal surplus
in 2008, instead of the 2½ percent of GDP deficit that is budgeted. This could be achieved
by containing the wage bill, curtailing low priority capital spending, and taking initial steps
to reduce the overlapping coverage and improve the targeting of social welfare programs.
Consolidation and improved targeting of welfare programs could facilitate the protection of
the vulnerable groups from the impact of food price hikes.
29.
Mongolia’s medium-term fiscal framework should help the authorities cope
with the uncertainty and volatility of a large mining sector. Taking a conservative view
of the timetable for bringing large new mining projects on stream, the staff recommends
that the authorities reduce the nonmineral deficit from 12½ percent of GDP in 2007 to about
8 percent of GDP over the medium term, with a separate limit on the growth in nominal
expenditure or the expenditure-to-GDP ratio. To maintain macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability, the authorities should be cautious about tapping nonconcessional sources of
external finance. Such borrowing should be considered only for projects with clear
economic viability that cannot be financed from concessional sources, and only when
inflation is under control.
30.
Monetary policy should also be directed at reducing inflation. The staff
welcomes the BOM’s recent decision to raise the yield on CBBs and encourages the BOM
to consider a moderate further increase in order to reduce the possible need for a more
abrupt tightening in the future. The real exchange rate is currently somewhat undervalued,

14
and greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate the tightening of monetary policy and
enhance the economy’s resilience to external shocks. Toward this end, the BOM should
reduce the use of the reference rate for its transactions with market participants and foster
the development of an interbank foreign exchange market.
31.
The staff welcomes the progress made by the BOM to strengthen its risk
management and governance structures. Looking forward, the BOM should continue to
strengthen the management of international reserves, particularly the gold reserves, reduce
its role in domestic gold market, and improve the transparency of its operations.
32.
The BOM’s framework for banking supervision is generally well developed,
and the condition for the banking system as a whole is generally comfortable. In
addition, the FRC has made progress in the supervision of nonbank financial institutions, by
conducting offsite examinations of the savings and credit cooperatives, requiring their
relicensing, and closing insolvent institutions. However, the rapid growth in banking system
credit and the rollover of loans could make it difficult for the BOM to spot emerging
problems in the banking system. Going forward, the authorities should continue to upgrade
the supervisory framework by monitoring large exposures and improving the supervision of
liquidity and operational risks of banks, enacting draft laws to support the supervision of
nonbank financial institutions, and continuing to develop tools for consolidated supervision.
If the authorities proceed with plans to introduce a deposit insurance system, payments into
the system should reflect the condition of individual banks, and the system should not be
extended to any nonbank financial institutions.
33.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve data quality for
surveillance and encourages the authorities to make further progress in completing
the GFSM 2001 pilot study and reconciling the discrepancies between fiscal and
monetary data on domestic financing. Considering the increasing role of private capital
flows in the economy, the staff encourages the authorities to monitor the size and nature of
private capital flows, while maintaining an open capital account regime.
34.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Mongolia take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MONGOLIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Steven Dunaway and Michael Hadjimichael (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
May 6, 2008
After four years of strong economic performance, Mongolia is now at a low risk of debt
distress and, with its vast mineral wealth, the public debt burden is projected to continue to
decline. Debt burden indicators under the baseline and the standard stress tests are
generally well below their indicative thresholds, even in the event of a decline in the terms of
trade or further delays in developing a large new copper and gold mine. However, a large
issuance of nonconcessional external sovereign debt, which is being considered, could raise
concerns over Mongolia’s debt sustainability. In addition, the historical scenario leads to a
prolonged and sustained breach of the threshold for the NPV of debt-to-GDP. The Staff
considers, however, that this result should be interpreted cautiously given the extensive
structural changes that have taken place in the economy, which implies that a scenario based
on historical averages does not appropriately capture the risks to the economy.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses Mongolia’s fiscal and external
debt outlook using the joint IMF/World Bank forward-looking debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries (LICs).1 Compared with the previous exercise, the
baseline scenario of the current analysis assumes that the development of Oyu Tolgoi (OT)
mine will go forward, which leads to substantial increases in GDP, exports, and government
1

The DSAs presented in this document are based on the common standard LIC DSA framework. Under this
framework, Mongolia is rated as a medium performer with regard to its policies and institutions, and the debt
sustainability is analyzed in relation to the indicative threshold indicators for countries in this category. See
“Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04)
and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework,
Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0629,
9/10/04) and “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief”,
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110606.pdf and IDA/SecM2006-0564, 8/11/06).

revenues starting from 2011.2 The current analysis also recognizes that private external debt
and portfolio capital flows, in addition to foreign direct investment, are likely to be of
increasing importance in the economy in the future.
2.
Mongolia’s public debt at the end of 2007 was estimated to amount to 40 percent
of GDP. Most of Mongolia’s public debt is external with about 60 percent of external debt
contracted with multilateral creditors on concessional terms and the remaining amount
contracted with official bilateral creditors. At the end of 2007, Mongolia did not have any
outstanding public debt to external commercial creditors.
II. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC AND DSA ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The baseline macroeconomic framework is built on the assumption that the
medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Real GDP is assumed to grow by
7−10 percent during 2007−10, underpinned by the development of the OT mine, and increase
to 12−14 percent during 2011−12 when the production of the OT mine comes on stream. In
the long run, real GDP is expected to grow by 5 percent. Inflation is projected to slow to
about 5−6 percent in the medium term, while GDP deflator is expected to decline following
the projected declines in commodity prices.
4.
The baseline scenario assumes that the overall budget would fluctuate from a
surplus in 2008 to deficits in the medium term and back to a surplus in 2014, when the
budget begins accruing significant revenues from the OT mine. Similarly, the external
current account balance will deteriorate in the next few years due to large mining-related
imports of investment goods, but will improve from 2011 when the OT mine begins
production and export growth picks up substantially.3

5.
The baseline scenario assumes that the NPV of public external debt in terms of
GDP would be kept at comfortable levels in the long run. As Mongolia’s per capita
income rises, the share of external financing provided on concessional terms is expected to
decline. The baseline scenario also assumes that Mongolia will no longer receive any grants
in the long run. Along with greater participation of the private sector in the economy, the
external borrowing of the private sector, which (apart from foreign direct investment) has
been negligible so far, is assumed to increase in the medium and long term.
6.
In addition to the standard alternative scenarios and bound tests used in the
DSA exercise, this analysis presents additional country-specific scenarios and shocks.
The first country-specific scenario assumes that the government will borrow a total of
US$1.2 billion in 2008−09 (half in each year) on commercial terms.4 The projects financed
by the bonds are assumed to be economically viable and have a high import content
(90 percent). The second country-specific scenario assumes a 3−year delay in the timetable
for bringing the OT mine on stream and a higher government equity participation
(51 percent) in the project.5 The government’s equity participation is assumed to be financed
through nonrecourse borrowing. Repayment of this loan will be made out of dividends and
the government would not have to make payments exceeding its cash flow from the project.
The third country-specific scenario assumes an adverse terms-of-trade shock in which copper

US$1.2 billion is the maximum amount approved by the Parliament.

The government equity participation in the baseline scenario is 34 percent. The discussions and negotiations to
raise the government equity participation, to at least 51 percent, are now in progress.

and gold prices decline sharply in 2011 (i.e., by 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively, on
top of the WEO projection) and catch up with the prices used in the baseline scenario within
5 years.
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
A. Baseline Scenarios
7.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt remains on a downward trend
over the projection period (Figure 1 and Table 1). Public debt falls from about 46½ percent
of GDP at end-2006 to 26½ percent at end-2012 and continues to decline thereafter.6 Strong
growth, together with buoyant revenues from new mining projects in outer years, bolsters the
downward trend of public debt. In NPV terms, the amount of public debt as a share of GDP
declines to 18 percent by 2012, with further modest declines thereafter. The NPV of debt-torevenue and debt service-to-revenue ratios are also projected to follow a similar pattern.
B. Alternative Scenarios
8.
The alternative scenarios under the standard DSA template suggests that public
debt sustainability would be put at risk if GDP growth and the primary budget balance
reverted to historical averages (Figure 1 and Table 2). However, this result should be
interpreted cautiously. Given the extensive structural changes that have taken place in the
economy, it is not clear that a scenario based on historical averages appropriately captures
the risks to the economy. For this reason, country-specific scenarios have been included in
the LIC DSA analysis.
9.
The analysis based on the country-specific scenarios indicates that large
sovereign borrowing would increase the public debt burden in the medium term
(Table 2). Delays in developing the OT mine and greater government equity participation
would also increase public debt burden slightly over the medium term. However, once the
mine is developed, the debt burden would come down to that of the baseline scenario by
2027.
C. Bound Tests
10.
The bound tests indicate that Mongolia’s public debt sustainability would be
most vulnerable to a sharp decline in economic activity. Given the high importance of the
mining sector in the Mongolian economy, the authorities should ensure that the tax and
investment regimes for the mining sector are transparent, stable, and internationally
competitive.
6

Fiscal surpluses during 2014-22 would lead to a large build up of government assets (a residual item in LIC
DSA framework).

5
IV. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
A. Baseline Scenarios
11.
The results of the external debt sustainability analysis indicate that Mongolia is
now at a low risk of external debt distress (Figure 2 and Table 3). Under the baseline
scenario, the NPV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio, which was 24½ percent (below the
40 percent threshold) at end-2007, is projected to decline to 17½ percent in 2012, dropping
further in the long run. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would stay well below the
corresponding threshold (150 percent) during the entire projection period. Since most of the
external debt is on concessional terms, the debt service ratio would stay at 1−3 percent of
exports, against the 20 percent threshold. The NPVs of debt-to-revenue and debt
service-to-revenue ratios would also stay well below the 250 percent and 30 percent
thresholds, respectively, as a result of buoyant mineral revenues and robust growth.
B. Alternative Scenarios
12.
The debt burden is expected to increase under the alternative scenarios, but
most debt burden indicators would remain below their indicative thresholds (Figure 2
and Table 4). The standard alternative scenario using key variables at historical averages
indicates that the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would breach the threshold in the medium and
long terms, but for the reasons mentioned earlier, the Staff does not consider that this
scenario appropriately captures the risks to the baselines scenario. The issuance of sovereign
bonds worth US$1.2 billion (about a quarter of the projected nominal GDP in 2009), would
make the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio breach the 40 percent threshold in 2009, although the
other indicators would remain below their indicative thresholds. A delay of the OT mine
would raise the debt burden modestly in the medium term, especially in terms of exports and
revenue. However, the external debt burden indicator would improve substantially in the long
run.
C. Bound Tests
13.
The stress test would result in a mild deterioration of the debt burden indicators,
but all these indicators would remain well below their indicative thresholds (Figure 2
and Table 4). Of all the stress tests, the adverse terms-of-trade shock, discussed earlier,
generally results in the most important deterioration of the debt burden indicators. However,
even under the terms-of-trade shock, debt burden indicators are not expected to breach their
indicative threshold because the additional production and exports from the OT mine would
offset the effect of price shocks.
V. CONCLUSION
14.
Mongolia is now at a low risk of debt distress, assuming the authorities continue
to borrow mainly on concessional terms and the external economic environment evolves

6
broadly as envisaged in the baseline scenario. The strong economic performance over the
past years has been crucial for lowering the debt burden, reducing vulnerability to external
shocks, and making room for high priority public investment in the future. However,
Mongolia should move gradually and cautiously in tapping nonconcessional sources of
finance, which should be used only for projects with clear economic viability that cannot be
financed from concessional sources. Establishing transparent, stable, and internationally
competitive mining regime is also important to sustain rapid growth and preserve Mongolia’s
debt sustainability.

Sources: Mongolia authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Assumes that real GDP growth is at baseline minus one standard deviation divided by the square root of 20 (i.e., the length of the projection period).
2/ Assumes that the government issues sovereign bonds of $1.2 billion in 2008–09 ($600 million each year).
3/ Assumes that the Oyu Tolgoi mining project will be delayed by 3 years and government equity participation in the project will be 51 percent.
4/ Revenues are defined inclusive of grants, however not all grants reported in the balance of payment are included in the budget.

Average

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) was subject to a
full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved by the
Executive Board on September 28, 2001. An on-site safeguards assessment of the BOM was
completed on September 10, 2003. Staff recommended that the BOM implement measures to
strengthen its external audit mechanism and financial reporting framework. The BOM has so far
implemented several of the recommendations. Staff continues to monitor the BOM’s efforts to:
(i) commit to the full adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS) and to disclose its
guarantees and pledges in its financial statements; and (ii) disclose the fair value of derivatives in
its net international reserve position and financial statements. At the conclusion of the

3
December 2002 PRGF discussions, the BOM agreed to implement special semi-annual audits of
NIR to provide further assurance on the NIR position and to identify any related pledges or
guarantees.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

On May 27, 1993, Mongolia moved from a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to a
floating exchange rate system. The official exchange rate is set daily on the basis of transactions in
the foreign exchange market. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a
conventional peg effective from June 2006. The official exchange rate is applied to State budget
and customs transactions, including debt-service payments, and to trade and service transactions
conducted under bilateral payments arrangements. Mongolia accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system that is
free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Mongolia
imposes exchange restrictions for security reasons in accordance with United Nations Security
Council Resolution No. 92/757 concerning certain transactions with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that have been notified to the Fund under
Decision 144-(52/51).
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2006 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 07/30) was concluded by the
Executive Board on January 10, 2007. Mongolia is on the 12–month cycle.

ANNEX II. MONGOLIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
Mongolia became a member of the World Bank Group in February 1991. Bank lending to
Mongolia, currently on IDA-only terms, represents about 11 percent of the country’s overall
official development assistance flows. A new World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) is under preparation, which will be broadly aligned with the Mongolian Government’s
National Development Strategy (NDS).
The Bank’s main sectoral activities also include:
Public Sector Governance. The Bank is working with the Government to strengthen its public
finance management framework, improve civil service administration through the combination
of analytical advice, and technical assistance projects under the ongoing Economic Capacity
building Technical Assistance project. In addition, a Governance Assistance Project was
approved in May 2006. This project helps improve transparency, accountability and
governance in the areas of public financial management (budget execution, debt management,
civil service), supports the government in its ongoing anti-corruption efforts, poverty
monitoring, and improving the investment climate (especially, tax administration and public
procurement). A Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review is being prepared for
completion in the first half of 2008. As part of the Bank’s Country Governance Assessment
Program (C-GAP), Governance Assessment is underway in Mongolia which aims at informing
the next CPS implementation process in order to enhance prospects of achieving the desired
development results.
Financial sector. The World Bank Group has actively supported capacity building and reforms in
the financial sector with an emphasis on strengthening banking supervision and credit risk
management capacity of commercial banks. The Bank is jointly conducting a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) with the IMF, and will continue to provide technical assistance
(TA) support under ongoing operations such as the second Private Sector Development Credit
(PSDC II) (which provides technical assistance in developing risk management and termlending capacity in selected Mongolian banks, and enhancing central bank supervision
capacity, in addition to improving access to financing for long-term private sector capital
investments.) The IFC is also playing a significant role in the World Bank Group’s
investments and transactions in the Mongolian financial sector (see below).
Private Sector Development (PSD). The findings from an Investment Climate study completed
in 2006 and a study on Mongolia’s Sources of Growth (the 2007 Country Economic
Memorandum) identified key constraints to sustained broad-based economic growth in
Mongolia over the medium term. The Governance Assistance project is addressing some of
1

Questions may be addressed to Ms. Boyreau, 473-8541.

7
these identified issues related to investment climate issues in the areas of tax administration or
public procurement, as well as in reducing corruption and improving transparency. New
lending operations to encourage private sector participation in infrastructure sector are also
being considered for the next three to four years, as well as in the mining sector Technical
assistance is also being provided at the request of the Government in the mining sector in
cooperation with the ABD, IMF and EBRD.
Social sectors. A Poverty Assessment was completed by the World Bank in 2006 which reports on
the findings of the 2003−2004 HIES-LSMS household survey. The Bank is working with the
Mongolian authorities to help them conduct another HIES-LSMS study in 2007−2008 to track
progress in poverty alleviation in the country over the past few years. In education, the Bank
launched a Rural Education project that will build classroom libraries in all rural elementary
schools in Mongolia. The World Bank is playing a catalytic role in enabling Mongolia to
access $29 million in grant funds under the “Education for All − Fast Track Initiative (FTI)”.
This program will help smooth the ongoing transition in the educational curriculum from a
10-year to a 12-year education system. The Bank has also completed analytical studies on the
quality of the educational system in Mongolia and its implications for the eventual transition
to a 12-grade system. A labor market study by the Bank was also undertaken recently, which
identifies three major interrelated challenges facing Mongolia’s labor market—joblessness,
informality and skills mismatch. In social protection, studies were carried out on the pension
system and the social welfare/transfer schemes in the context of the ongoing Public
Expenditure and Financial Management Review (PEFMR).
Rural and Urban sustainable development. The Bank is also assisting the government in the
development of its rural development strategy. Projects are financing efforts to promote secure
and sustainable livelihoods through activities in pastoral risk management, microfinance
services, basic infrastructure investment (through community-driven approaches), and the
piloting of a new index-based livestock insurance product. In this regard, the second
Sustainable Livelihood Project was approved in 2007. A Forest Landscapes Development and
Conservation project is under preparation. In the area of urban development, the focus of the
Bank Group activities is primarily on city development strategies in Mongolia. The Bank is
also supporting the improvement of basic service delivery, particularly on improvement of
water supply and ger area upgrading.2 In the context of the new CPS, efforts at reducing air
pollution and strengthening urban governance also being discussed with the authorities. The
World Bank has been engaged in partnership with the Dutch government to support analytical
work and technical assistance in the environment and natural resources management areas. In
addition, work is underway to analyze and advise the authorities towards determining its
medium-term infrastructure needs and environmental issues that need to be addressed in the
South Gobi.

Infrastructure. An Information and Communication Infrastructure Development Project was
approved on June 8, 2006. The Bank is working with the government to improve the technical
and financial operations of Mongolian electricity and water utilities through two projects:
namely, the Energy Project and UB2 project respectively. An Infrastructure Strategy report—
including sectoral background notes was completed in early 2007. Ongoing policy discussions
include a range of issues, including: tariffs adjustment in the energy sector; increased reliance
on renewable energy technologies in rural energy supply; strengthening and diversifying
off-grid energy supply chains; and increasing rural access to modern energy facilities. In this
regard, a Renewable Energy and Access Project was approved in November, 2006. The World
Bank is also providing policy advice and assistance to improve energy efficiency and
enhancing the financial sustainability of Mongolia's district heating sector.
Judicial and Legal reforms, Supreme Audit Institutions. The Bank is supporting efforts to enhance
public confidence in the legal system, with a focus on the judiciary system through the
creation of an administrative court system, the establishment of the National Legal Center and
through pilots designed to improve legal education and information. Challenges remain in
improving legal education, enforcing court decisions, enhancing access to justice, especially
for the poor; disseminating new laws to the public; and enforcing existing laws. The Bank
continues to work with the Mongolia National Audit Office to strengthen its technical audit
capacity.
IFC became a minority owner of two Mongolian banks in 2004 as well as providing debt capital
to a third bank. In 2007 IFC became a shareholder in the third bank and will continue in the near
term to support access to finance through the banking sector. The IFC is also providing technical
assistance for developing a leasing industry and the creation of a mortgage corporation. IFC plans
to scale up its activities in Mongolia under the next CPS. It will continue to support the
development of the leasing industry in Mongolia, and could also assist in building an SME
linkages program with an effort towards strengthening local suppliers and supporting community
development. IFC may consider, if appropriate, assistance in developing mining in an
environmentally and socially responsible manner through transaction support, joint financing of
public-private partnerships, and technical assistance. Finally, IFC is currently exploring
opportunities to support manufacturing and agri-business (cashmere industry), renewable energy
and water treatment projects in the Mongolia.
MIGA: Mongolia signed the MIGA convention in 1991 and ratified it the following year. MIGA
is able to assist the country in attracting foreign investment through its guarantee program.

ANNEX III. MONGOLIA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in February 1991. In line
with ADB’s poverty reduction strategy, ADB entered into a Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA)
with the Government of Mongolia in 2000. Within the framework of the PPA, in October 2005,
ADB formulated its Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2006−08. The new CSP
concentrates on achieving poverty reduction by supporting (i) stable, broad based growth and
(ii) socially inclusive development. An indicative lending level of $85 million from ADB’s
concessional Asian Development Fund resources is programmed for 2006−2008, supplemented by
an additional $40 million from ADB’s regional fund. The CSP formulates a program that includes
assistance in agriculture, transport, education, health, and urban development and support for
administrative consolidation in support of interventions in these sectors. A CSP Update for
2007−2009 maintains the overall directions of the CSP while increasing the focus of projects on
the Government’s own strategic objectives, accounting for the need for better governance, the
potential for increased levels of grant funding from other agencies, and ADB’s own Medium Term
Strategy II and its Managing for Development Results Agenda. Since March 2002, Mongolia has
been a full member of the ADB-supported Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program
for the Central Asian Republics and People’s Republic of China (PRC).
ADB has provided loans for 40 projects totaling $675.1 million in the agriculture, education,
energy, financial, health, industry, telecommunications, transport, and urban development sectors.
Fourteen loans were active at the end of 2007. ADB has also provided one private sector equity
investment in the amount of $6.1 million and one private sector credit line of $10 million.
Technical assistance grants have totaled close to $63.0 million, and grants funded by the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction and Japan Fund for Information and Communication Technology
total $10.7 million. Most early ADB support was in the form of quick-disbursing loans and
investments in ailing infrastructure sectors. Governance and poverty were identified as the major
development objectives in later years.
ADB allocates its concessional ADF resources to eligible member countries, including Mongolia,
based on an annual country performance assessment. The assessment focuses on indicators of
sustainable economic growth, socially inclusive development, governance and public sector
management, and portfolio performance. Based upon its debt-sustainability, Mongolia is eligible
for grant funding of 100 percent of its ADF allocation of $46.83 million over 2007–08.

ANNEX IV. MONGOLIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance, but further improvements are needed,
especially on national accounts and government finance statistics. There is also a need for
broadening the dissemination of macroeconomic data to the public. Mongolia participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). A data ROSC mission visited Mongolia in
October 2007 to update the May 2000 assessment of the macroeconomic statistics against the
GDDS, complemented by an assessment of data quality based on the IMF’s Data Quality
Assessment Framework.
The IMF Statistics Department is providing support to the National Statistical Office (NSO) in
implementing its Program of Statistics Development for 2006–2010. It aims to strengthen the
statistical capacity in conformity with the GDDS plans for improvement and to place Mongolia in
a position to subscribe the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
On national accounts and price statistics deficiencies persist in the annual and quarterly
production accounts that detract from the accuracy of the data, including the use of inappropriate
techniques to estimate capital formation and inconsistent deflators to derive constant price
estimates of GDP. While a proper methodological treatment of animal losses due to harsh winters
has been finalized, efforts are needed to improve coverage of the informal sector and small-scale
activity, especially in the services sector. Furthermore, the construction of expenditure-based
national accounts in constant price terms would serve as a useful check for the production side
estimates. The supply and use table for 2005 is being finalized and should provide a new
benchmark for GDP. The first real sector technical assistance mission following the October 2007
ROSC took place in November 2007, and the final mission is expected to take place in late-2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure derived weights
from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). The NSO has published a
national CPI for Ulaanbaatar and 21 aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and is now
developing a house price index. Progress is still needed on wages and earnings data.
The concepts and definitions used to compile fiscal statistics generally follow the guidelines of
the GFSM 1986. No formal decision has yet been taken on adopting a migration path to the
GFSM 2001 methodology, although the new framework is planned to be used for compiling fiscal
statistics. The classifications used for sub-annual and annual fiscal statistics follow broadly the
classifications of the GFSM 1986, but with some differences for financing. A major classification
issue concerns financing. The item banking system net credit is calculated as a residual and the
change in cash balances for the period is not identified separately.
Monetary and financial statistics broadly conform to the concepts and definitions of the MFSM
methodology. The Bank of Mongolia’s (BOM’s) monetary survey covers the central bank and 16
operating commercial banks, but excludes savings and credit unions, which increasingly compete
with commercial banks and whose deposit share is growing rapidly. The September 2006 STA

11
mission recommended actions aimed at correcting misreporting of government deposit data by
commercial banks. The BOM has begun compilation of monetary data based on the Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs), but further technical assistance may be needed to complete the project.
Regarding balance of payments statistics, the BOM strictly follows the concepts and methods in
the Balance of Payment Manual fifth edition. Coverage has been expanded through the
introduction of a survey of enterprises. Work has commenced on revising the register of
businesses, last updated in 2002. In addition, a working group with key official and private data
providers and users has been established and commercial bank staff has been trained in data
reporting. Further progress is needed in the estimation of the international investment position and
in procedures to adjust for nonresponses in the enterprise survey.
As regards dissemination, the NSO publishes monthly and annual Statistical Bulletins in English
and Mongolian. These bulletins include data on population, employment, national accounts,
prices, household income and expenditure, central and local government revenue and expenditure,
and external trade. The BOM publishes an Annual Reports and a monthly Statistical Bulletin,
which includes summary statistics for the central bank, consolidated balance sheet for commercial
banks, and interest and exchange rate data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 1, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Mongolia
On June 4, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mongolia. 1
Background
Mongolia’s economy has performed extremely well in recent years. Aided by a sharp
run-up in the international prices of copper and gold, real GDP growth has averaged
9 percent since 2004, while per capita income has more than doubled. Although the
upturn in performance was initially driven by developments in the mining sector, growth
has spread to other sectors over time, including construction and financial services. High
minerals prices and improvements in tax administration have generated rapid growth in
government revenues, and the budget recorded significant surpluses over the past three
years.
Growth picked up to 10 percent in 2007, while signs of overheating became increasingly
apparent in the second half of the year. Inflation rose from 6 percent (year-on-year) in
June 2007 to 21 percent in March 2008. The inflationary pressures reflected a relaxation
of monetary and fiscal policies, large increases in prices for food and fuel, and
transportation capacity constraints.
Monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly. Reserve money grew by 39½ percent
in 2007, driven by a large increase in net foreign assets of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM),
while broad money and credit to the private sector increased by 57 percent and
75 percent, respectively.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

The overall fiscal surplus declined from 8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2 percent in 2007.
The decline in the surplus reflected an increase in spending amounting to 10 percentage
points of GDP, including a proliferation of social welfare programs, a 49 percent increase
in the civil service wage bill, and more than a doubling of capital spending. Budget
revenues also increased, although less than expenditure, as high copper and gold
prices, the mid-2006 introduction of a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) on copper and gold,
and improvements in tax administration and compliance, more than offset the revenue
loss from cuts in the VAT, personal income tax, and corporate income tax rates.
With domestic demand accelerating, the external current account surplus narrowed from
7 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2½ percent in 2007. Imports increased very rapidly,
reflecting the run-up in food and fuel import prices and large imports of capital equipment
for the mining sector, while export growth slowed. However, the overall balance of
payments position remained comfortable, as imports of capital goods were largely
financed by foreign direct investment in the mining sector.
The strong economic performance of recent years has helped reduce Mongolia’s
vulnerability to severe shocks, such as large swings in the terms of trade and periodic
episodes of drought and devastating cold. The net present value (NPV) of external public
debt was cut from 51 percent of GDP at end-2004 to 24½ percent at end-2007, while
international reserves of the BOM have increased almost fivefold since 2003 to US$1
billion (4½ months of nonmining imports). External debt is almost entirely concessional,
and the debt service burden is low.
Mongolia’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable. High minerals prices have
spurred minerals exploration and re-energized plans to exploit very large untapped
deposits of copper, gold, coal, uranium, and other minerals. With the expected opening
of the new Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in 2011, real GDP growth is projected to
pick up from around 7−9 percent in 2008−10 to 12−14 percent in 2011−12. With strong
policy implementation, it should be possible to bring inflation down to a single digit by
end-2008 and to maintain a rate of 5−6 percent over the medium term. The external
current account is expected to move into deficit during 2008−11, reflecting expected
declines in copper prices and large FDI-financed imports of capital equipment for the
mining sector, but it is projected to move back into surplus in 2012, after the Oyu Tolgoi
mine comes on stream. The NPV of public debt, the debt service burden, and
international reserves are expected to remain at comfortable levels.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Mongolia’s impressive economic
performance in recent years, notably rapid GDP growth, budget and external current
account surpluses, and record levels of international reserves. Directors considered that
the medium-term outlook remains favorable, given Mongolia’s vast mineral wealth.
Nevertheless, they noted that near-term prospects are clouded by rising inflation,
reflecting rapid growth in government spending and private sector credit, large increases
in imported food and fuel prices, and the tightening of supply constraints. If allowed to
persist, these inflationary pressures could threaten macroeconomic stability and impair
growth.

3

Against this background, Directors underlined that the authorities’ immediate priority is to
address the risk of overheating by tightening both fiscal and monetary policies. On the
structural front, steps should be taken to address transportation bottlenecks and other
capacity constraints. Directors encouraged the authorities to establish a transparent,
stable, and internationally competitive mining regime to reap the full benefits of the
country’s mineral resources.
Directors expressed concern about the inflationary consequences of a relaxation of fiscal
policy over the past year. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to cancel plans for
additional spending in an amended budget. With revenues remaining much stronger than
expected in the budget, Directors saw scope for maintaining a small surplus this year by
curtailing low-priority capital spending and containing the wage bill. They welcomed the
authorities’ intention to consider future wage increases carefully in the context of a
broader civil service reform aimed at enhancing efficiency. Directors encouraged the
authorities to reduce the overlapping coverage and improve the targeting of social
spending programs to help contain spending while assisting the most vulnerable groups.
Directors underscored the importance of establishing a clear medium-term fiscal
framework to help anchor macroeconomic stability and avoid sharp swings in spending.
In this context, they advised the authorities to consider, as part of the fiscal framework,
the introduction of a separate limit on expenditure growth and the adoption of realistic
nonmineral fiscal targets. The authorities should continue to rely on concessional
sources of external finance whenever possible. Nonconcessional borrowing should be
considered only for projects with clear economic viability that cannot be financed by
concessional loans, and only when the risks of inflation have diminished. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to consolidate any foreign financing with the general budget
to ensure fiscal transparency.
Directors welcomed the recent tightening of monetary policy, and encouraged the
authorities to stand ready to increase the policy interest rate further as needed. They
observed that international reserves are now at a broadly comfortable level, and that a
further large increase could complicate the efforts to reduce inflation. They also noted the
staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is currently somewhat
undervalued, although a few pointed out that the divergence was within the margin of
error. Directors were of the view that, going forward, greater exchange rate flexibility
would facilitate the conduct of monetary policy and adjustment to external shocks.
Strengthening the interbank foreign exchange market to handle a larger share of foreign
exchange transactions will be important, and in this regard, they welcomed the steps
being taken by the authorities, including for the introduction of a screen-based trading
system.
Directors commended the BOM for the progress made in strengthening its governance
and risk management practices. They encouraged the BOM to expedite the preparation
of a strategy to exit from its role as a major purchaser of domestically produced gold.

4

Directors considered that the overall condition of Mongolia’s financial system is generally
healthy and the framework for banking supervision is well-developed. Given the rapid
credit growth, they encouraged the authorities to monitor large exposures closely and
improve the supervision of liquidity and operational risks of banks. Directors welcomed
the progress made by the Financial Regulatory Commission since its inception in 2006 to
create a framework for the supervision of nonbank financial institutions. Further efforts
are still needed to strengthen the statutory framework, especially for savings and credit
cooperatives, and to develop the tools for consolidated supervision. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ intention to review plans for the establishment of a development bank,
taking account of the experience elsewhere so as to avoid creating unfair competition
and distortions in the financial sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
