IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with France
On July 11, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with France.
The recovery is solidifying. The economy is projected to expand by 1.5 percent this year,
primarily driven by strong consumer spending. There are also signs of a cyclical recovery in
investment, and the slump in residential construction appears to be bottoming out. By contrast,
net exports are declining as demand from trading partners has slowed. Private sector job creation
has remained lackluster and the unemployment rate has hovered around 10 percent. Structural
fiscal adjustment is slowing to near zero this year and the public debt ratio is still rising.
Despite the cyclical recovery, structural rigidities and slower productivity growth across
advanced countries weigh on medium-term prospects. Apart from regulations in the services
sector and the high tax burden, a key obstacle to growth remains the labor market, where
structural unemployment is projected to remain high in the absence of additional reforms. In an
environment with modest medium-term growth prospects at home and in the euro area, France
thus faces two central policy challenges: to support a more rapid creation of new private sector
jobs and to ensure the sustainability of public finances via more efficient government spending
growth.
The government has continued to advance important reforms to help create the conditions for
improved economic performance. These include most notably the reduction in taxes under the
Pacte de Responsabilité et de Solidarité and the Crédit d'Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l'Emploi
(CICE) and the competition-enhancing structural reforms under the Macron law. Building on
earlier labor market reforms including the Rebsamen law, the El Khomri law would be another
step forward, increasing the scope for company-level labor agreements and reducing judicial
uncertainty. As for budget policies, there are ongoing efforts to contain spending growth at all
levels of government while easing taxes.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed France’s continuing recovery, while highlighting increased
downside risks including potential prolonged uncertainty in Europe in the wake of the U.K.
referendum. To secure a durable reduction in unemployment and public debt in the context of a
subdued medium term growth outlook, Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue reforms to
rebuild fiscal buffers, revive job creation, and strengthen competitiveness and productivity
growth.
Directors supported the government’s expenditure based fiscal consolidation strategy, which
aims to secure medium term sustainability while limiting the short term drag on aggregate
demand. They noted, however, that structural fiscal adjustment is slowing and that more
ambitious efforts to keep government spending flat in real terms would help achieve medium
term fiscal targets and a durable reduction in public debt. Directors recommended that, to make
consolidation sustainable and limit potential adverse social and economic effects, it should be
underpinned by efficiency enhancing expenditure reforms at all levels of government.
In light of the high level of structural unemployment and modest medium term growth prospects,
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue pursuing an ambitious structural reform agenda.
They commended the authorities for the targeted reductions in the labor tax wedge and a range of
reforms to improve the social dialogue, reduce judicial uncertainty around dismissals, and
increase the scope for enterprise level labor agreements. To reduce unemployment more rapidly,
Directors recommended additional measures to strengthen job search under the unemployment
benefit system, reform the minimum wage formula, and further adapt education and training to
evolving labor market needs. In order to boost private sector growth and competitiveness, they
also encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum on product market reform, including
easing regulations for start-ups and the self-employed, combined with further opening up of
access to regulated professions.
Directors welcomed the improved resilience of the financial sector since the crisis, with the large
banks having buttressed their balance sheets, helping them cope with recent episodes of global
financial stress. However, they stressed that, as in other euro area economies, banks and insurers
need to further adjust their business models to an era of modest growth and low rates, while
continuing to adapt to the evolving regulatory framework. Directors also recommended adjusting
guaranteed interest rates under the regulated savings schemes to reflect market interest rate
conditions. They stressed the need for supervisors to remain vigilant regarding potential risks,
including search for yield behavior.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
France’s economy is recovering, but major efforts are still needed to foster job creation
and put public finances on a more sustainable footing. Clearly, policies have progressed
in recent years, notably through labor tax cuts and competition-enhancing structural
reforms. The El Khomri law is another necessary step toward a more dynamic labor
market. There are also ongoing efforts to contain government spending while easing the
tax burden.
However, the medium-term economic outlook remains subdued and subject to
significant risks, implying that unemployment and public debt will remain uncomfortably
high for some time to come. Important structural barriers to job creation remain, and
high government spending is still an obstacle to fiscal sustainability, with structural fiscal
adjustment projected to slow to zero. To bring about a faster and durable reduction in
unemployment and debt, staff recommends:
 Reversing the trend of rising public debt by limiting growth of government spending
to the rate of inflation, as targeted in the government’s Stability Program. This could
eventually make room for alleviating France’s heavy tax burden.
 Making spending more efficient at all levels of government to make fiscal
consolidation sustainable and consistent with growth and social objectives. This should
include efforts to streamline the civil service and extend means-testing of social benefits.
 Complementing recent labor market reforms by strengthening job search incentives
through the unemployment and welfare benefit systems, and by further efforts to adapt
education and training to the labor market.
 Easing regulations for start-ups and the self-employed, while further opening up
access to regulated professions to support a job-rich recovery.
 Ensuring that banks and insurers adapt their business models to a global
environment of low growth and interest rates, while monitoring emerging risks, to
ensure that the financial sector can provide adequate support to the real economy.

CONTEXT—RECOVERY AND REFORMS
France’s economy is recovering. But unemployment remains stubbornly high and public debt is still rising.
To address these challenges, the government has pushed forward an agenda of tax cuts, spending
restraint, and supply-side reforms against significant political resistance.
1.
Gradual reform progress against political resistance. Since 2013, the government has
advanced a number of supply-side reforms, including services liberalization and income, labor, and
corporate tax cuts (Box 1). The fiscal consolidation strategy switched from tax increases to spending
restraint. These reforms were implemented against significant political resistance and in the context of
rising anti-establishment sentiment as evidenced by the results of the December 2015 regional
elections. The El Khomri reform of the labor code, unveiled earlier this year, has faced even stronger
opposition, and the government relied on a constitutional procedure to move a modified version of the
law through the lower house of parliament, triggering a confidence vote. This was followed by unionled strikes and fuel blockades. The political climate and social dialogue appear increasingly tense as
France approaches the May 2017 Presidential elections.
2.
Recovery underway, but job creation still limited. France’s economy grew 1.3 percent
in 2015, the fastest pace in four years. While the strong first quarter this year partly reflected one-off
factors, growth appears to be solidifying and catching up with the euro area average. The recovery has
been driven primarily by private consumption, which picked up in early 2015 as households gained
purchasing power from falling energy prices and flat consumer price inflation against steady moderate
wage growth, while some benefited from mortgage refinancing at lower interest rates. Corporate
investment has also picked up alongside the cyclical
recovery, supported by improved profit margins, low

continued economic slack.
3.
Continued credit growth despite volatility. A bout of global financial volatility in the first
quarter hit French banks’ equity prices but CDS spreads remained far below 2011/12 peaks. The impact
on France’s banks was broadly similar to other euro area countries and stock prices have recovered
since then. Despite the volatility, bank credit growth has remained positive—at around 4 percent in
2015 for both households and companies, well above the euro area—and larger firms have significantly
stepped up bond market financing, supporting a pickup in investment by French companies both at
home and abroad. Access to credit does not appear to be a major hurdle for France’s SMEs.

Lower headline deficit, but slower structural adjustment and rising debt. After a pause
in 2014, the overall fiscal deficit fell by almost half a percentage point to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2015,
overperforming the authorities’ projections (3.8 percent of GDP). Consolidation was supported by
nominal containment measures, including the continued wage scale freeze and reduced central
transfers to local governments, which in turn sharply curtailed investment spending for the second
year in a row. However, policy measures explain less than a third of the improvement, with real
primary spending continuing to grow faster than GDP. The main drivers of consolidation were the
cyclical recovery and savings from lower interest rates, with the 10-year bond yield averaging
0.8 percent in 2015, supported by the ECB’s quantitative easing program. Public debt continued to
rise, reaching 96.1 percent of GDP at end-2015.
5.
Some progress on competitiveness and external imbalances. France’s share in world
export markets has declined substantially over the past decade, while resilient domestic demand has
sustained import growth throughout the crisis. The current account deficit narrowed to less than
¼ percent of GDP in 2015, partly on account of improved terms of trade. This was ½ to 2½ percent
of GDP lower than staff’s assessment of the cyclically-adjusted norm, with the real exchange rate
3 to 9 percent overvalued (Appendix IV). Competitiveness has been impaired by a prolonged period
during which real wage growth remained solid despite declining productivity growth, combined with
regulatory barriers and a high tax burden. A weaker euro and low oil prices, together with cuts in the
labor tax wedge, have helped strengthen the external position somewhat but some of the
underlying causes of the external imbalance remain, including elevated unit labor costs and a
sizeable fiscal deficit.

OUTLOOK—MODEST GROWTH WITH RISKS
A subdued medium-term outlook implies that unemployment and public debt will remain elevated for
some time to come. France remains exposed to global financial stress, a protracted period of low
growth in the euro area, and confidence losses from regional or domestic political developments.
6.
Solidifying recovery, with some uncertainty and downside risks. We project real GDP to
grow by 1.5 percent this year. The latest data point to continued strong consumer spending,
suggesting that consumer confidence continues to improve despite recent terrorist attacks and the
still poor labor market. There are also clear signs that investment is picking up and that the slump in
residential construction may be bottoming out. The slowdown in structural fiscal adjustment, while
problematic for fiscal sustainability (see below), removes another headwind to growth. Conversely,
net external demand remains weak, reflecting in part slow growth in trading partners, including in
the euro area. Among the areas of uncertainty are the potential effects of strikes and blockades, the
upcoming Presidential elections, and a number of regional risks (see below).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

7.
Inflation outlook still subdued. Despite higher energy prices, headline inflation is
projected to remain just marginally above zero in 2016, reflecting continued economic slack and flat
import prices. As the recovery firms up, wage growth accelerates, and energy prices rise, inflation is
expected to increase to around 1 percent in 2017, still well below the rate consistent with mediumterm inflation objectives for the euro area.

8.
Modest medium-term growth prospects. Over past decades, growth has been supported
by rising government spending, robust wage dynamics and productivity growth, and a steady
expansion of the labor force. But the crisis has taken a toll and past drivers of aggregate demand are
fading. Alongside a subdued euro area recovery, France’s growth trajectory has flattened, with the
level of output around 8 percent below the (hypothetical) pre-crisis trend line by 2021. Potential
output growth—projected to rise gradually from around 1 percent in 2015 to 1½ percent by 2021—
is held back by slowing productivity as in other advanced economies, but also by structural rigidities
as discussed in last year’s consultation. Apart from regulations in the services sector and the high tax
burden, a key obstacle to growth remains the labor market, where structural unemployment is
projected to remain high in the absence of

Risks. There are a number of important downside risks that could have significant adverse
effects on growth, financial stability, fiscal sustainability, and unemployment (see also the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA, Appendix II) and the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM, Appendix III)):

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE



Global financial stress and severe downturn. An investment demand shock in the euro area
caused by weaker confidence and financial stress, combined with a near-term global slowdown,
could reduce French output by 3 percent cumulatively in real terms relative to baseline, and raise
unemployment by about 1½ percentage points by 2021 (Appendix I). Global financial stress
would transmit to France’s real economy via export demand, confidence effects, and through the
impact on France’s banks, which (as some other euro area banks) remain exposed to such shocks
in part due to modest profitability, elevated leverage, and still above average reliance on
wholesale funding (see financial section below). Based on historical data and assuming no
changes in the business model, this could imply a substantial loss in profitability for the globally
systemic banks, according to staff’s analysis (see paragraph 26).



Protracted stagnation in the euro area. A prolonged demand shock from lower investment
intentions and higher risk premia—reflecting low growth expectations, financial fragmentation,
and balance sheet concerns—could push the euro area into a low growth, low inflation
equilibrium, reducing potential output while leaving the output gap open and further eroding
the profitability of the banks. In this scenario, real output in France could drop in cumulative
terms by 1¾ percent by 2021 relative to baseline, and unemployment could rise by over
½ percentage points. This could squeeze banks’ profitability and their ability to lend to the real
economy (see paragraph 26).



Confidence losses due to domestic or regional politics. Domestically, the possibility of an extended
period of strike actions, social unrest, or a strengthening of populist forces in the run up to the
2017 Presidential elections could hurt investor and consumer confidence, hinder fiscal and
structural reform efforts, and create a more euro-skeptical environment. At the regional level,
there are a number of risks that could contribute to the above downside scenarios. The British
referendum on EU membership could trigger financial volatility—France’s direct banking system
exposure to the UK is estimated at about 10 percent of GDP—and an extended period of
political uncertainty, possibly compounded by other regional challenges such as refugees,
Ukraine, Greece, and terrorism.

10.
Potential spillovers. The above risks can create outward spillovers. A protracted period of
economic stagnation or domestic political tensions in France could have an adverse effect on the
euro area, both directly on aggregate demand and indirectly via confidence effects. Failure to deliver
on fiscal consolidation and structural reform commitments could be seen as weakening the
credibility of EU economic governance. Given their size and interconnectedness, French banks could
create adverse effects if global financial stress forced them into further retrenchment from retail
operations abroad (e.g., Italy, emerging Europe), trade and project finance, and correspondent
banking activities (though de-risking is less relevant for global French banks than for some global
peers).

POLICIES—TACKLING UNEMPLOYMENT AND DEBT
Reforms have progressed in recent years but more efforts are needed to bring down debt and
unemployment. Limiting spending growth through efficiency reforms would help rebuild fiscal buffers
and eventually allow alleviating France’s high tax burden. Reforming unemployment insurance,
strengthening training, and supporting creation of new enterprises would help support job creation.
The health of the financial sector should be protected by adapting to a modest growth and low rate
environment.
11.
The government has made significant policy progress. In an environment with modest
medium-term growth prospects at home and in the euro area, France faces two central policy
challenges: (i) to support a more rapid creation of new private sector jobs and (ii) to ensure the
sustainability of public finances via more efficient government spending growth. The authorities have
made progress on both fronts in recent years, notably through the reduction in taxes under the Pacte
de Responsabilité et de Solidarité (PRS) and the Crédit d'Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l'Emploi (CICE)
and the competition-enhancing structural reforms under the Macron law. Building on earlier labor
market reforms, the El Khomri law currently in parliament, would be another step forward, increasing
the scope for company-level labor agreements and reducing judicial uncertainty around dismissals.
As for budget policies, there has been progress on efforts to contain spending growth at all levels of
government while easing taxes. These were necessary steps that, taken together, have created the
conditions for improved economic performance.
12.
Further efforts will be needed to secure a durable reduction in debt and
unemployment. First, despite the ongoing recovery, the public debt ratio is still rising and
approaching triple digits, while structural fiscal adjustment is slowing to around zero. To rebuild fiscal
buffers and place debt on a firm downward trajectory, it will be important to bring down the deficit
further, and to do this based on deep reforms that make government spending much more efficient
in order to safeguard important services and social protections, while eventually making room for
alleviating the high tax burden. Second, with unemployment entrenched at a high level, recent tax
cuts and labor reforms should be followed by other growth-friendly measures to improve the
functioning of the labor market, while supporting growth opportunities for start-ups and SMEs and
further deregulating regulated professions. Finally, it will be important to protect the health of the
financial sector in an environment of modest growth and low margins.

A. Fiscal Policy on Knife’s Edge
13.
Fiscal consolidation is slowing and debt keeps rising. Structural fiscal adjustment, as
measured by staff, fell from an annual average of 1 percent of GDP in 2011–13 to 0.3 percent in
2014–15, and is projected to be around zero in 2016−18. The slowdown reflects the effects of tax
cuts and failure to curb real spending growth, which has been at the heart of France’s fiscal
problems. The government’s consolidation strategy—relying heavily on broad-based nominal
spending containment—has not delivered the hoped-for fiscal savings in the context of low growth
and inflation.



In 2016, real structural primary spending will continue to increase by more than 1¼ percent,
partly reflecting inflation shortfalls, the recent decision to end the public sector wage-scale
freeze, and new spending pressures such as increased security needs in the wake of recent terror
attacks.



Despite very favorable financing conditions, France will just barely meet the EDP deficit target of
3 percent of GDP in 2017 without further efforts.



Structural adjustment over 2015–18 is projected to average 0.1 percent of GDP, well below the
EC’s recommendation. Without further efforts, France will not reach the structural balance
objective within the five-year projection horizon.



Debt is projected to peak at close to 98 percent of GDP in 2017, and decline only slowly
thereafter.

14.
Fiscal dynamics could easily derail. The fiscal strategy faces two major risks:
implementation shortfalls and growth shocks. The government has committed to a sharp reduction
in real spending growth over the medium term—this would require substantial additional policy
measures that are not yet fully specified. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to find offsets for new
spending needs. To illustrate the implementation risks: if real structural primary spending was to
continue growing at its current pace, the structural deficit would rise to 3.1 percent of GDP by 2021,
against a baseline projection of 1.2 percent of GDP. Even if the necessary measures are taken,
France’s Stability Program objectives could still be derailed by growth shocks. Staff has simulated
two such shocks—a protracted stagnation for the euro area and a severe global recession with
financial stress (see Appendix I). In both scenarios, staff would advocate letting automatic stabilizers
work, but this would also mean that the 2017 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) objective will be
missed, and that debt will climb to well above 100 percent of GDP (see Appendix II). Moreover, if the
scale of the shock is such that coordinated fiscal action is pursued within the euro area, France may
need to allow for additional loosening. While a coordinated response in such circumstances would
prevent a sharper deterioration in near-term growth and debt dynamics (depending on the size of
fiscal multipliers and intra euro area spillovers), it would further delay achieving the medium-term
structural objectives, and could raise debt levels over the longer term as the stimulus is eventually
withdrawn.

15.
It is thus important to use the current economic upturn for rebuilding fiscal buffers,
based on sustained efforts to slow spending growth. To anchor the needed fiscal consolidation,
general government spending growth should be limited to the rate of inflation—as is broadly
envisaged in the government’s latest Stability Program from 2017 onwards. This would imply an
annual structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP—a moderate effort by both international
and historical standards—striking a reasonable balance between anchoring fiscal sustainability and
limiting the impact on demand. It would help reach the medium-term target of structural balance in
four years. Despite the impact on aggregate demand, the proposed adjustment path would place
public debt on a firmer downward trajectory, and eventually make room for lowering France’s still
heavy tax burden.1 A set of near-term measures that limit the impact on growth by addressing
structural inefficiencies, duplication, and poorly targeted spending, in line with the broader agenda
of spending reforms (see below), could include: (i) slowing recruitment and limiting the wage drift;
(ii) further tightening budget constraints for local governments (e.g., tightening of the caps on local
Assuming a fiscal multiplier of 1, the headline deficit would fall to about ½ percent by 2021, with public spending
and debt respectively 1.2 and 1.8 percent of GDP below the baseline. The adjustment would reduce on average
growth by 0.3 percentage point per year through 2020, allowing for further tax reductions starting the same year,
partly offsetting the loss in growth in previous years. See the 2015 Article IV staff report for a fuller discussion on the
impact of spending containment on debt and fiscal adjustment.

taxes and borrowing); (iii) enhancing means testing of social benefits; (iv) further curtailing the
growth in health spending; and (v) saving any additional windfall from lower interest rates or excess
revenues.
16.
Deep reforms to enhance spending efficiency will be critical to ensure sustainability.
The recent experience highlights the limits of a spending containment approach to consolidation.
Efficiency-oriented reforms would help underpin the needed adjustment and fiscal sustainability
while limiting its impact on growth and protecting the French social model. Staff’s recently
published study shows that such reforms could yield significant savings (Box 2).2 In particular:


Streamlining the large civil service and limiting the wage drift at all levels of government would
help reduce the wage bill, which at 13 percent of GDP is appreciably above the levels in EU peer
countries.



Increasing the targeting of social spending, for instance by expanding means-testing (notably
for family and housing allowances), could yield significant savings without adversely affecting
social outcomes. For illustration, if the redistributive efficiency of social benefits was at the EU
average, France could achieve the same reduction in income inequality at a fiscal cost that is
lower by 3.5 percentage points of GDP.



While demographics and recent reforms make France’s pension liabilities more manageable
than in some other EU countries, there is still room to further increase the effective retirement
age and rationalize special regimes.3



Slowing the growth in the cost of public health care, which already amounts to 8 percent of
GDP, could be helped by further enhancing use of generic medicines, rationalizing hospital
services and costs, and strengthening cost effectiveness evaluations.

17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities underscored their commitment to a fiscal consolidation
strategy that is fully based on expenditure efforts. They agreed that general government spending
should be kept broadly flat in real terms, as the 2016 Stability Program stipulates for 2017–19. They
acknowledged that structural fiscal adjustment is slowing, although less so than measured by staff, and
that real spending is continuing to increase, while noting that the spending ratio partly reflects tax
credits. They saw the slowdown in adjustment as necessary to preserve the economic recovery and
noted that the public ratio would soon start declining. They agreed that strong spending control and
additional measures will be required in 2017, but expressed confidence that the headline deficit would
Jean-Jacques Hallaert and Maximilien Queyranne (2016) “From containment to rationalization: Increasing public
expenditure efficiency,” IMF Working Paper 16/7. The results of this study were presented at a workshop organized
by the Treasury in November 2015 and, during the mission, at a seminar organized by the Audit Court.
2

According to the EC’s 2015 Ageing Report, the cost of public age-related spending will remain broadly at its current
level until 2025, before declining by 2.8 percentage points of GDP by 2060, partly reflecting demographics and
successive pension reforms. By comparison, public age-related spending cost is projected to decline by
0.2 percentage points on average in the EU by 2060, by 1.9 percentage points in Italy, and increase by 2.7 percentage
points in Germany and 0.7 percentage point in the United Kingdom. The 2015 reform of supplementary pensions will
further reduce incentives for early retirement, generating savings of 0.2−0.3 percent of GDP by 2060.

come in below 3 percent of GDP. They appreciated staff’s recently published study on expenditure
efficiency in France, and reiterated their objective to gradually reduce France’s spending and tax ratios.
To achieve this, they stressed that the approach of keeping tight budget constraints on all levels of
government should help encourage spending units to seek efficiency gains. They also saw value in
continuing the targeted annual spending reviews in selected areas initiated in 2015. Regarding euro
area fiscal governance, they indicated support for simplifying the rules to increase their transparency
and predictability.

B. Tackling Structural Unemployment

economic challenge. Unemployment appears less responsive to the business cycle, see Selected

19.
The poor labor market performance reflects deep-rooted structural rigidities, not just
a weak recovery. Several factors seem to have made France’s labor market less adaptable to an
evolving global economy—centralized labor agreements for over 700 branches; long and uncertain
judicial procedures around dismissals; relatively easy access to unemployment and welfare benefits;
a relatively high minimum wage; and a sizeable labor tax wedge. Moreover, real wages and unit
labor costs have grown steadily since 2000, including during the crisis years, contributing to a labor
cost competitiveness gap. Together with barriers to private sector growth, this has made it difficult
for job creation to match the dynamically growing labor force. The adverse effects cut across the
population but are particularly pronounced for the young, the low-skilled, and immigrants.

20.
Reducing unemployment has been the authorities’ long-standing goal—and important
steps have been taken in recent years. The labor tax wedge has been reduced significantly for low
wage earners through the PRS and CICE, helping reduce unit labor costs The Rebsamen law has
streamlined regulations for social dialogue in small and mid-sized companies and strengthened
activity incentive schemes for lower wage earners. The Macron law has taken a step toward
reforming the labor arbitration system (prud’hommes). 4 A new hiring subsidy for lower wage earners
in small firms and a new training program for the unemployed were introduced earlier this year.
Building on these reforms as well as the earlier labor law in 2013, the El Khomri law would increase
the scope for company-level labor agreements and further reduce judicial uncertainty around
dismissals—these measures should encourage more hiring on open-ended contracts and improve
labor market dynamics as the recovery gathers pace.
21.
Important barriers to job creation remain, however (see SIP Chapter I, B). Certain aspects
of the unemployment and welfare benefits systems may contribute to inactivity traps, with relatively
easy qualification for benefits and weak job search incentives.5 Moreover, the education and training
system has not kept up with a changing labor market, creating an increasing mismatch between the
existing skills of the jobless and those sought by employers. Bringing down the high level of
structural unemployment and raising the stagnant employment rate will be critical both for growth
and social objectives. With a view to supporting a job-rich recovery, staff recommends a set of
specific reforms that should raise France’s medium-term employment and growth potential while
improving opportunities for vulnerable groups without creating a drag on short-term demand:


Reforming unemployment insurance rules to strengthen work incentives, including by
(i) lengthening the minimum contribution period to qualify for unemployment insurance from
the current four months; (ii) unifying the maximum unemployment benefit period to two years;
(iii) changing the formula for calculating unemployment benefits to balance the treatment of
part-time work and alternating short-term work contracts; and (iv) introducing “degressivity” of
unemployment benefits.



Enhancing job search support for unemployment and welfare benefit recipients, while tightening
rules for accepting suitable job offers and strengthening enforcement of rules.



Changing the minimum wage formula to limit indexation to inflation while unemployment is
high.

The OECD estimated the combined impact of labor and other tax cuts and structural reforms under the Macron law
would raise real GDP growth by 0.3 percent per year through 2020.
4

A person becomes eligible for benefits after working for just 4 months, and reaches eligibility for the maximum of
24 months of benefits after working for 2 years (with a the maximum is 36 months for persons over 50). While on
benefits, the unemployed can reject the first “suitable” job offer, and can reject any offer with a wage of less than 85–
100 percent of the previous wage. The French system also features Europe’s highest cap for benefits, at about €7,000
per month. Moreover, an analysis by the Conseil d’Analyse Economique (September 2015) shows that there is an
increasing number of workers who alternate between ultra-short term contracts and short-term unemployment
within a month, receiving a total income close to the full monthly wage based on the current unemployment benefit
formula. Job search requirements are often weakly enforced, including for welfare recipients.
5

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE



Further improving education and professional training to better match the skills of the young
and unemployed to the needs of the labor market.

22.
Product market reforms remain an important complement to fostering job creation and
growth. The Macron law has liberalized legal professions and intercity bus transport, and opened the
way for extending retail trade opening hours, while the Rebsamen law increased certain employee
thresholds including for mandatory social dialogue, lifting the administrative burden on SMEs.
Building on these reforms, there is still ample scope to boost potential growth and job creation, both
in the short and medium term, by reducing red tape and enhancing competition:


Easing regulations for start-ups and the self-employed, enhancing data transparency, and
streamlining qualification requirements for regulated professions, as envisaged in the “Sapin II”
law on economic transparency.



Reducing barriers to competition for regulated professions other than in the legal area, and
further liberalizing retail trade (including by reviewing zoning restrictions).



Enhancing the efficiency of the “Business Simplification” process aimed at cutting red tape, with
additional monitoring from a new unit in the Ministry of Economy.

23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed that a large share of unemployment is
structural. They stressed their strong commitment to combat unemployment, noting that the El Khomri
law builds on a series of reforms and fiscal measures that were all aimed at improving the functioning
of the labor market. The law would be the first step in redrafting the labor code in order to increase the
scope for collective bargaining. It would reduce the fragmentation of the labor market by enhancing
incentives for hiring on open-ended contracts. It would also give more flexibility to firms while
providing security to workers. They agreed that in order to bring down unemployment decisively,
continued efforts are needed to strengthen education and professional training (such as through the
recent presidential initiative to create a new training program for the unemployed), reform the
unemployment insurance system, and further encourage the creation of new enterprises, growth, and
development (as is the intent of the Sapin II law on economic transparency).

benefited from continued access to mortgage
credit at low interest rates. Historically, financial conditions have impacted the economy mainly
through private investment and exports, while private consumption appeared less affected—in
contrast to the UK and the US (see SIP Chapter II, A). The lower impact on consumption may reflect
smaller wealth effects because of lower direct holdings of stocks or corporate debt securities by
households, and relatively small reliance on consumer credit to finance consumption. Moreover,
given the prevalence of fixed-rate mortgages, homeowners are cushioned from adverse financial
shocks, while being able to benefit from lower rates through refinancing. Saving accounts are
typically renumerated at rates which are regulated and insulated from financial stress, while life
insurance saving instruments are tax advantaged and often guarantee investors’ capital.
25.
France’s big banks have buttressed their balance sheets since the global financial crisis,
which has helped them cope with recent bouts of financial volatility. The four global
systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have strengthened their capital and liquidity buffers in line
with tighter European regulations and global standards.6 France’s global banks have also reduced
their leverage and their reliance on wholesale funding since the crisis. However, several banks are
still more leveraged, with continued low risk weights, and still have a higher share of wholesale
funding, than most G-SIBs.7 Moreover, profitability remains fragile, as for other euro area banks.
Staff’s analysis of how recent periods of financial volatility affect the group of thirty G-SIBs suggests
that wholesale funding, leverage, and profitability have been associated with greater equity price
responses to shocks, although this was not observed for all French banks (see SIP Chapter II, B).

They have raised capital adequacy to the fully loaded Basel III ratio, and adapted to new regulations on liquidity and
funding by holding higher shares of public sector assets and reducing their exposure to foreign banks. Total
exposure to emerging markets has increased recently, but remains moderate at 8 percent of total foreign claims.

U.S. dollar money market funding, which was a vulnerability in 2011 when funding dried up, was $160 billion in

Fed.

The main challenge is for banks and insurers to operate in an era of modest growth
and very low interest rates. While accommodative euro area monetary policy has lowered funding
costs and supported the recovery and thereby bank lending, it has also further flattened the yield
curve. The resulting pressure on margins, together with continued regulatory uncertainty, tends to
constrain profitability of French and other euro area financial companies—likely contributing to the
low price-to-book ratios. France’s G-SIBs are vulnerable to a protracted period of low growth and
low interest rates, because of (i) fee and commission income, as share of total assets, below non-EU
peers (though temporarily boosted by mortgage refinancing in 2015), (ii) regulated savings rates
above market rates, and (iii) a high share of fixed rate mortgages that have been refinanced at very
low rates, which could become a profit challenge when policy rates and funding costs rise again.8
Against this background, banks are further diversifying into asset management, private banking, and
insurance. Banks may eventually be tempted to loosen lending standards or engage in more risky
activities involving complex products, which could worsen portfolio quality.9 Staff’s empirical analysis
shows that low inflation and growth in France have in the past been associated with smaller spreads,
slower credit growth, and deteriorating credit quality. Moreover, for the group of thirty G-SIBs,
staff’s panel data regression analysis points to a significant association between growth, inflation,
and bank profitability. Under staff’s illustrative downside scenarios (Appendix I), this empirical
relationship would suggest that the profitability of France’s G-SIBs would decline appreciably
assuming no change in their business models, although the initial degree of diversification and asset
quality could be important mitigating factors that would limit the impact (see right chart below, and
further details in SIP Chapter II, C). This would have adverse effects on bank’s capital accumulation
and lending to the real economy.

Life insurance companies are also vulnerable to a low interest rate environment, but to a lesser degree than in other
European countries, as returns are adjusted on a yearly basis and only the principal is guaranteed.
8

At around 4 percent, non-performing loans (NPLs) are low by European standards, but are higher than for most GSIBs, partly due to exposures in the Italian subsidiaries.

The financial sector will need to continue adapting to this environment, while
supervisors should remain vigilant with respect to potential emerging risks. Protracted low
growth and interest rates will likely require continued cost cutting, including through branch
closures (SIP, Chapter II, D). It may also motivate further deleveraging and possibly sector
consolidation within the euro area, although lingering regulatory uncertainty appears to dampen
incentives for any larger strategic acquisitions. At the same time, supervisors should remain vigilant
with respect to risks related to search for yield. In addition, the macroprudential authority should
further study the reasons for the significant increase in corporate debt since the crisis, reaching
about 125 percent of GDP in gross terms, though much lower when intra-group debt is
consolidated, while carefully monitoring commercial real estate prices in certain locations.10
Continuing the efforts to complete the Banking Union, including through the European Deposit
Insurance Scheme proposal (EDIS), together with steps to enhance bank data transparency, will help
reduce systemic risks in the euro area. Finally, regulated savings rates in France should continue to
be adapted to reflect market interest rate conditions.
28.
An additional ongoing challenge for the financial sector is to continue adapting to the
evolving regulatory framework. New global requirements such as Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
(TLAC) will require further improvements in the capitalization of France’s G-SIBs. The French
authorities have proposed legislation to introduce a new class of senior debt, subordinated to
existing senior debt, which will improve the clarity of bank resolution in France and fulfill TLAC
requirements, and to add a cap on European Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible
Liabilities (MREL) requirements. There is also a range of other regulatory initiatives that could imply
additional capital needs or other adjustments, such as revisions to the treatment of risk-weighted
assets and the banks’ use of internal models, and standards on market risk, operational risk, interest
rate risk, sovereign debt holdings, and the net stable funding ratio and leverage ratio still to be
finalized at the EU and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) levels. After Bank Recovery
and Resolution Directive (BRRD) passage in August 2015, interim resolution plans for the four G-SIBs
are under preparation.

House prices have stabilized since the crisis, and household debt remains manageable at 85 percent of gross
disposable income and 55 percent of GDP, similar to the euro area average. However, commercial real estate appears
to have become potentially overvalued in greater Paris, as indicated in recent publications by the macroprudential
authority.

Authorities’ views. The authorities were confident that France’s banks are well placed to cope
with renewed global financial stress. They did not see leverage or wholesale funding as significant
sources of vulnerability, noting that leverage is comparable to some other euro area banks, that asset
quality is better and the cost of risk lower than for many euro area peers. Moreover, reliance on
wholesale funding has declined substantially since the crisis, and U.S. dollar market funding is matched
by deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. They agreed that profitability remains fragile, and that a
protracted period of low rates would over time create challenges, as for other banks and insurers in
Europe. They saw regulatory uncertainty as a significant challenge, with several European and global
regulations still being specified. The combination of low margins and regulatory uncertainty was seen
by many as the main reason for low price to book ratios. They agreed on the need to keep regulated
savings rates broadly in line with market conditions, while also pointing to the social role of these
savings instruments. On macroprudential surveillance, they did not see major risks in the residential
real estate market, and noted that they continue to monitor developments in the commercial real
estate market and are analyzing the reasons for the increase in corporate debt since the crisis. The
authorities stressed their strong commitment to completing the Banking Union, including the EDIS.
They proposed to carefully calibrate the MREL at the EU level to ensure the resolvability of all failing or
likely-to-fail banks that would apply a bail-in strategy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The economy continues to improve, but the medium-term outlook is subdued, with
several downside risks. The recovery is driven by domestic demand, reflecting purchasing power
gains from low import prices, favorable financial conditions, and improved profit margins, including
from recent fiscal measures. The external position has improved, but remains moderately weaker
than that implied by fundamentals. Medium-term growth prospects are modest and France remains
exposed to global financial stress, a protracted period of low growth in the euro area, and
confidence losses from regional or domestic political developments.
31.
Policies have clearly progressed in recent years, but more is needed to secure a
durable reduction in unemployment and public debt. In an environment with modest growth,
the two central policy challenges are to support the creation of new private sector jobs and to
ensure the sustainability of public finances. The authorities have made progress on both fronts in
recent years, notably through labor tax cuts and competition-enhancing structural reforms. There
are also ongoing efforts to contain government spending while easing the tax burden. However,
unemployment has remained stubbornly high, with structural bottlenecks continuing to hinder
private sector growth and job creation. Moreover, the public debt ratio is still rising and
approaching the triple digits, while structural fiscal adjustment is slowing to near zero. This makes
France vulnerable to shocks.
32.
Fiscal consolidation is slowing and could easily derail. High and rising government
spending has been at the heart of France’s fiscal challenges—a decisive break is needed to reverse
the growth of public debt and make room for eventually alleviating the heavy tax burden on the
economy. The government’s expenditure-based adjustment strategy is thus appropriate. However,

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

while the headline deficit is coming down, the structural fiscal effort is slowing to around zero, and
real spending is continuing to increase. Without further efforts, France will just barely meet the
3 percent of GDP deficit target in 2017 and not reach the structural balance objective within the next
five years. Fiscal risks are high—implementation shortfalls or external shocks could easily throw the
fiscal strategy off course, and push public debt to over 100 percent of GDP.
33.
Fiscal adjustment should be underpinned by efficiency-enhancing reforms to keep real
spending flat. A fiscal anchor of zero real primary spending growth would deliver structural
adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP per year, a moderate effort by international and historical
standards. While not detracting unduly from demand, this would ensure that medium-term fiscal
targets are safely met and debt is placed on a firm downward trajectory by 2017. In addition,
consolidation should shift from broad nominal containment to deeper reforms to make spending
more efficient at all levels of government, limiting the impact on demand and protecting the French
social model. Key reforms include streamlining the large civil service, increasing the targeting of
social spending, further increasing the effective retirement age, and continuing to slow the rise in
public health care costs.
34.
Combating unemployment is rightly at the top of the policy agenda. Much of France’s
high unemployment is structural and long-term unemployment is rising, creating major social and
economic challenges. The government has advanced a series of helpful reforms to boost job
creation, notably by reducing the labor tax wedge, streamlining regulations for small and mid-sized
companies, and creating a new training program for the unemployed. The El Khomri law would be
another important and necessary step forward—it should encourage more hiring on open-ended
contracts and improve labor market dynamics as the recovery gathers pace.
35.
Additional structural reforms are needed to boost private sector job creation. To
improve the functioning of the labor market, it will be important to reform the unemployment and
welfare benefit systems to strengthen work incentives and job search while continuing efforts to
target education and professional training to the evolving needs of the young and the unemployed.
The minimum wage formula should be reformed. However, to ensure that job creation keeps up
with France’s dynamic demographics, it will be critical to continue efforts to raise potential growth
through product market reforms, including by supporting self-employment and the creation of new
enterprises and further liberalizing regulated professions.
36.
The financial sector has become more resilient since the crisis, but needs to further
adapt to an era of modest growth and low rates. France’s big banks have buttressed their
balance sheets since the global financial crisis, which has helped them cope with recent bouts of
financial volatility. They have reduced leverage and reliance on wholesale funding, although for
several it remains above most other G-SIBs, and profitability is still fragile. A key challenge for both
banks and insurers is to ensure profitability in prolonged period of modest growth and low rates,
especially in the context of continued regulatory uncertainty. This will necessitate further cost
cutting, diversification, and possibly consolidation within the euro area. Supervisors will need to
remain vigilant of risks created by search for yield. Regulated savings rates in France should
continue to be adapted to reflect market interest rate conditions. While private sector balance
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

sheets remain generally solid, it will be important to monitor developments in the commercial real
estate market and analyze the recent increase in corporate debt levels.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 2. How to Increase Public Expenditure Efficiency
The fiscal consolidation that started in 2011 was initially supported by revenue-raising measures but is now
intended to be fully expenditure-based. However, identifying areas for savings has proved difficult, and there
is no clearly articulated consensus on the areas where spending is too high or inefficient. This is in part
because of concerns about the social and economic impact of specific spending cuts, in particular the
impact on inequality. Spending measures have thus mainly relied on across-the-board savings to limit
nominal spending growth. These cuts have focused on central government spending and the health sector,
while local governments and social security funds spending have continued to grow faster than GDP.
A shift from a policy of containment to broader and deeper efficiency-oriented reforms would increase the
chance of success and the sustainability of the ongoing fiscal consolidation, while protecting the French
“social model”. The government has recently initiated some steps for structural savings e.g., family
allowances, health, and pensions.
In a recent IMF working paper “From containment to rationalization: Increasing public expenditure
efficiency”, Hallaert and Queyranne undertake a three-step benchmarking to identify areas where there is
scope for greater expenditure efficiency in France, while maintaining or even improving social and economic
outcomes consistent with social preferences. First, the level of public expenditure is compared to other
European countries with a focus on Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. These are large economies with
comparable income levels per capita with France. Second, social and economic outcomes in each spending
area are assessed against the performance in European peers. Third, the input mix is analyzed to understand
what components are responsible for the level of spending and for the quality of outcomes.
This exercise shows that shifting from containment to deeper efficiency-oriented reforms could yield
significant fiscal savings. Most could be achieved by rationalizing social benefits and the wage bill, which
explain about 90 percent of the difference in the expenditure ratio between France and the EU average as
well as the average for Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. More specifically:

The wage bill accounts for 13 percent of GDP and almost one quarter of public spending. Recent
efforts have focused on a wage-scale freeze, but low inflation has limited the effectiveness of this approach.
Employment reduction (notably at the local level) and limiting the wage drift would promise greater scope
for efficiency gains.

There is significant scope to improve the impact of fiscal redistribution on inequalities and poverty
through reforms of the welfare and pension systems. France has the largest social spending in Europe and
the second highest tax-to-GDP ratio, but the reduction in inequality due to transfers is only slightly above
the EU average. If the redistributive power of social benefits was at EU average, France could achieve the
same reduction in income inequality at a fiscal cost lower by 3.5 percentage points of GDP.

Moreover, the social outcomes and
poverty impact are uneven. Social protection
benefits mostly the elderly due to a generous
pension regime. While long-term demographic
trends are more favorable than in many
European countries, additional pension reforms
would support consolidation and, together with
a further increase in means-testing of familyrelated spending, make room for more resources
to address child and youth poverty.


Spending on housing is higher in
France than in other European countries but
outcomes do not appear much better than in
other EU countries. This suggests potential for
higher means-testing and lower institutional fragmentation and duplication.


At over 8 percent of GDP, health spending is high by EU standards. While health outcomes are
good, they are similar to comparator countries whose health spending is lower. Building on the National
Health Strategy of 2014, France could consider reforms implemented in other countries such as further
improving generics market penetration, rationalizing hospital services and streamlining costs, and
strengthening cost-effectiveness evaluations to decide which services should be covered by public
insurance.

The unemployment benefits system, which accounts for about two-third of labor market policy
spending, is comparatively generous. The reform of the unemployment benefit under negotiations is
expected to lead to fiscal saving and reinforce work incentive (see section on unemployment for specific
advice)

The allocation of resources in education is less efficient than in many European countries,
particularly at the secondary level, and has failed to address deteriorating test scores and rising educational
inequalities. Organizational reforms could help improve both education quality and social outcomes, for
instance by better allocating teaching resources to the neediest, rationalizing inefficient spending (especially
in secondary education), and improving the targeting of vocational education and training for those who
have difficulties getting a job.

Public investment spending, which is at the European average, should focus more on maintenance
rather than expansion given France’s high quality and quantity of infrastructure. Rationalizing local and
state-owned enterprises investment would avoid duplication.

Appendix I. Growth Shock Scenarios1

downturn” scenarios in the fiscal policy section. The shocks are in line with those contemplated in the
Selected Issues Paper for the 2016 Euro Area Article IV.

corporate interest rate by about 0.5 percent,
cumulatively, by 2021. This, in turn, reduces real investment by around 2.3 percent on average,
annually, during 2017–21. As a result, the output gap persists over the medium term, reflecting an
assumed decline in the annual growth rate of total factor productivity by 0.1 percentage point each
year in 2017–21. This reduces real GDP in cumulative terms by 1.7 percent by 2021 relative to the
baseline as, alongside slower capital accumulation, consumption grows significantly less rapidly in
cumulative terms than in the baseline scenario (-1.8 percent). Unemployment is 0.6 percentage points
higher and employment 0.6 percent lower than in the baseline by 2021. Alongside, inflation remains
slightly positive but well below a rate consistent with the ECB’s objective, increasing only very slowly
to 1 percent by the end of the forecast horizon. The external environment outside the euro area is
unchanged from the April 2016 WEO baseline of an uneven, fragile global recovery. The euro area
environment, excluding France suffers similar stagnation as in France (with euro area GDP growth
assumed to fall to an average of 1.1 percent over 2017–21) and is described in detail in the
forthcoming Selected Issues Paper for the 2016 Euro Area Article IV.



Severe economic downturn in the short term followed by stagnation. In a severe economic
downturn, France’s growth would fall slightly below one percent in the near term before recovering
over the medium term. The scenario combines a near-term global slowdown with an investment
demand shock in France, and in the euro area more generally, due to weaker confidence and financial
stress. On the supply side, potential growth declines slightly as a result of lower investment and some
financial disintermediation. Outside the euro area, real growth is lower by ½ percentage point each
year in 2017, relative to the April 2016 WEO. The global slowdown and heightened risk aversion lead
to a sharp drop in investor confidence in France and the euro area, reducing real investment in France
by 2.2 percent on average, annually, during 2017–18 and by 6½ percent on average, annually,
thereafter, also due to an increase in the real cost of capital. Inflation expectations and TFP are

assumed to behave as in the stagnation scenario. By the end of the forecast period, real GDP is
3 percent lower in cumulative terms relative to baseline, and consumption and employment 2.9 and
7½ percent lower, and unemployment 1½ percentage points higher. Under this scenario, inflation
falls to zero.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 97.9 percent in 2017 and to
decline to 94 percent by 2021 as economic recovery gains traction and the primary balance shifts to a
surplus starting in 2020. Due to the maturity structure of the French debt, gross financing needs
increase to about 9 percent of GDP in 2015–17 but would decline thereafter. The debt-to-GDP ratio in
2015 is expected to be better than forecast previously mainly due to the base effect of the revision of
the 2014 debt ratio, high emission premium, a smaller primary deficit, and lower real interest rates.
However, by the end of the projection period, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be higher than was
forecast previously due to weaker nominal GDP growth and slower pace of adjustment. Accordingly,
public debt is expected to be at or above 94 percent of GDP throughout the projection period and
presents vulnerabilities as illustrated by the stress scenarios. The debt ratio would be bumped up
significantly in the event of a growth shock. The impact of lower fiscal consolidation and higher
interest rate remains comparatively more limited.
Background. The combined effect of low growth over
several years and the persistence of high fiscal deficits,
augmented by the fiscal stimulus of 2009, have increased
the debt-to-GDP ratio by 31.3 percentage points in eight
years, to 96.1 percent in 2015. Despite ongoing fiscal
consolidation, the debt ratio is projected to continue to
increase in the short term, peaking at 97.9 percent of GDP
in 2017, and decline thereafter.

Yields on French debt are at close to their historical low.
The flattening of the yield curve that occurred in 2014 has
been supported by QE. The benchmark yield (10 years) has
declined from 4.7 percent in June 2008 to 0.5 percent endMay 2016. The spreads over German Bunds, which had
increased to almost 190 basis points in November 2011,
were at about 35 basis points end-May 2016.

Owing to the sharp decline in interest rates and

Baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 97.9 percent in 2017 and then
decline to 94 percent in 2021. Interest rates are projected to decline in 2016 before steadily
increasing. As a result, interest payments would remain at a historically low level but are projected to
decline to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018 before increasing to 2 percent of GDP in 2021.


Macroeconomic assumptions. Recent growth performance has been affected by the weak
external environment and the drag caused by large structural fiscal adjustment in 2011–13. After
several years of near-stagnation, the economy grew by 1.3 percent in 2015, and growth is
expected to rise steadily to 1.8 percent by the end of the projection period, with the output gap
closed in 2021.



Fiscal outlook. The pace of structural adjustment has slowed. Reaching 1 percentage point per
year in 2011–13, it has slowed to 0.3 percentage point per year in 2014–15, and is projected, in
the baseline, to average 0.1 percent during 2016–21. Primary balance would be above its debt
stabilizing level starting in 2018 and shift to a surplus in 2020.



Debt levels and gross financing needs. The gross financing needs remain below the
20 percent threshold even under the stress tests. Part of the increase in the debt ratio reflects
financial support to other Euro area countries which grew from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to
3.2 percent of GDP in 2014.4 This support started to decline in 2015 (3.0 percent of GDP).

Realism of Projections. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2007–15 is
-1.22 percent suggesting there is an upward bias in the staff projections. The median forecast bias
for inflation stands at 0.18 percent suggesting again a slight downward bias in the staff projections.
At -0.56 percent, the median forecast error for primary balance suggests that staff projections have
proved slightly optimistic.
The debt-to-GDP ratio in 2015 is lower by 1.2 percentage point than forecast in the Staff report for
the 2015 Article IV Consultation. Most of the impact is explained by high emission premium,5 but
also by the base effect of a downward revision of the debt ratio in 2014, lower primary deficit, and
to a smaller extent by lower interest rates. However, at the end of the projection period, the debtto-GDP ratio is projected to be higher than was forecast due to weaker nominal GDP growth and
slower pace of fiscal adjustment.
The projected fiscal adjustment appears feasible. Cross-country experience also suggests that
fiscal adjustment projections are realistic. The projected adjustment and level of the CAPB are below
the thresholds that would cast doubt on the feasibility of the adjustment, based on high debt

Bilateral loans (direct and through the EFSF to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) and contributions to the ESM.

The interest rates on state auctioned debt were higher than the market rates. As a result, the debt was purchased at
a higher value than its reimbursement value, which is used to calculate the debt under the Maastricht rules. The
increase in debt was 1 percent of GDP lower than the state fiscal deficit. In contrast, in 2014, the increase in the state
debt was broadly similar to the fiscal deficit.

country experience. More specifically, at 1.2 percent of GDP, the largest projected adjustment over
any three years during the projection is below the threshold of 3 percent of GDP. In addition, the
maximum average level of the cyclically-adjusted primary deficit for any consecutive 3-year period
during the projection horizon reaches is 0.3 percent of GDP, well below than the threshold of
3.5 percent of GDP.
Heat map. Risks levels from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to
which France’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under baseline and
all stress test scenarios. In contrast, France’s gross financing needs remain below the benchmark of
20 percent of GDP in the baseline and all stress test scenarios. The debt profile remains below
relevant thresholds except for the share of public debt held by foreigners. As of endDecember 2015, foreigners held 61.9 percent of French debt, a level substantially lower than the
peak of 70.6 percent reached in mid-2010.
Shocks and Stress Tests. The DSA framework suggests that France’s government debt-to-GDP ratio
would not exceed 106 percent and its gross financing needs would not exceed 12 percent of GDP
under different standard macroeconomic and fiscal shocks.


Growth shocks. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation over 2017–18, i.e. 1.6 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The assumed
decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point
decrease in GDP growth) and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points for every
1 percent of GDP worsening of primary balance. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio
would increases to 105.6 percent of GDP in 2018 and declines thereafter.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a dual shock of lower
revenues and rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 1.1 percent deterioration in the
primary balance over 2017–21. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to
100.1 percent of GDP in 2018 and declines thereafter.



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes an increase of 246 basis points increase in the cost

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

of debt throughout the projection period. The deterioration of public debt and gross financing
needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually matures6 and new higher interest rate debt is
contracted. In 2021, the impact on the gross financing needs is less than 1 percent of GDP and
less than 2¼ percentage points for the debt-to-GDP ratio.


Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 13 percent devaluation of the real exchange
rate in 2017 and examines the impact on debt through the inflation channel. Under this
scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be marginally larger (0.2 percentage point at most) than
in the baseline.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest rate,
the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to double-count the effects of
individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach 105.8 percent of GDP in 2018 and
decline to 103.6 percent of GDP in 2021. The gross financing needs would peak at 11.7 percent
of GDP in 2018, which remains below the 20 percent benchmark considered by the heat map.

Authorities’ views. The authorities project a debt profile similar to staff’s with the debt ratio also
starting to decline in 2018. However, they expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to be slightly lower and to
decline faster than staff on account of faster nominal growth and fiscal consolidation in the second
half of the projection period. They do not consider that relatively large share of public debt held by
non-resident to be a vulnerability as investors in French debt are both institutionally and
geographically diversified. The authorities noted that France benefits from a structural demand from
central banks, which are net, stable, and recurrent purchasers with limited sensitivity to changes in
interest rates.

As of end April 2016, the average maturity of debt is 7 years and 108 days.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level
of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Current
account

Background. The current account has deteriorated from a surplus of almost 4 percent of GDP in the late 1990s to an estimated deficit of
0.2 percent in 2015, mostly due to structural factors (the cyclically-adjusted deficit is estimated at -0.8 percent of GDP). The deterioration
originates from a worsening net saving position of the private sector and higher government deficits in equal proportions, but it has
attenuated between 2014 and 2015 by virtue of positive shocks to the terms of trade (notably oil) and because of a weakening of the euro
in real effective terms. The current account is projected to deteriorate marginally in 2016 to 0.5 percent of GDP, reflecting in part higher
projected oil prices.
Assessment. The staff assesses the 2015 cyclically-adjusted current account to be ½ to 2½ percent of GDP below its norm. This is
consistent with the EBA model estimate that the cyclically-adjusted current account is about 1¾ percent of GDP weaker than the value
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Recent developments, including the depreciation of the euro and
lower oil prices, suggest some strengthening of the external position in 2016. Over the medium term, the current account deficit is
projected to remain closely around balance, as imports pick up in line with domestic demand. The gradual elimination of the fiscal deficit
will help narrow the EBA-estimated gap.

Real exchange Background. The trend deterioration in unit labor costs (9.3 percent cumulative appreciation of the ULC-based real effective exchange over
rate
the last 10 years) points to a loss of competitiveness consistent with the assessment of an imbalance in the current account. However, such
loss of competitiveness is less evident based on relative price indicators, such as CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER), as firms
appear to have squeezed profit margins to retain price competitiveness. Compared to its average level in 2015, the ULC-based REER has
appreciated by close to 2 percent as of June 2016. The CPI-based REER depreciated 4 percent in 2015 relative to its 2014 average level, but
as of April 2016 had appreciated 1 percent relative to its 2015 average.
Assessment. The EBA Level REER regression model estimates a 4.6 percent overvaluation, while the overvaluation suggested by the staff’s
assessment of the CA gap is a range of about 3 to 9 percent using standard trade elasticities. The EBA Index REER model on the other hand
estimates an undervaluation of -5.4 percent. Taking into account the superior fit of the CA model for France, as well as the evidence from
ULC and the Level regression model, the staff assessment is that the REER is 3–9 percent overvalued. 1/
Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. The current account deficit has been financed mostly by debt inflows (portfolio and other investment), while outward direct
investment was generally higher than inward investment. Flows in financial derivatives have grown sizably on both the asset and liability
side since 2008. The capital account is open.
Assessment. France remains exposed to financial market risks but the structure of financial flows does not point to specific vulnerabilities.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ The ULC-based REER recent modest appreciation adds marginally to past competitive losses. Taking all these inputs into account, staff
assesses the 2015 REER to be 3–9 percent overvalued.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015
was moderately weaker than
the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.
Recent developments,
including the depreciation of
the euro and lower oil prices,
have helped strengthen the
external position. However, it
is still moderately weaker than
implied by fundamentals,
given high unit labor costs and
fiscal deficits.
The labor tax wedge cuts
undertaken since 2013
(equivalent to 3 percent of
total labor costs, spanning
2014–17) have contributed
somewhat to improve cost
competitiveness. Efforts to
improve non-cost
competitiveness were
reinforced by further labor and
product market reforms
(Macron and Rebsamen Law)
in 2015.
Potential policy responses:
Continued wage moderation
(especially of the minimum
wage), continued reform of the
labor market, and productivityenhancing reforms (increasing
competition in product
markets and further regulatory
simplification) would help
restore competitiveness. Along
with the planned gradual
elimination of the fiscal deficit
over the medium term, these
measures should help correct
the external imbalance (as well
as promote growth).

Appendix IV. External Sector Report

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. After averaging near balance in the four years before the global crisis, the net international investment position (NIIP)
deteriorated to around 17 percent of GDP in 2015Q3, reflecting current account deficits and valuation losses (the latter accounting for
almost 20 percent of the deterioration in the NIIP since 2007). The deterioration in NIIP has been mainly driven by increases in public sector
liabilities, reflecting rising public debt held by foreigners. However the net position masks large gross positions, particularly for banks,
reflecting their global activities which grew steadily in the pre-crisis period. Since the crisis, the gross asset position has declined moderately
and stood at 295 percent of GDP in 2015. More than three-quarters of French bank exposures are to advanced economies, with the share of
major emerging market exposures now reaching 8 percent of total foreign claims. The value of emerging market exposures could fall in the
medium-term, causing a moderate decline in the gross asset position and in the net IIP. Public external debt accounts for about 19 percent
of the gross liability position. Stability of the French public debt market is an important element of euro-zone financial stability.
Assessment. The NIIP is negative but its size and trajectory do not raise sustainability concerns. However, there are vulnerabilities due to
the external public debt on the liability side.

Appendix V. Main Recommendations of
the 2015 Article IV Consultation and Authorities’ Actions
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy
Follow an ambitious enough pace of
fiscal adjustment to safely achieve the
medium-term fiscal targets, including a
firmly declining path for the debt ratio,
without unduly detracting from the
recovery.

The government continues to follow a fiscal adjustment strategy
that is fully expenditure-based. However structural adjustment is
slowing down to near zero in 2016.

Persevere with the efforts to rein in
public spending. Underpin the
adjustment by structural measures,
identified through comprehensive
expenditure reviews at all levels of
government.

The annual targeted expenditure reviews initiated in 2015 are now
fully integrated in budget preparation. Starting in 2016, the
indicative targets for local governments’ spending growth
(ODEDEL), are specified for each level of local government. However,
the bulk of spending control continues to rely on nominal spending
growth containment measures.

Structural Reforms
Allow more flexibility in firm-level
agreements on hours and wages, reform
the minimum wage, and strengthen job
search incentives for those receiving
unemployment or welfare benefits.

The El Khomri law, currently in parliament, would increase the scope
for company-level labor agreements and reduce judicial uncertainty
around dismissals.

Further liberalize regulated professions,
dismantle bureaucratic hurdles to small
enterprises, and remove barriers to
competition in services

The Macron law was adopted in the summer of 2015, and the vast
majority of measures has been implemented.

Financial sector
Closely monitor financial risks and
continue strengthening bank capital and
liquidity buffers in line with evolving
regulatory requirements.
Review guaranteed interest rates under
the regulated savings schemes and tax
incentives on financial savings products.

The authorities are monitoring financial and regulatory risks in the
context of the SSM. Banks have continued to adapt to evolving
regulatory requirements.

In August 2015, the Livret A savings rate was reduced to 0.75
percent. No further changes have been made since.

Exchange Arrangements:


France’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.



France maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions imposed solely
for the preservation of international peace and security. These restrictions which mostly involve
some individuals and entities and target specified countries have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). In accordance with the relevant EU
regulations and UNSC resolutions, certain restrictions are maintained on the making of
payments and transfers for certain transactions with respect to the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the former government of Iraq, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Guinea
(republic of), Guinea Bissao, the former Government of Liberia, the former Government of Libya,
the former Government of Tunisia, Transnistria, Eritrea, the former Government of Egypt,
Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, Syria, certain individuals associated with the murder of former
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, and, Central African Republic, Ukraine, Russia, Yemen,
Zimbabwe. As regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, some restrictions still exist in accordance with
the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution 2224 (double use goods, ballistic and
nuclear related goods) but the major part of the past restrictions (those imposed by the
European Union on a bilateral way: oil, gold, minerals…) has been dropped, in early 2016, due to
the Vienna Agreement.



Measures have been taken to freeze accounts of listed persons and entities linked to terrorists
pursuant to the relevant EU regulations (n°881/2002, n°2580/2001 and n°753/2011) and UN
Security Council resolutions (resolutions 1267 and 1373 and subsequent resolutions).

Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 8, 2015. The associated Executive Board
assessment is available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15328.htm and the staff

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and has
introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information. Notable
areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to include more
complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals principles in a number of
areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested that further steps could be
taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget presentation, provide a more
consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation process, and improve the
reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which has become
fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the first multi-annual
fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal objectives for the
period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides details on the level of
appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which the expected results of the
mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of
certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accruals basis accounting has been confirmed.
Parliamentary oversight powers have been strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noted that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high priority
by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of the Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major agencies disclose their
objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and
regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to
the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability.
However, the staff noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual
insurance firms is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency

of monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the
European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of mutual
insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation created a single
supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et Institutions de
Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA) and mutualities’ supervisor
(CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was strengthened and the powers of the
supervisory authorities extended. In 2010, supervision of the banking and insurance sectors was
unified under the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel (ACP), which subsequently also was granted
resolution powers and was renamed the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR).

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de France for the production
of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the reporting burden and the
confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably through the CNIS. Professionalism is
central to the statistical operations of the two institutions, internationally and/or European accepted
methodologies are generally followed, the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is
remarkable, statistics are relevant and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the
public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of INSEE as
the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing between the Banque
de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved; classification and valuation
methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency between the current account of the
balance of payments and the goods and services account in the national accounts improved; the
timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual national accounts aligned; and identification of data
production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations, including
by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater use of firm-level

Summary: The 2004 report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory and
regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS. The degree of
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French banking sector has
been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well capitalized. Systemic
vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained. Securities markets are large and
sophisticated.
The FSAP Update undertaken in January and June 2012 confirmed the resilience of France’s financial
system to severe market pressures but also identified challenges faced by the system. While its
structure has contributed to solid profit generation, the crisis exposed the risks posed by the banks’
size, complexity, and dependence on wholesale funding. The larger banks have been actively
restructuring their balance sheets—moving to more stable sources of funding; reducing their crossborder presence; and building up capital. They remain, however, vulnerable to sustained disruptions
in funding markets and reduced profitability, which would cause delays in meeting capital-raising
plans.
The 2012 report confirmed that the regulatory and supervisory regime for banks, insurance, and
securities market was of a very high standard. Areas for improvement that emerged from the FSAP
Update included greater de jure independence of supervisory authorities; disclosure of the capital
treatment and related financial interactions within complex banking groups; a move toward a more
economic risk-focused approach to insurance regulation and supervision; and enhanced supervision
of investment service providers and financial advisors.
The 2012 report also found disclosure-related shortcomings. French banks and listed companies,
more generally, make extensive public financial disclosures under IFRS, and as a result of bank
regulations (Pillar III of Basel II). Nonetheless, disclosure of financial sector data falls short of
international best practice and enhancements would be highly desirable. Market discipline would
benefit from the publication of regular and comparable data on an institution-by-institution basis,
as well as detailed official analyses of financial sector developments in France.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund
is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial
data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France subscribes to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard. Country is currently working on implementing the transmission of
data in electronic format using the Statistical Data and Metadata A data ROSC mission conducted an
assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was published in October 2003. A
factual update to the main report was published in November 2004.
National Accounts: France adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in May 2014.
The transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) entailed a revision of national accounts data. New data
sources have been incorporated in the new estimates. As a result of these changes, the GDP level
in 2010 has been revised 3.2 percent upward. Historical data series are available from 1949.
Government Finance Statistics: Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics (GFS)
data will be based on ESA 2010 methodology which is likely to include revisions of the general
government deficit and debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised data series will be published in October
2014. Although the source data are collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is
principally responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is
consistent with ESA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics are
based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary
aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are also disseminated in the
quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
External Sector: Starting in June 2014, monthly balance-of-payments statistics are published using the
guidelines set out in the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6) . Back casting of previous periods started with the publication of the Annual report of
the balance of payments and the international investment position end June 2014. It is expected that
greater international consistency will be achieved once all EU members adopt the BPM6.

Statement by the Staff Representative on France
July 11, 2016

This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
On June 23, the people of the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. The
referendum result surprised financial markets and triggered sharp currency movements and
declines in equity valuations, especially in the euro area. Similar to the episode of financial
volatility earlier this year, equity prices of France’s banks declined broadly in line with those of
other European banks, while credit default swap (CDS) spreads rose only modestly. The UK’s
prospective exit from the EU is expected to negatively affect euro area economies, including
France, through trade, financial, and confidence channels.
As noted in the Statement by the Staff Representative on the Euro Area, IMF staff has revised its
macroeconomic projections to take these recent developments into account. For France, staff’s
preliminary assessment is that real GDP growth will still be close to 1½ percent in 2016 and
decelerate to about 1¼ percent in 2017, compared to 1½ percent projected in the staff report. The
downward revision mainly reflects a slower pickup in business investment, on account of
heightened uncertainty and financial market volatility, and lower import demand from the UK
and other European countries. In line with recent episodes of financial stress, the impact on
consumption is expected to be limited in the near term. The revised growth projection assumes
that financial market conditions remain orderly and that any spillovers from France’s banks’
exposures to the UK are contained. Any further tightening of financial conditions would be an
important source of downside risk.
With lower aggregate demand and inflation expectations, average annual inflation is now
projected to come in just below 1 percent in 2017. The fiscal impact of these revisions is
expected to be modest under baseline assumptions, as slower growth is partly offset by savings
from lower interest rates. However, risks to achieving the near-term fiscal targets have increased.
The impact of these revisions on France’s medium-term economic prospects would be relatively
modest absent additional shocks. However, the risks to the outlook are now firmly on the
downside, with much higher uncertainty around financial conditions and political developments
in Europe.
The advice presented in the staff appraisal remains valid. With a subdued medium-term outlook
and heightened downside risks, major efforts are needed to secure a durable reduction in
unemployment and public debt. As discussed in the staff report, this will require further
measures to boost job creation and private sector growth as well as deeper reforms to make
public spending more efficient at all levels of government, which would help underpin
sustainability and resilience against shocks.

Statement by Mr. de Villeroché, Executive Director for France
July 11, 2016

We thank staff for a thorough and detailed set of papers on the main challenges that the French
economy is currently facing. Candid and open discussions during the Article IV mission led to a
comprehensive and fruitful engagement with my authorities. We are pleased to note that staff is
broadly in agreement with the authorities’ overall strategy implemented since 2012.
Since the financial crisis, the French economy has shown its resilience. In 2015, the economic
recovery accelerated, supported not only by external factors such as the decline in oil prices and a
moderate depreciation of the real effective exchange rate but also domestic factors resulting from
the implementation of reforms (in particular the reduction of the labor tax wedge, pro-competition
measures, incentives for private investment) which are already bearing fruits. Going forward, my
authorities remain committed to their economic strategy relying, in particular on ensuring the
sustainability of public finances and structural reforms, particularly on the labor market.
1. Macroeconomic outlook
In 2015, the economic recovery accelerated with a pickup in growth to 1.3 percent (higher than
the forecast of 1 percent in the 2015 Budgetary Plan) and after 0.6 percent in 2014. Economic
growth was driven by households’ spending, and corporate investment (+2 percent in 2015).
Ongoing efforts to restore businesses’ competitiveness have allowed France’s share of export
markets to stabilize (real exports grew by 6 percent in 2015) and contributed to lowering the
country’s trade deficit and almost balancing the current account.
Concerning the outlook for 2016 and 2017, the French economy is expected to gradually recover.
Staff has revised its growth projections upward to 1.5 percent for both years, compared
respectively with 1.1 percent and 1.3 percent in the last WEO. Staff growth forecasts are similar
to the French authorities’ projections as indicated in the Stability Program released last April, as
well as to the latest Consensus Forecasts. Additionally, they are also in line with the forecasts of
the OECD (1.4 percent in 2016 and 1.5 percent in 2017) and the European Commission (1.3
percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2017).
The result of the United Kingdom’s referendum on the EU Membership is expected to have a
limited economic impact in France through trade channels whereas it is still difficult to assess how
this outcome will affect the economic activity through the financial channels and the confidence
effect on the United Kingdom and the Euro area.
In a medium and long term perspective, France’s growth prospects should be supported by key
factors, including its institutional framework, world-class infrastructure, sound financial system,
well-educated workforce, positive demographic trends, and a high productivity rate in the world.
Furthermore, the ambitious agenda of structural reforms currently implemented by the authorities
will boost potential growth.

2
2. Fiscal policy
2015 execution
French public deficit stands at 3.6 percent of GDP in 2015 which has over-performed the objective
set in the Budget bill passed in December 2015 (3.8 percent of GDP). This performance resulted
from the containment of public spending following the first year of the saving plan’s
implementation. Additional saving measures were also taken during the year for EUR 4 billion in
order to offset the negative impact of a lower-than-expected inflation. Indeed, nominal public
spending excluding tax credits increased by only 0.9 percent in 2015, the lowest in decades. With
the implementation of tax reduction measures targeting businesses (Crédit d’Impôt Compétivitié
Emploi, Pacte de responsabilité et de solidarité) and private households, the tax-to-GDP ratio was
reduced by 0.1 point to 44.7 percent of GDP.
We therefore do not share the findings of the staff report that the authorities’ consolidation strategy
“has not delivered the hoped-for fiscal savings in the context of low growth and inflation.”
Fiscal medium-term consolidation path
As set out in the Stability Program published in April, France targets a 0.4 point of GDP structural
adjustment of public balance in 2016 and 0.5 point of GDP in 2017 and 2018, which will allow
under a prudent growth scenario (real GDP growth of 1.5 percent per year in 2016 and 2017) to
bring back the headline deficit below 3 percent in 2017 with a safety margin (2.7 percent of GDP),
a trajectory which is compliant with our European commitments. This target was restated by
President Hollande at the end of June.
Recently announced measures will be financed to ensure that our headline deficit target of 2.7
percent of GDP will be met in 2017. This target has been confirmed and the compensations have
been disclosed in the report published July 5th in order to prepare the draft budget bill discussions
this autumn.
In this regard, we would like to underline that the report finding of a structural “fiscal adjustment
slowing to around zero” is based on a scenario that does not fully take into account the measures
set out in the Stability Program. Moreover, this difference of appreciation of our structural efforts
is partly due to a lower estimate of potential growth by staff, compared to the Stability Program
(1.1 percent for 2016 and 2017 compared to 1.5 percent).
From 2017 to 2019, we forecast that the growth of public expenditure will be close to inflation.
The pace of consolidation strikes the right balance between the need to secure public finances’
sustainability in the medium term, while reducing the tax burden, and avoiding a drag on growth
in the short term.
Overall, given the strong commitment of the authorities to the consolidation path of the Stability
Program, we consider that staff overestimates the implementation risks of a deviation.

3
Long term sustainability
Strong demographics, the improvement in its older workers’ participation rate and the phasing-in
of recent pension reforms, have placed France in a better position to deal with its aging population
than most of its OECD partners. This long-term sustainable position has been reinforced by the
latest pension reform adopted in 2014 as well as the new agreement signed in 2015 on the financing
of the supplementary retirement scheme. According to the latest long term projections of the
European Aging Report 2015, public pension spending is expected to decrease by 2.8 percent of
GDP between 2013 and 2060. The financial position of France’s pension system is no longer a
major issue for the long-term sustainability of public finances.
3. Structural reforms
In order to reduce unemployment and foster potential growth, the French authorities are pursuing
the implementation of a bold agenda of structural reforms aiming at improving cost
competitiveness, enhancing the business environment, improving the functioning of product and
services markets, improving the functioning of the labor market as well as promoting social
inclusion and equal opportunities.
Improving cost competitiveness by cutting the labor tax wedge
The authorities remain fully committed to the implementation of the measures decided to foster
job creation and improve business cost competitiveness by reducing the labor tax wedge.
The Crédit d’Impôt Compétivitié Emploi (CICE), which is a tax credit equivalent to 6 percent of
gross wage targeted on lower wages than 2.5 times the minimum wage, has been fully implemented
and will amount to EUR 19 billion labor cost reduction in 2017. The Pacte de Responsabilité et
de solidarité (Responsibility and Solidarity Pact) amounts to EUR 20 billion and includes a
reduction in social security contributions which has been implemented since April 2016.
These measures, which represent a positive supply shock of almost EUR 40 billion (close to 2
percent of GDP), are already bearing some concrete positive results: the growth of the unit labor
cost in France has decelerated (+0.8 percent annually on average between 2013 and 2015 after +2
percent between 2000 and 2013 according to Eurostat) and has been lower than in Germany (+1.9
percent) and in the euro area on average (+1 percent).
To complement this labor cost reduction, a hiring bonus (so-called “Embauche PME”), targeted
on lower wages less than 1.3 times the minimum wage, was created in January for new hires made
in 2016 in SMEs, and was recently extended to next year hires. Furthermore, the President’s recent
announcements regarding the last phase of implementation of the Responsibility and Solidarity
Pact in 2017 included the increase of the CICE to 7 percent of gross wage, corporate income tax
cuts for SMEs, and EUR 150 million tax cuts for self-employed workers.
Enhancing the business environment and improving the functioning of goods and services markets

4
The government continues its efforts to reduce the red tape faced by businesses, through the socalled “choc de simplification,” and thus improves the business environment. On February 3, 2016,
the authorities announced new measures focused on jobs and innovation, notably the simplification
of applications for the Research Tax Credit (Crédit d’Impôt Recherche - CIR).
The Growth, Economic Activity, Equal Economic Opportunity Act (so-called Macron law)
adopted last summer has enhanced competition across the economy by opening-up various
regulated professions, better aligning their fees with costs as well as extending the possibilities for
Sunday and evening work hours. Since the adoption of this significant reform, its implementation
has made tremendous progress since almost all the implementing decrees are published.
In the same vein, the transparency, anti-corruption and the Economic modernization Bill, which is
currently before the Parliament, will ease the creation and growth trajectories of VSEs and SMEs,
and the access to certain self-employed professions through a streamlining of qualification
requirements.
Improving the functioning of the labor market
As indicated by staff in its report, several structural reforms (the 2013 Job Security Act, the 2015
Act on Labor-Management Dialogue and Employment – so-called Rebsamen law - and the Macron
law) have been implemented over the last years to improve the functioning of the labor market.
The overall objective is to give businesses more leeway to adapt to their environment while
providing employees with greater protection during times of career change, particularly periods of
unemployment.
Building on these achievements, the draft Labor Bill (so-called El Khomri law), which is currently
before the Parliament, aims at modernizing the functioning of the labor market by promoting social
dialogue, providing greater predictability to companies as well as making career paths more secure.
First, the El Khomri law will increase the decentralization of the labor market’s functioning and
expand the scope for negotiation between social partners at the firm level, notably by shifting the
responsibility from the branch to the firm level on determining how work is organized and working
hours. Collective bargaining rules will be reformed to make agreements more effective. The
occupational sectors’ contribution to regulating competition between businesses will be reasserted
and the number of branches will be reduced from 700 to 200 over four years.
Second, the objective of the Bill is also to give greater visibility to companies in order to encourage
hiring people on permanent contracts. Indeed, it identifies and spells out the economic difficulties
faced by a company that can justify economic layoffs. In addition, a decree will set an indicative
scale for compensations that labor tribunals can hand down for redundancies found to be without
real and credible grounds, giving heightened visibility to both employers and employees.
Third, the Bill introduces new safeguards, particularly for employees with little job security and
young people. The Personal activity account (CPA), that will enter into force on January 1, 2017,
will allow all workers to accumulate entitlements throughout their career, regardless of their status
(salaried employee, self-employed worker, civil servant, jobseeker), particularly for training or
support in setting up a business.
The final adoption of this draft law by the Parliament is expected in the coming days.

5
4. Financial sector
Since the financial crisis, French banks have made significant progress in strengthening their
balance sheets, in application of the new regulatory requirements. As indicated in the report, they
have significantly increased their capital level and improved their liquidity position, as illustrated
by the reduction of their dependence on short term wholesale funding and the decrease in their
loan-to-deposit ratios. Compared to the European average, French banks appear relatively more
profitable. The quality of their assets was confirmed by the AQR led by the ECB in 2014 and
which has led to one of the smallest adjustments within the euro area. French banks have lower
non-performing loans (NPL) ratios than the European average and their cost of risk remains under
control.
Concerning the challenges facing the French banking system, we acknowledge that the current
environment of low interest rates puts some pressures on banks’ profitability, in particular in a
context of regulatory uncertainties since there are still some ongoing discussions at the Basel
committee on further reforms which could increase the capital requirements. However, it is
important to underline that this challenge is not specific to the French banking sector and concerns
all financial sectors in advanced economies. In fact, the model of universal banking of French
banks contributes to their resilience thanks to a diversification of activities and could also ease the
evolution of their business model.
In this context, the authorities remain vigilant that French banks strengthen their balance sheets as
required by the regulation in order to preserve the financial stability and also that their adaption to
this new environment does not negatively affect the economy’s financing.
Last but not least, while we generally appreciate a more important focus on macrofinancial
linkages in the Fund’s surveillance activity, we note that the Selected Issues Paper on
macrofinancial issues conducted for the Article IV consultation on France is quite detailed on the
resilience of France’s biggest banking institutions to market volatility. We consider that it could
have been more interesting to focus on the interlinkages between financial developments and the
real economy. We also believe that comparing France’s biggest banking institutions with other GSIBs is not the most relevant approach from a macrofinancial perspective, given the differences
among G-SIBs (in particular but not only between European and US banks) in business models
and their relative shares in the financing of their domestic economy, as well as regulatory
environments (notably on housing loans). Going forward, we agree with staff that it should focus
its follow-up work on having a better understanding regarding the transmission channels of
financial conditions to economic activity.
