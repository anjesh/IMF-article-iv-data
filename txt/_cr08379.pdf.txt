Executive Summary
Background. The global liquidity crisis put the financial sector under severe stress but most banks have
weathered the crisis well owing to strong initial positions and supportive policies. The crisis accelerated
a downturn that had begun in 2007—after a two-year boom—and tilted the balance of macroeconomic
risk towards recession. Inflation, which picked up in 2007, has started to slow but the output gap is still
high and unemployment is still near a 30-year low, resulting in still-fast wage growth. The boom swelled
Denmark’s fiscal surpluses, reducing the government debt burden.
Outlook. Economic growth will drop below potential in 2008, and the output gap is expected to turn
negative in 2009. Recovery is expected to begin in 2010.
Staff’s views. The authorities’ response to the crisis has been bold and well conceived. Special liquidity
measures and a public-private Financial Stability Agreement (which includes a broad guarantee of
liabilities) are ensuring access to liquidity and should bolster creditor confidence. The macroeconomic
policy mix is appropriate—higher interest rates to support the exchange rate peg and an expansionary
budget to add a countercyclical thrust to the strong stabilizing effect of Denmark’s automatic stabilizers.
At this point, the case for further discretionary easing is weak because some slowing is needed to stop
the decline in competitiveness and automatic stabilizers will cushion the impact of a faster-thananticipated slowdown. Regarding fiscal sustainability, the impressive fiscal reforms of the last few years
have gone a long way towards closing the long term fiscal gap, but further action is needed to offset
more recent tax cuts and spending commitments.
Authorities’ position. Given the slippage in wage competitiveness and the still strong cyclical position
the authorities were wary of fiscal expansion, preferring to rely on automatic stabilizers rather than
discretionary policies. They are strongly committed to Denmark’s rule-driven policy framework,
anchored by the exchange rate peg and a medium term fiscal framework. Looking ahead, closing the
long-term fiscal gap is a key priority but the authorities consider it difficult to make further progress so
soon after the major reforms in 2006.
The discussions. A mission comprising Franek Rozwadowski (Head), Jay Surti, Allan Brunner, and
Mali Chivakul (EUR) visited Copenhagen on September 22–October 2, 2008. The mission met with the
Minister of Finance; the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Danmarks Nationalbanken; the Deputy
Director General of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority; the Deputy Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Business and Economic Affairs; and other senior officials. The mission also met
parliamentarians, representatives of trade unions and business associations, and financial institutions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
In Denmark, the global financial turbulence which gathered force in 2008 added
fuel to a cyclical slowdown that had begun in early 2007. From the perspective of
macroeconomic management, the timing of the crisis was fortuitous since the cyclical
position was still strong and a slowdown was called for. From the perspective of financial
stability, however, the timing was inopportune: banks with exposures to the slumping
construction sector were writing down loans just when the crisis raised their funding cost and
froze their foreign funding lines. Through the crisis, the authorities adhered to their
macroeconomic policy framework—a euro peg and fiscal rules which allow full play to
automatic stabilizers—while moving decisively to ensure banking system liquidity and
reassure creditors. This report was written in the midst of the crisis. The policy discussions
were held in late September, but the report also covers developments and policy responses
through early November.
Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Denmark’s policies are generally consistent with Executive Board views. Recent policy
changes have been in line with some but not all the recommendations made in the 2006
Article IV consultation: the marginal tax rate on labor income is being cut, but the
authorities have ruled out financing the cut by raising property taxes. Consistent with
the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendation, more
resources have recently been announced for the financial system supervisor (DFSA) in
order to facilitate more intensive risk-based supervision.
2.
The slowdown began with a reversal of the factors that had fueled the 2005-07
upswing (Figure 1). The housing boom ended when mounting supply pricked the price
bubble and slowed construction; ebullient consumer confidence wilted in the face of falling
home values; and previously easy lending conditions tightened as interest rates rose and
defaults on construction loans increased. Residential and business fixed investments declined
and export growth decelerated. By late 2008 the slowdown was firmly in place but the output
gap was still high and the labor market was still overheated (Figure 2).
3.
The labor market responded to both upswing and downturn with a lag. Early in
the boom, labor supply was expanded by structural reforms and an influx of workers from
EU new member states. Consequently, the upswing had an unusually large impact on
employment and an unusually small impact on wages. In mid-2007, however, wage growth
finally picked up; it has remained strong despite slowing output growth, although the most
recent data show some moderation. The tight labor market, a generous 2008 public sector
wage agreement, and rising food and fuel prices have pushed nominal wage growth to about
4.5 percent, implying real wage growth in excess of productivity growth. The downward

march of the unemployment rate ended in August but unemployment remains at a record
low, well below the estimated NAIRU, and vacancy rates are high. 1

Like wages, prices were quiescent during the first two years of the upswing and
picked up only in late 2007. Inflation, kept low by wage moderation and favorable import
prices, dipped below the eurozone level even as demand took off. But it accelerated to just
under 5 percent in 2008, pushed up by food and energy prices and an increase in core
inflation following the wage acceleration. Inflation expectations worsened starting in mid2007, though they have since stabilized with the downturn in commodity prices and the
global outlook.
5.
Competitiveness is adequate, but trends in wages and productivity are
unsustainable. CGER analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is well
aligned—the three approaches show an

REER has been softened by structural shifts— 1/ MB: macrobalance; ERER: equilibrium real exchange rate; ES: external stability
a move towards higher-value added goods
(sustaining profitability) and an improvement in the terms of trade (making real wages rise
faster than product wages). Even so, the REER is high relative to recent norms, the external
current account surplus has been narrowing, and Denmark’s share in global export markets
has declined.
6.
The global crisis has put financial markets under strain but most banks,
including the half dozen largest, have weathered it well. This reflects conservative
investment strategies in a sound regulatory environment. Although mortgage lending has
grown rapidly in recent years, against the background of a housing boom, credit risk
management standards are high and market risk is limited because most funding is through
covered bonds. Large commercial banks—accounting for about 80 percent of assets—and
specialized mortgage banks are well-capitalized. But small and medium sized banks—which
grew rapidly in recent years—have slim excess capital buffers (Table 7). Direct effects of the
global crisis were small because exposure to U.S. subprime assets was limited and
subsidiaries of foreign banks were subject to tight restrictions on intra-group exposures.
Spillover risk from subsidiaries in the Baltics and Ireland was very small since they
represented only about 5 percent of the parent bank’s credit portfolio and 2 percent of group
profits. Instead, the main channels of contagion were increasing risk aversion and the dryingup of liquidity (Figure 4). Hardest hit were small and medium sized banks, which had
increased their reliance on money market funding that now became difficult—and costly—to
roll over. This gave rise to a clutch of mergers and takeovers, including a high profile central
bank intervention in a midsize bank with an exceptionally weak loan portfolio. Fortunately,
most banks entered the crisis with healthy capital buffers (Table 6), partly because the
reduction of capital requirements under Basel II was phased in gradually.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS 2
8.
The global financial crisis and downturn are clouding the outlook. Growth is
expected to be weak through 2010 before reverting gradually to potential (Table 2, text
table). On the domestic front, borrowing costs have risen and confidence has been shaken by
falling home values, rising corporate defaults, and banking problems. Recent survey data
indicate a downward slide in expectations of economic performance over the next 12 months;
this should be reflected in sluggish consumption and weak investment. On the external front,
export growth will be pulled down by slower growth in key export markets: Germany,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But, assuming the global economy
revives in late 2009, growth should remain in positive territory. In the near term, the
slowdown in consumption will be cushioned by still high employment, rising real wages and
fiscal automatic stabilizers. Over time, rising unemployment and weaker inflationary
expectations should reduce wage pressures, enabling firms to rebuild profit margins and
creating conditions for a pick-up in growth.

Considerable downside risk attends this central outlook. A more prolonged global
recession could constrain export growth through 2010. Moreover, it may be difficult to
reduce interest rates in the context of a flight to liquidity in global currency markets. In the
immediate future, tight liquidity could push up interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages that
will reset in December—which amount to 13 percent of GDP. Higher interest costs—just as

The near-term outlook has deteriorated since the discussions. Growth projections for 2008-10 have been
revised downward by 0.2-0.4 percentage points since September and the output gap, which was projected to
gradually decline towards zero is now projected to be negative in 2009–12.

11
unemployment starts rising—could lead to household belt-tightening, a spike in mortgage
defaults, a further decrease in home values, and second-round effects on investment and
employment (Box 2). This could pull the economy into a recession.
Box 2. Housing and the Business Cycle
House prices overshot fundamentals during the recent boom and have yet to correct fully. 3 In these
circumstances an increase in interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages combined with a rise in
unemployment could trigger an abrupt adjustment. This would depress construction, drive up
unemployment, and weaken the performance of real estate-related loan portfolios.
WEO estimates suggest that Danish housing prices were about 20 percent overvalued in
December 2007 (text chart). Since then, prices have decreased only 2 percent, leaving them well above
the level justified by fundamentals such as disposable income and construction cost.
A drop in house prices would raise unemployment significantly due to a large impact on
construction. House prices have been highly correlated with residential construction; the high labor
intensity of construction implies a correspondingly high impact on employment.
The impact on consumption could also be large. While the correlation between consumption and home
values has been low in the past, the impact could be large when compounded by high interest costs, a
collapse in share prices and rising unemployment.
The ultimate impact—magnified by a “financial accelerator”—could be protracted low growth and
high unemployment. Foreclosures resulting from high interest rates on variable-rate mortgages could
depress home values and undermine recovery on defaulted mortgages. Banks would make losses when
balance-sheets were already damaged by rising unemployment, falling household wealth and weaker
corporate balance-sheets. This could result in a longer period of tight credit and higher borrowing costs,
delaying economic recovery.
...but housing is still overvalued.

Wage growth is a concern but appears to be moderating. As noted, rising wages
are contributing to an erosion of competitiveness. Looking forward, however, rising
unemployment, falling vacancy rates, and a trend towards more decentralized wage setting in
the private sector should help break wage momentum.
III. POLICIES AND DISCUSSIONS
11.
Faced with the global financial crisis, the authorities have taken steps to secure
the twin anchors of their policy framework—the euro peg and fiscal automatic
stabilizers. The peg stabilizes inflation by importing the ECB’s monetary stance. The
authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to it and taken the steps needed—including
interest rate hikes—to support foreign exchange reserves and maintain euro liquidity.
Denmark’s fiscal rules have two objectives: long-term sustainability—achieved through a
target range for the structural balance—and demand management—achieved via automatic
stabilizers. Despite the possibly severe downturn the authorities plan to stick to this
framework—relying on automatic stabilizers to cushion the slowing in demand without a
discretionary fiscal impulse. Moreover, they have reduced the likelihood of a severe
downturn with measures that should keep financial markets functioning and liquidity
flowing.
A. Containing the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis
12.
The response to the global crisis has been timely and comprehensive. The key
objective has been to support confidence; the key measures have aimed to maintain liquidity
and ensure that banks can honor all unsubordinated claims even if they come under stress.
13.
Early efforts to alleviate liquidity shortages in the banks had mixed success, and
were followed by more direct interventions. An attempt in May to revive the interbank
market by introducing loan bills—usable as collateral at Danmarks Nationalbanken (DNB)—
was not successful because it failed to address banks’ strong liquidity preference and
aversion to counterparty risk. With small and medium sized banks frozen out of the money
market, the DNB ratcheted up its response in September by broadening the set of collateral it
accepts and creating a framework for uncollateralized lending to banks with excess capital. In
October, in another attempt to revive the interbank market, a state guarantee was extended to
interbank lending. Finally, banks’ need to service clients requesting dollar liquidity was met
by a government issue of T-bills (which the US Federal Reserve accepts as collateral) and a
central bank auction of funds obtained via a swap line with the Federal Reserve.
14.
Foreign exchange market pressures in October have pushed up the interest rate.
The market’s flight to liquidity included a shift out of krone into the deeper euro market,
leading to reserve outflows. The authorities, whose monetary policy is focused tightly on
sustaining the peg, responded by increasing domestic interest rates (now 175 bps higher than
the euro rate), buttressing reserves with the proceeds of euro-denominated government
borrowing, and arranging a currency swap with the ECB. The interest rate hike stemmed the

13
outflow but it could push up mortgage financing costs when adjustable rates are reset in
December. The episode has revived discussions of a new referendum on euro adoption,
possibly in 2011.
15.
In October, as the financial crisis deepened, the government and the banking
sector agreed on an innovative and comprehensive framework to enhance financial
stability (Box 3). The overriding objective was to build confidence. The framework embeds
features aimed at normalizing the interbank market and avoiding disruptive suspensions of
payments, It secures the financial participation of the private sector through a Private
Contingency Association (PCA). It provides an incentive for distressed banks to seek preemptive private-sector solutions since shareholders of a bank wound up under the terms of
the new Act lose control of it. It also promotes the consolidation of the sector by easing
financial constraints that could block takeovers of distressed banks. Finally, eligibility
requirements are designed to reduce domestic and cross country “beggar thy neighbor”
effects. The framework has not yet been used, but some of its features—including financial
participation by the PCA—were present in the resolution of Roskilde bank in July-August.
Box 3. Agreement on Financial Stability
Key features of the agreement include a blanket guarantee and procedures for the orderly winding up of
distressed banks. Parts of the framework are entrenched in a Financial Stability Act, that has the
following key elements:
Guarantee of claims. All deposits and other unsecured claims on banks belonging to the PCA are
guaranteed. 133 banks—and 99 percent of deposits—are covered.
Winding up company (WUC). Banks whose capital falls below the regulatory floor must allow a stateowned WUC to arrange for purchase or wind-up. All deposits and unsecured claims are honored but
shareholders lose control of the bank.
Burden sharing. The PCA is set up as an insurance scheme. Member banks pay premia and make
guarantees that, together, cover the first DKK 35 billion of losses incurred by the WUC (equivalent to
2 percent of GDP). Beyond that, losses are covered by the state, which also receives any profit earned by
the WUC.
Level playing field. The guarantee covers all PCA member banks. It can cover branches abroad only if
the host country has a similar guarantee. The Act also extends the coverage of the regular Deposit
Guarantee Fund to Danish branches of foreign banks.
Addressing moral hazard and intensifying supervision. The Act has a framework for expelling a bank
that takes on greater risk under the umbrella of the guarantee. Alternatively the DFSA may dismiss
members of the board of directors or order the bank to dismiss a member of its management board.
Another key element of the agreement was an undertaking by participating banks not to pay dividends,
create new redemption programs or initiate new share purchases.

14
16.
Staff raised concern about the adequacy of the DFSA’s resources. The economic
slowdown and continued pressure in global financial markets call for intensified monitoring
of the financial sector. The transition to Basel II has expanded the DFSA’s supervisory
mandate, and the mission—following-up on the 2006 FSAP—emphasized the need for
resources to recruit and retain risk experts necessary to fulfill this mandate. The mission also
pointed out that the difficulties of small banks during the downturn underscored the need to
supervise them more frequently. The authorities increased the DFSA’s resources as part of
the political agreement on financial stability.
17.
The authorities emphasized that the introduction of the mortgage covered bond
legislation in 2007 strengthens lenders’ risk management practices. The legislation
tightens loan-to-value standards and provides incentives for commercial banks to strengthen
market risk management by aligning securitization techniques more closely with the “balance
principles” used by mortgage banks.
B. Macroeconomic Stabilization
18.
Denmark’s macroeconomic framework relies to a large degree on automatic
stabilizers. The peg rules out discretionary monetary policy since monetary conditions are
determined by the exigencies of

while North Sea oil and gas revenues are declining. But there are also discretionary elements.
First, a political accord (the “tax freeze”) caps tax rates, causing specific taxes—such as the
real estate tax—to fall in real terms. Second, an unfinanced cut in personal income taxes,
enacted in 2007, becomes fully effective in 2009. Third, a public sector wage agreement was
negotiated this past spring and locks in wage increases of 12 percent over the next three
years. And finally public consumption is projected to rise by 1 percentage point of GDP over
the period. Taken together, these trends and policies will reduce the structural surplus from
over 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to about zero by 2015.
20.
For 2009, the mission and the authorities agreed in September that a close-toneutral fiscal stance would be appropriate. While the economic slowdown was generating
political pressure for fiscal stimulus, the authorities emphasized that the economy was still
above capacity and unemployment was just bottoming out at an exceptionally low level.
Moreover, automatic stabilizers could be expected to cushion the slowdown, and indeed a
more serious recession, should it occur. Under the circumstances, they laid more emphasis on
the salutary role of a slowdown in breaking wage momentum. Staff shared these views and
also emphasized the need for a tight fiscal position to support long run sustainability. In the
event, the adopted budget was in line with the targeted medium-term path described above,
implying a fiscal injection ––over and above automatic stabilizers––of about 0.6 percent of
GDP.4
C. Fiscal sustainability
21.
Denmark was among the first in the OECD to articulate and implement a longterm fiscal framework that addressed demographic challenges. The strategy rests on two
pillars—accumulating assets while demographics and North Sea revenues are relatively
favorable and implementing structural reforms to

•

The mandate of the Tax Commission is to improve work incentives by lowering
marginal tax rates on labor income. The commission is free, in principle, to propose
compensating increases in other taxes—a welcome temporary thaw in the six year
“tax freeze”. But its ability to strengthen medium-term sustainability is limited. First,
the commission is required to present a revenue-neutral overall package. Second, real
estate taxes are off the table—the commission does not have the mandate to reverse
the decline in the effective tax rate caused by the freeze in assessed property values.

•

In contrast, the Labor Market Commission’s mandate is to improve long-term public
finances. The Commission recently released a number of proposals—accelerate the
Welfare Agreement’s program to raise the pension age, reduce the duration of
unemployment benefits, shift the focus of active labor market programs from
education to on-the-job training, and improve the recruitment of foreign labor. While
these proposals would go a long way toward improving fiscal sustainability, the
public reaction has been overwhelmingly negative, based on the view that it is too
soon to re-negotiate the terms of the 2006 Welfare Agreement.

23.
The mission discussed challenges and risks to closing the longer-term fiscal gap.
First the fiscal benefits of the Welfare Agreement—and the cost to retirees—are back-loaded
to 2019. While this allows ample time for planning; it also entails some risk that the political
commitment may falter as implementation draws nearer. Second, policy measures to achieve
the targets of the 2015 plan have not yet been identified. Third, there is a great deal of
uncertainty regarding the fiscal costs of ageing, especially with respect to health and old-age
care. Analysis by staff and by independent researchers suggests that the authorities’
assumptions might too optimistic. Fourth, Denmark will need to open its borders to the EU
New Member States at end-2010. While most studies show that inward migration from these
states is likely to have an insignificant effect on public finances, there are concerns that fiscal
sustainability could be weakened by individuals gaming the eligibility rules. Finally, there
are uncertainties associated with sustaining fiscal discipline at the local government level—
though in this area some recent reforms look promising.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Denmark has weathered the global crisis well so far but conditions are still
fragile. The economy is still cyclically strong but the weakening global outlook has
increased the risk of a severe downturn. Financial markets’ shift towards risk-free liquid
assets has put pressure on the exchange rate peg and widened interest rate spreads—between
krone and euro as well as between government bonds and mortgage bonds. Against this
background, policies need to address three challenges—find the right balance in steering the
economy to a soft landing; support financial stability; and ensure that a decade-long effort to
strengthen fiscal sustainability does not stall.

18
25.
Macroeconomic policies need to be set in light of the exchange rate peg. The peg
has served Denmark well—anchoring inflationary expectations and keeping interest rates
within narrow spreads relative to the euro zone. The authorities’ supportive policy stance—a
steady hand on fiscal policy through the crisis and a readiness to raise interest rates in the
face of reserve outflows—is thus welcome.
26.
The proposed 2009 budget strikes a good balance between allowing growth to
slow and cushioning it from a severe recession. The 2007 cyclical slowdown was welcome
given record low unemployment and fast rising wages, but the global crisis has increased the
risk of a hard landing. Given the deterioration in the global outlook, the authorities’ 2009
budget proposal—which adds a discretionary positive impulse to the automatic stabilizers—
is appropriate notwithstanding concerns about medium term sustainability.
27.
The authorities’ responses to the financial crisis were innovative, forceful, and
timely. The new liquidity facilities are comprehensive and the collaborative approach to
resolving problem banks facilitated prompt decision-making and prevented contagion during
a period of exceptionally fragile confidence.
28.
The new financial stability act establishes clear rules and sound incentives. The
main features of the agreement—a blanket guarantee and a transparent procedure for preemptive resolution should help secure creditor confidence. The burden-sharing rule protects
the taxpayer but has contributed to a decline in banks’ share values. Other measures—
intrusive but temporary—improve incentives for prudent behavior: the dividend moratorium
will strengthen capital buffers; the greater powers extended to the DFSA punish risk-taking;
and the elimination of shareholder control in a wound-up bank creates an incentive for
preemptive private sector solutions. Also welcome are provisions that level the playing field
in cross-border banking operations.
29.
Current conditions underscore the importance of intensifying financial sector
surveillance and supervision. The DFSA’s initiative to monitor liquidity risk more
frequently and comprehensively is welcome. Although financial stability work is well
established, there is scope for further strengthening, and it is important to ensure that the
DFSA has the resources to recruit and retain appropriate staff in light of their expanded
mandate under Basel II—the recently agreed increase is welcome.
30.
Competitiveness is adequate, but recent trends are unsustainable. The REER is
well aligned, but wages are rising faster than in trading partners while productivity is rising
slower. Wage growth needs to slow if firms are to rebuild profitability and stem the decline
in Denmark’s export share. Otherwise firms will be stressed by a simultaneous increase in
costs and slowdown in demand.
31.
Upfront action is needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. The achievements of the
past two decades have been remarkable, but they do not close the long-term fiscal gap.

19
Difficult choices are required in order to make the welfare state compatible with labor market
incentives and long term fiscal balance.
•

Tax reform needs to be more comprehensive. A broader set of measures should be
considered, including user fees, the indexation of the tax on residential property and
reducing the deductibility of mortgage interest.

•

On the expenditure side, the proposals recently presented by the Labor Market
Commission deserve careful consideration.

32.
Denmark’s continued generous provision of foreign aid is welcome. Denmark is
committed to maintaining development assistance at the internationally high level of
0.8 percent of gross national income.
33.

Staff recommends that Denmark remain on the 24-month consultation cycle.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 19, 2008
This statement provides information that became available after the staff report was issued.
The thrust of the staff appraisal is unchanged.
1.
Third quarter data suggest lower GDP growth than was assumed in staff’s
baseline scenario, implying weaker growth prospects. GDP fell by ½ percent in the third
quarter of 2008, owing to weak investment and an unexpectedly strong shift to imports.
Consequently, staff has marked down growth projections to about zero in both 2008 and
2009, with the output gap now projected to turn negative in 2009 (table).

2.
The authorities have indicated a continued preference for relying primarily on
fiscal automatic stabilizers to manage the downturn. Consequently, the structural fiscal
balance is broadly unchanged, but the projected slower growth and higher unemployment
imply smaller fiscal surpluses in 2008–09 and larger deficits in 2010–11.
3.
Financial markets have calmed but the authorities are considering injecting
capital into banks. Danmarks Nationalbanken matched the ECB’s rate cuts in November
and December, keeping spreads constant. Interbank rates decreased in November while
foreign exchange outflows stopped, and maturing mortgage bonds were rolled over
successfully. Against the background of more muted growth prospects, the government is
considering ways of increasing the banks’ capital buffers, including direct injections of state
funds.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 29, 2008

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Denmark
On December 19, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Denmark. 1
Background
The global financial crisis exacerbated a cyclical slowdown that had begun in early 2007, after a
long upswing. The slowdown began when Denmark’s housing boom ended and residential
investment declined. It gained momentum when the financial crisis raised borrowing costs and
depressed export growth, consumer confidence, and investment.
The crisis has put financial markets under strain, but most Danish banks, including the half
dozen largest, started out with healthy capital buffers which have helped them cope. Direct
effects of the crisis were modest because exposures to risky assets were small and because
Danish subsidiaries of foreign banks were protected by tight restrictions on intra-group
exposures. The main channels of contagion were indirect: increasing risk aversion and a
liquidity freeze, which affected all banks, hit small and medium-sized banks particularly hard,
leading to a number of mergers and takeovers.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The labor market continued tightening after the end of the boom, and unemployment—which
began rising only in October 2008—is still close to a historic low. Wage growth picked up in mid2007 and has remained strong, reflecting tight labor market conditions and a generous public
sector wage agreement in 2008. Inflation—keeping pace with wage growth—started rising in
late 2007, and accelerated to just under 5 percent in mid-2008, with food and energy prices
rising rapidly. External competitiveness is adequate, but current trends—faster wage growth
and slower productivity growth than in trading partners—are unsustainable.
Denmark’s fiscal position is among the strongest in the EU. A gradual reduction in the
expenditure ratio, combined with the recent economic boom, led to large surpluses, enabling
the government to substantially reduce its debt burden. Consequently, interest spreads on
government debt are low.
Economic growth is expected to remain weak through 2010 before recovering gradually. But
weaker-than-expected global growth or higher interest rates could drive the economy into a
recession.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for policies that have enabled Denmark to
weather the global crisis well. Nevertheless, conditions remain fragile because of market
liquidity constraints and the weakening regional and global outlook, increasing the risk of a
severe economic downturn. Directors concurred that the authorities face the combined
challenges of steering the economy during a period of substantial growth deceleration;
supporting financial stability; and persevering in their decade-long effort to strengthen fiscal
sustainability.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg of the krone to the euro has served Denmark
well, anchoring inflationary expectations and keeping interest rates close to those in the euro
zone. Macroeconomic policies therefore need to be set in light of Denmark’s participation in the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERMII). Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent
fiscal policy stance, underpinned by a strong rules-based framework, and their readiness to
raise interest rates in response to pressures on the peg arising from financial markets’ shift in
favor of holding risk-free liquid assets.
Directors considered that the proposed 2009 budget strikes a good balance between allowing
growth to slow in the face of record low unemployment and rapid wage growth, and cushioning
the economy from a severe recession. They viewed the moderate positive fiscal impulse in the
budget proposal, added to Denmark’s strong automatic stabilizers, as an appropriate response
to the increased risk of a hard landing. Directors emphasized that, along with progress on
structural reforms, wage growth needs to slow if firms are to rebuild profitability and secure
Denmark’s competitiveness and export market share.
Directors commended the authorities for their bold response to the financial crisis, and viewed
the new liquidity facilities as comprehensive. The proactive and collaborative approach to bank
resolution has helped prevent contagion during a period of exceptionally fragile confidence.

3
Directors welcomed the new financial stability act, noting that it establishes clear rules and
sound incentives for the banking system, helping to secure creditor confidence while
safeguarding public resources. The act improves incentives for prudent behavior—including
through a temporary dividend moratorium—provides powers to the Danish Financial
Supervisory Authority (DFSA) to punish excessive risk-taking, and encourages the private
sector to find timely solutions for problem banks. Directors welcomed provisions that level the
playing field with respect to cross-border banking operations.
Directors emphasized the importance of intensifying financial sector surveillance and
supervision under current financial market conditions. They pointed in this context to potential
vulnerabilities stemming from the housing sector and from regional spillovers. Directors
welcomed the supervisory authority’s initiative to monitor liquidity risk more intensively and
comprehensively, and stressed the importance of ensuring that it has the resources to fulfill its
expanded mandate under Basel II. They took positive note of the ongoing discussions on a new
banking package with the aim of preventing a credit crunch by injecting new capital into the
banking sector, subject to adequate safeguards.
Directors noted the impressive achievements of the authorities over the past two decades in
reconciling the costs of supportive social safety nets for an aging population with the demands
of long-term fiscal sustainability. While recognizing that further progress will involve difficult
choices, they encouraged the authorities to take additional measures on both the tax and
benefits sides toward closing the long-term fiscal gap.
Directors commended Denmark for maintaining a generously high level of official development
assistance, including in the current difficult environment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Denmark is also available.

Statement by Jens Henriksson, Executive Director for Denmark and
Katrine Mogensen, Advisor to Executive Director
December 19, 2008
On behalf of our Danish authorities, we would like to thank the staff team for candid and
constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV mission. They
appreciate the circulated set of high quality papers addressing topical issues for the
Danish economy. Our authorities broadly concur with staff's analysis and assessment and
will carefully consider the recommendations.
Outlook and Risks
The outlook for the Danish economy is marked by the financial turmoil and bleak
prospects for the global economy. The exchange rate and the interest rate spread vis-à-vis
the euro area have been under pressure, confidence indicators have fallen further and
public finances are expected to deteriorate amid falling stock and oil prices. In 2010 the
fiscal balance is expected to turn clearly negative for the first time since the mid 1990’s.
However, the structural surplus is expected to remain in positive territory, around 1
percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010.
The recent escalation in the financial turmoil, combined with the gloomy prospects for the
international economy, has led to a downward revision of an already weak outlook. Our
authorities are now projecting GDP to contract marginally in 2009 and grow moderately
in 2010.
The slowdown in the Danish economy started already at the end of 2006, and the total
period of weak growth is expected to last 3-4 years. Weak GDP growth has been
accompanied by sturdy growth in domestic demand up until the turn of the year, and
employment has risen to a very high level. This development has been reflected in high
import growth, a significant fall in productivity and rising unit labor costs, indicating
substantial pressures on production capacity. Total demand is now weakening due to the
financial turmoil, the slowdown in external demand and the falling house prices. Labor
market pressures are, therefore, expected to ease. The expected increase in unemployment
tends to dampen wage pressures, but since unemployment also increases abroad, where
capacity utilisation is lower, wage competitiveness is still expected to deteriorate.
The outlook is subject to an exceptional degree of uncertainty, reflecting the risks of a
prolonged financial turmoil and tightened credit conditions. As stated by staff, risks to the
outlook are related to the pressure on the Danish key refinancing rate spread vis-à-vis the
euro area, which came into existence during the period of financial turmoil and may give
difficulties in reducing interest rates. This could reduce the stimulating effects on demand
from the accommodative monetary policy in the euro area. A related risk is the
emergence of a credit crunch, where well-functioning, creditworthy households and
companies would have trouble getting finance for their activities, which might amplify
the adjustment in the housing market. The authorities are aware of the credit constrain
problem and have recently agreed on a number of comprehensive initiatives in order to
make the interbank markets function, as well as initiatives to support the pension sector
and the stable exchange rate policy. The authorities are also considering models for
recapitalising banks. The resetting of adjustable rate mortgages in December resulted only
in minor increases, thus reducing the related risk of household belt-tightening.

2
On the other hand, domestic demand will be supported by economic policy measures.
Short term rates are expected to fall to a very low level, which may support the housing
market and the financial stability, especially if the financial turmoil is contained. At the
same time, fiscal policy is eased due to high growth in public consumption and cuts in
personal income taxes. In addition, automatic stabilisers are quite powerful in Denmark.
Fiscal Policies
Fiscal policy is relatively expansionary in Denmark. The discretionary fiscal expansion
(as measured by the direct budgetary impact) is almost 1 percent of GDP in 2009, of
which personal income tax cuts and public demand growth each accounts for around one
half. Fiscal policy is thus presently more expansionary than in most other EU countries.
The first year fiscal impulse to GDP growth of this easing is estimated to 0.4 percent in
2009 (fiscal easing added 0.2 percent to GDP growth in 2008). On the back of the fiscal
easing (tax cuts), high wage growth and the significant drop in energy prices since June,
households’ real disposable income is expected to rise by as much as 3¾ percent in 2009.
As stated by staff, the economy is still above capacity and unemployment has just started
to rise from a very low level, well below the estimated structural unemployment level.
Thus, it is important to be cautious in fiscal policy planning since attempts to keep
unemployment at its current extraordinary low level will lead to increased imports, a
further deterioration of competitiveness, weakening public finances and increased
pressure on the interest rate, and may lead to an even higher increase in unemployment
than currently projected.
The financial turmoil and the uncertainty about growth outlooks imply that room for
manoeuvre at a later stage should be maintained. In Denmark, the starting point is
significantly better than in many other countries and there is still some room for
manoeuvre due to savings in “good times”. It is important that this room is used wisely.
Further easing now will reduce, or remove, the fiscal policy options further ahead, when a
real need for discretionary fiscal policies might arise.
Public consumption expenditure is expected to rise to 27¼ percent of GDP in 2010, the
highest level since 1983 and somewhat above the indicative target of 26½ percent set in
the 2015-plan. This is partly due to the public sector wage agreements of this year. Real
public consumption growth is approximately in line with the targets.
To provide against excess spending in municipalities proposals have been adopted to
ensure that local government budgets are in line with the tax freeze and the agreements
with the government. The proposals imply that the central government block grant to
municipalities is reduced if the municipalities on the aggregate exceed the services and
investment budget in 2008. In addition, from 2009 onwards the allocation of a part of the
block grant to municipalities is depending on whether or not local government budgets
are in line with the agreements. Also in the future, local government block grants will be
adjusted individually and collectively, if the total taxation in the municipalities exceeds
the agreements.
The automatic stabilisers, including automatic changes in tax payments and transfer
payments, will dampen the downturn. As stated in the report, the dampening effects from
automatic stabilisers are higher in Denmark than in most other countries. Compared to

3
discretionary fiscal stimulus, automatic stabilisers have the advantage of being well
timed, and do not affect the sustainability of public finances.
The financial turmoil and weaker external demand is expected to lead to a significant
weakening of the public finances in the coming years. The surplus is expected to fall from
4½ to 5 percent of GDP in 2005-07, to 3 percent of GDP this year and around balance
next year. In 2010 a deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP is projected.
Periods of financial distress requires fiscal discipline in small economies, like Denmark,
with a fixed exchange rate regime outside the euro area. Fiscal policy should support the
credibility surrounding the fixed exchange rate regime by ensuring sustainable public
finances, and contribute to bring inflation in line with the euro area and a lowering of the
interest rate spread vis-à-vis the euro area. Lower interest rates will support the housing
market and the financial system, while capacity utilisation normalizes and wage pressures
dampen.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Our authorities concur with staff's assessment that the exchange rate peg has served
Denmark well. The peg to the euro helps anchoring inflation expectations and is thus a
cornerstone of the stability oriented economic policy.
In conjunction with the financial crisis in October, Denmark was for the first time in more
than 10 years faced with substantial tensions in foreign exchange markets. The unrest was
not due to factors in the real economy and shows that when a global financial crisis
occurs, a price must be paid for not adopting the euro. At first the pressure on the Danish
krone was mainly due to the appearance of a negative spread between our lending rate
and the marginal rate of the ECB. Subsequently the intensified financial crisis and a
general tendency to move out of smaller currencies also hit Denmark and caused a
considerable outflow of capital in a very short time. Danmarks Nationalbank (DNB)
responded with a combination of interventions and widening of the interest spread vis-àvis the ECB. From the end of October, the pressure on the krone has eased and DNB has
been able to buy back foreign exchange. This has allowed DNB to follow the two latest
interest rate reductions of the ECB, announced on November 6 and December 4. Our
spread vis-à-vis the ECB currently stands at the somewhat elevated level of 1.75 percent.
If the yield spread to the anchor currency is to narrow, further private capital imports are
required.
Financial Sector Issues
Our authorities generally welcome the assessment by staff regarding the Danish responses
to the financial crisis.
Staff shows concern about the resources available to the DFSA to recruit and retain
appropriate staff in light of their expanded mandate under the Basel II. The budget of an
agency such as the DFSA is a matter for the Parliament as part of the annual revision of
the Danish National Budget. The resources allocated to the DFSA are increased when the
agency is given new assignments. As noted by staff, the authorities increased the DFSA’s
resources by DKK 10 million as part of the political agreement on financial stability.
These resources will be directed at strengthening the work of the DFSA on credit risk in
the banking sector.

4
The financial crisis and weak international growth outlook has a marked impact on the
Danish economy. In the coming years the prospects are associated with greater
uncertainty than usually.
A special risk is that a credit crunch can develop, reflecting in particular a need for
consolidation in the banking sector and difficulties for many banks to attract new capital.
At the same time, there are indications that Danish banks will need extra capital in the
near future, as losses mount. If nothing is done, the banks could go on the defensive and
cut their activities, thereby reducing the balance-sheet total to meet the capital
requirements. In that case, even creditworthy borrowers would find it difficult to obtain
financing for sound projects.
The Danish government is prepared to take action in order to reduce that risk. To prevent
a credit crunch, a new banking package is currently being discussed, which is to inject
new capital into the banking sector. In a situation where banks cannot raise new capital in
the markets, many countries have chosen to inject capital into the banking sector by
launching government rescue packages in accordance with the conclusion of the
European Council summit on October 15 and 16.
Designing a package with the purpose of avoiding a credit crisis is a complex issue.
However, a number of principles have to be followed: i) The aim is only to avoid an
actual credit crunch in Denmark; ii) only well-run banks should gain access to temporary
financing; and iii) the government should get a return that is as close as possible to a
market-based return in proportion to the capital injection made by the state.
Structural Issues
The Danish economy has been through a long period of significant growth in production
and employment and favorable conditions for public finances, both on the revenue side
and regarding cyclical expenditures.
The reduction of public debt has been strong during the recent upswing, partly due to high
revenues from oil and gas production in the North Sea, pension yield taxation and the
corporate tax. The budget surpluses were historical high at 4½-5 percent of GDP in 20052007 and the expected surplus of around 3 percent of GDP in 2008 is also higher than
expected under normal conditions.
As stated by staff future changes in demographics are one of the major challenges facing
the Danish economy. In the future the share of elderly people will increase, while at the
same time the labor force will shrink. This tends to put pressure on public finances, since
revenues from personal income taxes increase less than expenditures on health and
retirement pensions. The government has put forward a 2015-plan, including a long term
projection and fiscal policy objectives, to prepare for this challenge. The strategy has two
tiers; to reduce public debt in times with relatively favorable demographics and high
revenues from oil extraction, and to raise labor supply through structural reform.
The key targets in the government’s 2015-plan (presented by the government in 2007) are
sustainable fiscal policies and surplus on the structural balance all the way towards 2015.
Given the implementation of structural reforms that ensure a rise in unsubsidised
employment of 20,000 persons and unchanged average working hours until 2015, the
updated 2015-plan in Denmark’s Convergence Program 2008, practically fulfils the

5
central targets. The estimated structural requirements in order to meet the fiscal targets
are to improve public finances by approximately 0.8 percent of GDP. Despite the
financial turmoil, this has not changed compared to the 2015-plan (and the Convergence
Programme 2007).
A Labor Market Commission has been set up in order to come up with proposals for
structural reforms to meet the targets in the 2015-plan. As mentioned in the staff report
the Labor Market Commission recently released a number of proposals, including a
reduction of the duration of unemployment benefits. The Labor Market Commission is
expected to finish its work in the summer of 2009.
A Tax Commission has been established to work out models for a reform of the Danish
tax system. The aim of the reform is a notable reduction in labor income taxation,
including lower marginal tax rates. The tax reform is expected to help meeting the
structural policy requirements in the 2015-plan. The Tax Commission shall present its
proposals by early 2009. The tax freeze applies before and after the tax reform.
The selected issues paper provides for interesting analysis, but also shows that
quantitative estimates of the financing gaps hinge to a large extent on underlying
assumptions.
