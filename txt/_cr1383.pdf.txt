REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 19, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: A five-year burst in public investment, largely financed by buoyant oil revenue,
has transformed the country’s infrastructure. Roads, ports, and power supply have been
upgraded, and a number of prestige projects have been completed. Reducing poverty
and stimulating productive private sector activity remain urgent challenges. With
hydrocarbon revenue now possibly past its peak, priorities include strengthening fiscal
institutions, developing public services, and enhancing governance.
Risks: If global energy prices decline substantially, cutting revenue, government deposits
will be sufficient only to sustain projected levels of spending for two to three years.
Weak institutions, inequalities in income and opportunity, and low levels of educational
attainment could restrain growth and undermine political stability.
Medium-term framework: Pending review of the first phase of the 2008–20 National
Development Plan, the future role of the state in encouraging economic diversification
and poverty reduction remains unclear. No fiscal framework for the medium term has
been articulated and fiscal data lack essential compositional detail.
Developing public services: Attaining universal primary education will require a
substantial redirection of resources, underpinned by sustained political commitment.
Facilitating private sector development: Perceptions of a cumbersome and politically
protected business environment continue to impede foreign interest in nonhydrocarbon activity. Comprehensive governance reform may be the best way to
address this.
Meeting regional obligations: Although a substantial foreign currency deposit was
made into the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) in 2011, a sizeable proportion of
government financial assets is still held in overseas commercial banks, contravening
surrender requirements.
Producing and disseminating data: Serious shortcomings in data hamper surveillance
and hinder policy formulation. A commitment to regular publication and international
quality standards would stimulate long-delayed improvements.

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

CONTEXT
1.
Equatorial Guinea has the highest level of per capita income of SSA countries, but
ranks among the lowest in available social indicators. Government revenue, predominantly from
hydrocarbon extraction, is comparable in per capita terms to central Europe. 1,2 But the most recent
national poverty estimates for 2006 suggest that three-quarters of the population were then living
below the national poverty line.3 Less than half the population had access to clean drinking water.
2.
The first phase of the government’s National Development Plan (NDP), which aims at
emerging market status by 2020, has achieved a massive scaling up of public investment.
Roads, sea and air ports, and power generation have been transformed, and urban housing has
been expanded. A new center for public administration has been built on the main island, Bioko, and
a new city is being constructed on the mainland, Rio Muni. A number of other prestige projects have
also been completed including luxury facilities for the meeting of the African Leaders’ Summit in
2011 and football stadiums for the African Cup of Nations in 2012.
3.
Private sector commercial activity remains extremely limited outside the hydrocarbon
sector. Since the near demise in the 1970s of the country’s coffee, cocoa, and palm oil plantations,
few agricultural products are marketed. Fishing and sustainable timber exploitation is limited.
Manufacturing activities are very small in scale. In the private sector, more than half of the insured
labor force is employed in construction.
4.
The business climate is perceived as unwelcoming, and broader governance issues
continue to concern the international community. Unwieldy bureaucracy hinders investment and
often requires ministerial intervention. Limitations on civil society participation undermined
Equatorial Guinea’s unsuccessful candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
5.
Official projections imply that hydrocarbon production may now be in long-term
decline. 4 Output of gas derivatives rose to an equivalent of about 200 thousand barrels of oil per
day (bpd) in 2011, but current proven levels of reserves suggest that secondary hydrocarbon output
will now start to fall, except for a short burst later this decade. Meanwhile, primary oil production
appears to have peaked in 2008 at 350 thousand bpd.

1

“Hydrocarbon” production includes both crude oil and gas condensate production (classified as primary sector
output) and oil and gas derivatives, such as liquefied natural gas (secondary sector output).
2

In line with United Nations (World Population Prospects, 2010) the population in 2010 is estimated at 703,420.
Equatorial Guinea authorities use a population estimate of 1,622,000 for 2010. A new population census is planned
for 2013.

6.
The prospect of falling hydrocarbon revenues adds urgency to the case for a mediumterm fiscal framework. Although the overall fiscal accounts are currently close to balance, the
current level of the non-resource primary fiscal deficit—130 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP—will
not be sustainable over the medium term.5 To provide space for additional pro-poor current
spending, investment will need to be cut and non-resource revenue must rise.
7.
The 2013 budget proposes a small overall fiscal surplus on the basis of global oil prices
below $90 a barrel. Public investment is scaled down to about 20 percent of GDP (76 percent of
non-hydrocarbon GDP), while government current spending remains below 7 percent of GDP.
Membership in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) ensures a stable
monetary framework, with the discount interest rate at the central bank (BEAC) currently steady at
4 percent.
8.
Discussions covered similar ground to the 2011 Article IV consultations. In the interim,
the authorities have chosen not to follow staff advice to adopt a front-loaded fiscal adjustment in
2011, embark on a fundamental reform of public financial management (PFM), or develop a
comprehensive action plan to strengthen the business climate. However, they have requested
further IMF technical assistance (TA) on PFM and issued new decrees to help centralize revenue
collection and coordinate investment planning. Equatorial Guinea has also made a substantial
foreign currency deposit at the BEAC.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
9.
The hydrocarbon sector has continued to be the main driver of the economy,
accounting for about three-quarters of estimated GDP (Figure 1). Expanding output of gas
derivatives since 2007 has largely compensated for the onset of a trend decline in primary oil
production. Exports of hydrocarbons averaged US$12 billion during 2007–11, generating annual
government revenues of US$5 billion. Active exploration has raised expectations of further potential
gas fields for development.
10.
Although data deficiencies preclude any comprehensive assessment of the nonhydrocarbon economy, its average annual growth rate has clearly been very strong—probably
exceeding 15 percent—since 2007. Inflation rates persistently above the CEMAC convergence
criterion and some project bottlenecks are evidence of stretched capacity limits. The construction
sector has benefited from strong public investment; distribution, telecommunications, finance, and
housing are now becoming more firmly established as growth sectors.
11.
Public investment has recently been the mainstay of non-hydrocarbon activity. Annual
government capital spending has doubled in real terms since 2007 and currently accounts for about
35 percent of the estimated level of domestic demand (Figure 2). Although much of the contracting,
5

Revenues associated directly with hydrocarbon production are removed from all “non-resource” fiscal aggregates

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

materials and labor for infrastructure spending has been sourced overseas, the rapid expansion of
public investment has provided a sizeable boost to domestic construction and utility output. In
contrast, the agricultural sector—now mostly subsistence farming—appears to have remained
moribund, and the development of the fishing sector is not yet under way.
12.
Despite strong hydrocarbon exports, the external current account is estimated to have
been in sustained deficit in recent years (Figure 3). A large share of hydrocarbon earnings flows
to overseas parent companies, and high levels of investment by the public and hydrocarbon sectors
have induced substantial imports of capital goods and services. Although hydrocarbon sector
transactions have probably largely been financed by foreign direct investment, the external sector
will remain a potential source of vulnerability as long as the public sector continues to generate a
sizeable import bill.
13.
Equatorial Guinea’s external competitiveness within the CEMAC region— from where
many food imports are sourced—has been eroded by a rate of inflation consistently above
that of other member states. The inflation differential narrowed to 2.2 percent in 2011, but the
cumulative impact on the level of consumer prices relative to the rest of CEMAC over the last
decade reached 30 percent.6 The real effective exchange rate is estimated to have appreciated
18 percent in this period.
14.
The 2013 budget is premised on GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2013. With global oil
prices assumed to decline below US$90 a barrel, provision for capital spending in 2013 is set
16 percent lower in current prices than the original budget provision for 2012. Staff’s projections
assume that cash payments in 2012 and 2013 will be about 34 percent and 45 percent, respectively,
above the original levels of provision because of the underlying strength of work under way.

POLICY ISSUES
A. Anchoring and rebalancing fiscal policy
15.
The authorities heralded the successful scaling up of public investment under the first
phase of the NDP:


Upgraded infrastructure had generated new opportunities for private sector activity and raised
living standards. Fewer bottlenecks, better access to modern facilities, and lower costs had
already made doing business more predictable and attractive.



All this had been achieved in a fiscally responsible manner. External borrowing had been limited
to drawings of about US$1 billion from a US$2 billion credit line with China Eximbank. The fiscal
accounts had returned to surplus in 2011 in line with CEMAC convergence criteria.

16.
Staff noted nevertheless that the conduct of the public investment program (PIP) had
exposed the budget to high opportunity and legacy costs and had adversely affected
economic stability:


A number of elements of the PIP, particularly prestige projects, would involve substantial
continuing outlays that were unlikely to yield equivalent economic returns (Box 1). No evidence
was made available that project choices had been based on objective appraisal.



The scale and pace of the investment program had exposed Equatorial Guinea’s vulnerability to
external shocks. For instance, at the start of the 2009 global recession, a planned acceleration of
activity had to be sharply cut back because lower hydrocarbon revenue forced the authorities to
draw down public sector deposits. In the last five years, execution of government capital
spending had differed from plans by an average of 20 percent.



Although recourse to external borrowing during the infrastructure boom had been very limited,
and low current levels of government debt meant that there was no need to undertake a debt
sustainability analysis at this stage, fiscal buffers would be eroded if recent levels of public
investment were maintained.

17.
A presentation by staff of an alternative framework for fiscal policy that would reduce
future spending volatility, while allowing the government to make clear long-term choices
about investment and savings, provoked limited positive response from the authorities. The
framework, described more fully in Annex I, was anchored on a target path for the non-resource
primary balance that would establish and maintain adequate fiscal buffers and spread the use of
hydrocarbon wealth over time. In line with existing NDP documentation, the representative target
path—which underpins staff’s medium-term projections—assumes a substantial scaling down of
government capital spending over the rest of this decade, although less front-loaded than the draft
2013 budget. Current spending is assumed to rise over time as a share of non-hydrocarbon GDP,
primarily in order to improve provision of education, health, and other pro-poor services. The

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

revenue take from non-hydrocarbon activities is assumed to rise eventually to international ratios,
building on recent initiatives to improve customs collection and inhibit tax exemptions, as well as a
broader income tax base combined with tighter enforcement mechanisms.
18.
Staff highlighted that, on current oil price projections, the framework would produce
a small positive overall fiscal balance over the next three years, consistent with the mandatory
CEMAC surveillance criterion on the basic fiscal balance. Emphasizing that no decisions would be
taken on medium-term spending issues until completion of the review on the first phase of the NDP,
the authorities did not raise any specific concerns about staff’s projections, but reiterated their
additional long-standing objective to achieve a surplus of non-resource revenue over current
spending.
19.
Staff emphasized that external stability would be reinforced by commitment to a
prudent medium-term fiscal framework on the lines proposed (Box 2). Current account
imbalances and inflationary pressures would ease if government spending, particularly capital
investment, more closely reflected absorption and financing capacity. Adverse shocks such as the
“lower global growth scenario” in the October 2012 World Economic Outlook (WEO) could then be
readily accommodated (Annex 2). Over the medium term, fiscal adjustment would be crucial in
restoring the external current account to a sustainable level. 7
20.
Perceptions on the impact of the recent scaling up of investment on government
current spending differed widely:


The authorities noted that spending on health services had recently risen, and that the social
security system had increased its coverage for disadvantaged families. All children were required
to attend primary school, and the enrolment rates for 7-year olds had risen substantially.



Staff stressed however that the ratio of government current spending to GDP remained much
lower than in countries with similar levels of per capita income, or elsewhere in SSA, with limited
budget provisions for education and health. A firm political commitment to implementing
universal primary education might help mobilize resources in an area that was critical for both
current social policy and future labor force needs.



Staff also observed that some current spending has been poorly directed. For example, fuel
subsidies had been used to keep pump prices for gasoline and aircraft fuel fixed at 2007 levels,
at a cost, in 2011, of over 1 percent of GDP (Box 3). Additional government resources had been
committed to the sector by building retail outlets for the national oil company GEPetrol. While
welcoming the authorities’ studies of ways to phase out fuel subsidies for commercial users, staff
encouraged a more general unwinding of government involvement in petroleum distribution.

exceeded 80 percent of total
government expenditure in the period.
In 2011, based on preliminary data, physical infrastructure accounted for nearly 50 percent of capital
spending, with a focus on transport and electricity. The road network was extended; and the expansion
and modernization of airports and ports in Malabo, Bata, and other locations was continued. Large capital
projects completed in 2011 included the new city of Sipopo, involving a conference center; the
construction of a 6-lane highway; electrification and public lighting; and new monuments, squares, and
waterfront developments. Public administration absorbed around 22 percent of total capital expenditure,
including work on the “Malabo 2” district. About 18 percent of capital spending was spent on behalf of
“productive sectors,” including commerce, telecommunications, industry, energy, hydrocarbons, transport,
aeronautic, agriculture, hotels and tourism, and environment. Education and health accounted for about
3 percent of total capital spending.

Box 2. External Sector Vulnerabilities
Overall assessment: an
unsustainable external
position in the long run, but
not an urgent issue

Background. Despite a steady accumulation of current account deficits and
weakening competitiveness, Equatorial Guinea’s external position remains stable,
supported by ample official reserves and a steady inflow of foreign direct
investment (FDI). However, unless policies adjust, depletion of hydrocarbon
resources in the future threatens eventually to undermine external stability.
Potential policy responses. Lower levels of government capital spending and an
improved business environment would reduce current account deficits by cutting
investment related imports and strengthening competitiveness.

Current account:
vulnerabilities stemming from
public investment-related
imports and hydrocarbon
companies’ profit repatriation

Background. Despite large hydrocarbon exports, Equatorial Guinea has
accumulated current account deficits since 2006. The two major factors have been
investment-related imports and profit repatriation by hydrocarbon extraction
companies.
Assessment. Current account deficits are tightly related to the size and composition
of the fiscal expansion and the ownership structure of natural resource production.
But the ownership structure also ensures ready financing of the deficits by
hydrocarbon-related FDI inflows. When hydrocarbon resources decline, domestic
factors and external competitiveness will become much more important.

Real exchange rate:
overvalued, but limitations in
data and methodology
preclude realistic
quantification

Background. Using the external stability approach proposed by Bems and Carvalho
(2009)1, the large current account deficit and a low assumed exchange rate elasticity
would lead to an estimate that the real exchange rate is overvalued by about
60 percent.
Assessment. Although the Bems and Carvalho methodology takes into account
some important characteristics of resource-rich countries, it still has serious
shortcomings. Neither the domestic production capacity of non-resource sectors
nor profit repatriation by extraction companies is well addressed. Furthermore,
weak data seriously hinder any assessment. Therefore, it is difficult to assess with
any accuracy the magnitude of the real exchange rate overvaluation.

Capital and financial
account: stable in short term,
but vulnerable when
hydrocarbon resources decline

Background. Equatorial Guinea has received large amounts of FDI inflows, which
have been major sources of financing of current account deficits.
Assessment. Because of recent successful oil and gas exploration, stable FDI inflows
are expected in the medium term although their size will gradually shrink as
hydrocarbon resources are depleted. Meanwhile, little is known about other
financial transactions, because of data limitations.

Foreign exchange reserves:
ample usable external
resources

Background. Thanks to hydrocarbon wealth, Equatorial Guinea has accumulated
substantial foreign reserves in the BEAC and continues to hold sizeable foreign
currency deposits in commercial banks.
Assessment. The amount of usable external resources (BEAC official reserves +
government offshore savings) is about 8 months of imports.

Foreign assets and liabilities
position: no issues

Background. Equatorial Guinea’s external debt, more than 90 percent of which is
public debt, is small (about 9 percent of GDP).
Assessment. The government has no plans to take on additional external debt.
Therefore, neither external nor public debt is an urgent concern.

Figure 4. Equatorial Guinea: Governance and Business Climate
Equatorial Guinea has continued to score very poorly across a wide range of indicators of governance and the business
climate. Like much of the CEMAC region, it performs worse than most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and is
near the bottom of global rankings. Even in the relatively small number of indicators where Equatorial Guinea’s scores
have improved in recent years, the gains in other countries have generally been larger. The sample of business indicators
below compares Equatorial Guinea’s scores over time with average scores in CEMAC and SSA.
The number of days needed to start a business is four times as
large as the average for SSA (and increasing) and almost
twice that of CEMAC.

Box 3. Equatorial Guinea: Fuel Subsidies
Retail prices of refined fuel products have been fixed at current levels since February 2007. All refined oil
fuel products are imported. The government has recently built facilities for the national company, GEPetrol, to
distribute refined products as a competitor to Total Oil, which is currently the only bulk distributor of
petroleum products to the private retail sector.
The total cost of fuel subsidies was CFAF 104 billion in 2011 (1.3percent of GDP). The authorities are
considering a potential elimination of the subsidy for commercial users, who currently account for about
60 percent of total fuel consumption. Sales to private users of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene, and to foreign
and domestic companies for aviation jet fuel, all of which are subsidized, account respectively for the
remaining 25 and 15 percent.

21.
Staff suggested that deep-seated deficiencies in public financial management were
impeding progress toward a better allocation and use of government resources.8 The limited
integration of the PIP into the budgetary planning and execution processes had made it more
difficult to align the composition of budgetary outlays with plans, particularly when hit by external
or internal shocks, such as the drive to complete large projects in time for the 2011–12 international
events. Project appraisal has been limited, monitoring of spending has been stretched, little formal
provision has been made for consequential recurrent spending, and payments to contractors are
reported to have often been long delayed (although no arrears have been recorded in government
accounts). Staff also pointed to the absence of detailed information on budget execution, including
a functional or administrative breakdown of expenditure, as further confirmation of weaknesses in
monitoring and control mechanisms.
22.
The authorities refuted the implications of poor project selection and implementation.
They noted however that a new budget decree would involve the finance ministry more closely in all
planning and execution functions of the budget, as well as tightening up procedures for depositing
revenue with the treasury. Technical assistance from the African Development Bank would also

8

March 2011 (Box 4).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

accelerate the computerization of public financial management, which is currently the major
impediment.
Box 4. Equatorial Guinea: Recent Technical Assistance for Public Financial Management
Public financial management missions in May 2011 and September 2012 by AFRITAC (central) discussed
fundamental legal and regulatory framework issues and public accounting practices and made
recommendations on budget and project monitoring systems. Two follow-up technical assistance missions
are scheduled. Following a request from the authorities for a renewal of backstopping arrangements for
resident fiscal advisers, the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department is planning to conduct a diagnostic mission in early
2013.

B. Encouraging inclusive growth
23.
Diversifying the economy and addressing poverty were core motivations of the NDP,
but many fundamental policy issues remain unaddressed. Staff noted that making growth
inclusive requires a comprehensive approach to policy that encompasses addressing social needs,
developing human capital, and improving the challenging business climate to help create jobs.
Resuscitation of subsistence and commercial agriculture would also offer substantial potential to
raise household living standards and generate employment.
24.
Staff emphasized the importance of ensuring adequate competition in product
markets, encouraging a deeper financial sector, opening access to opportunities and
information, and addressing broader governance concerns. Government should not crowd out
the private sector by itself becoming involved in new commercial activities. An efficiently managed
rules-based approach to regulation that does not involve ministerial intervention offers the most
welcoming climate for business. Adherence to recent regional initiatives including on labor mobility
and trade barriers would contribute further.
25.
The authorities were unable to indicate how policy would evolve in the second phase
of the NDP (beginning in 2013) because of the ongoing review of the first phase. They noted
however that agriculture and fishing had already been accorded priority status in the NDP and that
pilot initiatives had been launched in education and health. A one-stop shop for investment would
also be introduced, but capacity limitations had slowed progress.
26.
There is considerable scope for an expansion of financial sector lending to the private
sector. The banking sector appears soundly based (Box 5) and a new, fifth bank—part of the panAfrican Ecobank group, which has a track record of small business support—is poised to begin
operations. The government is also closer to developing a loan guarantee scheme for small
businesses, which have experienced considerable difficulty obtaining loans in the past, reportedly
because of the owners’ inability to provide adequate business plans, perceived biases toward
companies working on government projects, and difficulties with contract enforcement. Staff noted
however that such issues were generally better addressed at source, or using market-based

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

incentives, because government guarantees tended to provide unwelcome opportunity for official
discretion and could result in large contingent liabilities.
Box 5. Equatorial Guinea: Financial Sector
The financial sector currently consists of four banks. Three of these have foreign parent companies,
whereas Banco Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial (BANGE) is owned by the government. A fifth bank, part of
the pan-African Ecobank group, is poised to start operations shortly. CCEI bank, a subsidiary of Afriland
First bank, accounts for about 70 percent of total credits and 45 percent of total bank assets. Societe
Generale and BGFI bank share about 13 and 11 percent of total credits, respectively. Microfinance is
insignificant.
Financial depth in Equatorial Guinea is very low. The ratio of bank credit to the private sector to nonhydrocarbon GDP was about 35 percent in 2011 and the density of borrowers from commercial banks is
about one tenth of the SSA average. The construction sector accounts for more than 60 percent of bank
credits. Private companies are the primary source of bank funds (about 60 percent of total bank deposits).
The banking sector appears sound, with a capital ratio averaging about 18 percent, and an average nonperforming loan rate of about 6 percent. Liquid assets account for about 40 percent of total assets. Banks
with a higher share of non-performing loans hold relatively higher shares of liquid assets.

27.
Staff also highlighted the importance of transparency, accountability, and the
enforcement of law as preconditions for a vibrant private sector. A major effort, involving all
levels of government, is required to answer the international community’s concerns regarding the
use of public resources, independence of civil society, human rights, and open access, as well as
labor restrictions and hold-ups to business operations (Figure 4). The authorities observed however
that external observers failed to give due weight to the national values and expectations that
underpinned their methods of operation, including in the business sector, and to the progress that
had already been made in difficult circumstances. They also noted developments in two areas:


An action plan is under way to reactivate Equatorial Guinea’s candidacy in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). To facilitate civil society involvement in monitoring
hydrocarbon activities and revenues, consultants would be advising on updating legislation,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

training programs are being provided, and an information center is planned. In response to
staff’s suggestions that regular reports of resource revenue would quickly advance the
transparency agenda, the authorities said that these had not yet been considered in the absence
of engagement with the EITI.


Extensive work is being undertaken in conjunction with the CEMAC financial authorities to set up
and enforce mechanisms to prevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism.
Staff noted particularly in this respect the importance of implementing international standards
on politically exposed persons, cross-border transportation of currency and bearer bonds, and
an operational finance intelligence unit.

C. Meeting regional obligations
28.
A large proportion of Equatorial Guinea’s external financial assets is still held in
foreign commercial banks rather than the BEAC. This contravenes the CEMAC region’s foreign
currency surrender requirements and reserve-pooling arrangements. The government held the
equivalent of over CFAF 2140 billion in foreign currency deposits in overseas banks at end-2011,
compared with holdings of CFAF 800 billion at the BEAC. However, the authorities noted that
Equatorial Guinea had transferred CFAF 474 billion to the BEAC in 2011 (bringing BEAC deposits
close to the level of M2 deposits) and that other oil-producing countries in the region also held
assets outside the BEAC.
29.
Staff noted two additional adverse consequence of Equatorial Guinea’s continued
deposits in commercial banks rather than the BEAC. First, because overseas deposits are not
reported in budget documentation (and neither is the Chinese Eximbank loan) the fiscal and
financial accounts are not fully reconciled. Second, Equatorial Guinea’s potential leadership in
attempts to reform the BEAC reserves framework (and particularly the remuneration of long-term
savings) is compromised by not following current obligations.

D. Compiling and publishing reliable data
30.
Staff observed that macroeconomic and socio-demographic statistics are still deficient
and hamper surveillance. Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals cannot be
effectively monitored. Statistical capacity is very low. Deficiencies are manifold and deep-rooted:


National accounts statistics are very poorly grounded (using a 1985 base year) and lack the
minimum indicators necessary to track annual developments in the non-hydrocarbon economy.
Official data for economic growth are based on computations and projections, rather than
survey evidence.



The reliability of price statistics is unclear in the absence of an up-to-date household survey and
adequate capacity to monitor price changes across the country.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA



Fiscal data are only available on a cash basis; there is no functional breakdown; and there is no
full reconciliation with financial data.



Balance of payments data do not reflect transactions actually recorded by customs or the
banking sector.



Several planned surveys have been delayed. Poverty and population data have been challenged.

31.
Noting that even the most basic data are very hard for the public to access, staff
suggested that a clear publication timetable for critical macroeconomic and sociodemographic data would both assist transparency and act as a powerful incentive to improve
statistical capacity. Another important step would be to implement the decree establishing an
autonomous national statistics institute. Technical support on statistics and administration would be
available under the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) but, as in previous years, the
authorities had not responded to staff’s encouragement to join.
32.
The authorities noted that the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and
Public Investment is undertaking an exercise to rebase the national accounts and improve the
coordination of economic data within government. The World Bank has posted a long-term
statistics expert to provide assistance and training. The nearly-completed demography and health
survey and the four major surveys planned for 2013 (including the population and housing
censuses) would provide much-needed additional source data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Equatorial Guinea has laid down some important physical foundations to advance
toward its goal of emerging market status. The upgraded national road network and new ports
will provide better access to commercial opportunities, the enhanced power infrastructure will
reduce costs and production bottlenecks, and modern public buildings and housing will raise
administrative and living standards. Costs and wastage have been high, however, because of
limitations in oversight and pressure for prestige projects.
34.
A clear fiscal anchor is needed to help insulate the economy from oil price volatility
and improve the allocation and efficiency of expenditure over time. Fiscal policy should be
guided by a medium-term target path for the non-resource primary balance that establishes fiscal
buffers sufficient to maintain expenditure commitments even when oil prices fluctuate. Some
accommodation may need to be sought in CEMAC fiscal guidelines. The target path should reflect
the expected future profile of hydrocarbon revenue, the likely efficiency of domestic investment, and
immediate poverty and development needs, as well as short-term absorption and financing
considerations. A first step would be to recast the 2013 budget proposals to highlight the nonresource primary balance and the implications for the overall fiscal balance of alternative
hydrocarbon production and price profiles.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

35.
External stability would be reinforced by commitment to a prudent medium-term
fiscal framework on the lines proposed. Analysis shows that the real effective exchange rate is
above its equilibrium level (although the magnitude is uncertain), pointing to an erosion in external
competitiveness. Lower levels of government capital spending, in conjunction with improvements to
the business climate, will be critical in addressing this.
36.
Broad guidelines should be set under the NDP for the composition of spending and
revenue that would underpin the target path for the non-resource primary balance. Both
expenditure rationalization and non-resource revenue mobilization will be required over the
medium term. Expenditure should be rebalanced to provide adequate room for a higher level of real
current spending, and revenue might be enhanced by improving customs collection and broadening
the base and efficiency of income tax (including limiting tax holidays and other exemptions).
37.
In the next phase of the NDP, improving the business climate and enhancing social
services will need to take center stage. This will require decisive and sustained action by
government to overcome its negative reputation for poor governance and to overhaul its weak
infrastructure for delivering education, health and personal services. Priorities in capital spending
should also switch from infrastructure toward education and health.
38.
To enhance and extend business opportunities, bureaucratic procedures should be
streamlined, and scope for political intervention should be curtailed. The proposed one-stop
shop for investment would reduce some of the costs and delays that currently hinder business
development. Problems that have slowed loan availability to small enterprises should, where
possible, be addressed at source by enhancing training and business services. While local
employment is a primary objective of economic regeneration, regulations that restrict the ability of
local or foreign companies to recruit adequate personnel should be avoided.
39.
Direct public sector involvement in commercial activities should be avoided. “Picking
winners” by governments is rarely successful, particularly where commercial experience is limited
and political connections can distort judgment. The government’s comparative advantages lie
instead in establishing infrastructure, ensuring a welcoming and predictable business climate, and
supporting labor force enhancement.
40.
A fast-track approach to making high-quality primary education available to all should
be considered. Ambitious targets should be set for the number and quality of teachers, adequate
financial resources should be committed, and programs should be developed to encourage student
enrollment and attendance.
41.
Equatorial Guinea should meet its obligations to the BEAC. The government’s foreign
currency deposits should be held in the BEAC rather than in commercial banks. Equatorial Guinea
would then be in a stronger position to take a leadership role in discussions about the future of the
reserves framework.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

42.
A strong political commitment to transparency could accelerate the production of
basic economic and social statistics. Priority should be given to: developing and publishing
evidence-based annual national accounts and balance of payments statements; reporting
government expenditure commitments and arrears and all financial assets and liabilities; and
conducting, in 2013, population and agricultural censuses and household and enterprise surveys.
These should be reinforced by a clear publication timetable for economic data. Regular publication
of reports on oil revenues would demonstrate Equatorial Guinea’s continued commitment to EITI
principles.
43.
IMF staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Low
Spillovers from Europe and/or
unresolved US fiscal issues
could lead to a marked and
perhaps sustained softening
of global growth, which in
turn would lead to sustained
lower hydrocarbon prices.

Medium
Equatorial Guinea is highly dependent on hydrocarbon exports.
Hydrocarbons account for about 75 percent of GDP, 98 percent of
goods exports, and 90 percent of fiscal revenue.
Experience suggests that EG authorities may prune capital
spending sharply in response to lower hydrocarbon revenues. This
would impact immediately on the construction sector.
However, large international reserves provide buffers that could
support spending for up to three years if the authorities wish to
use them.

Continuous loose fiscal
policy

High
Capital spending has recently
been on an unsustainable
trajectory, although the
authorities aim to keep an
overall fiscal balance and staff
expects capital spending to
turn down.
Since 2009, the government
has failed to increase fiscal
buffers despite their vast
hydrocarbon revenues.

High
Further scaling-up of capital spending would accentuate the
strains on administrative and absorptive capacity, with
consequential impacts on project selection, inflation,
competitiveness, imports, and scope for corruption.
Worsening competitiveness will further inhibit development of the
non-hydrocarbon sector over the medium term.
Fiscal buffers would be further eroded.
Introducing a fiscal framework anchored on the non-resource
fiscal balance would discipline expenditure practice and reduce
risks.

Widening inequalities

Annex I. Anchoring Fiscal Policy: Curbing Expenditure
Volatility and Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
With limited proven hydrocarbon reserves, the authorities need to adopt a fiscal strategy that
balances near-term development needs against finite resources, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability and boosting financial management performance. The government
has in the past considered different mechanisms to promote fiscal sustainability, such as using
cautious oil price projections in budget planning and financing current expenditure only with nonhydrocarbon taxes. It has also looked at the implications of a permanent income framework and the
establishment of a sovereign wealth fund. But these considerations have not yielded a firm
framework that would guide fiscal policy over a sustained period.
In practice, two main guiding principles seem to have underpinned recent budget proposals.
First, there has been a strong desire to follow the spending imperatives set out in the National
Development Plan 2008–20 and to meet construction deadlines for major international events.
Second, budget proposals have sought to deliver at least an overall fiscal surplus, in line with
CEMAC convergence commitments on the basic fiscal balance.
To insulate public spending from volatility in oil revenue requires fiscal mechanisms that can
establish and maintain strong fiscal buffers and effectively manage oil revenues over time.
Without such fiscal buffers, government spending is likely to rise and fall with global price
developments, thus amplifying economic cycles at home and impeding progress toward inclusive
growth.
Equatorial Guinea currently has fiscal buffers sufficient to protect the budget from oil price
volatility over a three-year horizon, provided the fiscal consolidation projected in this report’s
baseline framework is undertaken. Staff estimates based on value-at-risk analysis suggests that
resources at the BEAC, together with the government’s foreign currency deposits in commercial
banks, provide sufficient liquidity to offset the impact of most conceivable fluctuations in oil prices
for this period. The minimum required size of the stabilization buffer is estimated by simulating

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

stochastically the impact of different oil prices on the fiscal accounts using a specified framework of
the oil production profile and fiscal regime.1 The oil price is simulated 5,000 times.
A fiscal sustainability analysis based on the framework described in recent IMF work on
resource–rich developing countries2 suggests there is sufficient fiscal room to maintain a
moderately high level of investment over the medium term without jeopardizing fiscal
stability. The analysis follows the steps outlined below:
Establish a medium-term path for spending consistent with a declining path for the non-resource



primary fiscal deficit (NRPD). Having completed the first phase of the NDP aimed at building up
basic infrastructure, the authorities can now accommodate a significant scaling-down in capital
spending in 2012–20. This would also bring capital spending more in line with the country’s
execution and absorption capacity and allow room for growth in current spending. The
illustrative assumption incorporated here is that the level of capital spending will halve relative
to non-hydrocarbon GDP over the next four years, establishing a baseline scenario that permits
a phased, yet significant, fiscal consolidation during the second half of the NDP, reducing the
NRPD from 135 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2013 to 36 percent in 2020. This would also
keep net financial assets positive and help to secure external stability.
Determine the impact of both the scaling up of investment and subsequent consolidation on real



growth. It is expected that the scaling up of investment in 2008–12 will have a positive impact on
the productivity of the private sector and boost short-run growth. This will limit the direct
negative impact on activity of the consolidation that is assumed to follow. The negative impact
will also be limited because foreign companies and labor have been responsible for constructing
much of the public investment. Real non-hydrocarbon growth is assumed to rise to a peak of
5.0 percent in 2023 and then slow down to a long-term growth of 3.0 percent.

1
Oil prices are modeled using an AR(1) process in logarithms. The current year’s oil price is estimated using the
previous year price and a random variable (ε ): log(Pt)=α + β log(Pt-1)+ ε t, where α=0.058, β=0.90, and ε~N(0,0.29).
These parameters were estimated using data from the BP Statistical Review 2011 covering 1969–2010 controlling for
a possible regime change in the oil market in 1974.



Estimate the long-run level of the NRPD needed to maintain a given level of wealth.3 After 2020, it
is assumed that the NRPD would decline gradually to reach a level of just over 1 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP, which would be consistent with maintaining total net wealth at about
100 percent of non- hydrocarbon GDP in 2030. Interest rates are assumed to average
6.5 percent, 1 percent above the long-run growth of nominal GDP (Figure I.1).

3

Net wealth is defined as the sum of the present value of future oil revenue plus net financial assets. For a formal
definition of the net wealth-stabilizing level of the NRPD, see the annex to “Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for
Resource-Rich Developing Countries” (IMF Policy Paper; August 24, 2012).



Calibrate assumptions of fiscal policy to ensure consistency with the fiscal sustainability framework
assumed. An illustrative fiscal composition is presented in Table I.2. Reflecting lower levels of
revenue in the long term, because of the depletion of hydrocarbon wealth, government capital
spending declines to around 5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP. This is similar to the ratio
observed in other high-income economies and would follow more than two decades of rising
government capital stock. At the same time, primary current expenditure is expected to increase
(to around 25 percent of non-resource GDP), driven by the higher costs of utilizing the
enhanced capital stock and improved provision of social services. A substantial increase in nonresource revenue mobilization (almost doubling from 15 to 30 percent of non-hydrocarbon
GDP) will be required to cover this level of expenditure when hydrocarbon revenues fall. This
would likely entail a comprehensive approach to revenue mobilization that would include
reforms of tax administration and enforcement aimed at increasing tax collection (the process is
already starting in the customs area), the centralization of tax authority and collection, and the
curtailment of tax exemptions (in line with the 2013 budget decree) and broadening the income
tax base.

As the exercise above demonstrates, while a gradual consolidation of capital expenditure that
would allow completion of the NDP can be consistent with fiscal sustainability, it would entail
drawing down a majority of the public sector’s existing wealth. This policy, if coupled with
reforms aimed at strengthening public financial management and transparency, could transform
financial wealth into growth-enhancing physical and social infrastructure. Sustainability of the fiscal
position in the long run would also require a pronounced increase in non-oil revenues.

Annex II. Downside Scenario Analysis
In the main projections in this report, oil prices are assumed to decline only modestly in real
terms over the medium term, consistent with a steady but modest recovery in the world
economy as outlined in the baseline case of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), October
2012. However, among the more prominent global risks identified in the WEO, is a “lower global
growth” scenario that would depress demand for commodities over a sustained period and lead to
substantially lower commodity prices, particularly for energy. By 2016, global oil prices would be
30 percent below the levels of the baseline case.
The implications of the “lower global growth” scenario for the economy of Equatorial Guinea
would be substantial, given the dependence of both government revenue and foreign
currency earnings on hydrocarbon production. Indeed, if government spending were to follow
the same path as in the main projections in this report, simulations suggest the reduction in
hydrocarbon receipts would drain the bulk of government savings and official reserves within five
years, with both falling to about 20 percent of their 2012 levels. In contrast, provided confidence was
maintained, the impact on GDP would be relatively small because, outside the hydrocarbon sectors,
the economy is not directly dependent to any significant extent on world demand, investment, or
transfers, and lower energy prices would buttress investment and consumption.
Assuming, however, that the government would in fact cut spending in response to the lower
oil revenue , the drain on savings and reserves would be considerably reduced—but at a cost
in terms of domestic demand and hence GDP. In the example below, expenditure is reduced in
parallel to the fall in prices, but less than proportionately. This mitigates the potential impact on
GDP, but is not enough to preserve fiscal balance. Under such a scenario, government savings would
maintain about 70 percent of its 2012 levels without a substantial decline of real GDP growth.

Safeguard Assessments: The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional

central bank. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on July 6, 2009.
The findings of this assessment indicated that implementation of previous safeguards
recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control was limited, and that
the changing risk profile of the BEAC foreign exchange holdings required further actions to
strengthen safeguards at the BEAC. Subsequent to the revelation of Paris office fraud, a series of
initial measures and longer-term reforms was agreed between the IMF and the BEAC in order to
continue with country programs. The BEAC adopted an action plan for 2010 with the aim of
reforming its own governance and strengthening key safeguards. Implementation delays and
additional safeguards concerns raised in the first special audit triggered a suspension of IMF
disbursements to CEMAC countries from June to early August 2010, after which they resumed. In
addition, since 2010, the BEAC and the IMF agreed on additional periodic measures to address the
weaknesses highlighted by the special audit and to strengthen governance bodies. A recent
safeguards monitoring mission identified a new series of rolling benchmarks to address outstanding
safeguards concerns going forward.

XI.

Exchange System: The regional currency is the CFA franc. From 1948 to 1999, it was pegged

to the French franc. Since the euro was introduced in 1999, it has been pegged to the euro at the
rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. A 2007 temporary ministerial order requires
authorization of the General Directorate of Banking prior to rapid money transfers abroad by nonbank financial institutions.

XII.

Article IV Consultations: Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV

consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the
Executive Board on April 22, 2011 (Press Release No. 11/234).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 12, 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. National
accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of payments data are all deficient in quality,
timing, and coverage. A decree to establish an autonomous National Statistics Institute has not been
followed through and staff vacancies in the General Directorate of Statistics have not been filled. Poor
centralization of information between the island and continental regions is also an issue. Limited use
has been made of technical assistance.
National Accounts: National accounts are constructed by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC)
as part of their regular Monetary Programming exercise. They are based largely on estimates, without
the benefit of survey information except in the hydrocarbon sector. The current base year is 1985. An
exercise is under way by the General Directorate of Statistics, supported by the World Bank resident
adviser, to compile complete accounts for 2006 and 2007. The initial outcomes are expected to be
available in early 2013. A demographic and health survey was conducted in 2011 and is currently
being processed. A population and housing survey, a household survey, an employment survey, and
an agricultural survey are planned for 2013.
Price statistics: Compilation of the official CPI resumed in January 2009, with data collected in five
major cities. However, a number of deficiencies remain, including outdated weights and composition
of the basket of goods and services, and gaps in the time series corresponding to the period for
which data was not collected (June 2005 – February 2006, and 2008). Imputations for missing data do
not always reflect underlying trends. In general, the CPI tends to underestimate inflation.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide budget execution data to the African
Department, but these are limited in detail (with, for example, a poor delineation between capital and
current spending and no functional classification) and are not fully reconciled with the monetary
accounts. The fiscal data are not subject to any internal process of verification because internal and
external audit capability remains weak. The authorities are discussing with IMF FAD their request for
TA contracts covering recruitment and backstopping for three residential advisors for public finance,
budgeting, and accounting. Gains in transparency were made temporarily through the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative process, with a reconciliation report posted on the World Bank
website in March 2010 that included information on state owned oil companies.
Monetary statistics: The accuracy of monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border
movements of BEAC-issued banknotes among CEMAC member countries. About 60 percent of
banknotes issued in Equatorial Guinea by the BEAC national directorate circulate in Cameroon and
only 26 percent remain in the country, while currency in circulation in Equatorial Guinea includes
some 18 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and as much from Gabon.
Balance of payments: Although the BEAC produces balance of payments data for its monetary
programming exercise, they are in general not derived from records of current stocks or flows and are
not fully consistent with other datasets. Statistics are largely constructed from estimates rather than
actual financial and customs records, even though information on the hydrocarbons sector is available
to some parts of the government and customs data have improved since the implementation of the

through 2010. The authorities agreed to submit CPI data for the IFS publication and STA is
communicating with the authorities regarding the procedure. The BEAC reports monetary, interest
rates, and exchange rate statistics for publication in the IFS, but delays are persistent (currently the lag
is about three months). Balance of payments data are not submitted to STA for publication in the IFS
or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The latest year for which balance of payments data are
available is 1996. Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA for publication in the IFS or the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Equatorial Guinea
On January 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea. 1
Background
Driven by hydrocarbon extraction, which accounts for about three-quarters of estimated gross
domestic product (GDP), Equatorial Guinea has the highest level of per capita income in subSaharan Africa. Over the last five years, a burst in public investment under the 2008–20
National Development Plan (NDP), largely financed by hydrocarbon revenue, has upgraded
transport and power infrastructure and established several national prestige facilities. The
resulting stimulus to construction is estimated to have helped raise average growth rates in the
non-hydrocarbon sector to about 15 percent.
Reducing poverty and generating sustained productive private sector activity remain urgent
challenges. The most recent poverty estimates suggest that three-quarters of the population
were living below the national poverty line in 2006. Reflecting high government sector demand
and limited production capacity, inflation has remained above the regional convergence criterion
(3 percent), eroding external competitiveness.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
Higher oil prices restored the overall fiscal balance to a small surplus in 2011 despite
government capital spending levels that continued to exceed non-hydrocarbon GDP. The
external current account also improved, but remained in deficit because of high imports of
capital goods and hydrocarbon earnings to overseas parent companies. The external deficit
was largely financed by foreign direct investment. The government deposited CFAF 474 billion
at the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and other government foreign currency deposits,
held at commercial banks in contravention of regional surrender requirements, fell sharply.
Perceptions of an unwelcoming business climate continue to deter investment in the nonhydrocarbon sector and broader governance issues remain of considerable concern to the
international community. Limitations on civil society participation undermined Equatorial
Guinea’s unsuccessful candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Macroeconomic and socio-demographic data are also deficient in quality, timing and coverage,
and even the most basic data are very hard for the public to access.
With hydrocarbon production now past its peak, according to official projections, the outlook for
GDP is slow or negative growth over the medium term. To address fiscal and external
sustainability concerns, fiscal policy will need to target a declining path for the non-resource
primary fiscal deficit, which stood at 130 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2011. There
should nevertheless be room for higher pro-poor current spending because government
investment is expected to be significantly lower in the next phase of the NDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, despite substantial revenues from oil, natural gas, and
derivative production, reducing poverty remains an urgent challenge. Accordingly, Directors
encouraged the Equatorial Guinea authorities to improve policy frameworks and undertake
further reforms in a variety of areas to promote inclusive growth and bolster the business
environment.
Directors considered that the adoption of a transparent medium-term fiscal framework would
anchor spending decisions in the face of oil price volatility and the expected decline in
hydrocarbon production. They recommended targeting a path for the non-resource primary
balance that would establish fiscal buffers and reflect financing and absorption constraints. In
this context, Directors saw the need to reduce public investment levels, rebalance public
spending toward social programs, better target subsidies, broaden the revenue base, and
enhance tax collection. More broadly, they encouraged the authorities to strengthen public
financial management.
Directors agreed that scaling down public works after the recent surge would safeguard
external stability. They observed that infrastructure-related imports are a major factor in the

3
high deficit in the external current account. At the same time, the pressure on domestic
demand has kept inflation rates above those in other Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC) member countries, leading to a substantial appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate and a loss of external competitiveness.
Directors welcomed Equatorial Guinea’s recent contributions to the regional pool of official
foreign exchange reserves, but noted that the bulk of the government’s foreign currency
deposits remains outside the BEAC. They urged the authorities to hold these deposits at the
BEAC to comply with the monetary union’s surrender obligations.
Directors underscored that improving the business climate is critical to fostering private sector
participation in the economy and broad-based growth. They called for stepped up efforts to
strengthen governance and improve workers’ skills and health. Promoting greater access to
credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises should also be a priority. Directors looked
forward to Equatorial Guinea’s reinvigorated efforts to participate in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Noting the persistent inadequacy of economic statistics, Directors encouraged the authorities to
participate in the General Data Dissemination System and establish a publication timetable for
macroeconomic data.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Yambaye, Alternate Executive Director for
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
January 11, 2013
On behalf on my Equatorial Guinean authorities, I would like to thank staff for the
fruitful dialogue held in Malabo during the 2012 Article IV Consultation. My appreciation also
goes to management, for the continued support of the Fund to the development efforts the
authorities are undertaking. My Equatoguinean authorities are especially thankful of the Fund’s
valuable technical assistance (TA) which has benefitted Equatorial Guinea in recent years.
Recent Economic Developments
Economic development in Equatorial Guinea remains mostly driven by the oil sector,
notably by gas derivatives, which partly compensate for the sharp decline experienced in
primary oil output. Robust investment in the construction and infrastructure-related sectors also
contribute to economic activity. As a result, real GDP which grew by 4.9 percent in 2011 is
estimated to have decreased to 2.5 percent in 2012, with a decline of about 1.7 percent,
projected for 2013, mostly due to lower output in the hydrocarbon sector. Inflation has
remained stable at single digit, although above regional average, as a result of intense
construction activities and the related increased domestic demand. The external current account
remains in deficit, mainly due to high level of imports of capital goods and services.
As regards fiscal policy, the focus has been to use revenue from oil to build and upgrade
basic infrastructure. The infrastructure created and upgraded has generated new opportunities
for private sector activity and raised living standard. As staff note, the public investment
program has been undertaken in a fiscally responsible manner, with limited external borrowing.
As a result, the fiscal accounts have returned to surplus in 2011, in line with CEMAC
convergence criteria.
With the culmination of the first phase of the National Development Plan (NDP) (20082012) mainly focused on putting in place the basic infrastructure that would support economic
diversification, attention is now to tighten policy targets. Thus, the volume of public investment
is planned to be scaled down to 2010 levels, as contemplated in the 2013 budget framework,
focusing on economic diversification and social sectors development.
For the medium-term, in view of the decreasing available revenue and needed urgent
actions to productive and social sectors, my authorities are contemplating a more conservative
spending program that is closely adaptive to broad base growth. In this regard, the authorities
are giving full consideration to the staff’s advice and recommendations. However, a major issue
is weak capacity in fiscal administration. My authorities are addressing this issue with Fund
technical assistance and are hopeful that their request for renewal for the contract of the resident
advisor will be approved soon.

2

In the monetary and financial sector, memberships in the Bank of Central African
States (BEAC) and the pegged exchange rate regime have served the economy of Equatorial
Guinea well. Key fundamental financial indicators are sound. Additionally, limited exposure to
outside risky banking systems have also contributed to the resiliency of the sector. Nonetheless,
steps to enhance competitiveness will be ongoing. Although the financial system remains
healthy, further efforts are needed to increase private sector development and financing, while
maintaining a lower rate of None Performing Loans (NPLs), so as to further boost the non-oil
economic growth and deepen financial intermediations.
Outlook
Over the medium term, the authorities expect the growth rate to slow down, along with
the declining production activities in oil sector, together with the scaled down capital spending
in the construction sector. However, the authorities would note the accelerated pace to which the
first phase of NDP was implemented, and which have resulted in important outcomes, as several
of the desired social, economic and financial objectives are being accomplished. The authorities
are undertaking a review of the first phase of implementation, and lessons learned from that
exercise will help to improve on the implementation of the next phase of their development
planning. The hydrocarbon sector will continue to support the diversification initiatives at least
beyond this second phase of the strategy, which should make its objectives a bit more
achievable.
The authorities will pursue their efforts to reduce the non-oil primary deficit as the focus
of this second phase is to strengthen economic diversification away from resource sectors. Fiscal
targets are currently met through quarterly reviews of the budget and subsequent adjustments
when needed. Targeting expenditure on priority sectors, including public service provision,
poverty reduction initiatives will be improved. On the revenue side, efforts will continue
towards the broadening of the tax base and revenue collection, including better monitoring, with
the provision of taxpayer identification number, strengthening custom administration through
computerization, and the adoption of pre-shipment inspections. These, together with the creation
of a single unit in charge of large tax-payers should enhance non-resources revenue collection.
My authorities remain committed to pursue their efforts geared towards combating over
invoicing and tax evasion. They will also continue their efforts to strengthen capacity in the
fiscal sector with assistance from the Fund, the World Bank and the African Union.
Improving the business climate and external competitiveness, coupled with promoting
the private sector led growth, and reducing poverty constitute the main focus and key objectives
of the authorities’ next development phase. Structural reforms toward achieving such objectives
are being undertaking. Important emphasis is being placed on capacity building within the local
work force, together with efforts to improve access to credit, in addition to improving financial
and property legal framework. With regard to data shortcomings, the recent changes and
improvements within the Ministry of Planning and Statistics Department should help address the
issue.

3

Reducing poverty and improving the standard of living of the population remain major
objectives of the authorities. Much has been accomplished in the past few years and the data
referred to by the staff which is from 2006 do not reflect fully the progress that has been
achieved. Progress is continuing in all areas: education, health and importantly in infrastructure
building. My authorities agree that that much remains to be done and they intend to pursue their
efforts to improve the standard of living of the Equatoguinean population with determination.
Conclusion
Despite the many challenges, Equatorial Guinea has made considerable progress towards
achieving its development goals. Lack of readily available statistics constitutes one of those
challenges preventing a full appreciation of the progress achieved. While there are downside
risks to the economy due to its dependency on the hydrocarbon sector, there are also upside
opportunities. The hydrocarbon sector has supported the development of the country and the
authorities expect this sector to continue playing a vital role in future development, and enabling
the country to implement the required policies. Strengthening human capital, developing a
strong non-hydrocarbon sector, and creating a conducive environment for private sector
development constitute some of the upmost objectives presently at the authorities’ development
agenda.

Ministry of Finance and Budget
Number: 627
Malabo, February 28, 2013
COMMUNIQUÉ FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA ON THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATIONS
BY A MISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Republic of Equatorial Guinea would like to thank the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for its very useful economic policy advice in the context of the 2012 Article IV
consultations.
The government is aware that economic and social policy formulation is handicapped by the
absence of a system for the preparation, compilation, and dissemination of macroeconomic,
social, and demographic data. For that reason, the National Statistics Institute was recently
established and has already begun working on the preparation of the censuses and surveys
planned for 2013, including the population and housing censuses. Nevertheless, we
acknowledge that the paucity of data makes it is difficult to measure changes in the economic
and social indicators, as was discussed during the Article IV consultations.
The government would like to highlight the efforts made to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals and implement the National Economic and Social Development Plan
(PNDES), under which the infrastructure needed to develop the productive sector and
significantly improve the living conditions of the population was built during the first phase
from 2008 to 2012. Today, following the implementation of the PNDES, potable water and
electricity are in regular supply and telecommunications systems, social housing, a hospital
network, school buildings, hotels, convention centers, as well as road infrastructure, and
ports and airports of international standard have all been put in place.
The government remains committed to strengthening public administration management and
fostering transparency as well as to supporting productive and business development with a
view to generating sustainable economic growth over the medium- and long-term. Against
that backdrop, a referendum was held in 2011 to update the Basic Law of the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea, resulting in the creation of several important institutions such as the Court
of Auditors, the National Economic and Social Development Council, and the Office of the
Ombudsman. Further, with support from the World Bank, great strides have been made
towards accession to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI).

2
With a view to putting government finances on a stable and sustainable path, short-term
measures, for immediate implementation, have been taken to streamline public expenditure
and increase non-oil revenues. In parallel, work is continuing on several projects, including,
the recently launched “Strengthening Public Finances” project supported by the African
Development Bank, which has an important capacity-building component in addition to its
focus on computerization of the public sector. IMF Technical Assistance is also being
stepped up, a massive effort is underway to strengthen the capacities of public servants, and a
faculty of Public Financial Administration is being set up with support from the World Bank.
In relation to compliance with regional commitments, the government has asked the Bank of
Central African States (BEAC) to prepare a proposal to resolve the issue and facilitate
compliance with the CEMAC Agreements with respect to community reserves and bilateral
agreements signed with friendly countries with which the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
enjoys good economic relations and cooperation.
Concerning investments made during the first phase of the National Development Plan, we
welcome the IMF’s commendation on the creation and coming on stream of economic and
social infrastructure. However, we think it is inappropriate to talk about waste1 in this context
bearing in mind that the administration faces a factual technical capacity deficit in the areas
of awarding contracts and inspecting projects. In that regard, the government has established
a dedicated, independent entity to deal with the evaluation, design, monitoring, and
inspection of public works, which over time has been strengthening its project evaluation,
design, and monitoring capabilities. We are, therefore, confident and can affirm that the
government is moving in the right direction.
Taking into account the above observations, the government of the Republic of Equatorial
Guinea consents to the publication of the attached 2012 Article IV Report, together with this
communiqué.

Translation note: the word ‘despilfarro’ was used in paragraph 33 of the Spanish text provided to the
Equatorial Guinean authorities as a translation of the English word ‘wastage’. ‘Despilfarro’ can sometimes
imply a strong element of intent. An alternative translation could have been ‘desperdicio'.
