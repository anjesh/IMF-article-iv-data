INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation1
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the Democratic Republic of
Timor-Leste
Approved by Ray Brooks and Dhaneshwar Ghura
December 3, 2010

Key Issues and Recommendations:

1



Context: Petroleum-financed government spending supported double-digit growth in 2007–
09 and commendable progress was made in reducing poverty.



Growth prospects: in 2010 non-oil GDP growth is expected to slow to around 6 percent due
to the impact of adverse weather on harvests. Scaled up public investment will be a key
driver of growth in the medium-run, though there is uncertainty about the size, timing, and
quality of capital spending.



Focus: Discussions focused on how to manage the petroleum wealth to develop the non-oil
economy.



Appropriate pace of public spending growth: The government plans to fast-track
development by ratcheting up capital spending rapidly. The mission supported wellmanaged infrastructure investment but suggested a more-gradual-than-planned pace of
growth in capital spending while lowering capacity constraints.



External stability: Officially dollarized, competitiveness depends on business-enabling
reforms, raising labor skills, and a slower pace of government spending to contain
inflationary pressures.

The report is based on discussions during October 26–November 9, 2010, with Prime Minister
Gusmao, Finance Minister Pires, General Manager of the Banking and Payments Authority
Vasconcelos, State Secretaries of agriculture, commerce and tourism, and other senior officials, and
representatives of donors, the business community, and civil society. The team comprised
Messrs. Schule (head), Ochirkhuu, Ms. Sun (all APD), Mr. Cardoso (OED), Messrs. Rab, Suri (both
World Bank), and Kang (Asian Development Bank).

I. CONTEXT
1.
In its first eight years as an independent nation, Timor-Leste has made
commendable economic progress, though it still faces many development challenges.
About 40 percent of the population still lives in poverty and the 2010 Human Development
Report (based on 2009/10 data) ranked Timor-Leste at 120 out of a total of 169 countries
(Figure 1). Years of conflict have destroyed a large part of its infrastructure. However, the
country is blessed with natural resources, with offshore oil production starting in 2004.
Although its oil wealth is currently estimated at $24.3 billion or $22,000 per capita, and more
reserves such as the Greater Sunrise have been discovered, it is neither a major oil producer
nor an upper middle income country. It stands out as the most oil dependent country globally.
In 2009, petroleum income accounted for about 95 percent of total government revenue and
almost 80 percent of GNI.
2.
An overarching challenge for Timor-Leste is to manage petroleum wealth
effectively to raise growth and living standards on a sustainable basis. The 2010
Article IV Consultations took place against a backdrop of the authorities’ plans to fast track
development by scaling up public investment in infrastructure and human capital. The
government has outlined its strategy in a summary of the Strategic Development Plan (SDP)
for 2011–2030 (Annex 1). The authorities have been generally responsive to the Fund’s past
policy advice (Appendix Table 1).
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

The past three years saw rapid economic growth and reduced poverty. Improved
security following the 2006 civil unrest, higher oil-financed public spending, and a rebound
in agriculture from the 2007 drought have

poverty incidence from 50 percent in 2007 to
41 percent in 2009.
4.
Inflation largely reflected movements in international food and energy prices.
Annual CPI inflation fell sharply from 12 percent in mid-2008 to just 1 percent at end-2009,
and has since risen to 5.3 percent year on year in the September quarter of 2010. Domestic

4
price pressures have been rising and are
particularly high in some segments of the
economy, such as housing and construction, and
in the capital Dili where annual inflation reached
7.5 percent in September 2010. In each of the past
two years, wages in the public sector increased by
25 percent and, according to a provisional survey
by the Ministry of Finance, 9 percent in the
private sector in 2010.

The fiscal position strengthened in 2009. Sources:
APDLISC database.
Following a 130 percent increase in 2008, public
spending grew by a more moderate rate of 8 percent to $604 million in 2009, with capital
expenditure accounting for most of the increase. As a result, the non-oil fiscal deficit fell by
17 percentage points to 92 percent of non-oil GDP. For the first time, the deficit was financed
by $512 million withdrawals from the petroleum fund (PF) in excess of the $408 million
certified estimated sustainable income from petroleum (ESI). The ESI guides fiscal policy as
to the amount that can be withdrawn from the PF without depleting it over time (Annex 2).

6.
The original 2010 budget foresaw
continued moderate spending growth.
However, in June 2010, the authorities
introduced a supplemental budget that enlarged
this year’s spending envelop to $838 million, an
increase of almost 40 percent over actual
spending in 2009, largely financed by
withdrawals of $811 million from the PF. But
given procurement delays, particularly for
capital spending, staff suggest that 2010 cash
spending will be around $650 million, well
below the revised spending envelope.
7.
The current account surplus in percent
of non-oil GDP declined by almost half to
245 percent in 2009. Lower international oil
prices reduced oil earnings, recorded as income
on the balance of payments. Non-oil exports
such as coffee and tourism have remained
insignificant compared to oil. Merchandise
imports grew by 24 percent, reflecting higher
public spending and the economy’s limited
absorptive capacity.

The PF assets have accumulated substantially over the past 5 years to reach
$6.5 billion or about ten times non-oil GDP at end-August 2010. Owing to lower
international oil prices, petroleum-related revenue declined in 2009, but is expected to
recover to $2.1 billion in 2010. As a result, the overall fiscal surplus to non-oil GDP ratio is
projected to decline from 430 percent in 2009 to 240 percent in 2010.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The growth outlook remains positive, supported by social and political stability
and increased government spending.


Near term. GDP growth is expected to increase to around 7⅓ percent in 2011, driven
by government spending, which is projected to increase by almost 40 percent in 2011.
Activity in private construction and commerce is also expected to be dynamic, while
the recovery in agriculture remains gradual. Inflation is expected to average
4½ percent in 2010, and to increase to 6 percent in 2011.



Medium term. Scaled-up public investment will remain a key driver of growth in the
medium term, although its effectiveness may be limited by Timor-Leste’s weak
public financial management capacity and a disproportionally small size of the
private sector. As a result, annual non-oil growth is expected to re-accelerate in 2012
and to peak at 9¾ percent in 2013 (Figure 3).



Long term. Non-oil growth is to gradually converge to around 6 percent in the long
run, when the private sector will have to become the main driver of growth.

10.
However, large uncertainties surround the outlook. Oil revenues are sensitive to
volatile international oil prices and to interruptions in production. Domestically, there is
uncertainty about the size, timing, and quality of capital spending, especially for the medium
term. Moreover, the depth and pace of business-enabling reforms is difficult to predict.

6
Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities shared the mission’s positive assessment of the economy, but
expected double-digit growth rates. They projected a higher growth impact of public
investment and more private sector growth and noted that staff’s 2008–09 growth projections
were consistently below actual outturns. For 2010, the authorities agreed that the economy
would slow down, but could still approach a double-digit growth rate. The authorities
projected the economy to continue recording double-digit growth in the medium and long run,
with improving budget planning and execution. There was an agreement that any projections
are surrounded by large uncertainties given data constraints and a rapid change in the
structure of the non-oil economy. The authorities suggested that staff provide upper and
lower bounds of projections in the future pursuant to the conditions of Timor-Leste.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
The Pace of Public Spending Growth
12.
Pressing development needs call for more and better public spending. Petroleum
wealth provides a unique opportunity to transform Timor-Leste into a higher middle income
country. Following rapid growth in recent years, the level of public expenditure per capita
exceeds that of many other

projects need to be costed and
prioritized. The timing of large infrastructure projects should take account of Timor-Leste’s
institutional weaknesses, administrative capacity constraints, and limited absorptive capacity
of the economy, in particular due to the shortage of skilled labor and managerial capacity.
13.
The government’s fiscal projections foresee significant and front-loaded scaling
up of public investment and moderate growth in current spending.


For 2011, the draft budget presents an envelope of $985 million, an increase of over
50 percent from the spending expected by staff in 2010. However, such a large

7
increase may be challenging to execute and staff expect cash expenditure in 2011 to
grow at a slower pace and reach about $900 million. The draft budget foresees current
spending to grow moderately at 4 percent without taking account of the recurrent cost
associated with public investment. The government plans to limit withdrawals from
the PF to the 2011 ESI of $734 million. The remaining financing will come from nonoil domestic revenue and the government’s cash balance that has built up due to
under-execution of the budget in 2010.


In 2012–13, the authorities plan to increase public investment at an average rate of
about 30 percent, and to maintain this level in 2014–15. Without taking account of the
recurrent cost of capital spending, the government projects current spending to grow
by only 4 percent per year over 2012–15. Staff projects that the government’s
spending plans, if largely implemented, will require withdrawals from the PF
exceeding the ESI by an annual average of about $300 million. Staff expects a
significantly reduced overall fiscal surplus of 107 percent of non-oil GDP in 2015,
while the non-oil fiscal deficit averages 108 percent of non-oil GDP during 2012–15.

14.
Staff recommended a more moderate increase in spending, accompanied by
capacity building. Specifically:


Staff supports government investment in public infrastructure, health and education,
if such spending has a sufficiently high rate of return, is well managed and efficiently
and transparently implemented. Such investment would raise economic growth and
the standard of living of Timorese people.



However, present spending levels are stretching administrative capacities and creating
bottlenecks in the economy. Outsourcing can help ease administrative capacity
constraints, and staff encouraged the authorities to take full advantage of the expertise
provided by the World Bank, ADB, and bilateral donors. Yet, managing outsourcing
is a challenge in itself.



The ESI continues to serve as guidance for public spending that should anchor fiscal
policy over the medium term. The PF framework does not stand in the way of
financing worthy investment projects even if that implies temporarily spending in
excess of the ESI. Moreover, the move from using the low oil price forecast published
by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to using the average of EIA
low and reference case oil price1 has raised the ESI from $502 million in 2010 to
$734 million in 2011. The sum of domestic revenues and higher ESI, projected at
$835 million in 2011, forms a sustainable spending envelope for anchoring fiscal
policy. Specifically, given the need to build up capacity, staff advised an average

law. See The Estimated Sustainable Income Calculation and Selected Petroleum Fiscal Issues, IMF TA report
September 2010.

8
spending growth of around 10 percent annually over the medium term. This spending
path would entail that withdrawals from the PF are in line with the ESI levels on
average (Annex 2) over the medium term, with withdrawals from the PF below the
ESI in early years and above the ESI in later years.

15.
The key advantage of the staff’s alternative strategy is balanced and sustainable
economic growth. A more gradual increase in public investment–accompanied by
strengthening public financial management and accelerating reforms to improve the business
environment–would raise the efficiency of public investment and likely crowd-in private
investment. While GDP growth may be slightly lower than in the baseline in the short run,
economic development would become more balanced, with a stronger role of the private
sector, and yield higher long-run growth rates. Spending would be more aligned with the
absorptive capacity of Timor-Leste’s economy, exert less inflationary pressures, and
therefore reduce the risk of Dutch disease. The recommended spending path would also
maintain fiscal sustainability without reliance on oil revenues from Greater Sunrise.
Moreover, a binding medium-term budget constraint would help improve the budget process
by providing incentives for cost control, prioritization and better planning.
16.
The composition of public spending warrants close examination. The implications
of higher public investment for recurrent spending need to be carefully considered to ensure
that the scaling-up of public investment does not jeopardize fiscal sustainability. Furthermore,
the composition of public expenditure should take account of both economic and social
objectives. Within current spending, there is room to restrain wage growth, phase out
subsidies, including on rice and electricity, and to better target transfers to the most needy.
17.
The sustainability of public spending will also depend on the government’s
ability to realize the fiscal dividends of growth. Compliance with tax obligations is weak,

9
despite low statutory tax rates—10 percent on income, and 2½ percent customs duty and
sales tax. As a result, in 2009 the domestic tax to non-oil GDP ratio was only 8 percent. The
authorities are aware that tax collection is ineffective outside the petroleum sector. Staff
welcomed the governments’ ongoing efforts to strengthen the tax administration, including
by improving taxpayer registration, following through on non-compliance, and building tax
audit capacity. However, should these measures prove insufficient to reach a short-term
revenue target of $200 million (about 25 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012), higher tax rates,
and new taxes, including on land, should be considered. Conversely, new tax breaks in the
draft Investment Law go in the wrong direction and may prove ineffective in raising private
sector investment.
18.
The government is considering borrowing to finance large infrastructure
projects. Current development plans could be exclusively financed by withdrawals from the
PF. However, development partners may offer financing at concessional terms or at interest
rates below expected returns on PF assets, which could increase from the historical annual
return of 4½ percent with the planned change of PF investment strategy. Importantly, such
borrowing may come with the transfer of knowledge from these institutions. The mission
welcomed the authorities’ intention to channel borrowing through the budget subject to
parliament approval, and suggested that any borrowing should substitute for withdrawals
from the PF. Staff cautioned against borrowing from international financial markets.
19.
A first joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis (DSA) found that
Timor-Leste is at low risk of debt distress. A key assumption is that Timor-Leste would
resort to limited borrowings from development partners over the next 20 years, which carry
an average interest rate of not more than 4½ percent. The DSA also highlights Timor-Leste’s
sensitivity to petroleum price and production shocks. Therefore, to minimize the risk of debt
distress, it is advisable for Timor-Leste to take a gradual and moderate approach to
borrowing from development partners and be fiscally prudent.
Public Financial Management
20.
Staff commended the authorities’ ongoing efforts to improve the public financial
management (PFM) system and their resolve to address remaining weaknesses. The
recent fiscal ROSC and PEFA missions found solid progress albeit from a low base.
Nevertheless, despite of the government’s ongoing efforts, significant gaps remain in PFM,
notably little project assessment capacity, in particular on the capital side, weak planning and
implementation capacity in line ministries, a haphazard procurement process, and an absence
of internal audits (Annexes 3 and 4). The draft SDP is a welcome first step, but further work
is needed to improve medium-term budgeting and planning. Reforms should be prioritized
and consolidated while line ministries should participate fully in the PFM reform agenda.
The Ministry of Finance is taking steps in this direction through the development of a
Strategic Plan for PFM.

10
21.
The PF remains the cornerstone for managing the country’s oil-based financial
resources. The ESI has proven to be a useful benchmark to inform fiscal policy and public
discussion, while the PF framework is flexible enough to allow for spending above the ESI in
the long-term interest of Timor-Leste, subject to parliament approval. Staff welcomed that
planned revisions to the PF Law leave its basic principles—transparency, accountability, and
inter-generational equity—intact. However, some specifics as to what “justifies” withdrawals
from the PF in excess of the ESI, such as financial or social returns, would be helpful to
focus the public debate. Also, ambiguity as to who will be the manager of the PF is likely to
create uncertainty.
22.
Staff encouraged the authorities to address under-spending problems, in
particular regarding multi-annual capital projects and capacity building.


The first best approach would be to undertake comprehensive budget modernization
to enhance budget credibility, both in terms of quantity and quality, in line with the
recommendations of the Fund’s fiscal ROSC, PEFA, and treasury management
missions.



The second option, adopted by the government, of creating special investment funds
can be effective, if adequate yet flexible controls are established to prevent the funds
from taking on undesirable characteristics of extra-budgetary funds. Therefore, staff
welcomed the government’s commitment to allocate money into these funds through
the same budget rules as all other expenditures; to appropriate the use of fund
resources to an identified entity and project; and to link non-lapsing provisions to a
list of projects that have been approved through the normal budget process. The
government is also committed to keep resources in the treasury single account and
use the IFMIS system for the funds.

23.
The authorities’ efforts to improve cost and quality control and combat
corruption are commendable. The planned centralization of project evaluation and
approval in a new agency, which will report directly to the Prime Minister and be staffed by
well-qualified professionals, can help address the lack of administrative assessment capacity
and ensure more effective cost and quality control. At the same time, greater oversight and
transparency of project approval and monitoring could help reduce corruption.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities emphasized the need to scale up public investment quickly. They
noted that many years of conflict have left the country’s infrastructure in shambles. Given the
country’s stage of development, the state has to play a leading role in providing basic
infrastructure. Rehabilitating existing and building new roads, providing access to reliable
electrical power and clean water are seen by the authorities as a prerequisite to attract private
investment. The government is conscious of many difficulties and has been working

11
tirelessly to overcome capacity constraints. It has identified main investment priority areas, in
line with the Strategic Development Plan, and felt the urgency to act without delay in order
not to lose another generation.
25.
The authorities felt that front-loaded scaling up of public investment would be
consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability. Their position was that such spending
serves the long-run interest of the country even though it requires withdrawals from the PF in
excess of the ESI in the short run.


Ultimately, a vital private sector will need to become the source of jobs, income, and
fiscal revenue. However, without an essential public infrastructure in place, no such
economy is likely to emerge.



Once basic infrastructure is in place, large public spending can be reduced and
withdrawals from the PF can return to sustainable levels.



The current ESI does not capture potential revenues from the Greater Sunrise field, a
confirmed petroleum resource. Moreover, more natural resources might be discovered.

26.
The authorities felt that the composition of public spending reflects adequately
the country’s needs. Spending was increased rapidly in recent years to address the people’s
immediate social needs, laying the foundation of peace and security. Nonetheless, the
authorities thought that the mission’s recommendations of curbing wage growth, phasing out
rice and electricity subsidies, and better targeting transfers to the most needy are not
supported by the importance of maintaining overall stability and would have ramifications in
a post-conflict and fragile nation. They considered that now is the time to shift the focus to
public capital.
V. EXTERNAL STABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS
27.
Official dollarization has provided a strong nominal anchor. Dollarization has
served the country well and there is currently no obvious alternative. Running an independent
monetary policy would be extremely difficult given the absence of a well functioning
financial market and limited administrative capacity.
28.
Fiscal policy holds key to competitiveness and external sustainability. Standard
analysis of exchange rate misalignment is currently neither feasible nor very meaningful for
Timor-Leste. The lack of data on its nascent economy leaves little scope for econometric
techniques. The external current account balance is driven largely by oil and gas revenue,
with a small non-oil export sector, contributing only about 3 percent to BoP income. Against
this background, it is hard to ascertain a current account norm. The sustainability of the
current account in the medium-term is primarily dependent on fiscal policy (Box 1).

12
29.
Expediting business-enabling reforms is critical to enhance competitiveness and
promote private sector-led growth. Commendable progress includes the establishment of a
one-stop-shop for investors and the passage of the Transitional Land Law by the Cabinet
(though Parliamentary approval is pending). According to the World Bank’s Doing Business
Indicator, improving land access, easing business start-up, enforcing contract, and enhancing
access to finance are key interrelated areas to focus on. Staff welcomed the authorities close
cooperation with the World Bank in designing and implementing an action plan guided by
the recommendations of the Timor-Leste Diagnostic Trade Integration Study.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities agreed that dollarization has served the country well and
indicated that there are currently no plans to change the exchange rate regime.
However, they raised questions about the impact of dollarization on the competitiveness of
Timor-Leste relative to its neighboring countries.
VI. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY
31.
The financial sector remains at an embryonic stage of development, with
financial services reaching only a small portion of the population. Three foreign bank
branches dominate the financial sector, in addition to a small state-owned microfinance
institution and a newly established insurance company. Despite bank deposit growth
(30 percent in 2009), private sector credit has remained stagnant since 2005, with surplus
funds held mainly abroad, and the loan-to-deposit ratio is about 20 percent. The nonperforming loan to asset ratio has remained at 18 percent since 2008, but provisioning
remains sufficient.

32.
Staff suggested speeding up passage of key legislations and regulations to
stimulate financial sector development. Unclear property rights, in particular regarding
land ownership, and weak contract enforcement prevent efficient collateralization of loans.

13
The central bank law to safeguard Banking and Payments Authority’s autonomy and the antimoney laundering law were submitted for discussion by relevant Parliament committees.
33.
The authorities have continued to strengthen financial supervision. Close
coordination with foreign banks’ home supervisors is also warranted. Staff encouraged
continued efforts of data collection and analysis, and on-site and off-site supervision.
Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities indicated that commercial banks’ high lending rates of 15–
20 percent are disincentives for credit growth. They expressed interest in receiving
technical assistance to promote financial sector development.
VII. STATISTICS
35.
The availability, quality and timeliness of data continue to pose challenges to
policy formulation and surveillance. With extensive technical assistance (TA) from the
Fund and other development partners, Timor-Leste has made welcome progress in improving
statistics. For the first time, the authorities provided historical non-oil GDP data that entered
into staff’s analysis. However, important data remain unavailable, and the quality of data,
notably national accounts, continues to have significant shortcomings that hamper policy
analysis and surveillance. The mission suggested that adequate resources be provided to
compile key economic statistics. Participation in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) would be beneficial to Timor-Leste.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
After three years of double-digit expansion, economic growth is likely to slow to
about 6 percent in 2010, mainly because adverse weather has slashed agricultural
production. As from next year, growth is expected to gradually gather speed and peak at
around 9¾ percent in 2013–14, mainly driven by scaling up public investment, but also
supported by dynamism in the non-oil private sector, including a recovery in agriculture. In
the long term, growth is expected converge to about 6 percent given by supply-side
fundamentals. Price pressures have been rising in 2010 and are particularly notable in some
segments of the economy, such as construction, and in the skilled labor market. Inflation is
expected to increase to 6 percent, somewhat above the average rate in neighboring countries.
37.
Timor-Leste should use its oil wealth wisely to build a strong, sustainable nonoil economy that would permanently reduce poverty and raise living standards. The
governments’ resolve to step up development is admirable. After years of conflict, there is a
need to reconstruct basic infrastructure. If well selected and managed, investment in
infrastructure could have sufficiently high returns to justify withdrawals from the PF in
excess of sustainable income. However, the planned rapid expansion of public investment in
infrastructure risks overstretching the country’s current ability to plan, evaluate, and

14
implement given its institutional weaknesses and administrative capacity constraints. There
are also signs of rising inflation as the economy is reaching its absorptive capacity limit, due
to the shortage of skilled labor and the small size of the private sector.
38.
Therefore, a more-gradual-than-planned pace of spending increases is advisable.
Recent years have seen rapid spending growth to address pressing social needs and to lay the
foundation for peace in the aftermath of the 2006/7 civil unrest. By 2009, public spending per
head has reached a level that is above many comparable countries. The revised higher ESI
has created room for additional investment in a limited number of priority projects while
gaining experience with the management of capital spending. Spending at a measured pace
would stand a better chance of realizing high quality investment, crowding in private
investment, and thereby achieve balanced and sustainable growth.
39.
At the same time capacity constraints should be addressed and businessenabling reforms implemented. The government’s plan to address budget under-execution
and to build administrative capacities (to “invest in investing”) is encouraging. A new agency,
reporting directly to the Prime Minister, will be in charge of major project evaluation,
approval, and quality control. It will be important that the agency recruits well-qualified staff.
A more efficient administration and business friendlier regulations would make life easier for
businesses. The introduction of a one-stop-shop for business is a welcome step in this
direction. Reforms to enhance property rights, such as the pending land law should be
accelerated. Efficient collateralization would enable the financial sector to extend credits to
local businesses.
40.
Fiscal policy should be mindful of competitiveness and external stability. Official
dollarization has helped keep inflation under control and should be maintained. But
dollarization needs to be supported by accelerating productivity-enhancing structural reforms
and raising labor skills to improve competitiveness in non-oil industry and services. A slower
pace of public spending growth would help to contain inflationary pressures.
41.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

15

BOX 1. EXCHANGE RATE, COMPETITIVENESS, AND EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
The real effective exchange rate is a poor
indicator of Timor-Leste’s competitiveness.
Lack of data prevents the estimation of
equilibrium exchange rates. Moreover,
petroleum and coffee, the country’s main
sources of foreign income, are denominated in
U.S. dollars, and the CPI is poorly measured.
Competitiveness indicators based on unit costs
are unfortunately not available. However,
wages, driven by the public sector, have been
rising fast, while productivity has been lagging
behind and terms-of-trade have improved
significantly.

Current Account Sustainability: Baseline Scenario
corruption.1
Current spending plans risk undermining
external stability. From a macroeconomic balance
perspective the current account mirrors petroleumfinanced public spending. In 2011, the current
account surplus is expected to fall below its
sustainable level, computed as the difference
between petroleum income and the ESI. In the
medium run, the current account surplus is
projected to remain below its sustainable level by
about 30 percent of GDP.

Sources: Data provided by the Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Includes locally paid compensation of UN peacekeeping mission staff.
2/ Excludes oil/gas sector.
3/ Includes autonomous agencies and quasi-fiscal expenditure by donors outside the central government budget. The
revenue decline in 2005 reflects the creation of the Petroleum Fund to which all oil revenue now accrues. Income from the
fund and donor assistance finances the deficit.
4/ Excludes currency holdings by the public, for which no data are available.
5/ Simple average of EIA's low case and reference prices.
6/ Figure for 2004 refers to the Timor-Sea account, which preceded the August 2005 establishment of the Petroleum Fund.

(in percent of non-oil GDP)

Sources: Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Fiscal year: July-June until June 2007; calendar year starting 2008. Central Government includes subsidies to Autonomous Agencies.
Revenue from government rice sales (estimated at $17 million in 2008, $20 million in 2009, and $14 million in 2010 ) is excluded and only the net subsidy
included in recurrent expenditure.
2/ The budget moved toward a cash basis in 2008 and the authorities stopped reporting commitments. Of the $528 million reported as spent in 2008,
an estimated $80 million was actually paid out in 2009, with spending under the 2008 budget allowed to continue in early 2009 as a transitional
measure before fully applying cash-based principles.
3/ Includes allocations for BPA capitalization ($10.5 million in 2006/07).
4/ Cash expenditure includes carry-over expenditure from previous years (the reporting of which was not disaggregated prior to 2008).
5/ Defined as overall balance minus petroleum revenue.
6/ Permanent income from oil and gas, estimated according to the Petroleum Fund law for each budget.
7/ Adds non-petroleum revenue to estimated sustainable income from petroleum.

1/ Oil/gas revenue is not included as a budget revenue item and flows directly to the petroleum fund. The amount necessary to cover
the non-oil fiscal deficit is withdrawn from the fund and transferred to the budget and recorded as a financing item. Rice sales are excluded from domestic
revenue in this table.
2/ Includes sector projects which the government has identified as necessary to achieve development objectives, but may not be wholly
funded by the government.
3/ Donor grants excluding budget support.

ANNEX 1. TIMOR-LESTE: STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN1
In April 2010, the Timor-Leste authorities published a summary of Strategic
Development Plan (SDP) for 2011–2030, with the full SDP yet to be officially released.
Immediately after the publication, the Prime Minister started country-wide consultation of
the SDP.
The SDP summary defines challenges faced by the country. It outlines target growth rates
for public investment and financing until 2015, provides a “framework of action until 2020”
and the government’s “visions” of the country’s stage of development in 2030. The
authorities plan to establish an Economic Planning and Investment Agency (EPIA) in charge
of the design, budgeting, and implementation of the SDP.


Main challenges that the SDP will address include urban-rural and regional imbalances,
shortage of skilled human resources, fragile institutions of the state, and post-conflict
mentality.



The SDP aims to put Timor-Leste among the upper-middle-income countries by 2030,
supported by strong growth of the non-oil economy at an average rate of 12 percent per
year during 2010–20 and 10 percent per year during 2020–30.



With public investment taking the lead, the framework of action to 2020 entails major
public and private investment projects in human capital, infrastructure, and strategic
sectors such as agriculture, petroleum (including downstream), and tourism. Improving
the business environment is also seen as a fundamental priority.



The public investment plan to 2015 defines a five-year public investment budget in the
order of 30 percent of GNP per year and focuses on eight priority areas: health and
nutrition, education and research, roads, power, seaports and airports, agriculture,
petroleum, and tourism. Financing options of the public investment will include
withdrawals from the PF in excess of the ESI or concessional borrowing. The
government intends to keep current expenditure within the ESI.

1

Based on the 2010 “Public Financial Management—Performance Report” and the “Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Fiscal Transparency Module.”

30
ANNEX 2. THE ESTIMATED SUSTAINABLE INCOME


The Petroleum Fund (PF) Law defines the estimated sustainable income (ESI) as
3 percent of Timor-Leste’s total petroleum wealth, including the current PF balance plus
the net present value of future petroleum receipts.



Rather than a rigid fiscal ceiling, the ESI is a benchmark to guide budget withdrawals
from the PF and inform policy discussions. Actual withdrawals can exceed the ESI as
long as the government delivers a detailed explanation to parliament why doing so is in
the long-run interest of country.



The ESI is calculated every year based on a set of assumptions on petroleum output and
prices. The PF Law requires prudent assumptions to be used, as 70 percent of TimorLeste’s oil wealth remains under the sea and there is no diversification across multiple
projects.



Only projects with an approved development plan and firm investment commitment
(i.e., the Bayu Undan and Kitan fields) have been included in the ESI calculation. The
Greater Sunrise field has been declared a commercial discovery, but does not have an
approved development plan, and therefore according to current policy should not be
included in ESI. Further, its exclusion appears justified given the material uncertainties
surrounding the technical and commercial configuration of the project and the potential
for significant delays. However, Sunrise is a confirmed petroleum resource and its
exclusion from ESI arguably puts some strain on the credibility of the policy.



Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance should begin evaluating its potential effect on
petroleum wealth and fiscal financing. Perceived petroleum wealth from Sunrise is
already informing wider thinking in government and civil society about sustainable
spending levels, and quantification of the potential revenue flows would help to inform
and guide that discussion. In particular, this exercise would allow the authorities to
manage expectations and encourage a more realistic assessment of the potential addition
to petroleum wealth from Sunrise.



Until 2010, the oil price used for ESI calculation has been the “low” case from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook. To address the
concern within the government that the low case lies materially below market and other
respected forecasters expected prices, the authorities recently explored other alternative
methodologies for determining a price forecast more reflective of expectations but still
prudent. It came to a conclusion of using the average of the EIA low and reference cases,
which balances between being realistic and prudent. For 2011, the average price
generates an ESI of $734 million compared to $548 million under the EIA low case price.

31
ANNEX 3. TIMOR-LESTE: FISCAL ROSC AND PEFA ASSESSMENTS
The 2010 fiscal ROSC and PEFA exercises evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of
Timor-Leste’s public financial management (PFM) system. In response to the authorities’
request, the Fund carried out both exercises with participation of the WB and the ADB. This
diagnostic work will form the basis for the IMF’s input in helping the authorities elaborate a
comprehensive PFM reform strategy in close cooperation with the World Bank.
The assessments suggest that overall Timor-Leste has made solid progress in
strengthening the PFM system from a low base. Key strengths in fiscal transparency
include: a well-structured, basic budget process; a well-managed and supervised framework
for the petroleum sector; comprehensive budget documentation and regular fiscal reporting; a
modern integrated financial management information system; and an efficient Treasury
Single Account. Notable gains have also been made in funding predictability, timeliness and
quality of bank reconciliation and financial statements, legislative scrutiny, functionality of
the treasury system, and external audit process.
However, substantial weaknesses in the PFM system remain.


The budget is not a good predictor of actual spending, mainly reflecting large
supplementary budgets.



Budget Review in the Ministry of Finance has very little assessment capacity,
especially on the capital side.



Budget planning and implementation capacity in line ministries are still very weak.
Budget oversight of autonomous government agencies and public enterprises, albeit
relatively few in number, is weak and associated fiscal risks are not monitored.



Independent internal and external audit process is lacking.



Procurement has been in a state of flux for many years, with less competitive
instruments becoming more prevalent.



The budget is only weakly linked to policy objectives and the implications of capital
spending for recurrent budgets are ignored.



The Ministry of Finance has little capacity to adequately review the rationale, costing,
and impact of public investment.



A solid multi-year perspective on fiscal planning, expenditure policy, and budgeting
is missing.

Despite improved transparency in tax payer obligations, compliance and tax audit remain a
major issue.

32

ANNEX 4. INDEX OF BUDGET INSTITUTIONS
Staff constructed two inter-related indexes of budget institutions to capture the quality
of budget institutions in Timor-Leste.1 The first dimension (stage index) is along three
budget stages including planning, approval, and implementation. The second dimension
(category index) covers five cross-cutting categories at each budgetary stage: top-down
procedures; rules and controls; sustainability and credibility; comprehensiveness; and
transparency. Based on the recent fiscal ROCS and PEFA results, a score ranging from 0–4 is
assigned to each dimension and category according to a common scoring methodology
documented in Dabla-Norris et al (2010). The overall stage index and category index are
simple averages of sub-indexes.
Results suggest that Timor-Leste’s budget institutions are relatively strong on
transparency and comprehensiveness, but score below low-income countries (LICs) on
average. The overall stage index (1.6) is lower than the average of LICs (1.9), reflecting
weaknesses in budget planning and approval. Important shortcomings include (i) unclear
fiscal targets; (ii) a dual budget process where capital and current budgets are developed
separately; and (iii) inadequate analysis of fiscal risks. The overall category index (1.7) is
also lower than the average of LICs (1.9). Particularly, Timor-Leste scores poorly in fiscal
rules and controls, and sustainability and credibility, reflecting the absence of a solid
medium-term fiscal perspective, large gaps in internal and external audit, and inadequate
monitoring of fiscal risks. A commendable achievement for Timor-Leste is its relatively high
fiscal transparency, which is measured to be close to the average of middle-income countries
(MICs). Budget documents also provide fairly comprehensive information compared with
those of many other LIC peers.

1

The methodology is taken from “Budget Institutions and Fiscal Performance in Low-Income Countries” by
E. Dabla-Norris et al (IMF Working Paper 10/80). The lower is the index, the weaker are budget institutions.

http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2009/pn0988.htm.

IX.

Technical Assistance
Since late 1999, a significant amount of technical assistance has been provided
by the Fund as part of the international community’s efforts to reconstruct the
Timor-Leste economy. The Fund’s technical assistance has focused on
establishing key economic institutions (especially fiscal and monetary
authorities) essential for macroeconomic management, as well as on developing

3
local capacity to manage them. It also played a key role in the adoption of a new
currency arrangement based on the U.S. dollar. Since late 1999, Timor-Leste has
been one of the largest recipients of Fund technical assistance.
FAD: A series of multi-topic FAD missions took place early on to establish and develop
the Central Fiscal Authority (CFA, February 2000), which developed into the Ministry of
Planning and Finance. Assistance was provided to develop budget preparation, establish
tax policy and administration, strengthen treasury and expenditure management, and
advise on oil sector fiscal regimes. Long-term resident advisors were assigned to the
Ministry of Planning and Finance and the Revenue Service of Timor-Leste to cover a
wide range of issues, partly under a cost sharing arrangement with the UN. Over August
2004–July 2005, a FAD resident advisor assisted in the design and establishment of the
Petroleum Fund, which started operations in August 2005. A FAD resident advisor to the
Treasurer of the ministry finance started work in December 2006 to help strengthen
expenditure management, reporting and budget execution—after a short break, a
replacement has continued this work since July 2008. In 2007, a FAD TA mission
provided guidance for future reform of the non-oil tax regime. In April 2009 a FAD
technical assistance mission provided advice on implementation of the fiscal regimes for
petroleum. In addition to PEFA and fiscal ROSC, in 2010, FAD sent follow-up mission
on treasury management. Also in 2010, FAD TA mission provided advice on the
calculation of estimated sustainable income and other selected petroleum fiscal issues.
LEG: A number of LEG missions have been to Timor-Leste to advise the authorities on
key fiscal and financial legislation. These included tax legislation, the budget and
financial management law, and banking regulations (relating to the monetary authority,
the banking system, and the payments system). Jointly with MFD (now MCM), technical
assistance has been provided to assist in drafting an Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Law. LEG has also provided
assistance, in collaboration with FAD, for the drafting of the Petroleum Fund Act and tax
consolidation, and in collaboration with MCM, for the drafting of the Central Bank Law.
MCM: A large number of missions took place early on to establish and develop the
Central Payments Office (CPO, January 2000), which was transformed subsequently into
the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) (November 2001). Assistance was provided
to establish a payments system, prepare banking legislation, and develop key functions of
the monetary authority, including banking supervision, asset management, accounting,
and organization and management. Assistance was also provided on the introduction of a
dollar-based currency system and to issue domestic coins to supplement the use of U.S.
dollar coins. More recently, assistance has been provided to (i) draft the insurance law
and develop a framework for insurance supervision; (ii) strengthen banking supervision;
(iii) address a broad range of issues related to AML/CFT; (iv) establish and train the
investment unit responsible for managing petroleum fund assets (funded by Norway, a
resident adviser commenced in March 2005 and, after a break due to contract
renegotiations, a replacement continued this work from November 2008); (v) prepare for
the establishment of the central bank; (vi) design of a more effective organizational
structure at the BPA; and (vii) modernize payment systems, and accounting for the

4
Petroleum Fund. In addition, up until 2006 long-term resident advisors, including on
banking supervision, payments, and accounting, have been assigned to the BPA under a
cost-sharing arrangement with the UN. A long-term resident advisor assisted the BPA
General Manager from February 2005 until February 2008, with that support
subsequently provided on a peripatetic basis and funded by a Japanese grant.
STA: A multi-sector statistical mission took place in November 2000 to assess the
availability and quality of official macroeconomic data, and help establish the Statistic
Division of the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Assistance was provided by long term
statistical advisors during November 2001-October 2005. Since 2007, a peripatetic
statistical advisor has provided assistance for improving data compilation and developing
local capacity to prepare balance of payments statistics—responsibility for this was
transferred to the BPA in 2007. Provisional annual balance of payments statements for
2006 and 2007 were published in December 2008. In early 2008 a monetary and financial
statistics (MFS) mission helped introduce the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
reporting monetary data to the IMF and an integrated monetary database. Subsequently,
Timor-Leste has, for the first time, been able to publish a country page in IFS. A March
2009 follow-up MFS mission assisted in expanding the institutional coverage of
depository corporations to include microfinance institutions and in revising the call report
form that will be used to collect balance sheet data. In 2010, STA sent a follow-up
mission on balance of payments statistics and a mission providing assistance on updating
the CPI basket to Dili.

ANNEX II. TIMOR-LESTE: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION

1.
The Bank and the Fund country teams for Timor-Leste, led by Mr. H. Rab (acting
country manager) and Mr. W. Schule (IMF mission chief for Timor-Leste), maintain a close
working relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
2.

There has been close cooperation on a range of issues including:
(i)

Macroeconomic developments and economic updates: There has been close
dialogue throughout the year on macro policies and economic developments. There
is regular sharing of information, including Fund comments on the Bank’s semiannual economic updates.

(ii)

Public Finance Management: The World Bank participated in the IMF led PEFA
and ROSC missions. Bank staff have been following up on the recommendations,
including helping MOF put together a Strategic Plan. There is regular coordination
between Bank staff on the ground and the IMF’s Treasury Adviser at the Ministry of
Finance.

(iii)

External debt: The teams have engaged very closely on discussions around
government plans to borrow. A first joint DSA was carried out during the Article IV
mission in October/November 2010.

(iv)

Export competitiveness study: The Bank recently completed a trade diagnostic
study for which the Fund provided the analysis of external competitiveness and
sustainability.

3.
Based on the above, the teams agreed that Timor-Leste’s main macroeconomic
challenge is to manage the country’s petroleum wealth effectively and sustainably to develop a
stronger non-oil economy and reduce poverty. To meet this challenge Timor-Leste needs a
Strategic Development Plan to help prioritize public expenditure; to strengthen public financial
management; and to accelerate reforms to promote productivity and competitiveness. The
effectiveness of scaling up public investment depends critically on progress in these areas.
4.
Based on this shared assessment the following structural reform areas were identified as
macro-critical:


Strategic Development Plan: Timor-Leste envisages a rapid scaling up of public investment.
The SDP should help prioritize public expenditure, promote sustainable growth and fiscal
sustainability.



Public financial management reform: The recent fiscal ROSC and PEFA missions and the
Bank’s review of the Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program found
solid progress but also highlighted pressing issues around medium-term budgeting,
expenditure (in particular public investment) management and procurement, and auditing.
These areas are critical for the quality of expenditure.

6


Promoting productivity and competitiveness: Timor-Leste faces a number of challenges to
promoting productivity, competitiveness and diversification in the non-oil economy. Three
key priorities include addressing skills deficit; improving access to land; and strengthening
the business environment, in particular access to finance and contract enforcement.

5.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Appendix I details the
specific activities planned by the two country teams over the September 2010/2011 period. In
summary, the Fund will continue to lead on macro issues, and the Bank will continue to lead PFM
and macro critical structural reform issues.

ANNEX III. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 30, 2010)

Asian Development Bank (AsDB) assistance to Timor-Leste commenced in 1999. Assistance was
initially conveyed through the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor. Timor-Leste
joined the AsDB on July 24, 2002.
From 1999 to 2007, AsDB focused on the emergency rehabilitation of infrastructure, funded through
the multidonor Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET). AsDB implemented about $49 million in TFET
projects covering urban and rural power, national roads, ports, and water and sanitation. $4 million in
TFET funds were used to establish and capitalize a microfinance institute.
AsDB’s recent operations have been guided by the Country Program and Strategy Update 2006-2008
and the Country Operations Business Plans 2008-2011.1 AsDB support has been closely aligned with
the Government’s National Development Plan and its goals to improve physical infrastructure and
build capacity to manage and deliver quality basic social services.
The Asian Development Fund (ADF) program commenced in 2005. $62 million in ADF grant
funding has been approved, focused on essential infrastructure. A national roads rehabilitation project
($10.0 million ADF) concluded in 2009 and has been succeeded by a new Road Network
Development Sector Project ($46.0 million ADF). AsDB administers a complementary $3 million
project in support of road side communities, funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. AsDB
also supports the Dili water supply and sanitation project ($6.0 million ADF).
Timor-Leste is the recipient of AsDB’s largest ever technical assistance (TA) grant, the Infrastructure
Project Management TA. This $15 million package, funded with AusAID co-financing, commenced
in 2007 and helps plan, prepare, and execute the Government’s capital development program. Other
AsDB activities include the strengthening of microfinance, statistics and macroeconomic
management, and a civil service training institute.
To-date ADB has approved 9 grants (6 from the TFET and 3 from the ADF) for a total amount of
$114.8 million, and 30 technical assistance (TA) projects for a total of $28.3 million. Three grant
funded projects ($52.0 million) and 4 TA projects ($17.1 million) are active.
There has been no lending to Timor-Leste, with all ADF resources provided as grants. ADF resources
are set to move from 100% grant in 2010 to 67% grant and 33% loan in 2011-2012 and then to 33%
grant and 67% loan in 2013-2014. Timor-Leste's ADF Allocation for 2011-2012 is $30.2 million.

ANNEX IV. TIMOR-LESTE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 27, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially the national accounts. A multi-sector Fund
statistics mission visited Dili in November 2000 and assisted the authorities in establishing objectives
for restoring economic statistics and in setting up a Statistical Division in the Ministry of Planning
and Finance in 2001. A long-term resident statistical advisor assisted the Statistical Division during
November 2001–February 2004, and was succeeded by a new resident advisor until September 2005.
Technical assistance in balance of payments (peripatetic) and monetary statistics to the Banking and
Payments Authority (BPA) began in mid 2007 and January 2008, respectively, and will continue
through at least FY 2010.
National Accounts: Under a World Bank-financed project, national accounts data for 2000 (both
sector and expenditure basis) were estimated by the Boston Institute for Developing Economies
(BIDE). In late 2004, BIDE, under a follow-up World Bank project, produced GDP estimates for
2001-03 that suffer from limited source data and substantial extrapolation. The Statistics Directorate
has not been able to replicate the BIDE estimation exercise. Since April 2009, the authorities have
been employing a World Bank funded consultant to develop annual estimates of GDP.For the first
time in 2010, estimates of GDP (including for the oil sector) have been prepared by the
Macroeconomic Unit in the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with Fund staff. To improve national
accounts data, appropriate staff and substantial efforts in data collection and compilation are needed.
Price statistics: A consumer price index (CPI) has been compiled for Dili since December 2001 and
for the whole country since June 2003. Prices for all items in the basket are collected on a monthly
basis in the Dili region. Elsewhere, prices are collected at quarterly intervals for a representative
selection of other regions throughout Timor-Leste. The measure of the interim monthly price
movements for each item outside the Dili region is then estimated using the corresponding Dili region
item price movement as an indicator series. To address quality weaknesses, in particular inappropriate
and outdated weights, the commodity basket and the weighting scheme were revised in mid-2003
under a donor-supported project. A technical assistance mission during November 8-19, 2010 will
assist in rebasing the CPI using data derived from the Timor-Leste Living Standards Survey that was
conducted in 2006-7. Shortcomings in data collection need to be addressed and products and outlets
updated.
Labor market statistics: Annual data on public sector employment and wages are available in
official budget documentation. No official data are compiled regularly on private sector employment
and wages, except for partial data from various household surveys conducted by UNDP, ILO, ADB,
and the World Bank. In 2010, the Macroeconomic Unit in the Ministry of Finance has started to
conduct wage surveys.
Government finance statistics: Official data on central government revenue and expenditure are
published quarterly. Audited annual financial statements of the executed budget are made available to
APD as soon as they are released, normally three months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition,

10
monthly data are available on request through the budget, treasury, and revenue services. The
compilation of revenue and expenditure follows the classification of the Manual on Government
Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986) (including expenditure based on both functional and economic
classification). Only partial data are available on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken by
bilateral donors outside the central government budget. Currently, there are four non-financial public
enterprises, which are treated as government agencies and data on their operations are available in the
audited annual financial statements. No data are currently reported for the GFS Yearbook and the
International Financial Statistics. A technical assistance mission is tentatively scheduled to the last
quarter of FY 2011. This mission will aim to analyze the public sector’s composition and accounting
information as well as to set up a system to regularly report GFSM2001 data to users, including the
IMF.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled by the BPA, generally following the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, data are incomplete
because of the absence of official data on public currency holdings—which are difficult to compile
under the current currency regime—and of banks’ positions with public nonfinancial corporations.
The BPA publishes current monetary data on its website on a regular monthly basis, as well as a
quarterly bulletin and an annual report with key monetary aggregates.
Detailed monthly monetary data are available from July 2002 onward following the introduction of
the standardized report forms (SRFs). Beginning in February 2008, monetary data have been reported
to the IMF for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The BPA is planning to introduce
a new chart of accounts for the BPA in the coming months and a revised call report form (CRF) in
late 2010 to obtain balance sheet information from other depository corporations (ODCs). A March
2010 mission assisted the authorities in finalizing the design of the CRF and derived the SRF for the
ODCs based on this revised CRF. A follow-up mission could be scheduled for FY 2012 to assist the
authorities in introducing the SRFs for the central bank based on the new chart of accounts of the
BPA and for the ODCs based on the revised CRF and including the credit unions in the institutional
coverage of the ODCs. Additionally, a new CRF could be designed to collect balance sheet data from
insurance companies, and surveys compiled for financial corporations.
Balance of payments: Monthly data on merchandise exports and imports have been produced
starting March 2000, based on customs reports with a breakdown for major commodity categories. A
major data gap is the significant underestimation of imports of goods. Also not included are oil and
gas exports; an estimate of the large, unrecorded border trade; and some goods exempt from customs
duties. Further, customs data may underestimate imports because of undervaluation of declared
goods. Monthly merchandise trade data are now published regularly but there are significant gaps in
the series for 2006 and 2007. In the Fund staff estimates, data on oil/gas revenue are currently
recorded as current income based on fiscal data.
With technical assistance provided by the IMF’s Statistics Department, annual balance of payments
data for 2006 and 2007 were published by the BPA in December 2008. Data are now available for
2006-2009.
While methodology for the production of basic annual estimates of the balance of payments statistics
are in place, further development work is anticipated to address limitations of existing data sources, in
particular grants, merchandise trade statistics, and travel exports. The coverage of the survey of

11
foreign direct investment enterprises needs to be expanded, and the exploration and extraction
activities, in the Joint Petroleum Development Area and in the exclusive territory, require ongoing
monitoring. As the economy grows, it will be important to monitor new activities such as new direct
investment. Currently, there is limited information on remittances from Timorese working abroad and
improvement in the estimation/compilation procedures of such remittances should be pursued.
Some data on stocks of financial assets and liabilities have been collected as the balance of payments
development has taken place, and the annual international investment position statements should be
finalized. Development of quarterly statistics should also be pursued.
The next balance of payments technical assistance mission will be conducted in November 2010.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE
Joint World Bank/IMF 2010 Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Ray Brooks and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Carlos A. Primo Braga and Tunc Tahsin Uyanik (World Bank)
December 3, 2010
The medium-term fiscal path for Timor-Leste is subject to uncertainties regarding spending
commitments and income prospects from petroleum, which complicates the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA). The baseline macroeconomic scenario assumes a significant
scaling-up of public spending, future petroleum income only from fields with approved
development plans, and a moderate borrowing envelope. Under this scenario, the external
low income country DSA indicates a low risk of debt distress. The public DSA suggests that
overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of a gradual approach of
moderate borrowing and substantial savings in the PF.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
A young nation with a high incidence of poverty, Timor-Leste has been heavily
dependent on petroleum resources since the start of offshore production in 2004. Proven
reserves or production levels stand out in comparison to the non-oil economy. However, they
neither make Timor-Leste a major petroleum exporter in the world nor a rich country in per
capita income terms. By 2009, petroleum revenue accounted for almost 80 percent of GNI
and withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund for about 95 percent of total government revenue
(including grants). The Petroleum Fund (PF), established in 2005, is the cornerstone of
petroleum resource management and its assets reached $6.5 billion or ten times the non-oil
GDP in August 2010, which are invested entirely abroad.
2.
The first joint DSA for Timor-Leste is conducted amid the authorities’ quest for
double-digit non-oil GDP growth in the next two decades by scaling up public
investment. Currently, Timor-Leste has no public or external debt and withdrawals from the
PF have been financing non-oil fiscal deficits. But the government is contemplating external
borrowing, as a way to substitute withdrawals from the PF, to meet pressing development
needs. Loans from development partners may come with technical assistance, which would
be instrumental in strengthening the country’s policy and institutional capacity, and in

2
particular play an instrumental role for the government’s planned complex infrastructure
investments. At present, Timor-Leste has a weak Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) performance rating, corresponding to the lowest set of indicative debt
thresholds.
3.
The authorities’ agreed broadly with the DSA assessment. Given PF resources,
there is no immediate financial need for borrowing. However, the authorities see moderate
and gradual borrowing as a way to access technical assistance from development partners in
particular to address capacity constraints in the appraisal, selection, and implementation of
infrastructure projects. The authorities also see borrowing as a way to diversify sources of
financing and help build debt management capacity from scratch.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The first decade of Timor-Leste’s independence saw a significant rise in national
income, accompanied by large volatility associated with petroleum income. Thanks to
petroleum income, real GNI grew at an annual average of 27 percent, but ranged from a
contraction of 25 percent in 2009 to an expansion of over 50 percent each in 2007–08. Nonoil GDP expanded over the decade at an annual average rate of 5 percent with large volatility
(standard deviation of 8), reflecting Timor-Leste’s post-conflict status.
5.
The DSA takes account of both the non-oil economy and income from
petroleum. Currently GDP does not include petroleum production that takes place in the
joint production area between Timor-Leste and Australia. However, based on Timor-Leste’s
very small non-oil economy alone, any meaningful borrowing would be unsustainable.
Therefore, to reflect the special feature of the economy, the following adjustments are made
in measuring Timor-Leste’s repayment capacity: (i) GNI is used to capture the size of the
wider economy;1 (ii) wider exports cover exports of non-oil goods and services plus oilrelated income, including oil exports (recorded as oil income in the balance of payments) and
the PF investment income net of interest payments abroad; and (iii) total public sector
revenue equals non-oil revenue plus estimated sustainable income (ESI) from petroleum
(Box 1). In essence, Timor-Leste’s borrowing capacity depends crucially on petroleum
exports, the accumulation of PF assets, and growth of the non-oil economy.

1

GNI consists of non-oil GDP and total net income from abroad as recorded in the balance of payments. Unless
otherwise indicated, GDP throughout the paper (including tables and charts) refers to GNI.

3

BOX 1. THE ESTIMATED SUSTAINABLE INCOME


The Petroleum Fund (PF) Law defines the estimated sustainable income (ESI) as
3 percent of Timor-Leste’s total petroleum wealth, including the current PF balance plus
the net present value of future petroleum receipts.



Rather than a rigid fiscal ceiling, the ESI is a benchmark to guide budget withdrawals
from the PF and inform policy discussions. Actual withdrawals can exceed the ESI as
long as the government delivers a detailed explanation to parliament why doing so is in
the long-run interest of country.



The ESI is calculated every year based on a set of assumptions on petroleum output and
prices. The PF Law requires prudent assumptions to be used, as 70 percent of TimorLeste’s oil wealth remains under the sea and there is no diversification across multiple
projects.



Only projects with an approved development plan and firm investment commitment
(i.e., the Bayu Undan and Kitan fields) have been included in the ESI calculation. The
Greater Sunrise field has been declared a commercial discovery, but does not have an
approved development plan, and therefore according to current policy should not be
included in ESI. Further, its exclusion appears justified given the material uncertainties
surrounding the technical and commercial configuration of the project and the potential
for significant delays. However, Sunrise is a confirmed petroleum resource and its
exclusion from ESI arguably puts some strain on the credibility of the policy.



Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance should begin evaluating its potential effect on
petroleum wealth and fiscal financing. Perceived petroleum wealth from Sunrise is
already informing wider thinking in government and civil society about sustainable
spending levels, and quantification of the potential revenue flows would help to inform
and guide that discussion. In particular, this exercise would allow the authorities to
manage expectations and encourage a more realistic assessment of the potential addition
to petroleum wealth from Sunrise.



Until 2010, the oil price used for ESI calculation has been the “low” case from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook. To address the
concern within the government that the low case lies materially below market and other
respected forecasters expected prices, the authorities recently explored other alternative
methodologies for determining a price forecast more reflective of expectations but still
prudent. It came to a conclusion of using the average of the EIA low and reference cases,
which balances between being realistic and prudent. For 2011, the average price
generates an ESI of $734 million compared to $548 million under the EIA low case price.

4
6.
The DSA is based on the macroeconomic framework discussed with the
authorities during the 2010 Article IV Consultations (Box 2). The baseline takes account
of the authorities’ current policy intentions, which include a significant and front-loaded
scaling-up of public investment during the next decade. Financing of the scaling-up is to
come from higher withdrawals from the PF, some of which can be substituted by external
borrowing. It was also assumed that no new petroleum fields come on stream, such as the
Greater Sunrise field, which has a promising potential, but its development plans are
currently under negotiation.
Box 2. Baseline Macroeconomic and Petroleum Sector Assumptions (2011–30)
Real sector: real non-oil GDP is projected to grow at close to 9 percent on average over the
medium term before gradually reverting to its potential of 6 percent in the long run, slightly
above the historical average of 5 percent during 2002–09. Due to a lapse of one-off factors,
such as the agricultural rebound from the 2007 drought, as well as bad weather in 2010, staff
projects non-oil GDP growth to decelerate from an annual average rate of 11 percent during
2007–09 to about 6–7 percent in 2010–11. Medium-term projections reflect staff’s assessment
that Timor-Leste’s weak policy and institutional capacity will undermine the effectiveness of
significant front-loaded public investment scaling-up. As a result, medium-term growth is
projected at a rate lower than that being contemplated by the authorities. Given the economy’s
limited absorptive capacity, inflation is expected to remain high at 6 percent throughout the
medium-term before declining gradually to 4 percent in the long run.
Fiscal sector: tax revenue is projected to stay broadly stable at 7½–8½ percent of non-oil
GDP. Reflecting front-loaded scaling-up, capital expenditure rises from an average of
33 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009–10 to an average of 54 percent during 2011–15 before
declining gradually to 20 percent in the long-run. Despite the government’s plans to keep noncapital spending growth in line with inflation growth, staff projects current expenditure to
average at 68 percent of non-oil GDP during 2011–15 before declining gradually to about
30 percent by 2030. Unlike the
authorities, staff projections include

expects the non-oil fiscal deficit to rise

2010–15 before declining to 34 percent

in 2030. Financing of prolonged large
non-oil deficits will require withdrawals

2005 2009 2013 2017 2021 2025 2029
from the PF consistently above the ESI.
External sector: staff projects exports of non-oil goods and services to grow at an average of
about 12 percent annually. However, declining petroleum income will worsen the current

5
account balance from a surplus of 245 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009 to a deficit of
26 percent of non-oil GDP by 2024. Current account deficits will be financed largely by
withdrawals from the PF.
External financing: for this DSA, it is assumed that Timor-Leste will borrow around
$900 million during 2011–30 from bilateral and multilateral donors to fund its development
program. Around 40 percent of the loans will be on highly concessional terms. Concessional
loans are projected to wind down because Timor-Leste’s per capita GNI is already above the
threshold for Low Income Countries that are eligible for highly concessional loans from
several institutions. Other loans are assumed to carry a 5 year grace period, 25 year maturity,
and an interest rate of 4½ percent. Eligibility for such loans will be subject to creditworthiness
and other assessments depending on the financier. The assumptions are based on very
preliminary indications on potential lending and are therefore subject to change.
The financing assumptions in the DSA are driven mostly by Timor-Leste's changing status
from Low Income to Middle Income Country, which has implications for access to highly
concessional resources. To date Timor-Leste has received only grants from the IFIs (World
Bank and Asian Development Bank) on an exceptional basis because of its post-conflict status
and fledgling institutions. Ordinarily, as a Low Income Country, Timor-Leste would have
received highly concessional credits because the country is not at risk of debt distress. This is
likely to be the case from next year. In recent years, however, Timor-Leste's per capita GNI
has gone above the eligibility threshold even for highly concessional credits because of the
rise in petroleum receipts. The DSA therefore assumes that Timor-Leste will no longer be
eligible for highly concessional loans over the medium-term, because the country's GNI per
capita makes it a (lower) Middle Income Country.
Petroleum production: projections are based on two active fields, Bayu Undan and the
relatively small Kitan field. It is expected that Bayu Undan will cease production by 2025 and
Kitan by 2017. Total production is expected to peak at close to 70 million barrels of oil
equivalent in year 2012 before winding down by 2025.
Petroleum price: projections are based on an average of EIA’s low case and reference case
prices, published in May 2010. Except for a 10 percent decline in 2011 from $76 to $68 per
barrel, crude oil prices are expected to rise quite smoothly at an average rate of between 3 and
4 percent per year in nominal terms.
7.
The long-term impact of the rapid scale up in public investment on growth will
depend critically on the prioritization and quality of investment. Since 2006/07, capital
investment managed and financed by the government has increased by nearly tenfold. All of
it was channeled through the national budget. The rapid scale up, however, has stretched the
limited investment management capacity of the public and the private sector with negative
implications for the quality of projects, their implementation, and ex post monitoring. To

6
improve cost and quality control, the government is planning to establish an Infrastructure
Fund and a new agency (ADN) that will be responsible for project appraisal, design, and
monitoring. Procurement for large projects (more than $1 million) will be managed by a
Procurement Technical Secretariat. The government intends to staff these new agencies with
well qualified professionals and is also looking at different outsourcing options.
8.
The impact of investment on growth will also depend on the quality of
complementary policies and institutions.2 These will affect the ability of the private sector
to take advantage of infrastructure development. However, the private sector remains small,
relative to the size of planned public sector investment. Timor-Leste also has a very
challenging business environment.3 Key priorities include simplifying business start up,
strengthening contract enforcement and increasing access to finance. Other structural reform
priorities include investment in skills in the rapidly growing labor market, improving access
to land, ensuring access to energy, and liberalization of the telecommunications sector.
Finally, public finance management reforms will also play a major role in promoting
investment and growth.4 The government is taking steps in all these areas.
III. EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline Scenario
9.
The baseline scenario indicates that all debt stock and debt service indicators are
below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the projection period
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Specifically, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of debt-torevenue ratio are expected to peak at 17 percent and 68 percent respectively by 2025, much
below their thresholds of 30 percent and 200 percent, respectively. The PV of debt-to-exports
ratio is projected to peak at 67 percent in 2026, below the threshold of 100 percent. The two
debt service ratios are projected to rise over time but remain considerably below their
thresholds.
Standard Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
10.
Stress tests were conducted to assess the robustness of the baseline scenario to
various shocks. The results are presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1. Notably,
only a shock of lower export growth during 2011–12, which can be interpreted as a shock to

7
petroleum production or prices given the dominance of petroleum exports, would result in
some ratios breaching thresholds. Specifically,


Two debt stock ratios are expected to breach their indicative thresholds under a
very large shock to exports (B2) generated by the standard DSA template. The
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 37 percent and breach its threshold
during 2018–27, and the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is expected to breach its
indicative thresholds from 2024 when oil income winds down.



All debt ratios remain below their thresholds under standard shocks to GNI
growth, deflator, and non-debt creating flows (B1, B3, and B4).



The stress test of a combination of one-half standard deviation shocks (B5) leads
to more favorable debt dynamics. However, deducting one-half standard deviation
from large historical averages is unrealistic and leads to overly optimistic
assumptions on growth of GNI and exports during 2011–12.



The historical scenario (A1) indicates extremely favorable debt dynamics
relative to the baseline. This is because the baseline scenario expects that petroleum
income will steadily wind down by 2025 while the historical scenario applies a
counterfactual continuation of large petroleum income from the Bayu Undan field
throughout the projection period.



Under the scenario of less favorable loan terms (A2), all debt burden and debt
services indicators worsen relative to the baseline. But the ratios remain below
their indicative thresholds throughout the projection period.



The stress test of a one-time 30 percent depreciation is not applicable due to official
dollarization.

Customized Export Shock
11.
The standard DSA stress tests do not take account of Timor-Leste’s special
situation as a young post-conflict country. These tests are based on historical volatility of
the last eight years, which is particularly high and therefore may not be representative.
Specifically, the standard export shock would imply an unrealistic negative shock of about
140 percent. Given the substantial reliance on oil, an appropriate size of the export shock
would be one that mimics a realistic oil price shock of 30–40 percent during the last 10 years.
12.
Under a customized export shock of 60 percent to the baseline, Timor-Leste is
found to be at low risk of debt distress. This size of shock represents a worst case scenario
because it almost doubles the typical oil price shock observed in the last 10 years. As shown
in Figure 1 and Table 3, all debt stock and debt service ratios are projected to remain under
their indicative thresholds throughout the projection period (B6).

8
IV. PUBLIC DSA
13.
With only external borrowing by the government, the results of public debt DSA
mirror the external debt DSA. In light of substantial asset accumulation in the PF, TimorLeste’s public debt DSA is conducted on a net debt basis (i.e., gross public debt minus the PF
assets). Under the baseline scenario (Table 3 and Figure 2), all three debt stock and debt
service ratios are projected to rise eventually but stay well within their indicative thresholds.
14.
Timor-Leste’s net public debt does not appear to be vulnerable to the
standardized DSA stress tests (Figure 2 and Table 4). This is because the buildup of
substantial PF assets provides a significant cushion against shocks. However, Timor-Leste’s
net public debt is projected to increase significantly around 2025 when oil income winds
down. This highlights the importance of keeping borrowing envelope limited and being
fiscally prudent with spending from the PF.
V. CONCLUSIONS
15.
With a moderate borrowing envelope, Timor-Leste is at low risk of debt distress.
All debt stock and debt service ratios are projected to stay below their indicative thresholds
under baseline and stress tests. The public DSA also suggests that Timor-Leste’s overall
public sector debt dynamics are sustainable with moderate borrowing. Nevertheless, a range
of sensitivity analysis reveals Timor-Leste’s vulnerability to shocks, particularly those
related to petroleum production and prices, reflecting the country’s heavy dependence on one
single commodity (petroleum). Therefore, to minimize the risk of debt distress, it is advisable
for Timor-Leste to take a gradual and moderate approach to borrowing from development
partners and be fiscally prudent.
16.
A key challenge for Timor-Leste is to use its petroleum wealth effectively and
sustainably to develop non-oil economy. Given the flexibility embedded in the PF Law and
the calculations of the ESI, a major constraint on boosting growth through scaling-up public
investment comes from weak policy and institutional capacity rather than from the
availability of financing. Therefore, an appropriate level of public expenditure should be
commensurate with the government’s capacity to plan, implement, and review investment
projects, and with the ability of private sector producers to take advantage of public capital.
Close cooperation with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other
development partners would help prioritizing, sequencing, and managing expenditures. The
decision of how to finance development projects—through borrowing or more withdrawals
from the PF—is of second order. A gradual approach to borrowing is advisable to allow time
for building up debt management capacity from scratch. Moreover, preference should be
given to concessional loans rather than commercial loans to contain the risk of debt distress.

1/ Includes only public sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes changes in the PF balances; and valuation adjustments.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. Changing all historical averages to a horizon of 8 years does not affect the magnitude of the shocks and, therefore, the outcome of the
analysis.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
January 19, 2011
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on December 3, 2010. The information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Timor-Leste’s economic growth picked up in the second half of 2010. Preliminary
data provided by the authorities indicate that GDP growth in 2010 is likely to be higher than the
estimate in the Staff Report of 6 percent and closer to the government’s estimate of 9½ percent:


Bad weather conditions in 2010 appear to have had a more limited impact on
agricultural output than expected. Preliminary estimates indicate that, despite
unseasonally high rainfalls, total agricultural production grew by ½ percent in 2010,
rather than declined by 5 percent as estimated by staff.



Preliminary government estimates of activity in industry and services also show strongerthan-expected growth of 16 percent in 2010. Activity was particularly strong in the
transport and communication, financial services, and the small manufacturing sectors.

3.
Government revenue from petroleum was higher than budgeted, because of
higher-than-projected oil prices: US$ 2.2 billion was collected in petroleum revenue for
2010, 30 percent above the mid-year 2010 budget estimate. If higher oil prices persist,
sustainable income (ESI) from petroleum could be revised up by 3 to 5 percent when the annual
recalculation is made in April.
4.
The Ministry of Finance has revised upwards its estimate of government cash
spending in 2010 to US$729 million, about 20 percent higher than in 2009. Spending
remained below the sum of expected 2010 domestic revenue and the estimated sustainable
income (ESI) from petroleum by about US$100 million.
5.
The Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) reported an increase in CPI inflation
for Dili to 9.1 percent year-on-year in November 2010. The rate increased from the
7.5 percent reported in the Staff Report for September.
6.
As noted in the staff appraisal, a higher ESI creates room for additional spending.
Staff supports government investment in public infrastructure, health and education, and their
efforts to reduce administrative and absorptive capacity constraints. Meanwhile, spending at a
more measured pace would stand a better chance of realizing high quality investment, crowding
in private investment, and thereby achieving balanced and sustainable growth. The higher-thanexpected inflation also underlines the need for fiscal restraint.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/31
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 8, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
On January 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Timor-Leste.
Background
The Timorese economy has grown fast over the past three years in an environment of
improved security following the 2006 civil unrest. Driven by higher oil-financed public
spending and a rebound in agriculture from the 2007 drought, non-oil growth averaged
11 percent during 2007–09. A recent estimate by the World Bank also shows a decline
of poverty incidence from 50 percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2009. With increased
public spending, domestic price pressures have recently been rising and are particularly
high in some segments of the economy, such as housing and construction.
The fiscal position strengthened in 2009, the non-oil fiscal deficit declined by
17 percentage points to 92 percent of non-oil GDP. This reflected a moderation of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
spending growth to 8 percent following a sharp increase of 130 percent in 2008. A
supplemental 2010 budget raised the spending envelop by more than 30 percent to
US$838 million, to be financed by withdrawals of US$811 million from the Petroleum
Fund (PF). However, due to procurement delays actual public spending is expected to
be around US$729 million, and the non-oil fiscal deficit is projected at about 100 percent
of non-oil GDP.
Timor-Leste stands out as the most oil-dependent economy in the world. In 2009,
petroleum income accounted for about 95 percent of total government revenue and
almost 80 percent of gross national income (GNI). The PF assets reached US$6.8 billion
or about ten times non-oil GDP in October 2010. The current account surplus has been
driven by large oil income.
The financial sector remains at an embryonic stage of development. Three foreign bank
branches dominate the financial sector, in addition to a small state-owned microfinance
institution. A first insurance company has been established. Despite high bank deposit
growth, private sector credit has remained stagnant, hampered by a large share of nonperforming loans, weak contract enforcement, and unclear property rights.
The near-term outlook remains positive, supported by social and political stability and
government spending. Preliminary data provided by the authorities indicate that GDP
growth in 2010 is likely to be higher than the estimate in the Staff Report of 6 percent
and closer to the government’s estimate of 9½ percent, potentially pointing to a higher
growth projection in 2011. Staff expects GDP growth to stay high in the medium term.
Inflation is projected to increase from 4½ percent to 6 percent in 2011, higher than the
average of neighboring countries. Large uncertainties surround the medium-term
outlook, including the path of oil prices and production, the magnitude and quality of
public spending, and progress in business-enabling structural reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Timor-Leste’s economic performance over the last three
years and the progress made on poverty reduction and other social indicators. Following
a slowdown caused by adverse weather, the medium-term outlook for growth is positive.
Going forward, Timor-Leste’s key challenge remains to use its petroleum wealth wisely
to build a strong non-oil economy and raise living standards.
Directors welcomed the government’s resolve to push ahead with its development
policies. They noted that carefully selected infrastructure investment could have
sufficiently high returns to justify temporary withdrawals from the PF in excess of the
estimated sustainable income (ESI), and that the upward revision in the ESI has created
room for additional capital expenditure. Most Directors observed, however, that
spending at a slower-than-planned pace, consistent with the absorptive capacity of the
economy, would stand a better chance of realizing high quality projects and crowding in
private investment.

3
Directors praised the government’s emphasis on raising the country’s ability to plan,
evaluate, and implement spending programs, so that any expansion of public works
does not overwhelm administrative capacity. They supported plans to create a new
agency, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, which will be in charge of major project
evaluation and approval. Further improvements in public financial management and
budget execution will also be important.
Directors welcomed the government’s efforts to make the regulatory environment more
business-friendly. They noted that the introduction of a one-stop-shop for start-ups is a
step in this direction. Accelerated reforms to enhance property rights, such as the
pending land law, would also make it easier for the financial sector to extend credits to
local businesses.
Directors observed that the official dollarization has helped keep inflation under control
and should be maintained, supported by a fiscal policy that is mindful of external stability.
Productivity-enhancing structural reforms and efforts to build labor skills would improve
competitiveness in non-oil industries and services. Directors also noted that a slowerthan-envisaged pace of public spending growth would help contain inflation pressures
as supply-side limitations are approached.
Directors called for an intensification of the engagement between Fund staff and the
authorities. Noting differences between the official and the more conservative staff’s
growth projections, they encouraged a closer policy dialog and greater use of technical
assistance, including to strengthen Timor-Leste’s economic statistics. A number of
Directors also saw merit in reopening the resident representative office.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Mr. Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
and Mr. José Cardoso, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 19, 2011
We thank staff for visiting Timor-Leste. The authorities of Timor-Leste have always
highly valuated the dialogue with the IMF, not only under the framework of Article IV
consultations, but also in the context of important technical assistance missions.
The authorities of Timor-Leste do not consider the 2010 Article IV staff report to reflect
appropriately the most important recent economic and social developments, and also the
medium- and long-run prospects of Timor-Leste. The authorities would have preferred a
more appropriate guidance of the mission, and consider that the insufficient
understanding of Timor-Leste’s reality has undermined the quality of the report.
Additionally, this is the first Article IV consultation after the closing of the IMF Resident
Representative (ResRep) Office in June 2009. In this regard, in the Buff statement for the
last Article IV staff report, we had already expressed that “the authorities expect, under
the new circumstances, a deeper engagement of the Fund given the extremely challenging
endeavors that Timor-Leste faces ahead”.
At the last Article IV discussion — and also at the IMF/WB Spring and Annual
Meetings, and other bilateral contacts — the authorities have regretted the Fund’s
decision of closing the ResRep Office. In a fragile and post-conflict country, with less
than a decade of existence, the presence of a ResRep Office makes a difference for
Timor-Leste, and apparently also for the IMF. We recall the fact that the decision of
closing the ResRep Office was motivated, at the time, by financial constrains and in the
context of the IMF downsizing. Such motivation no longer persists. Once again, the
authorities of Timor-Leste would like to express their interest in the reopening of the
ResRep Office in Díli.
The following paragraphs present what the Timor-Leste authorities consider the most
important disagreements with the Article IV staff report:
• Front page; point 2: On growth prospects, the staff report says, “in 2010 non-oil
GDP growth is expected to slow to around 6 percent due to the impact of adverse
weather on harvests”. The authorities’ estimate of non-oil GDP growth in 2010 is
higher at 9.5 percent. Food production has been affected by unseasonal rains, but the
share of agriculture in the non-oil GDP is relatively small at 26 percent, and the
absence of growth in agriculture has been more than compensated for by buoyancy in
the sectors of transport and communications, manufacturing, wholesale and retail
trade, and private construction.
•

The past experience is that staff projections of non-oil GDP growth in Timor-

2
Leste have been on the pessimistic side. For example, following the 2009 Article IV
consultation, staff had estimated 7.4 percent for the 2009 growth rate, whereas the
authorities had estimated 12.2 percent. The actual outturn for 2009 was higher than
the staff’s figure, and the authorities’ figure has even proved to be slightly on the
conservative side. The actual outturn for the 2009 growth rate was (in the 2010
Article IV staff report) 12.9 percent.
• Front page; point 2: The staff report says “there is uncertainty about the size,
timing and quality of capital spending”. The authorities feel that the finalization of the
Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for 2011-2030, and the proposed establishment of
the Infrastructure Fund in 2011 will contribute to a reduction in the uncertainties
about the future path of public investment. This multi-annual and fungibility fund will
allow the authorities to review the proposed projects and Bill of Quantities (BoQs)
with the aim to reduce inefficiencies. The government is committed to ensuring high
quality of public spending and is in no hurry to implement projects by December 31,
if this hurrying can produce inefficiencies.
• Page 4, paragraph 6: The staff report says “given procurement delays, primarily
for capital spending, staff suggests that 2010 cash spending will be around $650
million, well below the revised spending envelope”. Once again, this has proven to be
on the pessimistic side, as the actual estimate of cash spending in 2010 is $731.9
million, representing a rate of execution of 87.3 percent (even higher than the
conservative authorities’ estimation). Moreover, the budget execution rate will be, at
the end, somewhat higher, because according to the prevailing international
standards, closure of accounts is only fully booked two months after the end of the
concerned financial year. It is important to highlight that, over the last few years, the
budget execution rate has been rising steadily.
• Page 5, paragraph 9: According to the staff report, “GDP growth is expected to
increase to around 7⅓ percent in 2011”. The authorities expect close to double-digit
growth in 2011 based on the recovery of agriculture, rapid buildup in capital
spending, and continued buoyancy in the private sector especially in construction,
trade and transport, wholesale and retail trade, financial services, and public utilities.
• Page 5, paragraph 9: The staff report says that “non-oil growth is to gradually
converge to around 6 percent in the long-run”. The authorities expect a higher growth
rate to be sustainable in the long-run once the productive capacity of the economy has
been substantially augmented by the planned investments in infrastructure and human
capital development. Coupled with contemplated improvements in the business
environment, this will provide for the emergence of a strong private sector, both
domestic and foreign, beyond 2015. Thus, a double digit growth can be sustained in
the next two decades.

• Page 6, paragraph 11: The authorities had suggested to staff to provide upper and
lower bounds for projections, namely regarding economic growth. These projections
are given on page 8 in the two tables on Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook. For 2011, the
range of the projected growth rate is 6.1-7.3 percent, and the average for 2012-2015 is
7.8-9.0 percent. The authorities’ analysis, based on the reasons presented above, is
that the upper bound is a double-digit growth rate in this period, as well as beyond
2015.
• Page 8, Table on Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook: Given the new basis for the
estimated sustainable income (ESI), the staff report projects ESI at $734 million in
2011, rising to $740 million by 2015 in the Baseline Scenario, and to $771 million in
the Alternative Scenario. These projections appear to be predicated on very
conservative assumptions about the future outlook for oil prices. According to Table
7, crude oil prices are expected to be at $68 per barrel in 2011, rising to $81 by 2015.
It is important to highlight that oil prices have already approached $90 per barrel, and
that, as the world economy recovers, they could rise even further.
• Page 8, paragraph 16: The staff report says “Within current spending, there is
room to restrain wage growth, phase out subsidies, including on rice and electricity
and to better target transfers to the most needy”. The authorities would like to indicate
that a reduction is proposed in the level of public transfers in the budget for 2011,
while emphasizing that the policy of social protection is important from the viewpoint
of containing poverty, and preserving peace and stability, through support that targets
the most vulnerable groups, such as veterans, the elderly, internally displaced persons
(IDPs), widows, and invalids.
• Page 9, paragraph 17: The staff report highlights the low domestic tax to non-oil
GDP ratio of only 8 percent. The authorities fully recognize the need for reforms,
both in tax administration and tax policy, not only from the viewpoint of mobilizing
more resources, but also for redistributive purposes. A phased strategy is being
implemented with an initial focus on improvements in tax administration, taxpayer
education, and measures to improve compliance, including expansion in the regime of
withholding tax. Beyond this, it is proposed to broaden the tax base, enhance the tax
system, and raise some tax rates, namely on luxury goods and services.
• Page 9, paragraph 20: The staff report indicates that “significant gaps remain in
PFM”. The authorities have placed great emphasis on improvements in public
financial management (PFM) in recent years, which has led to a substantial
enhancement in the budget execution rate. A Strategic Plan for PFM was finalized in
early 2010 and is being implemented in key areas related to accounting systems,
procurement practices, internal audit, staff capacity building, etc. Strong anticorruption mechanisms are being put in place. Two important facts should have been
highlighted: (i) it is reassuring that the Transparency International Corruption

4
Perceptions Index of 2010 shows an improvement of 19 positions by Timor-Leste in
the past 12 months; and (ii) Timor-Leste was the third country worldwide to achieve
the status of full compliance with the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.
• Page 10, paragraph 21: The staff report says that “ambiguity as to who will be the
manager of the Petroleum Fund is likely to create uncertainty”. We highlight the fact
that the authorities propose to provide flexibility in the Petroleum Fund Law as to
which institution would be the Operational Manager of the Petroleum Fund in the
future. The Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) of Timor-Leste is currently
assigned to conduct this task, but the government proposes that it may be the future
Central Bank or any other public entity established by the National Parliament in the
future. This entity will be independent from the government, and there will be a clear
division of responsibilities between the overall manager of the Petroleum Fund (the
government) and the Operational Manager.
• Page 15, Box 1: The staff report says “In the medium run, the current account
surplus is projected to remain below its sustainable level by about 30 percent of the
GDP”. This seems to be a biased and non-clear normative approach for estimating the
“sustainable” level, especially when the surplus remains high at over 100 percent of
the non-oil GDP up to 2015.
• Page 25: Table on Medium-Term Outlook: A number of projections have been
made in the staff report of the Medium-Term Outlook for Timor-Leste during the
period, 2011-2015. The authorities have the following views on the projections:
(a)
Non-oil GDP growth rate: The average growth rate projected for the next
five years is 8.7 percent. However, the authorities are confident that attaining an
average of a double-digit growth rate over the period is feasible in light of the fact
that growth will start from a low base in a relatively small economy, and that
plans, policies, and institutions will be put in place to achieve this growth rate.
The growth rate will be driven by public capital spending, the increase of
agricultural productivity, and continued high growth in the industry and services
sector.
(b)
Domestic revenue: This is shown as remaining, more or less, constant at
11 percent of GDP up to 2015. The authorities are working with the target of 20
percent of GDP in the next five years.
(c)
Capital expenditure: Central government capital expenditure is projected
to reach a peak of 62 percent of the GDP in 2013 and then fall sharply to 44
percent by 2015. The authorities feel that the level of public investment as a
percentage of the non-oil GDP will decline less rapidly and that it will be
sustained by larger financing through domestic revenues. In addition, the better
prospects for private investment due to improved infrastructure and a business-

5
friendly environment will preserve the growth momentum.
(d)
Crude oil price: As already mentioned, the forecast for crude oil price, as
highlighted above, is conservative at $68 per barrel in 2011, rising to $81 by
2015. The price is already close to $90 per barrel and the outlook is bullish given
recovery in the world economy. A higher price of oil than projected will, of
course, mean a higher ESI, a larger balance in the Petroleum Fund, and a higher
surplus in the current account.
Overall, the authorities appreciate the fact that the staff report for the 2010 Article IV
Consultation recognizes the post-conflict strong economic recovery in this fragile state
since 2006, with significant reduction in the incidence of poverty and major strides in key
social indicators. However, the report is (again, proven by existing data) excessively
biased on the pessimistic side regarding the strong potential for a double-digit growth rate
in the medium- to long-run. The current momentum will be boosted by infrastructure and
human capital development (financed mostly by oil revenues), which will also be
promoted by the emergence of the nascent and dynamic private sector, especially the
industry and services. As this potential gets recognition by the international markets,
foreign direct investment could also flow into Timor-Leste. The transition from conflict
to development that has taken place amidst the recently found peace, stability, and
growth holds out the prospects that Timor-Leste will join the rank of upper middleincome countries within the next two decades, as envisioned by the SDP.
To conclude, we would like to express two very positive and encouraging assessments.
First, the UNDP 2010 Human Development Report has recently been released, and it
now ranks Timor-Leste at 120 out of 169 countries, based on 2009/2010 data. This
represents a spectacular improvement in Timor-Leste’s relative position (from 162 out of
182 countries, based on 2007 data, in UNDP 2009 Human Development Report). In the
process, Timor-Leste has made an important transition from a low level of human
development to a medium level of human development. Second, the recent MEASURE
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) 2009-10 project — funded by the US Agency
for International Development (USAID) — reveals a significantly more positive
assessment on key social and human development indicators.
These two positive assessments further encourage the authorities’ revealed determination
to continue the implementation of a very ambitious reform agenda in order to develop the
country and profit both the current and future generations, and reveals that this strategy is
already paying off. Good results only mean that it is possible to reach the end of the path
faster. The recent achievements in poverty reduction and growth are very encouraging,
but there is still a challenging path ahead, and, therefore, the authorities of Timor-Leste
invite the international community’s involvement in the current strong momentum.
