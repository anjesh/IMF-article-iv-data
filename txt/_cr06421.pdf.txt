September 26, 2006
•

A staff team visited Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during June 6–22, 2006 to conduct
the 2006 Article IV Consultation discussions. The team comprised Mr. Molho
(Head), Mmes. Baker and Tumbarello (all APD) and Mr. Ahmed (PDR), and was
assisted by Mr. Lee, Senior Resident Representative. Ms. Phang (Executive Director)
and Mr. Duong (OED) attended some of the policy meetings.

•

Vietnam’s data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, but staff’s
analysis continues to be hampered by shortcomings in certain areas. At the time of the
mission, data on the monetary accounts and international reserves were available with
a three-month lag. Important weaknesses also remain in the areas of public finance,
the balance of payments, national accounts, and SOE and SOCB operations.

•

Vietnam accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and 4 with effect from
November 8, 2005, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Overall macroeconomic performance has remained strong since the conclusion
of the last Article IV consultation. Real GDP rose by 8.4 percent in 2005, and the
balance of payments has remained in comfortable surplus, led by rising oil prices and
a sustained expansion of non-oil exports. The year-on-year (yoy) rate of inflation has
edged down from 8¾ percent in December 2005 to 7½ percent in August.

•

Fiscal policy was eased considerably in 2005, and it seems set to be eased further
in 2006. Despite the oil revenue windfall, expenditure growth has outpaced revenues,
spurred by increasing public sector wages and oil subsidies, and a surge in off-budget
investment and net lending. The 2006 budget implies a continuation of these trends.

•

The rate of growth of credit to the economy fell to 21 percent (yoy) as of June
2006, as state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) endeavored to meet the State Bank
of Vietnam’s (SBV) new prudential standards. However, the increase in official
reserves has given rise to ample excess bank liquidity.

•

The authorities have introduced market-opening legislation in line with WTO
requirements, but SOCB and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms remained
uneven.

Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
•

The short-term outlook is broadly positive, but medium-term prospects are
subject to risks. Inflation is likely to remain higher and more entrenched than in
most other Asian countries; growth is to continue to be led by public investment,
whose quality is uncertain; and public debt is projected to remain on a path of
increase in relation to GDP.

•

A part of the large oil windfall should be saved in 2006 and 2007, and the non-oil
deficit placed on a declining trend over the medium term. The appraisal and
monitoring of all publicly-funded investment projects should be strengthened.

•

To guard against a premature easing of monetary policy, excess bank liquidity
needs to be mopped up. Adequate prudential measure should also be introduced to
manage potential new risks associated with banks’ off-balance-sheet transactions and
stock-market related lending.

•

The staff supports the SBV’s plan to establish a more flexible exchange rate
regime.

•

SOCB reform remains key to medium-term debt sustainability. A realistic
valuation of existing nonperforming loans (NPLs) is an indispensable first step
toward developing credible bank reform plans.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
The consultation took place against the backdrop of the June session of the
National Assembly (NA), which approved a new Socio-economic Development Plan
(SEDP) for 2006–2010. The new SEDP has reaffirmed the “socialist orientation” of the
economy, with the state sector expected to continue to play a leading role in the promotion of
industrialization and economic development (Annex I).
2.
Vietnam has achieved impressive economic performance over the past decade.
With the help of broadly prudent macroeconomic management and a gradual opening of the
economy, its growth has outperformed that of most other low-income countries. Poverty has
remained on a rapidly declining path, falling from 32½ percent in 2002 to 23 percent in 2004,
and most social indicators of development recorded large gains (Table 1).
3.
The prospects for continued strong economic performance in the period ahead
are reasonably bright, but there are also risks. WTO accession, which is expected to
occur soon, is likely to create new opportunities and risks. With the right policies, Vietnam
could become one of the most attractive destinations for foreign investment. Nonetheless,
important challenges will have to be overcome to support the achievement of the new
SEDP’s objectives.
4.
The consultation discussion focused on how to address these challenges. The
discussions emphasized the need for (i) prudent macroeconomic policies to stem inflationary
pressures and preserve

A. Economic Developments
5.
Overall macroeconomic performance has remained strong since the conclusion
of the last Article IV consultation. Real GDP growth rose to 8.4 percent in 2005, spurred
by strong domestic and external demand, including heavy public investment in support of the
ambitious growth target of the SEDP for 2001–2005 (Figure 1 and Table 2). While public
investment leveled off in the first half of 2006, export growth picked up and domestic
consumption remained strong.

6.
The expansion of aggregate demand, together with rising world commodity
prices, has hampered efforts to bring down inflation. The year-on-year (yoy) rate of
inflation declined from 8¾ percent in December 2005 to 7½ percent in August, as food price
inflation eased. However, inflation has become more broadly based and it remains well
above the rates prevailing in Vietnam’s major trading partners. Large increases in public
sector wages have reportedly led to second-round effects on private sector wages, and core
inflation, as proxied by nonfood inflation net of fuel costs, has been creeping up, despite the
authorities’ efforts to keep a lid on administered prices.1 2
7.
The balance of payments has remained in comfortable surplus. Although nonoil export growth slowed in the first half of 2005, exports rebounded in the second half of the
year, led by a marked recovery in garment exports, together with sharp increases in exports
of wood and plastic products, electronic items, and agricultural goods (Figure 2). Non-oil
1

Domestic oil prices were raised in April and August 2006 by a cumulative 18.5 percent on average. Following
these adjustments, the pass-through of international oil prices since end-2003 could be deemed to have been
complete as of end-August 2006 for gasoline and kerosene, but incomplete for diesel (at about 72 percent).
However, with diesel accounting for 65 percent of Vietnam’s oil imports, subsidies to oil traders are projected
to remain at around 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006. The regulated prices of some other key items such as
electricity, coal, and cement have not been adjusted to limit the short-term impact on inflation, but the
authorities consider this to be a temporary measure. A more detailed analysis of the recent causes of inflation is
provided in Chapter I of the Selected Issues paper.
2

Average civil service wages were raised by 30 percent in October 2004, and the common minimum wage,
which is the basis for the determination of civil service salaries and pensions and sets a floor for salaries of
employees of SOEs and non-FDI private enterprises, was raised by 21 percent in October 2005. The common
minimum wage is slated to increase by another 28½ percent in October 2006, in line with the government’s
Master Program on Public Administration Reform.

6
import growth also slowed in 2005, reflecting in part increasing import substitution in the
energy and steel sectors. The resulting improvement in the current account, together with
strong inflows of official development assistance (ODA) and foreign direct investment (FDI),
helped increase gross official reserves from US$6.3 billion at end-2004 to US$8.6 billion as
of end-2005 (Table 3). Exports continued to grow briskly in 2006, and gross official reserves
continued to rise, reaching a level of almost $11 billion as of end-June.
8.
Fiscal policy was eased considerably in 2005. Despite the oil revenue windfall,
the narrowly-defined official budget balance shifted from a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in
2004 to a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2005. Expenditure was spurred by increasing
public sector wages and oil subsidies, and a surge in off-budget investment and net lending
further boosted total outlays to nearly 32 percent of GDP, up from 29½ percent of GDP in
2004. The overall deficit (in accordance with the IMF’s definition, which includes on-lending
through the Development Assistance Fund (DAF) and off-budget investment) rose from less
than 3 percent of GDP in 2004 to almost 6 percent of GDP in 2005.3 The non-oil deficit
widened more markedly to 14½ percent of GDP, while the stock of public debt rose to
43½ percent of GDP as of end-2005 (Figure 3 and Table 4).
9.
The rate of growth of credit to the economy fell from more than 30 percent in
2005 to 21 percent (yoy) as of June 2006. New lending fell sharply as SOCBs endeavored
to meet the SBV’s new prudential standards. However, bank liquidity was boosted as a result
of the already-mentioned increase in official reserves, and reserve money growth increased to
31 percent (yoy) as of June (Figure 4 and Table 5). The SBV’s policy rates were raised by
about ½ percentage point in December 2005, and have remained unchanged since then (with
the discount rate at 4½ percent, the refinancing rate at 6½ percent and the base rate at
8¼ percent). However, open market operation (OMO) rates have fallen to 2-3 percent in
recent months, as sales of SBV bills have fallen short of absorbing banks’ excess reserves.
While bank lending rates have remained flat, deposit rates have been under upward pressure,
reflecting intensified competition for funds among joint stock banks, which have ample
capital adequacy.4
10.
The dong remained broadly stable relative to the U.S. dollar during the first
eight months of 2006. No pre-announced maximum depreciation has been set for 2006 (as
against a limit of 1 percent a year in 2004 and 2005). However, given the rate’s limited shortterm variability, Vietnam’s exchange rate continues to be classified as a de facto peg
according to the IMF’s criteria. Vietnam’s inflation differential relative to trading partners,
together with movements in major currencies, led to a large appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) of the dong (by 13 percent) in 2005, which was partly reversed in the
first eight months of 2006.

Box 3 (p.10).
4

While the growth of credit extended by SOCBs, which accounted for around 69 percent of outstanding loans
as of end-2005, slowed to 15½ percent (yoy) as of May, the growth of credit extended by joint stock banks has
remained buoyant (about 40 percent as of May 2006).

7
11.
Good progress has been made over the last year in adopting market-opening
measures required for WTO compliance. The new Common Investment Law (CIL) and
Unified Enterprise Law (UEL) were approved in November 2005. The implementing
regulations that are now being finalized should help level the playing field between domestic
and foreign investors and private businesses and SOEs. Vietnam has now completed all
bilateral negotiations and hopes to accede to the WTO shortly.
12.
Progress in banking sector reform has remained uneven. The SBV issued new
prudential standards in April 2005, and the SOCBs were initially to produce financial
statements based on the new standards by end-July 2005; on that basis, NPL resolution and
SOCB recapitalization plans were to be prepared by end-2005. However, the development of
these plans has been delayed by difficulties in implementing the new standards. With
reported discrepancies between SOCBs’ initial NPL estimates and those of international
auditors, the size of potential contingent liabilities remains uncertain. An equitization plan for
the Vietcombank was approved by the Prime Minister in September 2005, but the advisor for
the initial public offering has not yet been selected. The existing equitization plans for the
Vietcombank and the Mekong Housing Bank envisage limited participation by foreign
strategic investors and the retention of a controlling share by the state. However, the approval
in May of a comprehensive Banking Sector Reform Roadmap has reiterated the
government’s commitment to banking sector reform.
13.
Progress towards restructuring large SOEs has remained slow. While the
government issued a new directive in 2005 to step up SOE equitization in nonstrategic
sectors, and it established a new State Corporation of Investment Capital (SCIC) to manage
its stakes in equitized SOEs, equitized firms represented only 12 percent of SOE assets as of
end-2005. The transfer of assets to the SCIC, which was to become operational in January
2006, has yet to occur. In addition, the recent formation of eight “economic groups” that are
to remain wholly state-owned could complicate future SOE reform efforts.
B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
14.
The outlook for the rest of 2006 is positive. With public investment expected to
rebound in the second half of the year, and with the external environment remaining broadly
favorable, GDP growth is projected to be close to the official target of 8 percent in 2006. The
rise in international oil prices, together with the continuing boom in non-oil exports, is
projected to keep the external current account in a small surplus. As ODA, FDI and private
capital inflows remain buoyant, reserves would rise to about 11 weeks of imports.
15.
Medium-term prospects are also favorable but subject to risks. WTO accession
should create new opportunities for growth of non-oil exports and FDI, and high oil prices
should continue to underpin the public finances. However, greater exposure to global
competition following WTO accession could pose challenges for SOEs operating in sectors
that still benefit from protective tariffs or subsidies. Major risks to the outlook would stem
from expansionary macroeconomic policies or delays in needed reforms. Expansionary
policies could spur inflation, exert pressure on reserves, and ultimately erode confidence in
the dong. Although capital inflows are still dominated by relatively stable FDI and ODA,
private capital flows are being progressively liberalized (see below) and the dollarization of

8
the financial system, together with the de facto peg of the dong, makes the balance of
payments vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment.5 These risks would be heightened by
delays in SOE and SOCB reform, as the low quality of investment would constrain growth,
and the government’s contingent liabilities would rise. On the external front, key risks
include a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy; a disorderly adjustment of global
imbalances, which could reduce investors’ appetite for risk; and a fall in international oil
prices.
16.
Some of these risks are highlighted in the staff’s medium-term scenario and
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) framework (Table 6 and Annex VII). Implementation
of the state sector investment program of the SEDP would likely keep the overall deficit at a
level of 5½ – 6½ percent of GDP over the medium term, with the stock of public debt rising
to around 50 percent of GDP by 2010. As long as the external environment and real
economic performance remain favorable, Vietnam would face a low risk of debt distress,
with all external debt burden indicators remaining below the applicable thresholds.6
However, the total debt burden could become onerous over the long run in the absence of
measures to rein in public spending, especially if oil prices were to ease. This, in turn, could
eventually lead to a crowding out of high-priority public expenditures, and threaten the
SEDP’s growth and poverty reduction efforts.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The discussions focused on the need to strike a balance between the pursuit of
the SEDP’s short-term targets and the promotion of higher-quality, sustainable growth.
The authorities were concerned that too great a focus on short-term growth could hinder
macroeconomic stabilization, and slow the pace of improvement of investment quality. They
were also mindful of the risks posed by continuing high inflation, which could erode external
competitiveness. The authorities and the staff agreed that the maintenance of price stability
and medium-term debt sustainability would be key to the achievement of the SEDP’s
objectives. At the same time, the authorities cautioned that the need to meet the economy’s
investment needs limited the scope for the adoption of tighter macroeconomic policies.
A. Fiscal Policy
18.
The 2006 budget, together with approved off-budget expenditure, would imply
a further expansion of the fiscal deficit from its already high level in 2005. While the
recent run-up in oil prices is projected to generate a large revenue windfall relative to the
2006 budget, a part of this windfall was already being spent to finance subsidies to oil traders
resulting from the less-than-complete pass-through to domestic prices. This, together with a
planned sovereign issue in late 2006 for purposes of on-lending to SOEs, would lead to a
further increase in total expenditure and net lending. The overall deficit would rise by about

reserves, taking into account the effects of dollarization and the prospective liberalization of the capital account.

and beyond. The staff
cautioned that a
continuing deterioration of the fiscal position could hinder efforts to stem inflation in the
short run, and prove difficult to reverse over the medium term. The staff therefore
recommended that the government save some of its large oil windfall in 2006 and 2007, and
try to place the non-oil deficit on a declining path thereafter.
20.
The authorities questioned the team’s interpretation of fiscal policy trends. As
regards the definition of the fiscal deficit, they viewed it as inappropriate to consider onlending through the DAF as akin to fiscal expenditure. The DAF and its successor institution,
the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), enjoyed a considerable degree of financial
autonomy. The VDB is expected to service its debts in full, even though these debts will
continue to be guaranteed by the government. The staff agreed that, if the VDB is eventually
granted full autonomy in selecting its loan portfolio, develops a capacity to operate under
market principles, and has a good track record of loan repayment, its operations can
legitimately be excluded from the staff’s broad definition of the overall deficit. However, as
long as VDB’s debt is guaranteed by the government, it would still need to be included in
data on public and publicly-guaranteed debt for purposes of assessing debt sustainability,
21.
The authorities also questioned the appropriateness of saving the oil windfall.
In their view, a country at Vietnam’s stage of development, which faces huge gaps in public
infrastructure, would be better off using the windfall upfront to increase investment. They
noted that the SEDP viewed the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks as key to fostering
private investment and sustained growth.
22.
The staff recognized the need to meet Vietnam’s infrastructure needs, but also
noted the need to protect medium-term debt sustainability. Oil revenues are projected to
level off over the medium term, even if oil prices remain at the current high level, and nonoil
7

In the staff’s view, the non-oil deficit is a more accurate gauge of the short-term thrust of fiscal policy than the
overall balance when oil revenues are subject to large exogenous shocks, and it could be a useful measure of the
structural imbalance that could emerge once oil export receipts level off.

10
revenues could come under pressure (see below). While Vietnam’s public debt is low relative
to other low-income countries, a high deficit, if it continues unabated, could strain the
government’s debt servicing capacity. Indeed, most emerging and low-income countries in
Asia have taken advantage of improving growth prospects and revenue overperformance in
recent years to curb budget deficits and reduce the vulnerability of their fiscal positions.
Against this background, the team recommended that public wage increases be limited to
those included in the budget and accompanied, where possible, by retrenchment. In addition,
increases in world oil prices should be passed through more fully.8 The authorities agreed
that there was a need to contain the growth in current expenditure, and indicated that the
large estimated increase in the wage bill over the last few years was partly attributable to a
monetization of benefits. However, they explained that improving the remuneration of civil
servants was a key objective, which the government was committed to achieve under its
public administration reform program.9
23.
The authorities attach great importance to the need to upgrade the quality of
public investment. This is especially the case in construction projects, where the rate of
leakage and waste may be as high as 20-40 percent of total investment according to some
estimates.10 The allegations of misuse of ODA in Project Management Unit 18 of the
Ministry of Transport have sensitized the NA and the donor community to this issue. A Law
on Corruption Prevention and Control and a Law on Practicing Thrift and Combating
Wastefulness were passed in November 2005. The team also recommended that lending
through the VDB be scaled back until its loan and risk appraisal capacity is improved and an
adequate supervisory framework for its operations is in place, and cautioned against an
expansion of indirect financing of SOE investment, especially in areas where project
evaluation and monitoring mechanisms were weak. The authorities agreed that care needs to
be taken to avoid the issuance of government guarantees and indicated that they were about
to issue new guidelines to safeguard the quality of SOE investment projects.

8

Subsequently, domestic oil prices were raised by 9-9 ½ percent in August, and the authorities have announced
a plan to phase out remaining oil subsidies by 2008.
9

The reform aims to decompress the wage structure to strengthen the government’s capacity to retain and
attract high-quality staff; provide a decent living standard for employees that earn the common minimum wage;
and improve transparency through the monetization of a number of fringe benefits.

24.
The authorities are wary that the reduction of customs duties in line with
international commitments, together with the shift of the tax base to the harder-to-tax
private sector, could pose risks to revenue going forward. Although official information
on the timetable for the implementation of customs duty reductions was not available, the
authorities expected the net effect on revenues to be neutral over the medium term as the
volume of imports picks up. However, prospects for receipts from the SOE sector were more
uncertain. While income taxes are to be reformed over the medium term, and tax incentives
streamlined, these measures are expected to be revenue neutral at best. In light of the positive
results to date under the tax self-assessment pilot, the team encouraged the authorities to
strengthen tax administration by rolling out the self-assessment program throughout the
country as soon as possible. Supporting measures could include a functional reorganization
of the General Department of Taxation (GDT), creation of a large taxpayer office, and
passage of the new tax administration law, in line with FAD recommendations.
25.
While the management of the hitherto largely concessional external public
debt has been prudent, the authorities recognize the need for a more disciplined public
sector borrowing strategy as opportunities for borrowing on capital markets expand.
The recent introduction of Decree 134 on the control and repayment of foreign loans is an
important step toward unified oversight of Vietnam’s external debt and the development of a

12
medium and long-term debt strategy. The government also plans to set up a single unit to
consolidate the monitoring of all domestic and external debts.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
The SBV’s revised monetary program for 2006 targets a deceleration of credit
growth to 20 percent by end-2006. The team supported the authorities’ aim to slow credit
growth and welcomed the increased caution exercised by the SOCBs in their new lending.
However, given a still large amount of excess bank liquidity, there is a risk that credit growth
will resurge during the remainder of the year, especially if this proves necessary to ensure the
financing of strategic SOE projects.11 Additional challenges may be posed by banks’
potential new off-balance sheet risks, such as the issuance of guarantees for SOE bonds, and
stock market-related lending. The authorities acknowledged that bank financing for many
large SOE projects was likely to materialize in the coming months. However, the conflicting
mandates faced by the SBV will constrain its room for maneuver in the conduct of monetary
policy at least until the reforms set forth in the Banking Sector Reform Roadmap are
implemented (see below). The authorities shared the staff’s concerns about the risks posed by
stock-market related lending. To contain these risks, the SBV recently issued new regulations
to tighten the monitoring and control over lending for the purchase of shares.
27.
Consistent with the Board’s advice during the last Article IV consultation, the
SBV is pursuing a roadmap toward a more flexible exchange rate regime. Under this
roadmap, trading bands on foreign exchange trading are to be gradually loosened, capital
account transactions progressively liberalized, and the dong made fully convertible by 2010.
An early step in this process was taken in July, when the SBV allowed a small joint-stock
bank to set its own buy-sell rates for cash transactions on a pilot basis. The team strongly
supported these developments. To be sure, the de facto peg of the dong may have been a
useful nominal anchor in recent years, and the level of the exchange rate does not appear to
be misaligned to any significant extent (Box 2).12 Nevertheless, going forward, greater
exchange rate flexibility would encourage improved management of exchange rate risk, and
protect external stability, as the economy opens itself to global competition and private
capital. In the team’s view, the current strength of the external position offers a window of
opportunity for the adoption of early measures to enhance exchange rate flexibility. The
authorities cautioned, however, that further steps to increase flexibility will need to be
accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of the foreign exchange market.

11

The monetary transmission mechanism in Vietnam operates under a mix of direct channels and market
mechanisms. For a discussion of the resulting challenges for monetary policy, see IMF Country Report
No. 06/22, Box 2 (p. 8).
12

Chapter III of the Selected Issues paper includes an effort to assess the extent to which recent movements in
the real effective exchange rate may be indicative of misalignment.

13
C. Structural Reform
Financial Sector Reform
28.
The staff welcomed the recent approval of the government’s Banking Sector
Reform Roadmap. Under this roadmap, the restructuring of commercial banks is to be
accelerated, with all SOCBs to be gradually equitized and with international prudential
standards to be applied by 2010. The SBV is to be converted into a modern central bank,
with greater autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy, and a mandate to protect the value
of the currency, control inflation, ensure the safety of the monetary and banking system, and
create a favorable macroeconomic environment for growth and development. Importantly,
the SBV will no longer represent the ownership rights of the state in the administration of
SOCBs, thus removing a potential conflict with its supervisory role. These reforms are to be
incorporated in new draft legislation to be considered by the NA in 2008.
29.
Vietnam’s commitment under the WTO to liberalize foreign entry into its
banking system from April 2007 has heightened the urgency of bank reform. While the
entry of foreign banks would be unlikely to threaten the survival of the SOCBs, it would
probably increase competition for prime bank customers and make it more difficult to
improve their profitability. The team stressed the importance of ensuring the accuracy of
banks’ reports prior to finalizing the NPL resolution and bank recapitalization plans. To
guard against a renewed buildup of NPLs, the SOCBs’ mandate to operate on sound market
principles should be effectively enforced, with their managers given more operational
autonomy and incentives to improve corporate governance, residual policy lending
discontinued, and loans for already-approved SOE projects extended only under government
guarantee. Implementation of SOCB equitization should also be accelerated, and enlarged
scope provided for participation by foreign strategic investors. The authorities noted that the
ongoing strengthening of SBV’s prudential regulations, together with SOCBs’ efforts to
tighten their internal control and audit systems, were already bearing fruit. In addition, the
possibility of increasing the maximum allowed participation in equitized banks by foreign
strategic investors was under consideration.
SOE Reform
30.
The need for SOE reform has also taken on new urgency ahead of WTO
accession. The authorities are aware that a number of hitherto protected SOEs may need to
take painful adjustment measures to survive in a market-based environment. A recentlycompleted performance-based SOE rating exercise had been a welcome first step in the
establishment of appropriate restructuring plans. The staff urged the authorities to speed up
equitization of larger SOEs and the transfer of SOE assets to the SCIC. The SCIC should be
given clear guidelines for the appointment of SOE Board members, and SOE managers
granted operational autonomy and made subject to strict and transparent accountability
mechanisms. The authorities agreed with these recommendations. However, they noted that a
lack of capacity for accurately valuing large SOEs was hampering implementation and that
consideration was being given to contracting international valuation firms.

14
Trade Liberalization and Private Sector Development
31.
The staff strongly supported Vietnam’s efforts to secure WTO accession and
urged the authorities to build on their good progress on legislative measures by creating
a more enabling environment for private sector-led growth. To this end, it will be
important that the implementing regulations for the CIL and UEL remove concerns about
provisions that might open the door for government interference in private investment
decisions. The staff welcomed recent and prospective reductions in tariff rates in line with
commitments under the AFTA, the WTO, and other trade agreements. In light of a still-high
average tariff rate, the authorities should also continue to liberalize trade on an MFN basis.
32.
The government’s public investment program, together with SOEs’ dominant
role in some industries, may have discouraged private investment in the past. To
improve the quality of investment and growth, the authorities are taking steps to encourage
private investment in infrastructure projects. A draft decree was recently submitted to the
government to clarify procedures for the approval of projects undertaken by public-private
partnerships (PPPs). The team welcomed these initiatives, but also urged the authorities to
take steps to ensure an appropriate division of risks between the private and public sectors, so
as to limit possible risks to fiscal sustainability. Among other things, this will require
establishment of a strong regulatory environment to negotiate and enforce PPPs.
D. Other Issues
33.
Vietnam’s ongoing global integration calls for stepped up efforts to improve
the quality, transparency, and dissemination of economic data. While progress has been
made on the coverage of budget and external public debt, further improvements are needed in
the areas of off-budget activities, domestic debt statistics, and contingent liabilities.
Weaknesses also need to be addressed in the monitoring of portfolio and other private capital
inflows, and SOE and SOCB operations. Improvements in the timeliness and dissemination
of data on foreign exchange reserves and the monetary accounts will also be key to a more
efficient functioning of financial markets as the exchange rate system is liberalized.
34.
The staff encouraged the authorities to speed up the issuance of implementing
regulations for the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law, and move forward in drafting
an amendment to the criminal code on Combating the Financing of Terrorism. The
authorities were wary that the burden of certain AML provisions could lead to
disintermediation, and requested LEG technical assistance to help address these concerns.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Vietnam has achieved sustained robust growth and made great strides in poverty
reduction over the last few years. Nonetheless, the transition to a market-based system is far
from complete, and important challenges are yet to be overcome if the government is to
achieve its goal of graduation from low-income status by 2010. While WTO accession
should create enhanced opportunities, it is also likely to add an element of uncertainty going
forward, heightening the need for vigilant macroeconomic policies, and for faster reforms to
improve the economy’s efficiency.

15
36.
The short-term outlook is broadly positive, but medium-term prospects are subject
to risks. Growth in 2006 is projected to remain robust, and the balance of payments should
continue to record a large surplus. However, inflation is likely to remain higher and more
entrenched than in most other Asian countries; growth is expected to continue to rely heavily
on public investment, whose quality remains uncertain; and public debt is projected to remain
on a path of increase in relation to GDP.
37.
The economy’s strong cyclical position, the need to rein in inflation, and the
concerns about the quality of public investment all call for a strong effort to minimize any
further increase in the fiscal deficit. While the fiscal stance implicit in the new SEDP is
unlikely to lead to debt problems on current trends, a rising debt burden could lead to a
crowding out of poverty-reducing outlays if external conditions become less favorable. To
create more fiscal space for contingencies, expenditure growth needs to be reined in, and the
non-oil deficit placed on a declining trend. The staff welcomes the recent adjustment in oil
prices, and the authorities’ plan to eliminate oil subsidies by 2008. Wage increases also need
to be restrained, and efforts to improve the screening and quality of new investment projects
intensified. The recently approved legislation to curb corruption and prevent the waste of
public funds should facilitate this task, if effective implementing regulations can be put in
place soon. To shore up donor and investor support, additional steps should be taken to
introduce more transparent accounting and reporting for the government’s extra-budgetary
operations and strengthen procedures for the appraisal and monitoring of publicly-funded
investment projects. Reforms to improve tax administration, in line with FAD
recommendations, will also be essential to guard against potential risks associated with
declining revenues.
38.
The staff welcomes the significant recent deceleration of credit growth. Slowing
credit expansion should help contain inflation and slow the growth of banks’ nonperforming
loans. However, ample excess bank liquidity could lead to a quick reversal of the recent
trend. To guard against a premature easing of monetary policy, excess bank liquidity needs to
be mopped up and OMO rates allowed to increase significantly. At the same time, adequate
prudential measures should be introduced to better manage potential new risks associated
with banks’ off-balance-sheet transactions and stock-market related lending.
39.
The staff commends the authorities for the recent removal of remaining restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, and
acceptance of Article VIII obligations, and it supports their plan to move towards full
convertibility of the dong by 2010. The recent piloting of negotiated cash transactions is a
welcome first step toward the authorities’ goal of establishing a more flexible exchange rate
regime. While the exchange rate does not currently seem to be misaligned to any significant
extent, greater exchange rate flexibility would serve to better cushion the economy from
external shocks, and encourage market participants to improve their management of
exchange rate risks. The usefulness of the exchange rate as a shock absorber is likely to
become increasingly important as the economy becomes progressively more open to
portfolio capital flows in the period ahead.
40.
SOCB reform is key to ensuring debt sustainability and improving the allocation of
savings and investment. The staff welcomes the recent approval of the authorities’ Banking

16
Sector Reform Roadmap, and strongly supports the plans to accelerate SOCB reform and
convert the SBV into a modern central bank. A realistic valuation of existing NPLs is an
indispensable first step toward developing credible NPL resolution and bank recapitalization
plans. To guard against a renewed build-up of NPLs, SOCB operations should be placed on a
sound commercial basis, with their managers given a greater degree of operational autonomy.
Equitization could also have a salutary effect on SOCB governance, if it provides adequate
scope for participation by strategic foreign investors.
41.
SOE reform is an integral part of the move to a more efficient, market-oriented
economy. The prospect of WTO accession has increased the urgency of reforms of SOEs to
prepare them to meet the challenges of exposure to global competition. Accordingly,
government interference in SOEs’ management decisions should be discontinued without
delay, and SOE operations placed on a commercial basis. Managers should be granted the
autonomy to make their own pricing and investment decisions subject to strict and
transparent accountability mechanisms. As in the case of SOCBs, faster equitization of larger
SOEs could be a useful vehicle for the introduction of improved management practices,
provided that there is adequate scope for participation by interested strategic investors.
42.
An open trade and investment regime and a simple and transparent regulatory
environment will be key to promoting private sector-led growth. Implementing regulations
for the CIL and UEL should be put in place to level the playing field as soon as possible,
with adequate provisions to simplify and reduce bureaucratic requirements, so as to guard
against any inadvertent increase in government intervention in private investment decisions.
43.
Good economic and financial statistics are essential to provide high-quality and
timely input to the authorities for their policy decisions and improve interactions with
markets. Building on recent improvements in budget and external public debt data, the
authorities need to develop more comprehensive data on all off-budget investment funded
through the issuance of government and municipal bonds, domestic and external debt of
state-owned institutions, and the associated contingent government liabilities. A strong effort
is also warranted to improve the timeliness, coverage, and dissemination of monetary,
balance of payments, and official reserve data, so as to bring them closer into line with the
standards expected of a market economy.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Vietnam take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I
The Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006–10
In its May-June session, the National Assembly approved the new Socio-Economic
Development Plan (SEDP) for the period 2006–10, which had been endorsed by the newlyformed Politburo in April. The overarching goal of the SEDP is to maintain high economic
growth in support of Vietnam’s graduation from low-income status by end-2010. The SEDP
will also become the authorities’ new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), with an associated
monitoring framework covering its four main pillars: economic development and poverty
reduction, social inclusion, environmental protection, and improving governance.
The new SEDP reaffirms the socialist orientation of the economy and the prominent role of
the state in promoting investment-led growth, which could create tension with the objective
of transition to a market-based system. Total investment is targeted to rise to an average of
40 percent of GDP over 2006–10. The enlarged public sector, including government and
SOEs, would account for just under half of this investment (19.4 percent of GDP), modestly
lower than under the previous SEDP. The implicit rise in the incremental capital-output ratio
(ICOR) over the period 2006–10 suggests that there may be significant scope to improve the
quality of investment.

Even at the currently-projected high oil prices and continued strong growth, and assuming
that the government will take steps to restrain the future growth of current expenditure,
implementation of the investment program contained in the SEDP would raise the overall
fiscal deficit to an average of more than 6 percent of GDP through 2010. As a result, public
sector debt (excluding contingent liabilities) would increase by about 6½ percentage points
of GDP to approach the authorities’ notional ceiling of 50 percent of GDP by 2010. While
the rising level of debt should not pose serious risks to medium-term debt sustainability given
the continued high, albeit falling, level of concessionality of external debt, this assessment is
subject to risks. In particular, inadequate progress towards slowing the growth of non-interest
current expenditure or a decline in oil prices could result in a significantly more rapid buildup of public debt, which could place strains on the budget down the road (see Annex VI).

30
ANNEX II
External Competitiveness
While the limited availability of reliable wage and price data makes it difficult to assess Vietnam’s
competitiveness with accuracy, the available indicators suggest that external competitiveness remains adequate.
However, going forward, structural reforms and improved infrastructure will be required to ensure that
competitiveness will not be eroded as Vietnam’s global trade and financial integration intensifies.
Recent external sector performance provides a picture
of adequate competitiveness. During 2002–2005, nonoil exports, including a large component of laborintensive manufacturing products, grew by more than
20 percent a year on average. As a result, Vietnam’s
share of both total world exports and exports from Asia
has remained on an upward trend.
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) of
the dong has fluctuated significantly over the last few
years without exhibiting any noticeable long-term
trend. The REER reverted close to its 2001 level in
recent months, following a period of depreciation in
2002–04. These movements appear to have been
broadly in line with fundamentals, including the effects
of Vietnam’s significant opening up of its trade system
from 2001 onwards. The more recent appreciation of
the REER does not appear to have affected export
performance to date, as noted above, and it has been
accompanied by strong private capital inflows, low
sovereign risk premia, and a robust balance of
payments.

However, micro-level data provide a more nuanced
picture. Cross-country firm-level survey data compiled
by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO)
show that monthly wages of Vietnamese workers in

competitiveness could be eroded in the absence of

strain if delays in SOE reform undermine the viability of major SOE sectors following WTO accession.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:

On February 25, 1999 the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) revised the operation of the
interbank foreign exchange market. Under this regime, the SBV allows interbank foreign exchange
market rates to fluctuate by a maximum of ±0.25 percent a day (effective July 2002) from the
previous day’s average interbank market rate.
While Vietnam officially maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime, the exchange
rate has de facto been pegged to the U.S. dollar since August 2004. The SBV governor made

32
announcements in August 2004 and January 2005 that annual exchange rate depreciation would be
limited to one percent, and the dong in fact depreciated by 1 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in 2004
and by 0.8 percent in 2005. Although the authorities have not made any announcement to date
regarding the expected movement of the exchange rate in 2006, the dong/U.S. dollar rate remained
virtually unchanged during January-April 2006. Given that the Fund’s exchange arrangement
classification is based on de facto and not de jure policies, Vietnam is now classified as maintaining
a conventional fixed peg.
Vietnam accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and 4 with effect November 8,
2005. Vietnam maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, and has notified the Fund of
those restrictions pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
VIII. Article IV Consultations:
Vietnam is currently on a 12-month consultation cycle, subject to provisions of Board
Decision No. 12794-(02/76) of July 15, 2002. The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on
October 7, 2005.

ANNEX IV
Vietnam—World Bank-IMF Relations13

Partnership in Vietnam’s Development Strategy
Vietnam’s reform agenda has been guided by a series of strategic plans and documents, including
the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), the 2001–2006 SocioEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) and the Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy.
The CPRGS, approved in 2002, represented a sharp improvement from earlier investment- and
production- focused planning documents. Rather than spelling out detailed sector-by-sector
production targets, the CPRGS focused on development outcomes such as poverty reduction and
other Vietnam Development Goals (VDGs). Empirical evidence and a broad consultation process
were used to identify the policies best suited to attaining those development outcomes. Efforts
were also made to “cost” these policies and to align resources towards their attainment. A set of
monitoring indicators was developed to assess implementation. The CPRGS was “expanded” in
December 2003 to better address policies related to large-scale infrastructure. Broadly speaking,
the CPRGS structures the reform agenda around three main pillars: completing the transition to a
market economy, ensuring social inclusion and environmental sustainability, and building
modern governance.
Since then, several policy breakthroughs have contributed to shape reforms. In 2003, the
decision was made to accede to the WTO as early as possible, making global integration one of
the main drivers of domestic reform. In 2004, a new approach to the fight against corruption was
adopted, one emphasizing transparency and the strengthening of government systems. In 2005,
the decision was made to reform the banking system, separating the management of banks from
their supervision and aiming at the creation of a modern central bank.
A Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the CPRGS was discussed by the Boards of the IMF and the
World Bank in mid-2002. The Government has produced three CPRGS Progress Reports on an
annual basis, starting in November 2003. These Reports evaluate performance on economic
growth and poverty reduction, review policy implementation and identify the challenges ahead.
Joint Staff Assessments or Joint Staff Advisory Notes (JSANs) for these Progress Reports have
been distributed to the Boards of the IMF and World Bank in 2004–2006.
The IMF has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies and has been
active on a set of structural issues, especially trade, banking, and SOE reform, because of their
potential impact on macroeconomic stability. The IMF’s three-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) expired in April 2004.
The World Bank has taken the lead in supporting the Government’s structural and institutional
reforms in a number of sectors. These wide ranging reforms cover the three broad pillars of the
CPRGS and are backed by a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSCs). The PRSCs
provide resources directly to the government’s budget. The recently concluded PRSC cycle
(PRSCs 1 to 5) covered a five-year period, much the same as the CPRGS and the last SEDP.

36
With the CPRGS approach being integrated into the preparation of the next SEDP (2006–2010),
future PRSCs are proposed to be aligned to the implementation of this new five-year plan.

World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group employs a broad range of instruments to support the objectives laid out
by the CPRGS and other key strategies of the Government. They include analytical and advisory
activities; IDA investment projects; PRSCs; IFC’s equity, loan and TA participations; Mekong
Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) activities; and donor partnerships and ODA coordination. IDA credits provide policy,
institutional and physical investment support for Vietnam’s development and structural reforms,
with PRSCs used as vehicles for policy dialogue.
An update of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), presented to the World Bank Board in
January 2004, set out the planned support until FY06. The World Bank Group is now in the
process of drafting a new CAS covering the period from FY07 to FY11. The new CAS will be in
support of the SEDP for 2006–2010.
The implementation of the ambitious reform agenda spelled out in CPRGS and other strategies
and plans has been supported through PRSC operations. PRSC 1, a two-tranche operation for
US$250 million, was approved by the Board in June 2001, based on an Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The focus of PRSC 1 was mainly on the structural reform
agenda, with policies articulated around five main areas: liberalizing trade, reforming SOEs,
strengthening the banking sector, creating an enabling environment for the private sector, and
improving the management and transparency of public finances. PRSC 2, a one-tranche operation
for US$ 100 million, was approved by the Board in June 2003. Under PRSC 2, based on the
CPRGS, the range of economic reforms supported was considerably broadened. In addition to the
mainly structural reforms covered by PRSC 1, this second credit included various policy actions
aimed at keeping development inclusive and building modern governance. Measures related to
education and health sectors, environmental sustainability, land management, legal development
and public financial management, were all part of PRSC 2. PRSC 3 and PRSC 4 were onetranche operations for US$100 million each. These were approved by the Board in June 2004 and
June 2005, respectively. Both of these later operations deepened the broad range of reforms
covered under PRSC 2. A fifth PRSC operation, the last one in this five-year cycle, was approved
by the Board of the World Bank in June 2006. PRSC 5 has the same sectoral coverage and
characteristics as its immediate predecessors.
In addition to providing resources to the budget, PRSC operations have served as an effective
coordination device, supported by an increasingly large number of donors. The Steering
Committee for PRSCs is led by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reforms, and
brings together representatives from most line ministries and several Government agencies. On
the donor side, PRSC operations have been co-financed by several bilateral and multilateral
agencies, either through grants or through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a
transition in the role of co-financiers, from providers of finance to partners substantially engaged
in the preparation of the operations and the policy dialogue with Government. This dialogue is
organized by policy areas, in which donors engage selectively, based on their interests and
technical capacity on the ground. All donors who seriously consider the possibility to partner in
this process are invited to participate in the preparation of PRSC operations, even if they cannot
commit to co-financing them in the short term.

37
The number of donors participating in this process has increased from four in PRSC 1 to seven in
PRSC 3 to nine in PRSC 4. As many as 11 bilateral and multilateral donors are expected to cofinance PRSC 5. Some of the participating donors contribute grant resources during the PRSC
process, whereas others set up parallel credits based on the same policy matrix. At present,
donors contribute about US$130 million per year, in addition to the US$100 disbursed by the
World Bank.
The World Bank group has assisted the government in the three pillars areas of the Government’s
reform program, identified above and in the CAS, by financing investment projects. Some of the
investment projects are listed in Table 1. Efforts to improve governance focus on public
financial management, information and transparency, combating corruption, and legal
development. Major technical assistance has been provided by the World Bank in each of these
areas, and IDA projects are being implemented in Public Financial Management and Customs
Modernization. So far, AsDB, UNDP, and a number of donors have taken the lead on public
administration and civil service reform, whereas the World Bank plays the leading role in public
financial management.
The volume of IDA lending has expanded over the past few years. In FY06, IDA’s overall
lending was $768 million. In light of the good Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) rating, the IDA annual allocation for Vietnam is expected to be close to $900 million for
FY07 and 08. Today, Vietnam is the largest IDA-only borrower and the second largest user of
IDA resources in the world after India. As of June 30, 2006 the total active IDA credits amounted
to US$4.1 billion, out of which US$1.3 billion had been disbursed.
The IFC and MIGA programs are also expected to grow significantly as the investment climate
improves. From 1992 to date, IFC has provided nearly $500 million in financing to more than
25 companies in a wide range of sectors, including finance, health care, education, information
technology, manufacturing, and agribusiness. The Mekong Private Sector Development Facility,
IFC’s multidonor-funded technical assistance initiative, has also been working in Vietnam since
1997 to reduce poverty through sustainable private sector development.
In addition to its lending program, the World Bank has been working on capacity-building and
knowledge-sharing in key areas of emphasis. The annual Vietnam Development Report (VDR),
written in coordination with a large number of donors and submitted to the main Consultative
Group meeting, summarizes the accumulated knowledge in a specific policy area and fosters the
policy and institutional reform agenda. The VDRs delivered in 2003, 2004 and 2005, entitled
Poverty, Governance and Business respectively, provided a comprehensive analytical and policy
coverage each of the three pillars identified by the CAS. Other important reports over this period
included a Banking Sector Review in 2002, a Public Expenditure Review-Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment (PER-IFA) in 2004, an Infrastructure Strategy in 2006, and a forthcoming Investment
Climate Assessment. Several of these reports are prepared in partnership with local institutes and
researchers; the PER-IFA was jointly prepared by the World Bank and the Government of
Vietnam. In parallel, continuous support has been provided to the upgrading of statistics, both in
terms of quality and access. As a result, the Government currently produces a comprehensive
household expenditure survey every other year and an enterprise census every year. The quality
and transparency of information on public financial management has also improved considerably.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF was essential to launch the PRSC-PRGF
program in 2001. The process leading to this program spanned four years, starting at the onset of
the East Asian crisis. The overall framework for this collaboration was laid out in 1998, in
preparation for what was then expected to be the second Structural Adjustment Credit for
Vietnam. The lead agency in each policy area was identified in the Policy Framework Paper, and

39
particularly in the Structural and Sectoral Policy Matrix for 1999–2001. The direct involvement
of the IMF in some of the structural areas such as financial sector, SOE, and trade reform was
justified because of their potential impact on macroeconomic stability.
As a result of this overall framework, the World Bank supported policy reforms in collaboration
with the IMF in several areas, including external debt management, financial sector reform, SOE
reform, and public expenditure management. In some of these areas, the World Bank and the
IMF identified complementary sets of policy triggers for the PRSC and the PRGF programs
respectively. In others, cooperation between the two institutions took place in the context of
specific tasks, not directly related to lending.
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004 the two institutions have closely collaborated in
the discussion of PRSC prior actions and triggers in the policy areas that used to be covered by
the PRGF agreement. The IMF has provided Letters of Assessment in support of the last three
PRSC operations. In the area of public financial management, the World Bank is currently
following up on the technical assistance provided by the IMF in relation to tax reform and
revenue management. Joint work is also under way in support of the establishment of a modern
central bank, with the IMF providing technical assistance on monetary policies and banking
supervision, whereas the World Bank has set up an investment credit to reorganize the State
Bank of Vietnam and develop appropriate information management systems.
From 2005 onwards, the World Bank and the IMF have jointly prepared an annual Debt
Sustainability Assessment. More recently, they joined efforts in commenting on the direction and
contents of the SEDP 2006–2010. The IMF and the World Bank also collaborate in the
development of reliable economic statistics. The IMF focuses on improving balance of payments,
national accounts, and price statistics, while the World Bank concentrates on issues related to the
production of high-quality household and enterprise surveys, and to help develop broader access
to data in Vietnam.

40
ANNEX V
Vietnam—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) resumed its operations in Vietnam in October 1993.
The Country Strategy and Program (CSP) endorsed in January 2002, proposed a focus on
four pillars to align AsDB operations in Vietnam to the overarching objective of poverty
reduction: (i) sustainable growth through rural development and private sector development,
with a focus on small- and medium-enterprise development; (ii) inclusive social
development, by mainstreaming poverty, gender, and ethnic dimensions in AsDB operations,
with an emphasis on human capital development through secondary education and health;
(iii) good governance, with special emphasis on public administration and civil service
reform; and (iv) geographic focus on the impoverished central region. The AsDB is currently
preparing the new CSP for 2007–2010. The preparation of the new CSP is aligned with the
preparation schedule of the SEDP in order to synchronize, synergize and supplement the
government’s development goals and objectives as espoused in the SEDP, and to allow for
harmonization of development assistance in support of result-based SEDP implementation.
From October 1993 until the end-2005, the AsDB approved 55 public sector loans totaling
about US$ 3.5 billion. Since December 1998, Vietnam has been classified as a B-1 country
by the AsDB, which makes it eligible to supplement borrowing at ADF terms with limited
amounts of borrowing at nonconcessional OCR terms. The cumulative $3.5 billion loan
portfolio includes nearly $ 3.0 billion from the concessional Asian Development Fund
(ADF) and US$520 million from Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). Loans have been
provided for (i) rehabilitating physical infrastructure in the agricultural, energy, and transport
sectors; (ii) financial sector, public administration reform, and state-owned enterprise (SOE)
reforms and corporate governance; and (iii) social, environmental, and cross-cutting
concerns. The contract awards achievement in 2005 was $209.8 million as compared with
$116 million in 2004, rendering a contract award ratio of 13.6 percent compared with
9.7 percent in 2004. Disbursement in 2005 attained $223.7 million as compared with $182.4
million in 2004. The disbursement ratio has increased from 15.7 percent in 2004 to
17.5 percent in 2005. The AsDB has also extended technical assistance amounting to
US$123.7 million for 185 projects. In addition to public sector operations, the AsDB has
provided $168.5 million for 7 private sector loans. Vietnam also receives substantial support
under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiatives.
Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to
encourage the development of the private sector is a vital component of AsDB operations in
Vietnam. So far, the AsDB has approved eleven policy-based program loans in the
agricultural sector, the financial sector, SOE reform and corporate governance and public
administration reform, SME development and support to poverty reduction implementation.
In addition to program lending, policy dialogue is an important feature in all of the AsDB’s
loan projects in Vietnam. This includes support for increased efficiency of state-owned
utilities through reforming their rate structure and other measures to increase cost recovery
and to strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning. A high level capacity
building program is also in place under the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training (JFPPT)
funded by the Government of Japan.

41

The AsDB has been reorganized as of 1 May 2006, and Vietnam now belongs to the
Southeast Asia Regional Department, along with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,
Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia. The resident mission has been strengthened and has
been performing programming functions and administration of a portion of loan projects.
During the past years, the AsDB has helped the government carry out participatory poverty
reduction assessment and rolling down the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy. ADB was also active in supporting the Socio-economic Development Plan
consultation process. AsDB and Fund staff work closely together to support the process of
economic reforms in Vietnam. AsDB staff participate in Fund missions, exchange
information, and consult on policy matters. The resident missions of the two institutions also
cooperate closely.

ANNEX VI
Vietnam—Statistical Issues
While data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, the reliability and
coverage of macroeconomic statistics have significant deficiencies. Compilation and
dissemination are in need of substantial improvement, so that data properly reflect economic
developments and assist policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring. The authorities are
cooperating with the Fund, but work is hampered in some areas by the lack of authorization to
release data. Vietnam has few official statistical publications that provide coverage beyond the
real sector. A Vietnam page was introduced in the GFS Yearbook in 1999 and in the IFS in 2001.
Fund technical assistance has contributed to improvements in a number of statistical areas. The
STA multisector statistics/General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) mission in July 2001
found a number of deficiencies and recommended improvements in an action plan. The followup STA mission that took place in December 2001 agreed on a program to improve national
accounts and price statistics. Subsequently, a STA peripatetic expert was assigned to assist the
General Statistics Office (GSO) under a five-year project that commenced in January 2002, and a
series of four follow-up missions were fielded. There have also been follow-up missions in
balance of payments statistics in September 2003 and 2006. Vietnam is a GDDS participant with
metadata published on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since September 30,
2003 (http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=VNM).
National accounts
Vietnam has benefited from extensive technical assistance in the area of national accounts and
price statistics, as noted above. The GSO provides quarterly and annual data on the gross
domestic product (GDP) by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure14 (both in
current and constant prices), and monthly and annual data on external trade, industrial output,
retail sales, and prices. While the methodology for producing national accounts is broadly
consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993, the compilation process suffers from poor
data collection practices and a lack of coordination and communication between data collection
agencies. In 2001 the GSO introduced new methodology for calculating GDP and published two
revised handbooks on sources and methods in 2003 in Vietnamese.
Prices
The consumer price index (CPI) is in line with international standards. The GSO released a
revised CPI in May 2006 based on data from the 2004 Vietnam Household Living Standards
Survey (VHLSS). The basket now includes about 500 items, compared with about 400 for the
previous index (based on the 1998 VHLSS), and the weight of food has decreased from
47 percent to 42 percent. The GSO planned to introduce a producer price index in late 2001 but
14

GDP by type of expenditure was calculated from 2002Q1 to 2003Q2 but discontinued due to lack of
resources.

44
this has been delayed for technical reasons. Trade price indices are also compiled, but not used in
the national accounts by the GSO because the sample size is deemed too small. The authorities
are working on a core inflation index.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) State Budget Department produces provisional monthly,
quarterly, and annual data on government operations shortly after the end of the reference period;
final data for the fiscal (calendar) year are produced after a delay of about eighteen months.
These data reflect the consolidated operations of the state budget, which covers all four levels of
government: central, provincial, district, and commune. They exclude data on off-budget
investment expenditure, quasi-fiscal activities of SOEs and extrabudgetary funds, among which
are the Social Security Fund, Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund,
Export Support Fund, local development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for repayment of on lent
funds), for which data are not compiled on a regular basis.
Compilation is on a cash basis for final annual data, but varies for provisional data depending on
their source. As a result, government financing data, in particular domestic bank financing,
cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary accounts. Like the national accounts,
provisional data are compiled before the end of the reference period and thus involve a projected
component. The quarterly data are only revised when data are compiled for the same quarter of
the following year. The MoF’s External Finance Department maintains a centralized record of all
general government external debt, excluding guarantees issued on behalf of state-owned
enterprises. The MoF, with support from the UNDP, has put in place an external debt
management system for the recording of disbursements and multiple currency loans, which as of
May 2006 was in the testing phase.
Despite these shortcomings, the authorities have made progress in a number of other areas
related to fiscal transparency, including implementation of an improved budget management law
and adoption of a 1986 GFS-consistent budget classification at all levels of government. The
authorities published for the first time in late 1998 the fiscal outturn for 1997 and the approved
budget for 1999, although both in highly aggregated form. Starting in late 2001, the MoF began
posting annual budget outturns and plans on its external website, including by major revenue and
expenditure items. However, considerable actions remain to be taken to improve the coverage of
fiscal data as recommended in the 1998 Bank-Fund report on fiscal transparency, the STA
multisector statistics mission of 2001, and the 2005 Public Expenditure Review.
In this context, the government continues to work toward gazetteing and publishing the annual
national budget, as well as preparing commune-level budgets, implementing the GFS-based
functional budget classification system, initiating work on revising government accounting
standards, preparing a medium-term expenditure framework, and introducing an integrated
financial management system (IFMS) for improving treasury management and fiscal reporting.
The STA mission found that the functional classification had not yet been fully aligned with
international classification standards, which might hamper formulation, execution, and
monitoring of fiscal policy. The IFMS should allow a detailed classification of provisional, as

45
well as final budget accounts. In addition, it will permit incorporation of data on extrabudgetary
funds into the Treasury database.
Monetary and financial statistics
The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) reports monetary and financial data to the Fund, including:
(i) the monetary survey (on a monthly basis with a ten-week lag); (ii) the central bank balance
sheet (on a monthly basis and typically with a twelve-week lag); (iii) detailed consolidated
balance sheets (“derivation tables”) for six state-owned and 79 non state deposit money banks
and individual balance sheets for the four large state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) (since
the beginning of 2001 on a monthly basis and typically with a twelve-week lag; (iv) deposit and
lending rates of the large SOCBs (on a monthly basis and for various maturities); (v) data on
reserve requirement on a monthly basis and with a twelve-week lag; and (vi), data on open
market operations on a daily basis with a twelve-week lag. Since December 2005 the
consolidated balance sheets of deposit money banks covers additionally 5 financial companies.
Recently monetary data has been submitted to the APD mission team with a long lag compared
to the past. Data on foreign reserves (gross and net official international reserves and net foreign
assets of the banking system) are received from the authorities, but with substantial lags.
In January 1999, the SBV and commercial banks began implementing new charts of accounts for
compiling money and banking data, developed with STA assistance. However, they do not
adequately sectorize credit for monetary programming purposes, in particular failing to
distinguish between bank credit to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to other nonstate sectors
of the economy. Therefore, in addition to its regular monthly reports, the SBV has designed a
new monthly report form for the four large SOCBs for submitting sectorized credit data to the
central bank. The STA mission in July 2001 encouraged the SBV to develop a reporting scheme
for a comprehensive breakdown of banks’ credit to the economy by borrowing sectors, subsectors, and ownership of enterprises. The follow-up mission that took place during April 14-28,
2005 recommended changes to new bank report forms to allow greater sectorization of bank
credit. In addition, it recommended that a list of state-owned enterprises that should be classified
as private enterprises be distributed to banks to guide their data reporting on enterprises; that
funds for on-lending be reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified liabilities” to “other deposits”;
and gave a presentation of how Fund accounts should be compiled in monetary statistics. Further
cooperation from the authorities is needed to resolve data discrepancies involving credit data for
a state-owned bank. These discrepancies may reflect possible noncoverage and/or omission of
certain loans and financial leases, offset by lower deposits and other liabilities.
External sector statistics
The SBV compiles quarterly and annual balance of payments (BOP) statistics with a one- to twomonth lag, although the data reported to the Fund for publication are less timely—the data
published in the August 2006 issue of the IFS are for 2004. The SBV does not compile
international investment position statistics. Since 1995, monthly and annual trade data have been
compiled using customs reports, but the coverage and accuracy of these data need to be
improved. In particular, the commodity breakdown of a large share of reported exports and
imports (approximately 17 percent and 22 percent respectively in 2004) is unknown. Data on
invisibles continue to be based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage

46
and identification of the types of transactions. Improvements are particularly needed for data on
tourism revenue and workers’ remittances.
Improvements in BOP statistics, in particular foreign direct investment (FDI), also continue to be
hampered by interagency coordination problems. Data on FDI are now compiled by the SBV
based on quarterly and semi-annual survey reports received from foreign enterprises operating in
Vietnam and supplemented by reports from SBV branches. The Ministry of Planning and
Investment (MPI) also collects administrative data on FDI. However, at the September 2000
ASEAN Workshop on Improving the Quality of FDI Data, the authorities indicated that
problems persisted with the survey response rate, as not all FDI enterprises were providing the
requested information. Moreover, the 2001 STA GDDS mission noted that no effort had been
made to distinguish head office and other nonresident liabilities in the reported data. The 2003
and 2006 balance of payments statistics missions recommended that the MPI, GSO, and SBV
work jointly to improve FDI questionnaires and processes, including collecting data on both
stocks and flows.
The SBV maintains data on contracting of commercial debt (by SOEs and privately owned
firms). Some loans are reported only after an extended delay, and the reporting of
disbursements and repayments remains poor. Data on contracting, disbursement, and service
of official debt are maintained by the MoF. The MPI also reports the loan obligations of
foreign investors. The STA missions found that the overlapping responsibility for debt
statistics has at times resulted in some deficiencies in coverage, including the lack of
monitoring certain leasing arrangements (e.g., for aircraft). The 2006 mission also
recommended creation of a line item for portfolio capital flows to capture the 2005 sovereign
bond issuance, as well as expected future portfolio inflows, and a draft report form was left
with the authorities for their review.

ANNEX VII
Vietnam—Debt Sustainability Analysis15
Public Sector Debt Sustainability
Since the time of the last joint DSA, the most important new signal on the likely direction of
Vietnam’s economic policies over the medium term has been the recent approval by the
Politburo and National Assembly of the five-year Socio Economic Development Plan
(SEDP) for 2006–2010, which is also the government’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS). The new baseline is intended to broadly capture the implications of the policies
contained in the SEDP evaluated at the currently high international price of oil, excluding
any effects from the contingent government liabilities in the SOE and SOCB sectors.
Alternative scenarios capturing the implications of continent liabilities related to SOCB
reform are also presented. However, given the delay in the compilation of a reliable estimate
of the magnitude of SOCB recapitalization and reform costs, the portion which may
eventually be borne by the government remains highly uncertain. In the absence of more
definitive new information, the two indicative scenarios with contingent liabilities have been
left virtually unchanged from the DSA contained in Country Report No. 06/22. 16
Baseline (excluding contingent government liabilities)
The baseline is broadly consistent with the policies contained in the SEDP. Full
implementation of the SEDP’s public investment program over 2006–2010, together with a
forecasted decline in international oil prices, would imply a steady increase in the overall
deficit (IMF staff definition),17 despite a sizeable fall in non-interest current expenditure.18
However, the non-oil deficit would be placed on a path of rapid decline over the 2007–11
period. The baseline assumes that the non-oil deficit would continue to decline steadily
thereafter, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. This implies that the overall fiscal deficit would
begin to decline following Vietnam’s graduation from low-income status at end-2010, as the
need for public investment falls and non-interest current expenditure returns to its 2001–2005
15

This DSA was prepared jointly by the Bank and the Fund on the basis of the joint framework approved by
the Bank and Fund Boards in April 2005.
16

Scenario I was slightly revised to account for the actual decline in credit growth in 2005 and the first half of
2006, and the assumed start date for the recapitalization process has been shifted by one year to 2007 for both
scenarios.

17

The assumed transfer in 2006 of the proceeds from a US$500 million (0.8 percent of GDP) sovereign bond
issue in one lump sum payment for the purposes of on-lending to an SOE leads to a one-time decline in the
overall deficit in 2007 relative to 2006, but the deficit reverts to a rising path thereafter.
18

Non-interest current expenditure is assumed to decline by 2 percentage points of GDP over the period
2006–2010.

49
average. The debt stock (excluding contingent liabilities) would rise by about 8½ percentage
points of GDP between 2005 and 2011 under this scenario, peaking at about 54 percent of
GDP in 2016, when ODA already in the pipeline is assumed to dry up. The implied
narrowing in the primary deficit from 2010 onwards would moderate the pace of increase in
the debt ratio and eventually lead to a decline in the debt ratio to slightly below the
authorities’ notional debt ceiling of 50 percent of GDP by 2026. Under such conditions, the
overall debt burden would remain manageable.
More specifically, the principal assumptions of the baseline are as follows: (i) continued high
GDP growth of 7–7½ percent a year; (ii) government investment in line with the levels
envisaged in the SEDP over the 2006–2010 period; (iii) a decline in non-interest current
expenditure resulting from the authorities’ planned phasing out of oil subsidies to oil traders
by end-2008 and a slowdown in wage increases; (iv) a peaking of oil revenue at 9½-10 percent of GDP in 2006–07, followed by a steady decline to 6½ percent of GDP by 2011 and 6¼
percent of GDP by 2026, which reflects the projected decline in international oil prices, less
favorable revenue sharing contracts on new fields, and a diversion of a growing share of
output for domestic consumption as oil refining capacity comes on stream; (v) a steady
decline in public investment (including net lending) from 13½ percent of GDP in 2006 to
11½ percent of GDP in 2011 and 9¼ percent of GDP by 2026; and (vi) an increasing shift in
the composition of new borrowing from 2010 onward from ODA debt secured mostly on
IDA terms to a blend in multilateral and bilateral lending as well as increasing sovereign
bond issuance, all of which lead to a sharp decline in the concessionality of new borrowing.
Under these assumptions, the stock of total public debt would approach the authorities’
notional debt ceiling19 of 50 percent of GDP by 2010, and would remain on an upward trend
through 2016, before beginning to decline thereafter as the primary deficit is sharply reduced.
Although the ratio of the NPV of debt to GDP would reach a level of 50 percent of GDP by
2016, and the NPV of debt to revenue ratio would rise above 200 percent, the debt service
burden would remain manageable.
However, the above scenario would be subject to significant risks. In particular, a failure to
carry-out the envisaged adjustment in the primary balance, lower growth or lower-thanprojected oil prices could result in significantly faster and larger increases in the public debt
burden. More specifically, as is illustrated under alternative scenario A2, if the primary
balance were to remain unchanged at its level as of 2006 (-6.3 percent of GDP), the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio, the NPV of debt-to-revenue, and the debt-service-to-revenue ratios would
rise sharply, and would reach levels of 83 percent, 354 percent, and 28 percent, respectively,
by 2026. A permanently lower GDP growth rate (alternative baseline scenario A3) would
also have a significant, albeit less dramatic effect on the dynamics of the NPV of debt

19

in staffs’ definition of public and publicly guaranteed debt.

50
relative to GDP and revenue.20 Alternative baseline scenario A4 demonstrates the large
potential impact of a future decline in oil prices on fiscal revenues and public debt
sustainability. A decline in international oil prices to the levels published in the April 2006
WEO would raise the overall deficit by 1.8 percent of GDP in 2007, with the impact
declining to 1 percent of GDP per year from 2011 onwards. As a result, the NPV of the debt
stock would rise by an additional 6 percentage points of GDP by end-2011, and would
remain on a continually rising trend, reaching 63½ percent of GDP by end-2026. While the
impact of the assumed decline in oil prices may seem less dramatic than that of an unchanged
primary deficit, movements in the oil price represent an external shock which could require
costly cut-backs in the government’s public expenditure program to protect public debt
sustainability.
Banking reform scenarios
The existence of contingent liabilities associated with SOCB reform is a major additional risk
to medium-term sustainability. The two scenarios presented below, which are broadly
unchanged from the 2005 DSA, should be viewed as indicative given the continued high
degree of uncertainty regarding (i) the current stock of NPLs in the banking system; and
(ii) the current and projected future capital shortfalls, which depend on a number of difficultto-predict policy variables. Both scenarios assume that the pace of banking sector reform is
stepped up starting in 2007, while credit growth remains on the declining path observed in
2005 and the first half of 2006, decelerating to 15 percent per year by 2010. As a result, the
incidence of new NPLs and associated provisioning requirements fall sharply over the
medium term, and the SOCBs’ capital shortfall is contained.
For simplicity, both scenarios assume that the entire capital shortfall will be financed by
bond issuance,21 and that the overall deficit will increase to accommodate any increase in the
interest bill, so as not to force a compression of primary expenditure. The main differences
between the scenarios include the magnitude of the capital shortfall and the time period over
which recapitalization is spread.22
Banking reform scenario 1:
•

Under this scenario, the end-2006 capital shortfall of 20 percent of GDP is assumed
to be filled by a capital injection by the government, in the form of the transfer of
government bonds to SOCBs, spread over two years (2007 and 2008). As a result, the

20

The magnitude of this shock is small due to the low historical variation in growth. Under the baseline
scenario growth averages 7.2 percent over the period 2007–2026, while under the stress test, growth is reduced
by only 0.3 percent per year and averages 6.9 percent over the period.
21

The authorities could also use equitization receipts or proceeds from as-yet unidentified asset sales to cover a
part of the capital shortfall.
22

For a complete discussion of the methodology, see Country Report No. 06/22, Annex V, pp. 52–55 and
Country Report No. 05/148, Annex V, pp. 49–54.

51
debt stock jumps to 66½ percent of GDP by end-2008, peaks at around 67 ½ percent
of GDP in 2010–11,and falls thereafter with the help of the continuing decline in the
primary deficit and continued high real growth, to a level of about 53 percent of GDP
over the long run.
Banking reform scenario 2:
•

Under this scenario, the end-2006 capital shortfall amounts to 8 percent of GDP and
is assumed to be filled by a capital injection by the government, spread over a period
of 4 years. The debt stock would jump to 56½ percent of GDP by end-2010, peaking
at 58½ percent of GDP in 2014, and declining moderately over the longer term to
approach the authorities’ notional debt ceiling by 2026.

The above indicative scenarios illustrate the important ways in which contingent liabilities
can influence public debt dynamics. Going forward, a renewed acceleration in credit growth,
delays in implementing bank reforms, and slow progress in improving the quality of new
lending could all lead to further increases in contingent liabilities, the cost of which could
have a significantly larger impact than is envisaged under the above scenarios. A sharp
increase in the size of the required capital injection into the banking system could, in turn,
pose a more serious threat to medium-term debt sustainability, if it is combined with a
significant delay in the adjustment of the primary balance and/or a sharp reduction in the oil
price. This could require a larger and more abrupt adjustment to quickly place debt on a
sustainable path, with the increasing debt servicing requirements likely to crowd out higherpriority investment and social expenditures.
External Debt Sustainability
The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities continue their current policy of setting an
annual external borrowing limit, while maintaining the existing system of controls on capital
flows. As a result, it could be viewed as a conservative external debt scenario for a country
which can be expected to transition in the middle of the projection period from IDA-only to
emerging-market status.
More specifically, the baseline scenario assumes (i) a peak in IDA finance in 2010, followed
by a slow tapering off and move toward a blended mix of multilateral and bilateral finance;
(ii) a gradual decline in ODA-financed on-lending; (iii) a decline in the ratio of SOE external
debt with government guarantee; (iv) continued robust growth in FDI; (v) net annual
issuance of commercial sovereign bonds equivalent to 1 percent of GDP; and (v) a modest
increase in private debt from about 5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 8½ percent of GDP over the
long run.
Vietnam’s external debt is deemed sustainable under the baseline scenario. The external debt
stock would remain roughly flat through 2011 at 31–32 percent of GDP, as ODA and
concessional financing would complement domestic financing, and would decline over the
longer term to about 27 percent of GDP, as the steady decline in the primary deficit contains
the overall size of the government’s external borrowing requirement. The NPV of public and
publicly guaranteed debt-to-exports ratio would decline throughout the period due to robust

52
exports, falling to 18 percent by 2026, while the debt service ratio would rise slightly from
3.7 percent in 2006 to 4.7 percent by 2026, as the concessionality of new borrowing drops
off.
While the current low NPV of debt in relation to exports makes it unlikely external finance
would lead to external debt distress over the medium term, a number of risks that are not
properly reflected in the baseline call for continuation of a prudent external debt management
policy. First, as in the case of the baseline for total public debt, the path of external debt is
predicated on a relatively rapid pace of fiscal adjustment. If the adjustment fails to
materialize or is significantly postponed, external borrowing could be more extensive than
assumed under the baseline, and the external public debt dynamics less favorable. Second, as
Vietnam’s capital account is progressively opened up, and foreign investors’ appetite for
Vietnamese paper increases, the government could make increasing recourse to sovereign
bond issues for purposes of on-lending to SOEs that face large capital needs. Additional
risks, which could adversely affect external debt dynamics, include (i) a significantly faster
than expected deterioration in the terms of new external financing, and (ii) a large
depreciation of the dong.
Staff’s Assessment
Staff consider Vietnam to be at low risk of external debt distress over the period 2006–2011.
Vietnam’s external debt ratios would remain below applicable policy-based debt thresholds
under the baseline and under standard stress scenarios, provided that external borrowing
policies will continue to be guided by the prudence that has characterized Vietnam’s policies
over the last few years.23 However, the expansionary policies contained in the SEDP could
pose risks to this relatively benign outlook in the event of a sharp decline in oil prices or if
the fiscal adjustment assumed to take place from 2010 fails to materialize. The sensitivity
tests and alternative scenarios suggest that the risks to medium-term external and public
sector debt sustainability could be considerably larger than projected in the baseline over the
long term, warranting close monitoring.

23

Vietnam is considered a “strong” performer on the basis of its 2005 CPIA score. Its applicable external debt
thresholds are the following: (i) NPV of debt-to-exports = 200 percent, (ii) NPV of debt-to-GDP = 50 percent,
and debt service-to-exports = 25 percent.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 25, 2006
The information provided below has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
On October 9, the Government of Vietnam issued the action plan to implement the
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006–2010. The new SEDP, which is also
the government’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, will soon be issued to the Board,
together with a Joint Staff Advisory Note, for information.
2.
Real GDP is estimated to have risen by 7.8 percent (year-on-year (yoy)) during the
first nine months of 2006, in line with the staff report’s projections. While inflation declined
to 6.9 percent (yoy) as of September, and the pass-through of recent decreases in
international oil prices should serve to moderate cost-push pressures in the short run, average
inflation is still projected at around 7½ percent in 2006. The coming into effect of the
increase in the common minimum wage (by 28½ percent) on October 1, 2006, together with
strong seasonal demand and a possible pick-up in credit growth (see below), can be expected
to restrain the disinflationary impact of falling oil prices in the period ahead. Gasoline prices
have been reduced in two steps by a cumulative 12½ percent since end-August, compared
with a 20 percent decline in international oil prices. As the profit margins of oil traders were
restored, import tariffs on gasoline, which had been reduced from 5 percent to zero in April
2006, were reinstated in late-August and have since been raised to 20 percent. The domestic
prices of diesel and kerosene, which had not been fully adjusted to reflect the earlier
increases in world prices, have remained unchanged, and applicable import tariffs kept at
zero. Following the recent decline in international oil prices, the subsidy element has been
largely eliminated.
3.
The revised outlook for oil prices implies a significant reduction in the oil revenue
windfall for the budget. Oil revenues under the new WEO oil price baseline are now
projected to fall short of the staff report’s projections by 0.5-1 percent of GDP over the
medium term. During 2006-07, the net effect on the fiscal balance should be largely offset by
a faster-than-projected decline in subsidies to oil traders, together with the increase in import
duty receipts resulting from the above-mentioned reinstatement of gasoline import tariffs.
The overall deficit is now projected to increase by 0.1 and 0.3 percent in 2006 and 2007
respectively, compared to the staff report’s projections. However, the increase in the deficit
could be a little higher (0.6-0.7 percent of GDP) in 2008–10 (since the authorities’
announced plan to eliminate oil subsidies by 2008 were already factored into the staff’s
baseline scenario). These developments reinforce the need for measures to rein in the growth
of public expenditure, so as to save a good part of the oil revenue windfall.
4.
The growth of credit to the economy edged down to 21.3 percent (yoy) in July, but
the recent pattern of slowing credit growth may be difficult to sustain in the period ahead.
The growth of credit extended by state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) fell to
13.4 percent (yoy) in July, more than offsetting a pick-up in the growth of lending by joint-

2
stock banks (to 40.8 percent). While the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has kept its policy
rates unchanged, open market operations (OMO) rates have fallen to 1-1½ percent in recent
months, as excess bank liquidity was boosted by a further increase in official reserves—to
US$11.2 billion as of end-August. Following recent instructions from the Prime Minister, the
SBV Governor issued several official letters in August and September, which instructed
SOCBs to provide financing for a number of large SOE projects without requiring project
evaluation. In addition, the SBV has provided SOCBs with exemptions from the singleborrower limit of 15 percent of equity for lending to selected SOEs. While data on the size
and likely phasing of the new SOCB loans are not available, their aggregate amount could be
significant, and could lead to a pick-up in credit growth in the coming months.
5.
On the structural front, continued progress has been made towards strengthening the
regulatory and legal framework, and the authorities have announced plans to step up marketoriented reforms in the period ahead. In the banking system, SOCBs have been required to
conduct annual audits in accordance with International Accounting Standards, with their first
such reports for 2005 to be submitted to the SBV by October 31, 2006, and their equitization
is to be completed on an accelerated schedule by 2008. On October 17, in his opening
statement to the National Assembly’s fall session, the Prime Minister indicated that the
government will reduce its intervention in pricing in 2007, including by liberalizing the
prices of cement, steel and fertilizer and reducing state subsidies for petroleum, coal and
electricity production and trading. The Prime Minister also reiterated the government’s plan
to restructure all SOEs, including by allowing most of them to be partly equitized during
2006-2010. As regards the legal framework, all implementing decrees for the Unified
Enterprise Law and the Common Investment Law were issued in August and September
2006, with a view to complying with Vietnam’s WTO agreements. The government has also
established an inter-agency task force to address potential difficulties in implementation,
which could arise from possible inconsistencies between the two laws and the implementing
regulations.
6.
The 14th session of multilateral negotiations on Vietnam’s accession to the WTO was
completed on October 10, 2006. The working party on Vietnam will meet again on October
26 in Geneva to address any outstanding issues. If all goes smoothly, agreement on
Vietnam’s WTO membership could be finalized in time for accession by the end of this year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 7, 2006

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Vietnam
On October 25, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Vietnam.1
Background
Overall macroeconomic performance has remained strong since the conclusion of the last
Article IV consultation. Real GDP growth rose to 8.4 percent in 2005, spurred by strong
domestic and external demand, and it remained robust in the first half of 2006 as continued
strong domestic consumption and rising export growth offset a slowdown in public investment.
However, the expansion of aggregate demand, together with increases in world commodity
prices, has hampered efforts to bring down inflation. The year-on-year (yoy) rate of inflation has
edged down from 8¾ percent in December 2005 to 7½ percent in August, but inflation has
become more broadly based and has remained well above the rates prevailing in Vietnam’s
major trading partners. The continued brisk pace of exports and resulting strengthening of the
current account, together with strong official development assistance (ODA) and foreign direct
investment (FDI) has kept the balance of payments in comfortable surplus. Gross official
reserves rose from US$6.3 billion at end-2004 to US$8.6 billion as of end-2005, and to nearly
$11 billion as of end-June (Table 1).
Fiscal policy was eased considerably in 2005. Despite the oil revenue windfall, the narrowlydefined official budget balance shifted from a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2004 to a deficit of
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

about 1 percent of GDP in 2005. Expenditure growth outpaced revenues, spurred by increasing
public sector wages and oil subsidies. A surge in off-budget investment and net lending further
boosted total outlays, and the overall deficit (as measured in accordance with the IMF’s
definition, which includes on-lending through the Development Assistance Fund and other offbudget operations) rose from less than 3 percent of GDP in 2004 to almost 6 percent of GDP in
2005. The non-oil deficit widened more markedly to 14½ percent of GDP, while the stock of
public debt rose to 43½ percent of GDP as of end-2005.
The rate of growth of credit to the economy fell from more than 30 percent in 2005 to 21 percent
(yoy) as of June 2006. New lending fell sharply as state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs)
endeavored to meet the new prudential standards of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).
However, with bank liquidity boosted as a result of the already-mentioned sharp increase in
official reserves, reserve money growth increased to 31 percent (yoy) as of June. The SBV’s
policy rates were raised by about ½ percentage point in December 2005, and they have
remained unchanged since then (with the discount rate at 4½ percent, the refinancing rate at
6½ percent and the base rate at 8¼ percent). However, open market operation rates have fallen
to 2-3 percent in recent months, as sales of SBV bills have fallen far short of absorbing banks’
excess reserves. While bank lending rates have remained basically flat, dong deposit rates
have been under upward pressure, reflecting intensified competition for funds among joint stock
banks, which have ample capital adequacy.
Good progress has been made over the last year in adopting legislation and market opening
measures required for WTO compliance. The National Assembly approved the much-awaited
Common Investment Law and Unified Enterprise Law in November 2005. The implementing
regulations that are now being finalized should help level the playing field between domestic
and foreign investors and private businesses and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Vietnam has
now completed all bilateral negotiations and hopes to accede to the WTO shortly. With the
accession, Vietnam is expected to lower its trade barriers to a wide range of products and
services.
Progress in SOCB and SOE reform has remained uneven. The development of plans for the
resolution of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and for SOCB recapitalization has been delayed by
difficulties in implementing new prudential standards. Discrepancies between SOCBs’ initial
NPL estimates and those of international auditors have led to further uncertainty regarding the
size of potential contingent liabilities. However, the approval in May of a comprehensive
Banking Sector Reform Roadmap has reiterated the government’s commitment to banking
sector reform. In the SOE sector, progress towards restructuring larger enterprises has
remained slow, with equitized firms representing only 12 percent of SOE assets as of end-2005.
The outlook for the rest of 2006 is positive. With public investment expected to rebound in the
second half of the year, and with the external environment remaining broadly favorable, GDP
growth is projected to be close to the official target of 8 percent in 2006. However, inflation
would remain higher than in trading partner countries. The rise in international oil prices,
together with the continuing boom in non-oil exports, is projected to keep the external current

3
account in a small surplus, which together with buoyant ODA, FDI and incipient private capital
inflows would lead to a continuing rise in reserves.
Medium-term prospects for sustained high-quality growth and poverty reduction are also
favorable but subject to risks. WTO accession should create new opportunities for growth of
non-oil exports and FDI, and high oil prices should continue to underpin the public finances.
However, greater exposure to global competition following WTO accession could pose
challenges for SOEs operating in sectors that still benefit from protective tariffs or government
subsidies. Additional risks to the outlook would stem from expansionary macroeconomic
policies and delays in needed reforms. On the external front, key risks include a significant
slowdown in the U.S. economy; a disorderly adjustment of global imbalances, which could
reduce investors’ appetite for risk; and a fall in international oil prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised Vietnam’s impressive record of sustained high growth and rapid
poverty reduction, and noted that continuing efforts to improve the economy’s market orientation
had made Vietnam an attractive destination for foreign investment. Looking ahead, Directors
underscored that faster reforms of previously-protected industries would be essential to enable
the economy to reap the full benefits from Vietnam’s forthcoming WTO accession.
Directors noted that the short-term outlook is broadly positive, but medium-term prospects are
subject to some uncertainties. Inflation remains higher and more entrenched than in most other
Asian countries and, under the new Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan, growth will
continue to rely heavily on public investment, whose quality remains uncertain.
While recognizing the economy’s large infrastructure needs, Directors cautioned that a rising
public debt burden could eventually crowd out poverty-reducing outlays in the event of a
slowdown in world growth or lower oil prices.
Directors stressed the need for a more prudent fiscal stance, particularly in light of the
economy’s strong cyclical position. They welcomed the substantial reduction in oil subsidies in
2006, but considered that the recent decline of international oil prices had weakened the fiscal
outlook, reinforcing the need to rein in growth in public spending. Furthermore, Directors urged
the authorities to contain future increases in public wages and intensify efforts to improve the
screening of new investment projects. In this context, they called for the adoption of enabling
regulations to help enforce the recently-approved laws to curb corruption and prevent the waste
of public funds. Directors stressed that more transparent accounting, reporting, and monitoring
of the government’s extra-budgetary operations and all publicly-funded projects is needed to
shore up donor and investor confidence.
Directors welcomed the recent deceleration of credit growth, and stressed that continuation of
this trend would help contain inflation and reverse the growth of banks’ NPLs, although excess
bank liquidity could reverse the recent progress in this area. Directors urged the authorities to
step up liquidity-absorbing open market operations, avoid directed lending through state-owned
commercial banks, and introduce adequate prudential measures to limit banks’ off-balancesheet risks.

4
Directors commended the authorities’ acceptance of the obligations under the Fund’s Article VIII
and supported their plan to make the dong fully convertible by 2010. While the dong does not
currently appear to be misaligned, most Directors were of the view that the current strength of
the external position would facilitate a move towards greater exchange rate flexibility, which
would serve to cushion the economy from external shocks and foster better management of
exchange rate risks. In this respect, they welcomed the recent move toward liberalizing banks’
own exchange rates for currency transactions.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ Banking Sector Reform Roadmap and the plans to convert
the State Bank of Vietnam into a modern central bank. They also supported the plans to apply
International Accounting Standards for all state-owned banks, and urged the authorities to
proceed with a realistic valuation of NPLs as a basis for NPL resolution and bank
recapitalization plans. Directors emphasized that, to place state-owned bank operations on a
sound commercial basis, their managers would need to be given increased operational
autonomy. While supporting the government’s plans to accelerate the issuance of equity in
state-owned banks, Directors stressed that adequate strategic foreign investor participation
would be important to help improve governance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to restructure and issue equity in most state-owned
enterprises by 2010. They urged the authorities to grant managers full autonomy to make their
own pricing and investment decisions. In this connection, Directors welcomed the recentlyannounced plans to liberalize the prices of cement, steel and fertilizer and reduce state
subsidies in the energy sector, and urged the authorities to adopt time-bound plans to remove
all other remaining distortionary price regulations.
Directors stressed that a continuing opening up of the trade and investment regimes would be
key to private sector-led growth. They urged the authorities to implement the Common
Investment Law and Unified Enterprise Law to level the playing field, while preventing any
increase in government intervention.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the timeliness and quality of data on off-budget fiscal
activities, money and banking statistics, and balance of payments and reserve data to support
informed policy decisions and effective interaction with markets.

and Quoc Anh Duong, Advisor to Executive Director
October 25, 2006

Introduction
1.
We would like to convey to the management and staff of the Fund the appreciation of
our Vietnamese authorities for the continued support extended to Vietnam through policy
dialogue, technical advice and training over the years. This has provided a conducive
environment for the authorities to embark on a forward-looking economic program aimed at
enhancing the country’s economic potential and strengthening its capacity, in order to attain a
more sustainable and broad-based growth over the medium term. On behalf of the
Vietnamese authorities, we would like to thank staff for their well-written report and selected
issues paper.
2.
The authorities have made significant progress in moving from a state-controlled
economy towards a market economy. Under the Five year Socio-economic Development
Plan (SEDP) 2001–2005, all levels of the public sector had worked with dedication and
diligence to achieve solid growth with poverty eradication. They are now working hard to
implement the next Five year SEDP (2006–2010) with the aim of lifting the country out of
the low income situation. Cognizant of challenges ahead, the authorities are nevertheless
committed to implementing reforms to raise productivity and competitiveness for sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction. In this endeavour, they hope that they can count on
continued cooperation and assistance from the international donor community in general and
active consultations with the Fund in particular.
Recent Economic Developments
3.
In 2005 and the first half of 2006, the country was faced with a plethora of
adversities, including adverse weather, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the reoccurrence of avian flu with the risk of a pandemic outbreak, and significant upsurge in
commodity and service prices, especially oil and gas and other key materials. However,
thanks to the efforts of the authorities, sound policies and good measures for maintaining
macroeconomic stability such as appropriate State-owned enterprise (SOE) reform,
enhancement of enterprise competitiveness and improvement of the legal framework in line
with the integration process were all effectively implemented. Thus the Vietnamese economy
continued to perform well in 2005 and early 2006.
4.
Real GDP growth remained strong at 8.4 percent in 2005, supported by robust growth
in consumption, buoyant domestic investment, expansion in exports and a rebound in FDI in
anticipation of Vietnam’s accession to the WTO. Inspite of the adverse impact of the global

2
increase in commodity prices, the year-on-year inflation rate declined from 8.4 percent in
December 2005 to 7.5 percent in August 2006. The fiscal deficit continued to be restrained
and the exchange rate remained broadly stable.
5.
The macroeconomic outlook for Vietnam is broadly positive with continued robust
growth projected at 8.2 percent in 2006. The performance of the external sector is expected
to remain favourable with strong capital inflows from emigrants’ remittances, tourism
receipt, sustained ODA and FDI and export growth. The balance of payments has been
generally satisfactory and external reserves have increased to about 11 weeks of imports
(2005: 10.1 weeks of imports).
Fiscal Policy
6.
The authorities have continued to pursue a prudent fiscal policy as part of their effort
to provide a strong foundation for growth. In 2005, the final year of the 2001-2005 SEDP,
the authorities were faced with many difficulties and challenges in implementing the state
budget to achieve the targets of the Plan. Nevertheless, official data shows that the state
budget deficit in 2005 was maintained at 4.9 percent of GDP, below the 5 percent target set
by the National Assembly. This ratio is projected to remain restrained in 2006.
7.
On the expenditure front, improvements were made in three main areas. Firstly,
action was taken to improve the linkage between economic development plans and the
budget. Secondly, administrative norms were rationalised. For example, procedures for state
expenditure through the treasury system were significantly improved with the removal of
unnecessary formalities. Thirdly, the authorities passed the Law on Corruption Prevention
and Control and the Law on Practicing Thrift and Combating Wastefulness to upgrade the
quality of public investment and prevent leakage and waste. In addition, in May 2006, the
government established the Vietnam Development Bank through reorganizing the
Development Assistance Fund (DAF) to improve the management mechanism and credit
quality, and reduce the outstanding debt of the DAF.
8.
Over the past years, the government has managed the domestic and external debt
prudently. However, with the recent financial innovations by SOEs and State-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs), the opportunities for borrowing on domestic and international
capital markets are increasing and the government recognizes the need for a coordinated and
disciplined public sector borrowing strategy. As recommended by staff, the government has
recently issued Decree 134 on the control and repayment of foreign loans and plans to set up
a single unit to monitor all domestic and external debts.
9.
On the revenue front, the Government explored all means to broaden the tax base to
mobilize more resources for socio-economic development. The government made continuous
efforts to strengthen the tax administration. Main taxes such as VAT, special consumption

3
tax, and business income tax were further supplemented and amended in line with
international best practices. Taxes were adjusted in the spirit of simplifying tax-paying
procedures, reducing tax rates as well as creating favorable conditions for monitoring and
prevention of tax evasion and fraud. Since 2003, the authorities have moved the budget
revenue structure in the direction of increasing the proportion of stable revenues from
domestic production. Besides tax innovations, many other policies have been adopted to
improve revenue, including those relating to land and residential property, particularly
revenues from assigning land use rights. Higher revenue from increased domestic activity
and higher crude oil prices provided an additional source of financing for the investment and
development of the national economy. It should be noted that though customs duties
accounted for the third biggest share of total tax revenue, the share of fees and charges has
decreased continuously since 2002 in line with Vietnam’s international commitment.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10.
In the past year, monetary activities were flexibly managed to curb inflation while
supporting economic development. In order to control inflation, in line with staff’s
recommendation, the authorities have raised some key interest rates, including the
refinancing rate, rediscount interest rate and the interest rate cap on deposits in foreign
currencies. The credit institutions were instructed to improve credit quality and assess credit
risk provisioning capacity to ensure the safety of the system. Consequently, the year-on-year
inflation rate was contained to 8.4 percent by late 2005 and 7.5 percent in August 2006,
while the rate of credit growth continued to decline to 23 percent in March 2006 and
21.5 percent in June. However, the present situation may have changed. While the policy
rates have remained unchanged, the domestic interest rates have increased in line with the
increase in global interest rates. The situation of excess liquidity in the banking system is
temporary and differs between the state owned commercial banks, foreign bank branches and
joint stock commercial banks while the interbank money market is not yet well developed.
The authorities are concerned that the prolonged use of a tight monetary policy to control
inflation may also dampen economic growth.
11.
After nearly six years of dormant existence, the stock market has become more active
in 2006. This would help to mobilize capital for economic development. However, it also
poses a new potential risk associated with stock market-related lending. Sharing staff’s
concern about this issue, the authorities have launched an investigation and have recently
issued new regulations to tighten the monitoring and control of lending for the purchase of
shares.
12.
The use of a managed floating exchange rate regime has helped to keep the Dong-US
Dollar exchange rate broadly stable in recent years and to contain inflation and facilitate
investment and international trade. However, in line with staff’s advice, the authorities are
exploring the option of exchange rate flexibility in the medium-term period. While

4
maintaining some essential administrative measures to protect the domestic and financial
system, the authorities have been looking into ways to introduce broad reforms in the foreign
exchange management mechanism which are consistent with the development of an open and
internationally integrated economy.
13.
The authorities have issued an amendment to Decree 63/1998/ND-CP on Foreign
Exchange Management to confirm liberalization of the current account, to allow payments
and transfers for current account transactions to be conducted freely within the territory of
Vietnam. With the issuance of this amended Decree and the Ordinance on Foreign Exchange,
the Fund has accredited Vietnam as being in full compliance with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of
Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement.
Structural Reforms
14.
The authorities recognize the importance of intensifying structural reforms in order to
encourage private investment, and sustain economic growth and poverty reduction. The
structural reforms are ongoing in a wide range of areas include improving the efficiency of
public sector financial management, accelerating reforms in the SOE and SOCB sectors,
addressing the weaknesses in competition and investment regimes, ensuring public debt
sustainability and encouraging foreign investment.
15.
On financial sector reform, the authorities have implemented measures to accelerate
the process of restructuring commercial banks to enhance the financial capacity and
competitiveness of the banking system. In line with international best practices on debt
classification, risk provisioning and capital adequacy, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has
issued legal documents on loan classification, making and using of provisions to settle credit
risks in banking operations of credit institutions and on prudential ratios applied to credit
institutions. All SOCBs’ total debt outstanding incurred as at December 31, 2000 have been
basically settled and they have been recapitalized by the state budget while all commercial
banks have formulated their plans for NPL resolution and loan classification in accordance
with the new prudential standard issued by SBV. It should be noted that the authorities have
recently approved the government’s Banking Sector Reform Roadmap, under which the SBV
will be developed into a modern central bank; the commercial banks will be restructured and
all SOCBs will be gradually equitized while international prudential standards will be in
place by 2010. As part of this Reform, the government had previously decided to equitize the
first two SOCBs, namely the Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (VIETCOMBANK) and the
Mekong Housing Bank (MHB), in 2007. As of now, these two banks are in the process of
asset revaluation and financial settlement before hiring international consultants on
equitization. The equitization of these two banks will provide momentum for the reform of
the sector.

5
16.
Being cognizant that SOE reform is essential for the development of a competitive
and efficient economy, the authorities have made substantial progress on SOE reform in
accordance with the Master Plan for SOE transformation, including the implementation of
performance-based rating exercise and the establishment of the State Corporation of
Investment Capital (SCIC) to manage the government’s stake in equitized SOEs. The
government has issued a new directive to step up SOE equitization. There have been
welcome revisions to the legal documents required for improving the equitization process,
extending equitization to larger enterprises and listing equitized SOEs on the stock market. It
should be noted that by August 2006, 4,447 SOEs have been transformed, of which 3,060
SOEs have been equitized and 61 equitized SOEs have been listed on the stock market.
17.
The government has continued to create a more supportive environment for private
and foreign enterprises. In order to create a level playing field and to meet the requirement
for WTO accession, the authorities, in close consultation with private sector and foreign
investor communities, have developed the Unified Enterprise Law and Common Investment
Law. Under the Unified Enterprise Law, which was effective from July 1, 2006, domestic
and foreign enterprises, regardless of ownership, are governed by the same corporate
legislation and are free to choose the form of corporate entity (previously, foreign enterprises
were allowed to operate only as limited liability companies). The Common Investment Law
introduces a common investment regime for domestic and foreign investors alike so that a
wider range of sectors is now open for foreign investment, in line with Vietnam’s current and
prospective international commitments. In addition, the authorities have made substantial
progress on efforts to secure early accession to the WTO. Vietnam is already in compliance
with tariff reduction schedules on regional trade agreements and the adoption of international
codes for classification of imports and exports. In addition, all bilateral and multilateral
negotiations have been completed in preparation for Vietnam’s accession to the WTO.
Other Issues
18.
The authorities have taken steps to improve transparency, and reduce bureaucracy and
red tape over the past year. The administrative reforms have been implemented under very
comprehensive civil service reforms. The Prime Minister has instructed ministries,
government agencies and provinces to conduct a review of administrative procedures with a
view toward simplifying them. Progress has been made in areas such as residential
registration permits, business registration, land use rights certificates, and customs and tax
procedures. The government also introduced new regulations to strengthen the delivery of
public services through improved monitoring of service quality, introducing user feedback,
and limiting the use of proceeds from service fees to fund salary expenditure.
19.
In addition, recognizing the need to tackle the systemic causes of corruption, the
National Assembly has passed the law on the prevention of corruption. The Prime Minister
has issued an action plan delineating the roles of various ministries and agencies in ensuring

6
effective implementation. The authorities will be issuing the regulations for implementing the
Anti-Money Laundering Law and moving forward in drafting an amendment to the criminal
code on Combating the Financing of Terrorism.
Conclusion
20.
While the road ahead is fraught with many challenges, the authorities would like to
reaffirm their determination to overcome those challenges, by continuing to pursue prudent
economic policies as well as enhancing reform implementation in a progressive and steady
manner. This will have to take into account economic considerations, capacity constraints,
and more importantly, the aspirations and hence the ownership of the people of Vietnam,
which will be strengthened with further improvements in economic growth and poverty
reduction.
