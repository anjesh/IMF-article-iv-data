EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Papua New Guinea is enjoying its fourth year of recovery and macroeconomic
stability, supported by broadly sound economic policies and record mineral revenue
inflows. The current economic performance is strong relative to recent history.

•

However, the performance gap relative to comparator countries is widening
given higher growth among peers, while downside risks for Papua New Guinea have
increased, and development needs remain high.

•

The near-term challenge is to continue following an appropriate fiscal-monetary
policy mix that maintains macroeconomic stability.

•

•

Monetary policy should continue to maintain low inflation, and the authorities
should stand ready to tighten the stance if fiscal-related demand pressures
intensify.

•

Given the expectation of diminished mineral revenue inflows, the current
managed floating exchange rate appropriately allows a build-up of reserves
while protecting nonmineral sector competitiveness by resisting rapid
appreciation of the kina. However, greater flexibility would be needed in the
face of sustained pressure.

•

The 2006–07 budgets are appropriately focused on one-off development
spending increases given the temporary nature of current record mineral
revenue inflows. However, keeping in mind past election-related fiscal policy
excesses, the authorities should take measures to minimize the potential for
nonpriority expenditure and associated inflationary pressures emerging ahead
of the mid-2007 general elections.

•

A more ambitious medium-term fiscal strategy would better cope with volatile
and exhaustible mineral revenue and anchor fiscal sustainability. The
suggested strategy would use budget surpluses to pay down public debt while
leaving room for more spending in areas that would contribute to higher
sustained nonmineral sector growth.

A key medium-term challenge is to renew momentum on structural reforms—
including in the public sector—to raise growth in the nonmineral sector and
reduce unemployment and poverty.
•

The investment environment needs considerable strengthening, including by
addressing a poor communications and transportation infrastructure, high
crime, and weak governance.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Papua New Guinea is enjoying its fourth year of recovery and macroeconomic
stability, but major challenges lie ahead. Sound macroeconomic policies over the past
several years have reduced fiscal vulnerabilities, lowered inflation, spurred business
confidence, and boosted growth. High prices for key export commodities (petroleum, copper,
and gold) have strengthened the fiscal and external positions. However, progress toward
achieving the country’s Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) objectives or
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been limited (Box 1, Table 1, and Figure 1). In
particular, structural reforms needed to stimulate activity in the nonmineral economy have
stalled in advance of the June 2007 general elections.
2.
Reflecting past years of political instability and weak economic management,
per capita income is little improved since independence in 1975. As a result of earlier
election-year fiscal policy excesses, the current government faced a near crisis situation
when it took office in 2002; its efforts during its initial years mainly—and successfully—
focused on stabilizing the fiscal situation and promoting economic recovery. However,
underlying development needs in Papua New Guinea still remain to be fully addressed. The
dominance of the natural resource

sector has hindered the development 180 Asia and Pacific Islands Countries, 1970-2007 (in percent)

governance, and an unattractive
business environment have

constrained more rapid growth.
Although recent growth rates have

growth performance gap relative to

comparator countries is widening.

Poverty and unemployment remain
high as the economy is unable to absorb a rapidly growing labor force.1
3.
Recent developments have introduced new uncertainty to the outlook as the midyear parliamentary elections draw closer. Frequent cabinet changes over the past year,
including in key economic ministries, have complicated macroeconomic policy-making. The
PNG-Queensland gas pipeline project, originally expected to start construction in late 2006,
was put on hold following a recent reassessment by foreign partners.

1

Unemployment data are unavailable, but anecdotal evidence suggests it is about 40 percent of the labor force
in major urban centers, such as Port Moresby.

5

Box 1. Medium-Term Development Strategy
The April 2005 Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) sets out the government’s
development priorities for 2005–10, consistent with their Millennium Development Goals.
The MTDS objectives are to: (i) establish good governance; (ii) promote export-driven
growth in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism; and (iii) accelerate rural development
and poverty reduction, through:
•

public sector reform with improved accountability, reduced costs, more efficient service
delivery, and fiscal sustainability;

•

a more favorable climate for private sector activity through improved law and justice,
expanded telecommunications, development of human resources, and upgraded
transportation infrastructure; and

•

redirecting public expenditure toward the priority areas of rural and transportation
infrastructure, basic education, law and justice, and preventive health care programs,
including for HIV/AIDs.

Almost two years after the strategy’s inception, progress has stalled in many areas. An
important advance has been in shifting a larger share of budgeted expenditure toward
infrastructure and human capital. However, the MTDS’s objectives remain valid and a point
of reference for the public.

2006 Article IV Consultation
Consecutive fiscal surpluses since
2004; debt lowered further to 39
percent of GDP in 2006.

Reduce fiscal deficits (-5 percent of
GDP) and public debt (72 percent GDP).

Fiscal deficit in balance and debt
reduced to 60 percent of GDP.

Reduce nonpriority spending, including
wage bill, to provide room for priority
expenditure such as infrastructure and
education.

Little progress; 2004 budget
provided for 3 percent wage
increase and additional
performance bonuses.

Current spending, including wage bill,
reduced as share of GDP. Budget
focus on infrastructure expenditure, but
execution capacity weak. “Right-sizing”
report completed, but implementation
delayed until after 2007 elections.

Monetary policy should aim at reducing
inflation and gradually relaxing interest
rates.

Inflation and interest rates brought
down to low single digits.

Inflation and interest rates remain low.

Strengthen operations of public
enterprises with view to possibly
privatize in medium term.

No significant progress. Most
enterprises continued to run
losses.

Financial positions have improved but
still slow progress in improving service
delivery. No privatization planned.

Create business-friendly environment to
encourage growth and job creation in
nonmineral sector.

Limited progress in easing
constraints, e.g., weak law-andorder and infrastructure.

Little further progress; however,
budgeted spending increase for
rehabilitating infrastructure.

Progress on multi-year tariff reform
program.

On track.

Completed in early 2006; some
backtracking in 2007 budget.

II. BACKGROUND
A. The Economic Setting
4.
Recent developments and the near-term outlook remain favorable (Tables 2–5
and Figures 2–7). High commodity prices and expanding mineral production should
contribute to continued growth and fiscal and external surpluses (Box 2).
•

The recovery is expected to gain steam in 2007, with growth rising to over 4 percent,
as new mines begin production and increased government spending stimulates
activity in the nonmineral sector.

•

Inflation, estimated at 3.5 percent on average in 2006, is expected to rise slightly in
2007 as fiscal spending increases pressure on prices, but remain consistent with the
Bank of Papua New Guinea’s (BPNG) 4 percent medium-term inflation objective.

•

The current account surplus should narrow in 2007 as the value of mineral exports
begins to decline with lower prices expected for key exports. Official external
reserves should increase to about $1.6 billion (4 months of goods and services
imports).

Box 2. Role of the Mining Sector in Papua New Guinea
The mining sector (including petroleum and natural gas) dominates Papua New Guinea’s economy.
Once considered a sector in decline, the recent surge in mineral prices has spurred investment in
existing mines to expand production and in new exploration as reflected in a sharp rise in mineral
exploration applications. The outlook hinges on whether planned projects come on stream before
expected declines in mineral prices dampen activity once more.
Gold and silver (27 percent of exports): The largest mine (Lihir) is expanding output with new
investment, a second sizeable mine (Kainantu) recently began operations, and several new small
mines should start production over the next 2–3 years. The life of another large mine (Porgera) will
likely be longer than previously expected.
Copper (27 percent of exports), nickel, and other minerals: Copper production from the Ok Tedi
mine is expected to decline steadily from its recent highs, albeit over a longer timeframe than
previously envisaged. The large Ramu nickel mine is expected to begin construction in 2007, with
production commencing in 2010.
Oil (23 percent of exports): production volumes should remain flat during 2007–10, followed by a
gradual decline thereafter.
Natural gas: Following the late–2006 discovery of natural gas in Papua New Guinea’s Gulf region,
the largest producer, InterOil, has announced new exploration bids. However, the $5.3 billion PNGQueensland Gas Pipeline Project tapping natural gas reserves located in Papua New Guinea’s
Highlands region is now unlikely to materialize after the external partners’ recent negative
reassessment of the project’s viability due to increasing costs. The government is considering
alternative options for use of the Highland’s gas reserves and another project may be developed if
prices remain high.

•

After a steep rise in the kina’s value in 2003–05, it appreciated by 3 percent against
the U.S. dollar and 6 percent on a real effective basis in 2006.

•

An overall fiscal surplus is expected for the third successive year in 2007, although
the underlying nonmineral deficit would further widen due to higher spending and
lower nonmineral tax revenue (largely reflecting the phased reduction in the personal
income tax). The 2006-07 budgets provide for large spending increases mainly for
development expenditure (over three quarters of the total increase), much of it oneoff, and smaller allotments for public enterprise investment, natural disaster victims,
and domestic arrears clearance. Given weak implementation capacity and the late
timing of the 2006 supplementary budgets, the spending outcome is expected to be
significantly less than appropriated. The remaining amounts would be deposited in
trust fund accounts for future spending.

•

Repayment of 0.5 percent of GDP of external debt in 2006 to the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB) combined with positive debt dynamics (real GDP growth, kina
appreciation, and low interest rates) should contribute to a public sector debt–to-GDP
ratio of 40 percent in 2007.

17
B. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
5.
The macroeconomic outlook should remain positive, if fiscal and monetary
policies are maintained on their current path (Table 6 and Figure 8). Real GDP growth of
about 4 percent is expected over the medium term, together with continued low inflation
rates. Falling export prices should underlie narrowing external current account surpluses. The
nonmineral fiscal deficit is expected to improve gradually after 2007, if one-off spending in
the 2006–07 budgets is not carried over and the “right sizing” program to streamline the
government is implemented.
6.
The balance of risks is to the downside. Higher-than-expected election-related
spending could lead to increasing price pressures; the resulting rise in interest rates as
monetary policy is tightened could choke off economic growth. Still weak fiscal
accountability, especially for many trust funds, also poses risks of higher or inefficient
spending. A steeper-than-anticipated decline in world export commodity prices or
postponement of large mineral projects would heighten the need for fiscal adjustment to
allow room for essential development spending.2 Inaction or unwinding of previous progress
on structural reform would dampen investor confidence. The further spread of HIV/AIDs—
already one of the highest infection rates in the Asia-Pacific region—would have
consequences for growth and human development. On the upside, rapid development of gas
reserves could improve the longer-term outlook for growth.
7.
A doubling of the baseline growth rates would be needed to significantly reduce
poverty and unemployment. Stronger annual growth of 7–8 percent is within reach, but
would require more effective use of Papua New Guinea’s mineral wealth, including a
sustainable medium-term fiscal policy that efficiently delivers needed development
expenditure, and decisive efforts on structural reform to encourage greater activity in the
nonmineral sector. The resulting strengthened fiscal position would improve the debt
sustainability outlook.
8.
Papua New Guinea is at a moderate risk of debt distress, emphasizing the
importance of continued prudent fiscal policy (Appendix I). The staff’s debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) using the low-income country framework suggests that the public sector debt
outlook is particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP growth and to the exchange rate. The
authorities are keenly aware of these risks. The objective of their debt strategy targeting a
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term is to reduce these vulnerabilities.

A 10 percent reduction in key export prices reduces government revenue by 0.5 percent of GDP annually.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on the short-term policy mix that would preserve
macroeconomic stability and provide a bridge to a higher growth path in the future.
The authorities and the staff broadly agreed on the main challenges facing Papua New
Guinea and on the policy priorities needed to address them. In particular, the authorities were
committed to avoiding the election-related fiscal policy excesses that in the past resulted in
significant setbacks to the economy. In addition, while the current monetary and exchange
rate policy was appropriate, a tightened stance would be needed should fiscal-related demand
pressure emerge. Looking forward, in line with the objectives of the MTDS and the MDGs,
the authorities and staff agreed on the need for renewed attention to the structural reform
agenda to encourage private sector activity and raise growth in the nonmineral sector.
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10.
The staff views the current monetary policy stance as appropriate. The monetary
and credit aggregates continue to rise at relatively rapid rates and liquidity in the banking
system remains high. However, along with the continued appreciation of the kina, the BPNG
has absorbed sufficient liquidity to keep inflation within the low single digits.
11.
Looking ahead, both the staff and the authorities see risks for inflation in 2007
and the possible need for tightening the monetary stance. The most serious concern arises
from the risk of unproductive election-related government spending. In addition, pressure
could emerge from expected upward revisions in controlled prices (although these would
likely have a temporary impact), and sustained large mineral revenue inflows. In that light,
the authorities and the staff agreed that monetary policy should be tightened if signs of
inflation pressure emerged.
12.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to a floating exchange rate regime.
The authorities generally limit intervention to smoothing out fluctuations within a relatively
thin market buffeted by volatile foreign exchange flows related to the mineral sector.
Recently, they have used the opportunity of the current favorable terms of trade to build
reserves, while protecting the competitiveness of the nonmineral sector by resisting rapid
appreciation of the kina against the U.S. dollar. The staff supported this pragmatic approach,
given:
•

Mineral prices are not expected to remain at current highs, suggesting that the real
exchange rate need not adjust upward permanently. The large current account surplus
in 2006 is expected to dissipate over the medium term.

20
•

Foreign reserves have increased, but at 4 months of goods and services imports, they
are not large relative to comparator countries (and are small relative to other natural
resource exporters) (Box 3).

•

Competitiveness indicators are mixed, but point to either little change or some
decline in nonmineral sector competitiveness in recent years (Box 4), presenting an
additional challenge for the nonmineral economy where sustained economic and
employment growth must come from over the longer term.

However, as the authorities have neither the resources nor the record of fiscal discipline
needed to defend a fixed rate, should upward pressure be unexpectedly sustained or
downward pressure materialize, the exchange rate should be allowed to move flexibly as
needed.
Fiscal Policy
13.
Against the background of pressures for increasing spending ahead of the 2007
elections, the 2006 and 2007 budgets sought to achieve a balanced budget while giving

•

The staff emphasized its concern that weak public expenditure management might
result in leakages and nonpriority spending, which could lead to a build-up of demand
and inflation pressure. In particular, the months ahead of the mid-2007 elections
might lead to a further expenditure expansion, typical of previous election years. The
authorities stressed that they did not wish to repeat the past mistake of pre-election
spending excesses, particularly given the large size of revenues at stake. For this
reason, the 2006-07 budgets had clearly-defined spending priorities of one-off
development expenditure aligned closely with MTDS objectives.

•

Staff argued for using more of any expected revenue over-performance to pay down
debt. Aside from external and domestic debt, this could also include covering the
large unfunded government liability (about 10 percent of GDP) to the civil-servant
superannuation fund. The authorities emphasized that their objective of pursuing
deeper reduction of external debt under the MTDS was thwarted by costly penalties
for early repayment, while paying down domestic debt was inconsistent with the
desire to build a market for government securities.3 Regarding the superannuation
fund, a reform strategy was already in place to fully cover new employees and to
address the unfunded liability on an annual basis over time; however, they agreed to
explore the staff’s proposal in the future should revenue over-performance continue.

14.
Given critical development needs, the staff welcomed the continuing shift in the
expenditure mix toward public investment, particularly in infrastructure and human
capital, and away from current expenditure.
•

The staff noted with concern that the government had deferred action on the rightsizing initiative recommendations until mid-2007. The authorities agreed that
reviving the public sector reform program should be a priority for the next
government.

•

Overall public sector employment has remained largely unchanged in recent years,
and the wage bill was reduced relative to GDP, though it is still high (about 8 percent
of GDP) relative to most comparators. In that light, the staff welcomed the
authorities’ intention to limit government workers’ wage growth to productivity
increases in the next round of public sector wage negotiations.

•

In addition, the staff encouraged other steps to create further fiscal room, including
reducing subsidies to public enterprises—about 0.7 percent of GDP in the 2006–07
budgets—in line with ongoing reforms, and assisting future development budgets by
preparing costed plans for priority sectors consistent with the MTDS and integrated in
the multi-year fiscal framework.

15.
However, past history indicates that in the absence of improved implementation
capacity, there is a risk that the large increase in development spending may not be
efficiently spent. Leakages of funds deposited in trust accounts are a special concern given
that accountability for many remains weak.4 To that end, the authorities and staff agreed on
the immediate need to strengthen implementation of the existing donor-supported framework

for public expenditure reform (the Public Expenditure Review and Rationalization project),
including in particular:
•

Urgently improving the monitoring and reporting of budget outcomes—including by
applying sanctions to encourage compliance, expanding the system of financial
controllers and auditors, closing trust accounts, and speeding up finalization of the
Integrated Financial and Information Management System—and subjecting all
expenditure to basic accountability procedures (including spending by major
spending agencies, remaining trust fund accounts, district support grants, statutory
authorities, and public enterprises);

•

Strengthening budget execution, in particular for infrastructure and key services. The
authorities noted their intention to process major contracts as efficiently and quickly
as possible. They expressed interest in receiving technical assistance for improving
budget execution, possibly through PFTAC;

•

Clarifying the legal framework establishing responsibility at different government
levels, subjecting provinces and local governments to basic controls and reporting
standards, and reforming current unsustainable legal commitments for central
government financing of provincial and local governments.

16.
While the existing medium-term fiscal strategy assisted the consolidation
achieved over the past several years, large mineral revenue inflows suggest a need for
strengthening the strategy. The existing strategy targets budget balance and a decline in the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 45 percent by 2009. However, given favorable debt dynamics, the
medium-term debt-to-GDP target was achieved in 2006. Staff recommended a medium-term
fiscal strategy that could better anchor fiscal sustainability, while leaving room for
productive spending that would support higher sustained growth.
•

Staff suggested that a revised medium-term fiscal framework that targets gradually
improving nonmineral balances over the medium term—rather than continuing to
target overall budget balance—would strengthen the ability to cope with the volatility
and exhaustibility of mineral revenue and help prevent large yearly expenditure
swings;

•

The authorities could continue to cautiously spend any mineral revenue windfalls in
future years for priority infrastructure and projects that enhance social welfare to the
extent absorptive capacity permits, and use the remainder to further reduce debt;

•

A more ambitious debt reduction strategy could lower the NPV debt-to-GDP ratio
below the 30 percent threshold that classifies Papua New Guinea at a moderate risk
by the end of the medium-term horizon.

26
The authorities observed that they had already begun exploring possible changes to the fiscal
strategy in anticipation of providing an updated framework for a new government following
the elections. In that light, they expressed interest in giving further consideration to the
staff’s proposals in the months ahead.

and emphasized the importance of quickly
finalizing the draft Administration Act prepared with Fund technical assistance. It also
suggested that a comprehensive review of the overall tax system would help ensure that new
tax measures are consistent with the government’s economy-wide priorities, the tax system
promotes uniformity of treatment across all businesses, and the government receives a fair
share of windfall profits from strong commodity prices.
B. Structural Reform for Faster Growth and Development
Financial Sector Issues
18.
Given the importance of a developed and healthy financial sector for long-term
growth, the recent rapid expansion of credit to the private sector is a welcome sign of
re-intermediation. Private sector credit, although still low relative to comparators, has
regained levels existing prior to the last economic downturn. Available data suggest that the
distribution of the credit increase is relatively broad-based. Backward-looking indicators of
financial sector soundness, such as nonperforming loans and return-on-assets, are favorable
(Figure 5). In addition, three of the four major banks in Papua New Guinea are subsidiaries
of established foreign banks, suggesting that underlying risks to the system are low. The
authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment, and noted that they would continue to monitor
closely private sector credit growth for possible signs of increased sector concentration or a
deterioration in credit quality.
19.
In addition, the authorities and staff agreed on other measures that would
further strengthen the financial sector. These include progressing rapidly on implementing
MCM recommendations regarding bank supervision, a risk-based internal audit system,
implementation of recently-enacted AML/CFT legislation, and strengthened internal
management procedures. In addition, there is a need to reinforce supervision of

27
superannuation funds, including passage of legislation now under consideration. Finally, the
staff supported efforts underway to complete implementation of the steps needed for the
creation of a secondary market for government securities.
20.
New draft legislation would allow the Rural Development Bank to expand into
microfinance without adequate oversight and accountability. The staff expressed
concerns with this plan, not least given poor experience with development banks globally
and within Papua New Guinea itself. The authorities acknowledged the risks and agreed that
there is a need to adhere to basic financial sector supervision regulations, including the
principle that all applications for a banking license, including microfinance operations, must
comply with all due diligence and fit and proper criteria.
Private Sector Development
21.
The authorities and staff agreed that for private nonmineral activity to become
the main source of strong and sustainable economic growth and job creation, the
investment environment needs considerable strengthening. While there have been some
advances in recent years, the overall business environment remains difficult. Poor and costly
transport and communications infrastructure, unreliable basic utilities, weak governance,
high crime and weak prosecution, land issues, and little access to skilled labor constrain
growth prospects. The staff observed that the budgeted increase in spending on infrastructure
could measurably affect growth if efficiently executed.
22.
The financial position of the large public utilities has improved in recent years
and enterprises are now designing plans to improve service delivery, but concerns
remain about the slow progress on services and continued need for fiscal subsidies. The
staff recommended that, subject to the still incomplete appropriate regulatory framework
being put in place, parallel actions should be taken such as privatization, opening sectors to
competition, or private minority shares to introduce shareholder oversight. The authorities
noted that they have no plans to advance privatization. The current strategy focuses on costcutting, rationalization and enhancement of services, and the possible use of privatepartnership arrangements as a source of expertise and capital.
Other Issues
23.
Papua New Guinea maintains one of the least restrictive trade regimes in the
region. In 2006, the authorities completed the seven-year tariff reform program launched in
1999 compressing the tariff structure to four rates, with the zero rate applicable on three
quarters of commodities. However, the 2007 budget introduced new exceptions by raising
tariffs by 5–25 percent on three imports (canned beans and tuna, and soft drinks) to protect
local industry. The staff expressed concerns with the backtracking on tariff reform and urged
redressing these slippages as quickly as possible. The authorities explained that the increases
were temporary pending a comprehensive review of tariff policy.

28
24.
Progress by the Auditor General’s office in completing public account audits
with greater timeliness is welcomed, along with the improved compliance by budget
agencies in providing data. The staff suggested that broader accessibility of the general
public to completed audits—now available through 2005—would help strengthen
transparency and accountability. The authorities noted that plans were also underway to
further improve timeliness and to expand the scope of budget audits to include an assessment
of governance issues.
25.
Although data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, the
authorities agreed that shortcomings in quality, coverage, and timeliness continue to
hinder effective monitoring of macroeconomic developments. The poor condition of
fiscal, national accounts, and balance of payments data also add to the lack of transparency
and accountability within the public sector. The authorities welcomed the recommendations
of the recent STA multi-sector mission for strengthening the statistical framework and are
developing a plan for implementing the recommendations and rehabilitating the National
Statistical Office.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Papua New Guinea has made good progress in achieving macroeconomic
stability since 2002. The fiscal consolidation set in motion at that time, along with
supportive monetary policy and favorable export commodity prices, have led to the fourth
year of real economic growth and low inflation. However, reflecting earlier years of poor
economic management and political instability, per capita income is little changed since
independence, and development needs remain high. The main challenge facing Papua New
Guinea is maintaining macroeconomic stability in the short term, especially given increased
downside risks. An improved investment environment is also needed to encourage faster
growth in the longer term that would reduce poverty and unemployment, and close the
performance gap with comparator countries.
27.
The current monetary policy stance seeks to maintain low inflation. With upward
risks for inflation over the next year, including from increases in government spending, the
authorities should be prepared to tighten monetary policy should signs of inflation pressure
emerge.
28.
The managed float exchange rate policy is appropriate. Given the temporary
nature of the current large mineral revenue inflows, the need to guard against the loss of
nonmineral sector competitiveness and accumulation of reserves are a pragmatic response.
However, additional flexibility should be shown in the face of sustained upward pressure or
should downward pressure materialize.
29.
The 2006 supplementary budgets and 2007 budget are appropriately focused on
one-off development expenditure given the temporary nature of the current large

29
mineral revenue inflows. The clearly defined priorities reflected in the decrease in recurrent
spending and debt, and increase in development expenditure are welcomed. However, the
potential size of the spending increase and the risks that spending will not be used as
appropriated are significant concerns, especially given weak implementation capacity and the
history of misappropriation of funds and pre-election spending excesses. To address these
concerns, the enforcement of the monitoring and reporting of budget outcomes should be
considerably strengthened and all major spending agencies should be subject to basic
accountability procedures. The staff also urges moving rapidly to resume implementation of
the right-sizing initiative to streamline public spending and welcomes plans to limit wage
increases to productivity increases. Greater debt reduction is advocated, especially if further
windfall revenue materializes, such as covering the large unfunded liability to the civil
servant superannuation fund. In addition, preservation of the nonmineral revenue base would
be a critical support for long-term fiscal sustainability.
30.
The recent expansion of credit to the private sector is a welcome sign, given the
importance of a developed financial sector for long-term growth. The overall financial
sector appears sound. However, the authorities are urged to follow through with
recommendations to expand supervision to non-banking financial institutions, tighten
propriety controls at the central bank, and complete implementation of AML/CFT
legislation. Plans to expand the development bank into microfinance without adequate
oversight are a concern and should be reversed.
31.
Little progress has been made on the underlying structural constraints holding
back private sector activity and more rapid medium-term growth. While the financial
position of public utility monopolies has improved, services remain costly and unreliable.
The necessary regulatory framework should be quickly finalized as a first step to introduce
competition to the public enterprise sector. Rapid progress is also needed to improve the
transport and communications infrastructure and strengthen governance and law
enforcement.
32.
Although data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, major
shortcomings in quality and timeliness continue to affect monitoring of macroeconomic
developments. The authorities’ intention to overhaul the main statistical framework is
welcomed. Implementation of the STA mission’s recommendations should begin without
delay.
33.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY5
This appendix summarizes the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Papua New Guinea
using the new framework for low-income countries. The baseline macroeconomic scenario
underlying this DSA is the medium-term outlook discussed in the staff report, including the
sustained implementation of the ongoing medium-term fiscal strategy. This appendix also
assesses the impact of various exogenous shocks on the sustainability of public sector debt
and external debt under the baseline scenario.
A. Main Assumptions
•

Real GDP growth is projected to grow at about 4 percent in 2006-2011 as agricultural
productivity improves, several mining projects come on stream, and continued
gradual progress is made on structural reform.

•

Monetary policy continues to be geared toward maintaining low inflation and
achieving a sound external position.

•

Fiscal policy remains unchanged and in line with the government’s medium-term
fiscal strategy; surpluses are expected to decline due to falling mineral revenues and
nonmineral balances improve steadily after 2007.

•

Papua New Guinea would have access to external concessional finance and continue
to follow a prudent debt strategy.

•

Prices of key commodities are in line with January 2007 WEO assumptions.

•

Structural reforms outlined under the authorities’ Medium-term Development
Strategy, including those on public sector reform, are implemented at a gradual pace.

•

Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the PNG-Queensland gas pipeline
project, this DSA assumes no government borrowing to finance an equity
participation (in contrast to that envisaged in the 2005 Article IV DSA).

5

As Papua New Guinea is an IBRD/IDA blend country, this DSA was prepared by Fund staff only under the
IMF-WB DSA framework for Low-Income Countries. See Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Assessments in Low-Income Countries—Further Considerations.

38
B. Total Public Sector Debt Sustainability
The public sector debt ratio declined from 67.4 percent of GDP at end-2003 to an
estimated 39.3 percent of GDP at end-2006 (Appendix I, Table 1). This improvement
reflects prudent fiscal policy, favorable mineral sector developments (in particular, strong
export prices in recent years), kina appreciation, lower interest rates, and a sustained
recovery since the current government took office in mid-2002. Of total public debt,
approximately 50 percent is external debt, of which 47 percent of loans are in US dollars, 36
percent in Japanese yen, and 14 percent in Euros. Multilateral debt accounts for about twothirds (AsDB and World Bank) of external debt. Japan is the main bilateral creditor. Under
the authorities’ Medium-Term Debt Strategy, foreign-currency loans are considered only if
they are highly concessionary (grant element of 35 percent).
Under the baseline, the public sector debt ratio is projected to decline to 34.3 percent of
GDP by 2011 and 13.6 percent by 2026. The projected debt improvement stems mainly
from the expectation of a continued prudent fiscal policy into the medium term, and
favorable debt dynamics. The NPV of public debt would decline sharply from 48.2 percent
of GDP in 2005 to 40.1 percent of GDP in 2006, and continue to decline to 35.3 percent of
GDP by 2011 and to 13.5 percent of GDP by 2026. The NPV of public debt service-torevenue ratio, which is estimated to fall significantly in 2006 due to high windfall revenue, is
expected to rise somewhat in 2007 as mineral revenue moderates. The debt service to
revenue ratio should revert to being relatively stable (13 percent), before declining sharply in
the longer term.
Papua New Guinea faces a moderate risk of debt distress under the IMF-WB DSA
framework for LICs.6 The main results are: (i) only one indicator—NPV of debt to GDP
ratio—is above its threshold under the baseline scenario—and it declines under the threshold
over the long term, (ii) other indicators are well below their thresholds over the entire
projected period, and (iii) only under one bound test for lower real GDP growth are these
thresholds significantly breached.
The standard analysis indicates that the paths of the debt ratios are particularly
sensitive to changes in real GDP growth and the exchange rate (Appendix I, Table 2 and
Figure 1). Compared to 2006, a decline in real GDP growth to one standard deviation below
its historical average would raise the NPV of public debt to GDP ratio by about 20
percentage points of GDP in the long term. A one-time 30 percent real exchange rate

6

Papua New Guinea is rated a poor performer for its policies and institutions by the IMF-WB LIC DSA
framework. Thus, Papua New Guinea’s applicable thresholds are: (i) 100 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports,
(ii) 30 percent for NPV of debt-to-GDP, and (iii) 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenue; and for debt
service: (i) 15 percent of exports and (ii) 25 percent of revenues.

39
depreciation in 2007 would raise the NPV of debt to GDP ratio by about 10 percentage
points.
C. External Debt Sustainability
Papua New Guinea’s total external debt has declined in recent years, from 65.3 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 32.9 percent in 2006 (Appendix I, Table 3). External debt as a percent of
exports is also estimated to have declined significantly from 107 percent in 2003 to
42 percent in 2006.
External public debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario, as all three
debt indicators (the NPV of public external debt of GDP, the NPV of debt in percent of
exports, and the debt service to exports ratio) do not breach the key thresholds. Based on
available data, private external debt was estimated at 12 percent of GDP at end-2006. Private
external debt is expected to decline over the long term, as large mineral projects that
accounted for a high proportion of debt reach completion.
External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to shocks to lower export growth. Stress
tests were carried out to test the robustness of the baseline scenario. The decline in export
value growth by one standard deviation below its historical average would raise the NPV of
public external debt-to-GDP threshold by 25 percentage points during 2006–09, and only fall
below the threshold level in 2019. A one time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2007
would raise the NPV of debt to GDP by 6 percentage points in the first three years before
falling over the longer term. The export shock to the NPV of debt-to-exports would raise the
level closer to (though still under) the distress threshold for the first ten years, before falling
over the long term. Papua New Guinea’s external debt distress risk is further moderated by
the fact that it has an excellent external repayment record, having never defaulted in the past.
D. Conclusions
While Papua New Guinea has made significant progress in reducing its public debt
burden, it will need to continue its prudent management of debt over the medium-tolong term in order to mitigate risks to public debt sustainability. While most indicators
show that the economy’s debt is manageable, Papua New Guinea faces a moderate risk of
debt distress. The outlook is particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP growth and to the
exchange rate, highlighting the vulnerability of the debt dynamics to potential shocks and the
need to avoid policy slippages. To further help guard against these vulnerabilities, Papua
New Guinea should ensure that any external borrowing is obtained on concessional terms, in
line with its Medium-Term Debt Strategy.

APPENDIX III. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: SUMMARY OF ANNEXES

Fund Relations
Papua New Guinea joined the Fund in October 1975, and has no outstanding purchases or
loans. The last stand-by arrangement expired in September 2001. Papua New Guinea has a
managed floating exchange rate arrangement; the exchange rate of the kina is determined in
the interbank market in which authorized banks participate. The 2005 Article IV consultation
was concluded by the Executive Board on February 13, 2006 (IMF Country Report
No. 06/99).
Relations with the World Bank Group
Papua New Guinea has received 35 IBRD loans and 13 IDA credits amounting to
$787 million and $115 million in commitments, respectively. At present, there are two active
loans, totaling $65 million. In June 2003, the Bank suspended disbursements on the Forestry
and Conservation Project due to noncompliance with the loan agreement. The loan was
cancelled at the government’s request in June 2005. The Bank is involved in public
expenditure management, health and education, and HIV/AIDS. An Interim Strategy Note
provided guidance through end-2006 and a Country Assistance Strategy is now under
preparation. The IFC has committed $14.5 million.
Relations with PFTAC
Assistance to Papua New Guinea in recent years has been limited due to the presence of
extensive assistance under the Australian Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP). In all, there
have been 21 missions since 2000, and Papua New Guinea has sent over 50 officials to the
Center’s regional seminars, workshops and training courses in this period.
Relations with the Asian Development Bank
Papua New Guinea has been approved 59 loans totaling $927 million for 46 projects.
Currently there are 9 active loan-financed projects (and one special fund grant-financed
project). AsDB approved a new strategy in July 2006 focusing on (i) public finance
management; (ii) private sector development; (iii) transport sector; and (iv) health and
HIV/AIDS. Public enterprises and utilities reform are key issues the AsDB will support,
initially through technical assistance. Total lending over 2006–2008 is expected to remain a
blend of Asian Development Fund ($77 million) and ordinary capital resources. Lending will
include one new priority investment project per year.

47
Statistical Issues
Although data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes,
inadequate coverage and timeliness of key macroeconomic data continue to hinder the
conduct of macroeconomic policy. The September 2006 STA multisector statistics mission
assessed the institutional arrangements, methodological foundations, and accuracy and
reliability of data and found serious shortcomings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 21, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Papua New Guinea
On March 7, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea.1
Background
Papua New Guinea is enjoying its fourth year of recovery and macroeconomic stability,
but major challenges lie ahead. Sound macroeconomic policies over the past several
years have reduced fiscal vulnerabilities, lowered inflation, spurred business confidence,
and boosted growth. High prices for key export commodities (petroleum, copper, gold,
and most agricultural products) have strengthened the fiscal and external positions.
However, progress toward achieving the country’s Medium-Term Development Strategy
objectives or Millennium Development Goals has been limited. In particular, structural
reforms needed to stimulate activity in the nonmineral economy have stalled in advance
of the June 2007 general elections.
Reflecting past years of political instability and weak economic management, per capita
income is little improved since independence in 1975. As a result of earlier election-year
fiscal policy excesses, the current government faced a near crisis situation when it took
office in 2002; its efforts during its initial years mainly—and successfully—focused on

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

stabilizing the fiscal situation and promoting economic recovery. However, underlying
development needs in Papua New Guinea still remain to be fully addressed. The
dominance of the natural resource sector has hindered the development of nonmineral
sectors of the economy. Poor infrastructure, weak governance, and an unattractive
business environment have constrained more rapid growth. Although recent growth
rates have been strong relative to the past, the growth performance gap relative to
comparator countries is widening. Poverty and unemployment remain high as the
economy is unable to absorb a rapidly growing labor force.
Recent developments and the near-term outlook remain favorable. High commodity
prices and expanding mineral production should contribute to continued growth and
large fiscal and external surpluses. The recovery is expected to gain steam in 2007, with
growth rising to over 4 percent, as new mines begin production and increased
government spending stimulates activity in the nonmineral sector. Inflation is expected
to rise slightly, as fiscal spending increases pressure on prices, but remain within the
low single digits.
The current account surplus should narrow in 2007 as the value of mineral exports
begins to decline with lower prices expected for key exports. Official external reserves
should increase to about $1.6 billion (4 months of goods and services imports). After a
steep rise in the kina’s value in 2003-05, it appreciated by 3 percent against the U.S.
dollar and 6 percent on a real effective basis in 2006.
An overall fiscal surplus is expected for the third successive year in 2007, although the
underlying nonmineral deficit would further widen due to higher spending and lower
nonmineral tax revenue. The 2006-07 budgets provide for large spending increases
mainly for development expenditure (over three quarters of the total increase), much of
it one-off, and smaller allotments for public enterprise investment, natural disaster
victims, and domestic arrears clearance. Given weak implementation capacity and the
late timing of the 2006 supplementary budgets, it is estimated that a limited amount of
the expenditure appropriations was spent in 2006, and the remainder deposited in trust
fund accounts for future spending. Repayment of 0.5 percent of GDP of external debt in
2006 combined with positive debt dynamics (real GDP growth, kina appreciation, and
low interest rates) should contribute to a public sector debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent in
2007.
The macroeconomic outlook should remain positive, if fiscal and monetary policies are
maintained on their current path. Real GDP growth of about 4 percent is expected over
the medium term, together with continued low inflation rates. Falling export prices
should underlie narrowing external current account surpluses. The nonmineral fiscal
deficit is expected to improve gradually after 2007, if one-off spending in the 2006–07
budgets is not carried over, and the “right sizing” program to streamline the government
is implemented.

3

However, the balance of risks is to the downside. Higher-than-expected election-related
spending could lead to increasing price pressure; the resulting rise in interest rates as
monetary policy is tightened could choke off economic growth. Still weak fiscal
accountability, especially for many trust funds, also poses risks of higher or inefficient
spending. A steeper-than-anticipated decline in world export commodity prices or
postponement of large mineral projects would heighten the need for fiscal adjustment to
allow room for essential development spending. Inaction or unwinding of previous
progress on structural reform would dampen investor confidence. The further spread of
HIV/AIDs would have consequences for growth and human development. On the
upside, rapid development of gas reserves could improve the longer-term outlook for
growth.
A doubling of the baseline growth rates would be needed to significantly reduce poverty
and unemployment. Stronger annual growth of 7-8 percent is within reach, but would
require more effective use of Papua New Guinea’s mineral wealth, including a
sustainable medium-term fiscal policy that efficiently delivers needed development
expenditure, and decisive efforts on structural reform to encourage greater activity in the
nonmineral sector. The resulting strengthened fiscal position would improve the debt
sustainability outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
The Directors commended the Papua New Guinea authorities for their sound and
supportive macroeconomic policies. Along with favorable commodity export prices,
these have led to a sustained economic recovery, macroeconomic stability, a strong
external position, and a declining debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years. However, Directors
recognized that significant challenges remain, including the need to reduce
unemployment and poverty and the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. They
encouraged the authorities to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies and to step up
the pace of structural reform, in order to accelerate economic diversification, boost
private investment and growth, and move more quickly toward the Millennium
Development Goals.
Directors welcomed the central bank’s focus on price stability and its readiness to
tighten monetary policy should inflation pressures emerge. Directors considered the
managed float of the exchange rate to be an appropriate response to appreciation
pressures stemming from the temporary influx of mineral export revenues. While
recognizing the importance of maintaining the competitiveness of the non-mineral
sector, they advised that the potential inflationary pressures from increased liquidity be
carefully monitored, and that, in the event of sustained revenue inflows, a more flexible
exchange rate would help contain such pressures.
Directors welcomed the shift of emphasis from recurrent to development spending,
particularly for infrastructure and human capital, in the 2006 supplementary budgets and
the 2007 budget. At the same time, they expressed some concern about the potential

4

size of the spending increases and the risk that spending might not always be used as
appropriated, given the weak budget implementation capacity, the approach of the
mid-2007 parliamentary elections, and the economy’s limited absorptive capacity. In this
regard, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to maintain fiscal
prudence in the run-up to the elections. They encouraged strengthened public
expenditure management, subjection of all major spending agencies to basic
accountability procedures, pressing ahead with the closure of unneeded trust accounts,
and a resumption of the “right-sizing” initiative to streamline government spending.
Directors emphasized the importance of preserving the non-mineral revenue base and
containing the non-mineral fiscal deficit to maintain long-term fiscal sustainability. They
supported plans to improve tax administration, and welcomed the progress made in
implementing the government’s medium-term debt strategy. Looking ahead, Directors
saw merit in continuing to cautiously spend any mineral revenue windfalls in future years
for priority infrastructure and projects that enhance social welfare, to the extent that
absorptive capacity permits, and to use the remainder to further reduce debt as much as
possible.
Directors welcomed the overall soundness of the financial system. They viewed the
recent expansion of bank credit to the private sector as a sign of re-intermediation and
business confidence, while cautioning that credit quality should be monitored closely.
They encouraged the authorities to further strengthen supervision, particularly of
non-banks, and to implement the recently-passed legislation against money laundering
and terrorism financing. Directors expressed concern that the Rural Development
Bank’s planned expansion into microfinance operations would lack adequate prudential
oversight.
While appreciating the institutional constraints facing Papua New Guinea, Directors
stressed that greater progress is needed in removing the structural impediments to
private sector activity and more rapid growth. They highlighted, in particular, the
importance of improving the business environment, the governance and law
enforcement systems, and the transport and communications infrastructure. As basic
utility services remain costly and unreliable, Directors recommended that the necessary
regulatory framework be quickly finalized as a first step toward introducing competition
in the public enterprise sector. Beyond this, the authorities were also encouraged to
reconsider their decision not to move forward on privatization.
Directors recommended that a stronger effort be made to improve the quality and
timelines of macroeconomic statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
