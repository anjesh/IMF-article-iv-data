REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2008 Consultation with the Republic of Croatia
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Anthony Boote
April 17, 2008

Discussions for the 2008 Article IV consultation took place in Zagreb from February 21 to
March 4, 2008. The staff team comprised Messrs. Feldman (head), Jafarov, and Moore (all EUR),
and Mmes. Ilyina (PDR) and Ötker-Robe (MCM). The mission met with Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Economy Polančec; Finance Minister Šuker; Croatian National Bank (CNB)
Governor Rohatinski; other senior officials; and representatives of social partners, think tanks, and
the private sector.
Following parliamentary elections in November 2007, the largest party in the government, the
center-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), formed a coalition with two smaller parties and
seven independents. The coalition holds a small parliamentary majority.
Croatia started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. The European
Commission has indicated that accession negotiations could be completed in autumn 2009,
stressing the importance of further progress with judicial and administrative reforms, fighting
corruption, and shipyard restructuring.
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix II) and subscribes to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though
some improvements would be desirable (Appendix III).
The mission held a press conference on the concluding statement (published in Croatian and
English). The authorities intend to publish this staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook. Although growth accelerated last year, Croatia has significant
vulnerabilities: a large current account deficit and high external debt, alongside balance-sheet
exposures to currency risk. Also, surging food and utility prices pushed inflation higher. But
Croatia has so far felt limited effects from the global financial turbulence. The real exchange
rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals.
Staff’s baseline for this year is for growth to slow, but to remain around estimated potential
(4–4½ percent); inflation to ease but stay higher than in recent years; and the current account
deficit and external debt to remain modestly above their 2007 levels. Downside risks to the
baseline predominate. Thus, Croatia is confronted with the important policy challenges of
reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring that higher inflation does not become entrenched in
expectations, while raising potential growth.
Policies. Staff and the authorities agreed on the benefits of a tightly managed exchange rate
in light of balance-sheet exposures. But this policy requires strong support from financial,
fiscal and structural policies to ensure adequate risk management in banks, restrain demand,
and boost export growth and productivity. This, in turn, would lessen external vulnerabilities
and raise economic growth on a sustainable basis, and is all the more important when
external sustainability could be threatened by a further deterioration in the global
environment and repricing of credit risks by foreign lenders. The CNB has introduced
additional administrative and prudential measures to limit credit growth and macro-financial
vulnerabilities; and nonbank supervision and regulation has continued to improve.
Staff recommends a somewhat more ambitious fiscal adjustment path than envisaged by the
authorities: saving any revenue overperformance in 2008 and bringing the general
government deficit to 1 percent of GDP or less in 2009, also aiming for balance by the end of
the government’s term. Expenditure reform and restraint are key, as is significant
frontloading of fiscal adjustment, with a view to more quickly addressing external
vulnerabilities and inflation.
Faster structural reforms would raise confidence in successfully concluding EU accession
negotiations and thus in economic stability. Once again, the discussions underscored the
urgency of improving the business environment and addressing corruption, which have
deterred investors and dampened export performance. Reform of the heavily indebted
shipyards is urgent.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Growth accelerated in 2007, but external imbalances continued to increase. On
the back of strong domestic demand, real GDP growth reached 5.6 percent, albeit with some
moderation in the second half of the year (Figure 1 and Table 1). Domestic demand pressures
were also reflected in the current account deficit, which widened to 8.6 percent of GDP, with
higher world energy prices contributing as well (Table 2). External debt reached nearly
88 percent of GDP at end-2007 (Figure 2).
2.
The exchange rate has been stable, but inflation picked up. Because of financial
euroization (Figure 3) and balance-sheet exposures,1 the Croatian National Bank (CNB) has
sought to maintain broad exchange rate stability, intervening periodically in the foreign
exchange market (text chart). In 2007, although the volume of intervention declined, the
kuna-euro exchange rate fluctuated within an increasingly narrow range.2 Until very recently,
the stable exchange rate helped keep inflation between 2 and 4 percent, aided by moderate
wage growth and limited pass-through of rising world oil prices to retail energy prices
(Figure 4). Nevertheless, surging food and utility prices pushed year-on-year headline
inflation above 6 percent in early 2008, the highest rate since the early 1990s. Year-on-year
core inflation reached 5.3 percent in January 2008.
3.
The headline fiscal deficit narrowed significantly in recent years, though a
broader measure of fiscal policy shows an expansionary fiscal stance in 2007 as the
economy boomed. The government reduced the general government deficit from 6.1 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 3 percent in 2006, and to an estimated 2.3 percent in 2007.3 Taking into
account off-budget and quasi-fiscal activities not included in the general government
accounts,4 a broader measure of the fiscal deficit was little changed in 2006 and 2007
(Table 3). But with growth particularly rapid in 2007, cyclical adjustment implies that the
overall fiscal stance was expansionary in that year.
4.
External competitiveness appears adequate. Despite some gradual real exchange
rate appreciation, indicators of price and cost competitiveness vis-à-vis central European peer
countries remain benign (Figure 5). Market share of goods exports has been steady. Tourism
receipts—which account for almost 40 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services—

have been strong.5 Staff estimates discussed in the policy issues section below indicate that
the real exchange rate is broadly consistent with fundamentals.
5.
The financial sector is healthy, but risks associated with rapid credit growth
have been a concern. Bank credit to the nongovernment sector increased by 23 percent in
2006 (Table 4, Figure 3), taking the stock above 70 percent of GDP and—in contrast to most
other countries in the region—above “equilibrium” levels estimated by several studies.6 As

discussed in the accompanying Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA), banks’ capital
adequacy and asset quality are at sufficiently comfortable levels to withstand a range of
shocks (Tables 5 and 6). Though declining, profitability is still high. Nevertheless, significant
external imbalances and rising asset prices (and volatility in the case of equities)
accompanying credit growth expose banks to sudden shifts in market sentiment. Banks also
face significant interest and exchange rate induced credit risks: the majority of their loans is
at variable interest rates and linked to foreign currency; and adverse shocks would erode
borrowers’ debt-servicing capacity in circumstances of high corporate and household debt.
The CNB has taken a range of measures, whose aims include curbing banks’ borrowing from
abroad and domestic credit expansion (Table 7); bank credit subsequently slowed.
6.
While Croatia had not been particularly hurt by the financial turbulence
through 2007, cracks have appeared (Figure 6). In particular, stock prices surged in 2006–
07 (increasing by 60 percent annually), taking market capitalization to 130 percent of GDP;
but prices slumped by almost 30 percent in the first 3 months of 2008.7 A widening CDS
spread suggests concerns with external vulnerabilities, though not to the same extent as for
some other countries.
II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.

The outlook for 2008 suggests macroeconomic imbalances will persist.

●
In staff’s baseline (Table 8), which assumes the authorities achieve their targets for
the general government deficit (discussed below), growth slows this year to within staff’s
estimate of potential (4–4½ percent).8 This is in line with the moderation already under way
since the second half of 2007, and mainly reflects slower consumption growth, with the bulk
of the “pensioners’ debt” now repaid and lower consumer confidence in the wake of stock
market weakness, and the unwinding of last year’s jump in government investment.
Nevertheless, inflation, while projected to ease from its current rate, remains higher than in
recent years. The current account deficit and external debt stay modestly above their levels in
2007. There was broad agreement on the macroeconomic setting, with only minor differences
with the authorities’ forecasts.
●
Downside risks to the baseline predominate. Inflation could be worse than expected if
there are second-round effects from higher food and utility prices—for example, if wage
moderation were not maintained. A deeper slowdown in trading partners’ growth—for
example, if the financial and external risks flagged in the April 2008 WEO were to
materialize—would widen the current account deficit and likely cause less favorable external

Financial Theory and Practice.

8
debt dynamics. While Croatia has so far felt little impact from the turmoil in global financial
markets, the ongoing global repricing of credit risks could eventually push up external costs
for Croatian borrowers and result in higher local bank lending rates. The potential for shocks
in southeastern Europe represents an additional downside risk.
8.
From a medium-term perspective, the baseline envisages progress toward
external stability. The current account deficit steadily narrows in relation to GDP. The
external-debt-to-GDP ratio falls during the government’s term.
9.
Tensions from heavy capital inflows, if they were to persist, could strain the
macroeconomic framework in an environment combining a number of underlying
difficulties. These include heavy state presence in the economy, lackluster growth in goods
exports, and extensive euroization. Tensions could be particularly acute in the absence of
continued structural reforms conducive to higher greenfield FDI and other capital flows that
would add to productive capacity, especially in the tradables sector.9
10.
Two alternative scenarios—one assuming more vigorous structural reforms and
the other a worse external environment—illustrate the potential benefits of greater
ambition but the risks from policy inaction. Table 9 illustrates a higher sustainable growth
path assuming early resolution of problems in the shipyards and substantial reform of the
business environment. Table 10 presents a scenario based on a more severely deteriorating
external environment. The resulting weaker export performance, higher current account
deficits, and lower-than-baseline FDI imply a continuing buildup of external debt over the
projection period—and heightened vulnerabilities to shocks.10 Slow structural reform
implementation and a failure to attract more greenfield FDI would increase the risk of
external instability.
III. POLICY ISSUES
11.
In light of the outlook, the discussions focused on measures to jointly attain the
goals of reducing vulnerabilities, ensuring that higher inflation does not become
entrenched in expectations, and raising potential growth. Specifically, the discussions
centered on the benefits of a significant reduction in the size of government, including by a
frontloaded expenditure-led contraction in the general government deficit. They also focused
on the critical importance of maintaining and rigorously applying high prudential standards
in the financial sector. Finally, the merits of accelerating structural reforms—also to bolster
confidence in the prospects for acceding to the EU and thereby confidence in economic
stability—were also discussed. To inform the discussions, staff prepared, and gave seminars
on, two accompanying selected issues papers on assessing external stability and analyzing

A large depreciation could push external debt well over 120 percent of GDP (Appendix I).

the efficiency of government expenditure. Table 11 summarizes the authorities’ responses to
past Fund recommendations.
12.
With monetary policy constrained by the tightly managed exchange rate, there
was broad agreement that maintaining stability required strong support from financial,
fiscal, and structural policies.
●
Because a stable exchange rate tends to reduce perceptions of exchange rate risk and
is therefore conducive to unhedged foreign-currency borrowing, strong prudential policies
and bank supervision are needed to ensure adequate risk management.
●
The tightly managed exchange rate also limits the ability of monetary policy to
respond to domestic demand pressures, implying that support from fiscal policy is essential
to help contain higher inflation and external imbalances. Fiscal policy could, however, face a
trade-off between these objectives if growth were to slow substantially below potential. In
such a case, consideration would need to be given to allowing automatic stabilizers to play,
taking into account the extent of external imbalances at the time.
●
Finally, a gradual narrowing of external imbalances and orderly real convergence
with the EU can only be achieved through improvement in the competitiveness of Croatia’s
economy brought about by wage moderation and structural reforms. There was broad
recognition that the impact on competitiveness of any attempt to weaken the exchange rate
would likely be offset by higher inflation and adverse balance-sheet effects.
A. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
13.
The advantages of the CNB’s policy of tightly managing the exchange rate were
well recognized. A stable exchange rate has been a key element of Croatia’s successes,
including by acting as a powerful anchor for inflationary expectations after Croatia’s
experience with hyperinflation. And given persistently high levels of financial euroization,
maintaining broad exchange rate stability has mitigated significant balance sheet risks.
14.
Staff discussed its external stability assessment of Croatia.11 Reassuringly, staff
calculations using the CGER methodologies, based on the baseline, imply that the real
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (text table). However, all recognized that
the risk of instability is accentuated by the high level of external debt-to-GDP ratio and the
further widening of the current account deficit.
15.
In view of persistent external imbalances and rising demand, the CNB
introduced additional credit measures in 2007. These measures were taken against a

1/ Current account norm corresponds to a CA level that is consistent with a specific set of economic
fundamentals; “Norm_CA” and “Norm_NFA” are computed using the panel regression estimates for two
model specifications, with lagged current account balance and initial NFA position, respectively. The external
sustainability approach assumes the medium/long-run real GDP growth rate of 4.8 percent and inflation rate
of 3 percent (in euros). The benchmark NFA position is based on the latest official data, with the exception of
the inward FDI position, which is estimated as cumulative FDI flows from 1998 onward. The rest of the data
comes from the latest WEO (April, 2008). For more details on the CGER methodologies, see Methodology for
CGER Exchange Rate Assessments (2006).
2/ Underlying current account balance assumes that both domestic and foreign output gaps are closed and
is adjusted for the projected REER movement during 2008–13.
3/ Current account elasticity to REER is computed using the standard long-run real exchange rate
elasticities for imports (0.92) and exports (-0.71), as well as the values of Croatia’s exports and imports of
goods and services (in percent of GDP) over the period of 2003–07.

background of concerns about a loosening fiscal stance: elections were coming up in the fall
and known off-budget fiscal spending was slated to increase (notably because of “pensioners’
debt” repayments of 1.2 percent of GDP). In addition, options to curtail rapidly growing
credit were judged to be limited. In these circumstances, the CNB introduced credit controls
in 2007, while recognizing their potentially negative side effects—including on credit to
smaller enterprises and bank competition. The CNB has extended the controls to 2008. The
controls have contributed to a significant slowdown in bank credit, as intended by the CNB;
available data suggests that total credit growth to the private sector (from external sources
and domestic banks and nonbanks) slowed modestly (Figure 3). Arguably, the effects of the
controls were more significant from a counterfactual point of view, to the extent that credit
growth would have been higher without the controls.
16.
The CNB has taken a number of prudential and supervisory measures to limit
macro-financial vulnerabilities. The prudential measures (listed in Table 7) have
contributed to a fall in the share of foreign currency-linked loans since 2006. In addition,
banks seem to be more aware of risks related to such lending, have reduced their foreign
borrowing, and intensified efforts to attract deposits and capital. There are also recent signs

11
of a tightening of lending standards, including through increased lending rates and tighter
conditions in granting loans.
17.
The CNB has worked to improve communications with banks in Croatia and
cooperation with the supervisory authorities of their parent banks abroad. The recent
update of the IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) viewed these
actions as crucial (Table 12). Interactions with banks (e.g., through workshops and
consultations) have contributed to a better understanding of CNB measures, improved their
acceptability, and raised risk awareness, thus helping better align the incentives of the
financial institutions with those of the CNB. With foreign banks owning more than
90 percent of the banking system, the CNB was actively seeking to upgrade home-host
supervisory coordination.
18.
Preparations for Basel II—to become effective in January 2009—appear on
track. According to the FSSA, while the framework for risk-focused supervision is still
evolving, the current supervisory techniques and risk management processes do not appear to
pose risks for successful implementation of Basel II. In addition, consultations between the
CNB and banks have been useful in enhancing preparations for Basel II.
19.
Supervision and regulation of the nonbank financial sector has continued to
improve. The inclusion of previously unregulated leasing companies under the oversight of
the nonbank supervisor, HANFA, has helped in closing a channel for circumvention of the
credit measures on banks. Coordination efforts have also been stepped up between the CNB
and HANFA on information sharing, the intention to jointly inspect banking groups, and the
plans to map cross-sector risk exposures and ownership linkages between banks and
nonbanks.
20.
The authorities nevertheless recognize the need for vigilance, including by
stepping up contingency planning efforts. It was therefore recognized that further
prudential measures may need to be considered to contain any emerging risks, especially
from abroad, including contagion risks from global financial turbulence via mature-market
European banks (as illustrated by the worst-case stress tests in the FSSA). The CNB also
plans to produce a forward-looking financial stability report, expanding the stress testing
analyses to a variety of possible shocks, and has initiated formal communications with
foreign supervisory authorities concerning contingency planning for possible external shocks.
The authorities are also working to clarify the roles of different agencies in bank resolution
and deposit insurance.
B. Fiscal Policy
21.
The government envisages a further narrowing of the general government
deficit. Its current plans target a deficit of ½ percent of GDP (on a modified GFS basis) by
2010. The path to this target represents a considerable tightening compared with the plans
during the previous Article IV consultation (Table 11).

12
22.
Staff recognized that the targeted adjustment was significant, but recommended
maintaining momentum by aiming for balance by 2011 (the end of the government’s
term) while significantly frontloading adjustment. More frontloaded adjustment would
have a more immediate impact in dealing with the current challenges of bringing down
inflation (and inflation expectations) and reducing external imbalances. More frontloading
would also raise the likelihood of meeting the targets for the general government balance, as
politics will make reforms increasingly difficult in the latter part of the government’s term.
Reducing the government’s size would also raise the private sector’s share of economic
activity, thereby enhancing overall productivity and the rate of potential growth.
23.
The discussions focused on achieving an expenditure-led reduction in the fiscal
deficit. Some progress on reform is in train, including discussions on containing health care
spending and designing an approach to compiling a database on various social assistance
benefits paid. However, the authorities and staff agreed that more needs to be done to
develop specific measures. Staff noted the potential for significant budgetary savings with
reforms in other areas, including the civil service, education, and state aid (subsidies). Given
the significant room for improvement in the efficiency of public spending, a substantial
expenditure reduction can be achieved without unduly compromising the delivery of public
services.12
24.

The discussions also noted some favorable aspects of the 2008 budget.

●
The budget targets a general government deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP, equal to the
2007 preliminary outturn, but lower than the original target of 2.8 percent for the 2007
budget. Taking into account the formation of a coalition government and the associated
spending pressures, staff recognized the accomplishment this would represent.
●
The government intends to limit government wage increases to 6 percent. Because the
government is a very large employer, there was agreement that this could send a helpful
signal to keep other wage increases moderate. Revenues are also estimated conservatively,
leaving potential room for further deficit reduction.
●
A broad measure of the fiscal deficit that takes into account off-budget and quasifiscal activities (outside the general government accounts) shows that the overall fiscal stance
will considerably tighten in 2008, though this mainly reflects the one-off effects of repaying
the bulk of pensioners’ debt in the preceding year rather than specific new policy measures.
25.
Reflecting the benefits of frontloading, but with the budget already approved,
staff recommended that the authorities take any opportunity available to further
12

This was a key message of the accompanying selected issues paper on the efficiency of government spending.
The paper was accepted for presentation in April 2008 at a Zagreb conference (Welfare Performance and
Design) sponsored by the Croatian Institute of Public Finance.

13
reduce the 2008 fiscal deficit. This would provide some insurance against downside risks
requiring fiscal action. Staff urged the authorities to save any revenue overperformance,
while keeping to or below budgeted expenditures, taking advantage of any buffers.
26.
Frontloading also implies that 2009 is the time to undertake the lion’s share of
fiscal adjustment. Thus, staff recommended a fiscal deficit in 2009 no larger and preferably
smaller than 1 percent of GDP. This is smaller than the authorities’ target of a deficit of 1.4
percent of GDP. Any expansion in the deficits of off-budget entities should be offset by
general government adjustment. In addition, there was widespread recognition of the benefits
of starting preparatory work soon because of the need to take underlying measures in several
spending areas. Staff also emphasized that avoiding a ratcheting up of spending when
revenues overperform would facilitate adjustment in later years.
27.
Ways to enhance fiscal flexibility and thereby improve the readiness of fiscal
policy to respond to unanticipated shocks were an additional point of emphasis. In this
regard, staff recommended a gradual increase in the general contingency reserve and having
contingent spending measures at the ready. Staff—working with the authorities—has
identified a menu of options for expenditure reduction that would be more than sufficient to
achieve the recommended fiscal adjustment. The authorities noted that with about threequarters of spending already pre-determined (notably on wages, social protection, and health
care), budget flexibility was constrained.
C. Structural Issues
28.
Discussions with representatives of the public and private sector continued to
underscore the urgency of improving the business environment and addressing
corruption. This includes improvements in the efficiency and transparency of all levels of
public administration. There was broad recognition that enhancing Croatia’s attractiveness as
a destination for “greenfield” foreign direct investment is key to sustainably increasing the
growth of total factor productivity (estimated by staff at only 1.3 percent)13 and thereby
Croatia’s overall growth potential. In this context, judicial reform was seen as essential, both
to underpin the rule of law needed for a better business environment, and as part of the EU
accession process. Indeed, while the World Bank’s 2008 Doing Business survey ranks
Croatia as the second-top reformer last year in terms of improvements in country scores,
Croatia still lags behind most other peer countries on business environment indicators
(Figure 7), possibly explaining its comparatively lackluster goods export performance
(Figure 5).

The authorities indicated their intention to move forward with privatization. The
government, in previous years, launched IPOs for the oil and telecom companies. While the

broader privatization process slowed last year, new management for the privatization fund
was recently appointed. The authorities also announced plans to start the sale of two
shipyards at end-2008. In addition, the authorities are considering setting up “closed-end”
investment funds, consisting of shares in the remaining state-owned enterprises. These fund
shares would be sold by public offering, with a view to accelerating privatization.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Croatia has experienced recent successes. Strong economic growth has generated
increasing employment. Policies have improved in recent years: the general government
deficit has been significantly reduced and financial supervision has been strengthened. A
broadly stable exchange rate has helped anchor inflation expectations and, along with wage
moderation, delivered, until recently, low inflation.
31.
But worrying macroeconomic imbalances are present. Inflation is up and the
current account deficit and external debt have continued to increase. Moreover, the outlook
for this year suggests that imbalances will persist: inflation, while falling, remains higher
than in recent years, and the current account and external debt are modestly above last year’s
levels.
32.
In these circumstances, there are a number of key goals for policy. These include
reducing external and financial vulnerabilities. In light of Croatia’s past experience with
hyperinflation, it is also important to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched
in expectations, not least by avoiding second-round effects from higher food and utility
prices. Accelerating structural reforms would support orderly convergence with the EU and
lessen external imbalances.
33.
While the monetary policy framework continues to be appropriate for Croatia,
support from other policies is essential. In light of the high degree of euroization,
sensitivities to balance-sheet mismatches, adequate external competitiveness, and the strong
anchor provided historically, maintaining a stable exchange rate is a sensible policy. But this
policy puts considerable onus on fiscal policy to manage demand and address
macroeconomic imbalances. Since a stable exchange rate is conducive to unhedged foreigncurrency borrowing, strong prudential policies and financial sector supervision are needed to
ensure adequate risk management. Wage moderation and faster and deeper structural reforms
are the only ways to strengthen competitiveness, helping also to both raise potential growth
and narrow the current account deficit.
34.
The authorities’ medium-term target for the general government deficit moves
fiscal policy in the right direction. Achieving their target of a ½ percent of GDP deficit by
2010 would represent a significant adjustment. Aiming for fiscal balance by 2011 would
maintain momentum and signal the authorities’ intention to continue with fiscal
consolidation.

15
35.
Frontloading adjustment would be well advised. Bringing down inflation and
reducing external imbalances are immediate concerns, and greater frontloading would
provide more immediate help from fiscal policy. Because politics will increasingly make
reforms difficult, especially in the latter part of the government’s term, frontloading also
raises the likelihood of meeting the recommended 2011 target. Thus, with the 2008 budget
already passed, saving any revenue overperformance while keeping at or below budgeted
expenditure would be beneficial. The benefits of frontloading also suggest aiming for a more
ambitious target than the authorities’ 1.4 percent of GDP in 2009. Aiming for 1 percent of
GDP or less would have considerable merit. Finally, stronger-than-recommended fiscal
adjustment may be needed if external imbalances or inflation were to turn out worse than
expected. Thus, the authorities would be well advised to identify contingency measures
without delay.
36.
There is ample room to lower the government deficit by spending reform. This is
important because large fiscal adjustments are more successful, durable, and friendly to
growth when they rely on reducing current expenditure. Moreover, inefficiencies in public
spending suggest that expenditure cuts can be achieved without unduly compromising the
delivery of public services. Key areas for reform, some already under active discussion, are
health care, education, social security, social assistance and social benefits, subsidies, and
civil service employment. But specificity is needed soon to ensure timely adjustment. Nearterm wage moderation is also crucial, in light of the importance of avoiding secondary price
effects. In addition to keeping government wage growth moderate, state-owned enterprises
must follow suit, an intention the government could usefully reiterate. Policies should also
seek to ensure the sustainability of the pension system, including by avoiding further
backtracking on earlier reforms.
37.
The financial sector is healthy and much progress has been made in
strengthening its supervision. The CNB’s increases in required capital cushions and risk
weights to limit macro-financial vulnerabilities, improved communications, and efforts to
strengthen home-host supervisory coordination are welcome improvements. The continued
strengthening in supervision of the nonbank sector is also encouraging. To support Basel II
preparations, further dialog between the CNB and banks, through consultative papers on
Pillars 2 and 3, would be helpful.
38.
Other challenges lie ahead. While the impact on Croatia has been limited, continued
turbulence in global markets underscores the need to be vigilant in maintaining high
prudential standards and closely monitoring banks’ risk management and lending practices.
Plans to produce a forward-looking financial stability report are welcome. And timely
responses from foreign authorities on formal communications concerning contingency
planning for possible external shocks would be helpful. That said, stress tests suggest that
higher buffers may be needed in certain worst-case, but plausible scenarios. Further
prudential measures may also need to be considered to contain any emerging but unforeseen
risks. Although the CNB’s rationale for introducing credit and other administrative measures

16
is understandable, they are not sustainable. As also highlighted in the FSSA, they have
negative side effects. Thus, transitioning away from administrative measures is another
important task ahead, but one that requires careful planning to maintain stability.
39.
Faster structural reforms will be needed for Croatia to realize its goals of
sustainably raising living standards and successfully concluding EU accession
negotiations. Absent reforms, Croatia will have difficulty substantially boosting export
growth, thereby lessening external vulnerabilities, and raising economic growth on a
sustainable basis. Reform of the heavily indebted shipyards is urgent for advancing accession
negotiations and containing the substantial drain on the public resources. Difficult decisions
to rationalize capacity and employment are inevitable. More generally, privatization needs to
be completed, with strategic investors playing an important role to ensure appropriate
restructuring and corporate governance. Notwithstanding recent efforts, improving the
business environment requires improvements in several areas, including reducing the
administrative burden, legal uncertainties, and corruption. This is critical to enhance
Croatia’s attractiveness as a destination for greenfield foreign direct investment, rightly
recognized in the authorities’ Strategic Plan for the Economic Development of Croatia as
key to sustainably increasing total factor productivity and potential growth.
40.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia will be on the
12-month cycle.

1/ In 2003, excludes debit entry of 1.1 percent of GDP in the item “investment income” in the current account, and an offsetting credit entry in the item “FDI-reinvested
earnings” of the capital account, related to the “distribution” and “reinvestment” of paper income from the revaluation of a patent by a Croatian company (see IMF Country
Report No. 03/358, Appendix IV).
2/ Errors and omissions are explicitly projected to reflect persistent unrecorded capital outflows.

1/ Baseline projections are based on the authorities’ achieving their targets for the general government balance in 2008–10 and staff’s recommendation for 2011.
2/ Deficit presented for 2004 includes in “other revenue” HRK 197 million secured in December 2004 from an auction of a GSM licence, but not received in cash until February 2005; this amount is not
included in 2005 revenues.
3/ Excluding “pensioners’ debt” repayments; including accumulation of arrears in “use of goods and services.”
4/ The increase in investment in 2007 is mainly due to one-off spending on roads.
5/ Includes repayments of “pensioners’ debt” and the balance of HBOR (net of budget transfers).

Table 7. The CNB’s Measures 1/
Prudential and supervisory
●

Higher reserve requirements for general banking risks for banks with asset growth above
specific thresholds;

●

Introduction of capital charges for market risks;

●

Increased risk weights on unhedged foreign-currency loans;

●

Issuance of guidelines for banks for managing risks related to FX and household loans;

●

Intensified cross-border supervisory coordination;

●

Intoduction of link between minimum required capital and loan growth.

Administrative
●

Marginal reserve requirement (MRR) on banks’ new foreign borrowing: introduced in mid2004 at a rate of 24 percent, subsequently increased in steps to 55 percent; loopholes in the
base closed. A 55 percent special reserve requirement also applies to banks' bond issuance
(to close a loophole in the MRR).

●

Reintroduction of credit controls, effective at the start of 2007; previously used in 2003.
In 2007, banks were required to purchase low-yielding CNB bills for 50 percent of the
amount by which their credit growth exceeded the CNB ceiling, which is consistent with
12 percent credit growth for the full year.
The CNB modified the current controls several times to close loopholes, and, in
December 2007, confirmed the retention of the controls in 2008. In 2008, 1 percent
monthly sublimits apply and other conditions were tightened: the purchase requirement
for excess credit growth was increased to 75 percent; and the CNB bill yield was cut to
0.25 percent.

●

Foreign-currency liquid asset requirement, also known as the “32 percent rule.”
The CNB broadened its base in late 2006 to include indexed instruments.

●

Banks are also subject to a high general reserve requirement (17 percent).

Source: adapted from the accompanying FSSA Update.
1/ Outside the CNB’s remit, other relevant measures in 2006–07 include the launch of the
credit registry; and the Leasing Act, which prohibits non-leasing credits by leasing companies.

1/ Assumes substantial reform of the business environment that resolves land ownership uncertainties, reduces corruption and the regulatory burden, and
transparently completes privatization. This results in higher greenfield FDI inflows and faster growth in total factor productivity (about double the baseline pace)
from 2009. Increased competitiveness is reflected in both higher goods exports and in higher tourism investment and receipts.

1/ Assumes a less favorable external environment (lower-than-baseline import demand for Croatia's goods and services and higher external borrowing costs).
This results in real GDP growth and new FDI inflows modestly lower than in the baseline, wider-than-baseline current account deficits, and a continuing increase
in the external debt-to-GDP ratio through the projection period.
2/ Modified accrual basis based on GFS 1986 methodology.

Table 11. Croatia: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Policy area

Directors’ recommendations
(2006 Article IV consultation)

Implementation

Fiscal policy

More ambitious fiscal consolidation than
envisaged in the authorities’ (2006)
medium-term plans.

Significant tightening of medium-term fiscal
targets in the July 2007 revision of the
Economic and Fiscal Policy Guidelines.

Resist spending pressures in the run-up
to elections in late 2007, and ensure a
fiscal deficit in 2007 no larger than the
budget target.

With revenues overperforming in mid-2007,
a supplementary budget provided for higher
spending but a lower deficit. The general
government deficit outcome (2.3 percent of
GDP) was significantly below the original
budget target (3.0 percent). Taking into
account off-budget and quasi-fiscal
activities, cyclical adjustment implies that
the overall fiscal stance was expansionary
in 2007.

Support for the tightly managed
exchange rate, but emphasized the
importance of supporting policies (fiscal,
structural, financial).

The CNB continues to tightly manage the
exchange rate.

Reservations about the reintroduction of
credit controls, whose impact and side
effects would need close monitoring,
while sharing concerns about the
prudential and macroeconomic risks of
ongoing rapid credit growth.

The CNB closed loopholes in the credit
controls in 2007 and maintained the
controls in 2008.

Consider tighter prudential measures
that would raise credit quality and
reduce vulnerabilities.

Other prudential and supervisory measures
recently implemented, including a further
increase in risk weights on unhedged
foreign-currency loans, and the introduction
of a link between minimum required capital
and loan growth (see Table 7).

Significantly improve the business
environment: reduce the administrative
burden, legal uncertainties, and
corruption.

Some progress (see para. 28), but Croatia
still lags most peer countries on business
environment indicators.

Restructure the loss-making shipyards,
reform the remaining public enterprises,
and remove impediments to
privatization.

Shipyard reform was delayed through 2007.
In March 2008, the authorities announced
plans to start the sale of two shipyards at
end-2008.

Central bank policies

Structural policies

Mixed progress on privatization. A new
head of the privatization fund was appointed
in February 2008.

APPENDIX I. CROATIA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Fiscal Sustainability
1.
Fiscal consolidation would keep public debt on its downward trend. Under the
baseline scenario, public debt would fall from 38 percent of GDP in 2007 to 27 percent of
GDP by 2013. Stress-testing suggests that most shocks leave public debt either declining or
unchanged (Table 13, Figure 8). The one notable exception is the scenario keeping key
variables at their historical averages, under which the debt ratio increases by 13 percentage
points of GDP between 2007 and 2013. This is because the historical primary deficit does not
yet fully account for the significant fiscal consolidation in 2004–06—with consolidation
continuing in the medium term baseline—while the historical growth rate is unduly affected
by a recession in 1999. Assuming no policy change beyond 2007, the debt ratio would stay
roughly constant over the forecast horizon, as it also would in the case of a large and
sustained drop in economic activity. The dynamics of the debt ratio would continue to be
resilient under the assumptions behind scenarios including a policy-induced widening of the
primary deficit, and also a combination of a policy-induced widening of the primary deficit, a
slowdown in growth, and an interest rate hike. Under the two one-time shock scenarios, the
debt ratio resumes a downward trend following the initial shock. The inclusion of the stock
of state guarantees and arrears (about 10 percent of GDP) in the above analysis does not
materially change the described responses to shocks.
B. External Sustainability
2.
External debt rose by over 26 percentage points of GDP (in euro terms) between 2002
and 2007, on the back of strong private sector borrowing and notwithstanding efforts at fiscal
consolidation, a shift by the public sector towards domestic financing, and measures by the
central bank to discourage bank external borrowing. In the baseline projection—which
incorporates a deterioration of the external current account balance relative to GDP in 2008
followed by a gradual improvement in subsequent years—the debt-to-GDP ratio continues to
hover around 88 percent in 2008–09 and then gradually declines towards 84 percent by 2013
(Table 14). Alternative scenarios demonstrate the sensitivity of external debt to several
factors, highlighting the need for vigilance in economic management to forestall
unsustainable debt dynamics (Figure 9). In the scenario keeping key variables at their
historical averages, the external debt ratio eases slightly. In scenarios with lower growth or a
worsening current account, the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to around 90 percent. The small effect
of the interest rate shock partly reflects the low historical standard deviation of interest rates
(with one-half standard deviation equivalent to about 70 basis points); doubling the size of
the interest rate shock would push the debt/GDP ratio to over 90 percent. A large real
depreciation has significant adverse effects, with the debt-to-GDP ratio possibly averaging
over 120 percent between 2009 and 2013.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna
on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and

outstanding. The charges shown below are net charges and assessments by the SDR Department.

43
demand in the interbank market, with tight management by the CNB. Staff has
proposed to reclassify Croatia’s de facto exchange rate arrangement from
“managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate” to
“conventional pegged arrangement” as from September 1, 2006. The authorities’
response is pending. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On
April 3, 2008, the official exchange rate was kuna 7.270397 per euro (middle rate).
VIII.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for
the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144(52/51).

APPENDIX III. CROATIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some
improvements would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data
coverage and reliability in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by
insufficient resources and issues regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices
and at constant (1997) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry
groupings. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between
expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of
coordination between the CBS and the Croatian National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism
receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the selfemployed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in
inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data
for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector. Other shortcomings include: (i) inadequate
conversion of government finance statistics from a cash to an accrual basis; (ii) inadequate
price deflators; and (iii) late publication of annual data, which show large differences with
quarterly data.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between
rebasing, the weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are
collected at different time periods in the month for different product groups but in all cases
between the 13th and the 21st day of each month. The indices are released around the 15th day
of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine towns, but the weights are
based on a sample of households in the whole country. A harmonized index of consumer
prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat methodology, but is not released for the
time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also calculated based on a methodology
developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly producer price index (PPI), usually
on the 8th day of the following month. The weighting system of the PPI is based on the 2000
Annual Report of Industry and is changed every five years, while weights are partially
corrected every year.

46
C. Wages and Employment
4.
The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are
based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each
industrial category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including
persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is
now being conducted on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998,
and began releasing quarterly results in 2007 with a lag of about four months. The difference
between the survey-based unemployment rate and that based on the registered unemployed
has recently been reduced.
D. Government Finance Statistics
6.
Government finance statistics (GFS), produced on a monthly basis with a lag of 30
days, are available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) or
provided directly to the Fund. Revenue data are reliable and available on request on a nextday basis for most major categories for both the central budget and the budgetary funds.
Expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic
and functional) for the central budget and the budgetary funds. The data on central
government financing in the MoF reports are not reconciled with those in the CNB’s
monetary survey and balance of payments data, with substantial discrepancies owing partly
to different methodologies and definitions of government. Following the recommendations of
the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from the MoF, CNB, and CBS
was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced by these institutions;
after a slow start, meetings are now being held more regularly.
7.
The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical
Review are now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin,
which also reports stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF prepared a
database with government guarantees in July 2003 that has been used to monitor
developments in the stock and flows of guarantees.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
available only on a quarterly basis and with a lag of 30 days. Local government data are
partial as they include the operations of the 53 largest municipalities. Annual cash data
through 2006 for the general government and its subsectors are published in the 2007 GFS
Yearbook. Up-to-date monthly data for the budgetary central government are reported for
publication in the IFS. All data for the GFS Yearbook and IFS are reported in the GFSM
2001 framework.

47
E. Monetary Data
9.
Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the
recommendations of the IMF’s 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Data on the monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and the
balance sheet of the CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags, respectively.
The CNB is planning to extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of
investment funds and insurance companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting
financial information (balance sheets and investment structure) from investment and pension
funds; the data are not yet published, but used for internal purposes. According to the CNB,
the inclusion of other financial corporations in monetary statistics depends on the
harmonization process of the monetary statistics with the statistical reporting requirements of
the European Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB reported monetary data in the
format of Standardized Report Forms for December 2001 to the present. These data accord
with the concepts and definitions in MFSM and were published, along with the corresponding
metadata, in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
F. External Sector Statistics
10.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data are generally available with a lag of
two months and are subject to substantial revisions in subsequent releases; trade data are
available with a lag of one month and data on international reserves are available the next
day on request. Travel survey methodologies were modified in 2002, 2004, and again
in 2005, while the method for estimating the cost of insurance and freight was modified in
early 2004. The most recent modification of tourism revenue contributed to an upward
revision of the current account deficit for 2004 equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP. Net errors
and omissions have ranged from 2½ to 3¾ percent of GDP since 2003, and are negative. The
coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and accurate.
11.
A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and
London Club creditors in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data
according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and
Users, 2003, and began disseminating external debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The
inclusion of hybrid and subordinated debt instruments, repos, late interest, and interest
accruals and arrears has caused an upward adjustment in the external debt series compared to
previously released data. Quarterly data on the international investment position are available
on the CNB website up to Q3 2007.

APPENDIX IV. CROATIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
The World Bank is assisting Croatia in its structural and institutional reforms, within
the context of the EU integration process. The Bank’s Board discussed the second Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Croatia in December 2004. The CAS Progress Report (CAS
PR), which was presented to the Board in May 2007, assessed the relevance of the CAS and
adjusted the second half of the CAS program to take account of developments including
(i) the EU’s launch of membership negotiations with Croatia in October 2005 and Croatia’s
progress towards accession; (ii) progress toward achieving the CAS outcomes; and (iii) the
status of implementation of Croatia’s structural reform program supported by the Bank’s
Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PAL).
2.
The proposed operations in the CAS PR aim to address areas cited in the EU Progress
Report as needing significant effort—including judicial and public administration reform,
anti-corruption, agriculture, environment—as well as to facilitate Croatia’s absorption of EU
IPA grant funds. The backbone of the World Bank assistance to Croatia remains a series of
PALs, with investment loans supplementing the PALs. The investment loans address
institutional capacity problems; work in concert with the PALs in mitigating the effects
reforms may have on vulnerable groups; and assist Croatia in addressing significant
environmental challenges of the accession process. The Bank Board approved the PAL1 in
September 2005 and the PAL2 in May 2007, each amounting to EUR 150 million. The PAL
loans aim to support enhanced economic growth through: (i) improving the investment
climate; (ii) strengthening governance; and (iii) reducing the size and improving the
efficiency of the public sector. They also aim to support government reforms needed for the
fulfillment of the EU accession criteria and successful EU integration.
3.
Currently, the World Bank finances 17 operations in Croatia in a wide range of
sectors with a combined loan amount of close to US$1.1 billion. IFC’s portfolio amounts to
about US$300 million and there are over US$40 million MIGA guarantees. The Bank’s
current program (the “base case”), set out in the 2007 CAS PR, envisages about
US$160 million in new lending during the Bank’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2008. The
projects under preparation are: the Judicial Reform project, the Sustainable Health System
project, and the Rijeka Gateway II project. The Bank will also seek a dialogue with the
government on the future of the PAL program, including on the remaining actions that could
trigger the release of the first and second tranches of the EUR 150 million PAL2.
4.
The new Croatia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will cover July 2008 through
June 2012 (the Bank’s fiscal years 2009–12). The World Bank Group seeks to launch CPS
discussions with the government in early 2008. The discussions between the government and
the Bank on support for structural reforms and investments, as well as analytical work during
the upcoming CPS period, will be aimed at strengthening (i) Croatia’s efforts to accelerate its
accession to the EU, taking account of the findings of the EC’s latest Croatia Progress
Report; and (ii) the fiscal and social sustainability of Croatia’s public expenditures and
policies.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Republic of Croatia
May 9, 2008
1.
This statement reports on recent developments and adds to the information contained
in the staff report for the 2008 Article IV consultation. It does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data releases are broadly consistent with the outlook in the staff report.
Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 5.7 percent in March. Year-on-year growth in domestic
bank credit to the nongovernment sector eased to 12.3 percent at end-March. In line with EU
requirements, the Croatian National Bank has changed the external debt reporting system.
This resulted in an upward revision to Croatia’s end-2007 external debt of 1.3 percent of
GDP.
3.
Staff’s proposal to reclassify Croatia’s de facto exchange rate arrangement from
“managed floating with no preannounced path for the exchange rate” to “conventional
pegged arrangement” (as from September 1, 2006) remains under consideration.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Croatia
On May 9, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia. 1
Background
Growth accelerated in 2007, but external imbalances continued to increase. Real GDP growth
reached 5.6 percent, on the back of strong domestic demand. The latter was also reflected in a
widening current account deficit (8.6 percent of GDP), with higher world energy prices
contributing as well. External debt reached nearly 88 percent of GDP at end-2007.
Inflation picked up. Because of financial euroization and balance-sheet exposures, the Croatian
National Bank (CNB) has maintained the exchange rate in a tight range. Until very recently, this
has helped keep inflation between 2 and 4 percent, aided by moderate wage growth.
Nevertheless, surging food and utility prices pushed year-on-year headline inflation above 6
percent in early 2008, the highest rate since the early 1990s.
The general government deficit was brought down significantly in recent years, from 6.1 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 3 percent in 2006, and to an estimated 2.3 percent in 2007. But with
economic growth particularly rapid in 2007, and taking into account off-budget and quasi-fiscal
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the May 9, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
activities not included in the general government accounts, cyclical adjustment implies that the
overall fiscal stance was expansionary in 2007.
External competitiveness appears adequate. Despite some gradual real exchange rate
appreciation, indicators of price and cost competitiveness vis-à-vis central European peer
countries remain benign. Market share of goods exports has been steady and tourism receipts
strong. Staff estimates indicate that the real exchange rate is broadly consistent with
fundamentals.
The financial sector is healthy, but risks associated with rapid credit growth have been a
concern. Banks’ capital adequacy and asset quality are at sufficiently comfortable levels to
withstand a range of shocks. Though declining, profitability is still high. Nevertheless, significant
external imbalances and rising asset prices—and volatility in the case of equities—
accompanying credit growth could expose banks to sudden shifts in market sentiment. Banks
also face significant interest and exchange rate induced credit risks. The CNB has taken a
range of measures aimed at limiting vulnerabilities, including to curb banks’ borrowing from
abroad and domestic credit expansion.
Although Croatia was not particularly hurt by the global financial turbulence through 2007, stock
prices slumped in the early months of 2008. Widening credit default swap spreads suggest
concerns with external vulnerabilities, though not to the same extent as for some other
countries.
Some progress was made on structural reforms, but Croatia still lags most central and eastern
European countries on business environment indicators. In the heavily indebted shipyard
sector, reforms were delayed through 2007; recently, the authorities announced plans to start
the sale of two shipyards at end-2008. Progress on privatization was mixed: initial public
offerings for the oil and telecom companies were successful but the broader privatization
process slowed.
The discussions focused on measures aimed at reducing vulnerabilities, ensuring that higher
inflation does not become entrenched in expectations, and raising potential growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Croatia’s strong economic growth in recent years, which has
generated an appreciable increase in employment. This strong performance has been
accompanied by commendable improvements in policies, notably a reduction in the general
government deficit since 2003 and a continued strengthening of financial supervision. At the
same time, Directors noted that the current account deficit has continued to widen, external debt
has remained high, and inflation has increased sharply. They emphasized the need for
continued policy efforts to mitigate these imbalances and create an environment conducive to
sustained high growth.

3
Directors stressed the importance of near-term wage moderation, both in the government sector
as intended and the state-owned enterprises. Wage moderation will be key to avoiding secondround effects from food and utility price increases and preventing higher inflation from becoming
entrenched in expectations, as well as underpinning external competitiveness.
Directors noted that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and recognized
the advantages of maintaining a stable exchange rate in circumstances of high financial
euroization, sensitivities to balance-sheet mismatches, and the past success of this policy. At
the same time, Directors emphasized the need for support from other policies, including
continued fiscal adjustment to manage domestic demand and help address macroeconomic
imbalances; accelerated structural reforms to lessen vulnerabilities while raising sustainable
growth; and strong prudential policies and financial sector supervision.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to reduce the
general government deficit. They noted that achieving the authorities’ target of a deficit of ½
percent of GDP by 2010 would represent a significant adjustment, and encouraged them to
maintain this momentum going forward by announcing a target of fiscal balance by 2011.
Directors generally considered that frontloading fiscal adjustment—including by saving any
revenue overperformance—would provide welcome immediate support in reducing
macroeconomic imbalances and raising the likelihood of meeting the recommended targets. A
fiscal deficit target of 1 percent of GDP or less in 2009 would have considerable merit.
Directors underlined the benefits of expenditure-led fiscal adjustment and saw room to reduce
current expenditure without unduly compromising the delivery of public services. They also
pointed to the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the pension system, including by
avoiding further backtracking on earlier reforms. More broadly, Directors encouraged the
authorities to identify contingency measures that could be readily put in place in case
macroeconomic imbalances turned out worse than expected.
Directors noted that Croatia’s financial sector remains healthy, while stressing that continued
strains in global financial markets and balance-sheet vulnerabilities underscore the importance
of vigilance in maintaining high prudential standards and closely monitoring banks’ risk
management and lending practices. Directors commended the authorities’ measures to
strengthen banking supervision, including through increases in required capital cushions,
improved communications with market participants, and efforts to strengthen home-host
supervisory coordination. They also welcomed the continued strengthening in supervision of the
nonbank sector, and the authorities’ plan to produce a forward-looking financial stability report.
While understanding the central bank’s rationale for implementing credit and other
administrative measures, Directors considered that, taking into account their side effects, a
phasing out of the measures would be desirable, acknowledging that this would need to be
done in a careful way. This would require support from tighter fiscal policy to reduce excess
demand pressures and close supervision of banks.

4
Directors stressed the considerable benefits of faster structural reforms for reducing
vulnerabilities, raising living standards, and successfully concluding EU accession negotiations.
They encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the business environment by reducing
administrative burdens, legal uncertainties, and corruption. Such actions would make Croatia a
more attractive destination for the investments needed to sustainably increase productivity,
exports, and potential growth. Directors also looked forward to swift action on reforming the
heavily indebted shipyards and on completing the broader privatization process, with
involvement of strategic investors.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Republic of Croatia
and Tomislav Galac, Advisor to Executive Director
May 9, 2008
The authorities value their continuing cooperation with the Fund, as their economic
policies are being increasingly shaped by the ongoing efforts to speed up Croatia’s accession
to the European Union. They thus greatly appreciate that the 2008 Article IV Consultation
focused on those topics important to the Croatian economy that are in the domain of the
Fund’s core competencies – fighting rising inflation and persistent external vulnerabilities,
and strengthening the financial sector. The authorities welcome the thorough staff analysis
and mostly agree with the staff’s recommendations.
In 2008, the reelected government took office for a new four-year term that is
expected to see Croatia becoming a full member of NATO in 2009 and in the same year
finishing negotiations with the EU. While the invitation to join NATO, extended to Croatia in
April 2008, provides a security blanket in a still relatively unstable area, the ongoing EU
negotiations continue to act as an important anchor for macroeconomic stability. In such a
stable environment, the key objective of the authorities is to speed up progress in structural
reforms, supporting key growth sectors of the economy and restructuring lagging ones.
Economic performance and outlook
Croatia has experienced seven years of uninterrupted real output growth of around
5% per year, with consumer price inflation subdued below 3.5% per year. Real GDP rose by
5.6% in 2007, as both private and government final consumption accelerated, spurred by the
political cycle and a large pay-out of so called “pensioners debt”. With a lag, solid growth
and price stability resulted in an increase of the average number of employed persons over
3% in both 2006 and 2007, after a sluggish growth over the past five years; the
unemployment rate reached its lowest level of 9.5% in 2007. Recently, consumer price
inflation picked up, peaking at 6.2% in January 2008, as the economy could no longer buffer
rising energy and food prices. Years of above-potential growth, increasingly financed by
foreign borrowing, have pushed up the current account balance to 8.6% and external debt to
88% of GDP in 2007, the latter being higher than in most comparator countries.
The authorities recognize the potential risks associated with Croatia’s external
imbalances, especially in light of the dimming global growth outlook and persistent strains in
commodity and financial markets. Both fiscal and monetary policies for 2008 and beyond
have been adapted accordingly, as underlying growth projections have been reduced to 4.5%
and inflation projections raised to 5.5%, close to current WEO projections. These
conservative projections will support the authorities’ efforts to further reduce the government
deficit and to curb the growth of domestic credit, in the medium term. Against this
background, the authorities now expect external debt and the current account balance to
stabilize close to their end-2007 levels in the baseline, supported by a further reduction in the
growth rates of broad money and bank credit to the private sector.

2
Monetary policy and external sector
Faced with hyperinflation in the early 1990s and financial euroization thereafter (one
of the highest levels in Europe), monetary policy has aimed at maintaining broad nominal
exchange rate stability, that has served the economy well, as it has brought down inflation
and inflation expectations, and curbed balance sheet risks. While closely monitoring growing
inflationary pressures, the Croatian National Bank (CNB) has focused on mitigating external
vulnerabilities for some time now. In particular, to combat high credit growth, mostly
financed from abroad, that adds to the rising current account deficit, the CNB has resorted to
a battery of direct monetary and prudential measures (Table 4 in the FSSA Report), while at
the same time strengthening its communication to the financial community and the general
public.
The measures produced considerable results during 2007, as the government reined
its finances, bankers focused on profits rather than on market shares, and external financing
conditions tightened. Specifically, total credit growth slowed noticeably, especially to the
household sector,. Moreover, the measures significantly reduced the proportion of foreign
currency denominated loans in total loans, supported by a significant rise in the proportion of
domestic currency in total deposits. The measures provided the right incentives for most
banks to raise additional capital and have prevented a more severe widening of the current
account deficit. The authorities are aware of possible negative side-effects of these measures
(well indicated in the FSSA report). Nevertheless, given the limited options for monetary
policy, and given that vulnerabilities have not yet been sufficiently reduced, the authorities
contend that it is premature to phase these measures out in the short term.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that Croatia’s growing current account
deficit is mostly driven by structural deficiencies, while there is no compelling evidence of
real exchange rate misalignment. Therefore, the monetary authorities closely monitor macroprudential indicators for any signs of emerging pressures which might warrant a tightening of
prudential standards. As recognized by staff, the authorities are addressing immediate risks to
Croatia’s external liquidity position, stemming from the worsening global outlook. As a
precautionary measure, the central bank is currently assessing how to increase the flexibility
of its liquidity management instruments for the banking sector and improve its existing crisis
management framework. Nevertheless, the authorities expect that external stability indicators
will follow closely the baseline scenario under the DSA. This expectation is based on the
continued success of measures to slow down credit growth to the private sector, on the
positive effects of accelerated structural reforms on government finances, and on the
expected increase of non-debt creating inflows from Croatia’s major investing partners, as
they by and large come from neighboring countries, and thus have longer-term investment
horizons.
Fiscal policy and structural reforms
The authorities have successfully pursued fiscal consolidation over the past several
years. The overall general government deficit has declined from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2003,
to 2.3 percent by 2007. Pension reform, wage moderation, and investment cuts all have

3
contributed. Revenue collection overperformed in 2007, which was quite remarkable given
the political cycle. However, the authorities are aware that the total public financing
requirement decreased at a slower pace. Therefore, they are committed to further mediumterm fiscal consolidation. To this end, the authorities have secured a 2008 budget, that aims
at a significant reduction in the total public financing requirement, due to lower extrabudgetary payments of “pensioners debt”. Moreover, the medium-term framework envisages
significant further reductions in the general government deficit for 2009 and 2010.
Against this background, the authorities concur with the results of the staff’s debtsustainability analysis that shows further declining levels of the public debt-to-GDP ratio
under the baseline scenario, while the bound tests show that the current level of the public
debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to a number of reasonable shocks.
The planned improvements in Croatia’s fiscal position assume rapid and considerable
positive effects of planned structural reforms. Some of these reforms are among the most
difficult of the Croatian economic landscape ever, but they are prerequisites for the last stage
of Croatia’s convergence into the EU. Among the top priorities for the 2008-09 period are
finalization of the already well advanced pension reform as well as completion of the
privatization process, particularly the disposal of large government stakes in railways and
shipbuilding. In anticipation of this privatization these sectors will be restructured, with a
view of permanently reducing subsidies in line with EU standards. The government has
already announced plans to privatize two viable shipyards. The government announced in
March 2008 that it would establish a new investment fund for other companies, to which the
entire portfolio of the Croatian Privatization Fund (HFP) would be transferred. The
privatization process will be effectively completed after shares in this investment fund have
been successfully offered to the general public.
Other far-reaching reforms concern the health sector, education and social security,
for reasons well elaborated in the Selected Issues papers.
Financial sector
As noted in the FSSA Report, Croatia’s financial system has made a huge leap
forward since the 2002 FSAP. In this period, the assets of the financial sector doubled; nonbanking financial intermediaries have entered the scene; the securities markets developed
from a miniscule base; and financial conglomerates emerged. At the same time, the CNB has
put in place an effective bank supervision framework, whereas the supervision of the nonbanking financial sector has significantly improved under the unified non-banking supervisor
(HANFA). Memorandums of understanding have been signed between the two supervisors,
as well as with relevant foreign supervisory authorities. While there is a need to further
develop the financial system, staff rightly concludes that the financial sector remains broadly
healthy, and that the authorities have been proactive in addressing the remaining challenges.
Regarding staff recommendations for further strengthening the financial system, the
authorities are actively addressing areas that can be dealt with immediately. In the banking
sector, the CNB is improving its surveillance and communication strategy, and preparing a

forward-looking financial stability report to be published in the second half of 2008. The
central bank is modifying its liquidity management framework, to address potential effects of
cross-border illiquidity spillovers, as well as to improve the functioning of the money market.
The authorities are working on clarifying the roles of various agencies involved in the
banking resolution process, and the central bank initiated formal contacts with relevant
foreign bank supervisors in order to strengthen contingency planning.
In the longer run, further development of the financial sector will require full
harmonization of financial legislation with EU standards, especially in the area of investor
protection and enforcement of contracts. Completion of other reforms, including the
transition to Basel II, and improvements in land ownership records, will significantly
contribute to increased efficiency of financial intermediation. The authorities are also
examining the benefits of inclusion of information on non-bank creditors and on legal person
debtors in the national credit registry. Finally, strengthening the capacity and the powers of
HANFA will improve the efficiency of non-banking sector supervision.
