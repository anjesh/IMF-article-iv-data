STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite an unfavorable external and domestic environment, economic
performance improved in 2013 after a difficult 2012. The European crisis led to a
deceleration of activity in the nonprimary sector, but GDP growth is expected to
reach about 4.5 percent owing to a bumper cereal crop. Inflation remained low. The
external current account deficit declined and reserves remained stable at more than
four months of imports. The fiscal deficit narrowed as expected, owing to lower
international oil prices that reduced the cost of subsidies and as a result of measures
taken by the government to control spending. However, unemployment remains
high, especially among the youth and, despite progress over the past decade, much
remains to be done to reduce poverty.
Outlook and risks: Assuming an average cereal output, growth could reach about
4 percent in 2014, as nonprimary activity is expected to accelerate. However, the
economy remains vulnerable to international conditions and a difficult regional
environment. In this context, the outlook continues to hinge on the implementation
of policies to strengthen the resilience of the economy, ensure stronger and more
job-rich growth, and improve social protection, particularly for the most vulnerable.
Policy discussions: Despite progress in 2013, further fiscal consolidation is needed;
nevertheless, there should be space for investment and well-targeted social
protection. In this context, the reforms of the tax, subsidy, and pension systems are
important, as is the gradual reduction in the public wage bill. Reforms are also
needed to improve the business climate, transparency, the judiciary, and the labor
market to boost private investment, competitiveness, and employment. Greater
access to finance is also needed. More flexibility in the exchange rate regime would
help support competitiveness, enhance the capacity of the economy to absorb
shocks, and support the authorities’ strategy for diversifying external flows away from
Europe. In this context, the discussions focused on four intertwined themes:
(i) conducting a fiscal policy supportive of external adjustment and growth;
(ii) fostering a more growth-friendly business environment; (iii) adapting the
monetary and exchange rate frameworks; and (iv) enhancing access to finance while
further strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.

BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments
1.
Morocco has a track record of strong performance, but vulnerabilities increased in
recent years. The solid macroeconomic performance of the past decade was challenged as the
economy was hit by a series of exogenous shocks, including the European recession, a rise in oil
prices, and the transition in Arab countries. As a result, the external and fiscal deficits widened
significantly in 2012 while growth suffered from low agricultural production. Moreover, despite
progress, poverty remains pervasive.1 The authorities’ economic program, which aims at addressing
these challenges, has been supported by the Fund since August 2012 by an arrangement under the
precautionary and liquidity line (PLL).2
2.
The formation of a new coalition government ended a period of uncertainty that
delayed policymaking. The previous government coalition, headed by the Justice and
Development Party (JDP), a moderate Islamist party, ended in the summer 2013 when the junior
party Istiqlal withdrew from it. Following protracted negotiations, a new government, now including
the center-right National Rally of Independents (NRI), was announced on October 10, 2013. The
hope is that efforts to build consensus on difficult reforms (e.g., subsidies, pensions) can now be
brought to closure so that faster progress can be made. Still, in the current difficult regional context,
the risk remains that social pressures may derail implementation.
3.
Growth picked up in 2013, boosted by a strong rebound in the primary sector. On the
back of a bumper harvest, the agricultural sector is estimated to have grown by almost 20 percent,
pushing overall GDP growth to about 4.5 percent. However, political uncertainty following the end
of the previous government coalition, tighter credit conditions, and the weak European economy
weighed heavily on other sectors. Nonprimary growth is thus unlikely to have reached more than
2.5 percent, compared to an average of about 4.5 percent in the past 10 years. This slowdown is
mainly visible in sectors such as extractive industries (especially phosphates), and construction,
which also has important knock-on effects on other sectors. On the demand side, the main support
came from private consumption. Inflation remained low, averaging about 2 percent, despite the
increase in the prices of some subsidized energy products. Unemployment remained high, especially
among young people.
4.
The fiscal deficit declined in 2013. The overall fiscal deficit decreased from 7.3 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 5.5 percent in 2013. Total revenue fell by 0.8 percent of GDP, dragged down by a
decline in tax receipts of nearly 2 percent of GDP, which reflected the slowdown in nonprimary
activity and was only partially offset by higher grants and nontax revenue. Expenditures declined

significantly, mainly owing to a reduction in the subsidy bill by nearly 2 percent of GDP. Lower
subsidies resulted from lower international oil prices, the full-year impact of the price increases
implemented in June 2012, and the introduction in September of a mechanism to partially index the
domestic prices of some fuel products to world prices. Spending on wages was also reduced by
about ½ percent of GDP. The authorities took several significant measures to contain the deficit in
light of the weak revenue performance. In particular, they canceled all 2013 investment
appropriations that had not been committed at end-October, in an effort to avoid overshooting
their annual investment target.
5.
The current account improved. Better domestic food production, lower energy imports,
and increased substitution of industrial goods imports by domestic production resulted in a
contraction in imports. Exports also declined, as the 19 percent increase in FDI-related exports did
not fully offset a 23 percent drop in phosphate exports resulting from a sharp decline in world
prices. Overall, the trade deficit is estimated to have fallen to 19 percent of GDP in 2013 from
20.9 percent of GDP in 2012. As a result, the current account deficit, excluding grants, is estimated to
have declined to 8 percent of GDP in 2013 from 10 percent in 2012.

Reserves have been broadly stable at more than four months of imports, and external
debt, though on the rise, remains sustainable. External pressures continue to be a concern, but,
considering existing controls on capital outflows that partially insulate them from capital account
vulnerabilities, reserves remain broadly

and the country was not significantly
affected by the recent sell-off in emerging markets. Although external debt increased fairly rapidly
over the last few years, it remains sustainable (Annex).
7.
The exchange rate assessment continues to show some evidence of moderate
overvaluation of the dirham, though less than a year ago. The current account approach of the
IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology, which is based on current policies and does
not factor in the impact of planned policies, points to a current account gap of -2.6 percent of GDP
(compared to -4.2 percent for the 2012 assessment). The EBA external sustainability approach, which
accounts for planned policies, indicates a smaller current account gap of -0.3 percent of GDP
(compared to -0.9 percent of GDP in the 2012 assessment).3 Overall, both methods indicate that the

current account gap has narrowed from last year, but still point to a moderate overvaluation of the
dirham (between 1.3 percent and 11.3 percent) and the need for continued policy efforts to reduce
imbalances, particularly in the fiscal sector. Other indicators, including the recent scaling up of
capacity and FDI in developing manufacturing industries, suggest that Morocco’s competitiveness is
adequate.

Bank-al-Maghrib (BAM) has continued to fill the shortage in bank liquidity, mainly
though 7-day advances. In 2012, the loss of foreign assets contributed to a persistent contraction
in bank liquidity, to which BAM responded by stepping up its liquidity injection. Despite the relief
provided by the broad stabilization of foreign reserves, liquidity conditions remained tight in 2013.
BAM increased the average daily amount of its interventions by about 20 percent in the last quarter
of 2013 and maintained its three-month refinancing interventions to 20 billion dirham, including
6 billion under the operations lending guaranteed by private assets from small and medium
enterprises (SMEs). In its December meeting, BAM left its policy rate unchanged at 3 percent,
balancing uncertainties surrounding commodity prices with concerns about the strength of external
demand.
9.
Tight funding conditions and sluggish demand have continued to constrain credit
growth. Loan growth outpaced domestic deposit growth in recent years, and despite a slight
increase in 2013, the domestic deposit-to-loan ratio remained at 97.3 percent, well below the
113 percent reached in 2008. This is exacerbated by the narrow domestic debt markets and the
limited resort to external funding. In response, banks are enlarging their funding sources by
expanding securitization instruments, increasing their financing in foreign currencies, and accessing
BAM’s facility for newly eligible collateral. Credit conditions were also hardened as risk premia rose
in line with uncertainties related to nonprimary growth. In addition, credit demand weakened as
businesses adopted a wait-and-see approach in the difficult economic and political environment.
However, growth in most categories of credits picked up somewhat in the third quarter, compared
to the previous one.
10.
Despite increasing nonperforming loans (NPLs), the financial sector remains sound
overall. As of June 2013, the Tier 1 capital ratio amounted to 10.6 percent while regulatory capital to
risk-weighted assets reached 13.1 percent, both up from December 2012 (when they amounted to
10.2 percent and 12.3 percent respectively). Banks’ reliance on lending activities is likely to weigh on
their profitability, though so far it has been resilient, supported by their international activities. NPLs
have increased from 5.4 percent in June to 5.8 percent of total loans as of November 2013,
reflecting the slowdown in activity. Moroccan banks fund themselves mainly through domestic
deposits, but have started expanding their sources of funding to include the issuance of
international bonds.4

4

The share of net external debt funding to total loans is currently close to zero and the banks’ ratio of deposits
to loans is 97.3.

B. Outlook and Risks
11.
Economic performance in 2014 will depend on the sustainability of the recovery of
nonprimary growth and the outcome of the next agricultural season. Consistent with the
nascent pick-up in most conjunctural indicators, growth in nonprimary sectors is expected to
rebound to 4.8 percent, mostly supported by stronger domestic demand, as uncertainties that
weighed on consumption and investment last year recede. Net exports are expected to make a
small positive contribution to growth, led by newly developing industries (e.g., automobile,
aeronautics) and improving conditions in Europe. The rapid development of these emerging
industries has been driven by high FDI inflows. They represent high value added and are critical
to the development of higher growth potential in Morocco. In total, assuming a return to normal
cereal production, growth could average about 4 percent, although the margin of uncertainty
around this projection is fairly large at this stage. Inflation is expected to increase moderately to
2.5 percent, reflecting higher domestic prices of some energy products.
12.
The authorities are committed to pursuing fiscal consolidation in 2014 while
accelerating the pace of structural fiscal reform. The 2014 budget aims at a fiscal deficit
target of 4.9 percent of GDP in 2014. Achieving this target will require the sustained
implementation of the reform agenda notably to continue reducing subsidies while controlling
wages and investment expenditure. Tax and nontax revenue will continue to be affected by the
slowdown in activity in 2013.5 New measures introduced in the 2014 budget, notably the removal
of tax exemptions on large agricultural producers, will only start to yield revenue in 2015.
13.
The current account is expected to improve further and reserves to remain stable.
The 2013 improvement in the trade deficit should continue through 2014, helped by lower
international oil prices, higher demand from Europe, and stronger exports from developing
industries (automobiles, aeronautics, etc.)6 The European recovery is also expected to support
tourism, remittances, and other services. The current account deficit is expected to decline
further to about 6.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Over the medium term, the current account will
continue to be financed by a relatively high level of grants, especially from the Gulf Cooperation
Council countries. The capital and financial accounts are expected to remain strong, notably
through FDI, as Morocco remains an attractive destination for investors. As a result, reserves
would remain stable above four months of imports over the medium term.
14.
As risks remain mainly on the downside, the medium-term outlook continues to
hinge on the sustained delivery of the reform agenda. On the domestic front, political risks
have receded with the recent appointment of a coalition government, but regional socio-political

tensions could continue to affect the ability to sustain the delivery of an ambitious reform
program. Externally, a protracted period of slowdown in Europe would depress demand for
Moroccan exports, slow remittances and FDI inflows, and put pressure on reserves. Protracted
economic and financial volatility, triggered by the prospective exit from unconventional
monetary policy (UMP) in certain advanced economies, would challenge Morocco’s borrowing
capacity in international markets. This could result in a cutback of growth-enhancing
expenditures and jeopardize growth prospects. In this context, the medium-term scenario that
underlies the central analysis in this report depends heavily on the sustained implementation of
reforms to strengthen the resilience of the economy and foster higher potential growth.

POLICY DISCUSSION
15.
The Article IV consultation focused on the challenge of continuing to reduce
vulnerabilities while fostering higher and more inclusive growth. Reforms should target the
most binding constraints on competitiveness, growth and jobs. Surveys comparing related
indicators across countries indicate that, in Morocco, these constraints mostly relate to an
inefficient bureaucracy and governance issues, a tax system that does not adequately support
competitiveness, difficulties in accessing finance, labor force skills that do not match business
needs, and labor regulations that are unsupportive of job creation (Figure 3).7 Exchange
arrangements are also recognized as an impediment to development. At the same time, the
authorities need to pursue their fiscal and external adjustment to strengthen the economy’s
resilience, which calls for continued fiscal consolidation. In that context, the Article IV
consultation focused on the four following intertwined themes: (i) conducting a fiscal policy
supportive of external adjustment and growth; (ii) fostering a business environment conducive to
growth and jobs; (iii) adapting the monetary and exchange rate frameworks; and (iv) enhancing
access to finance while further strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.

A. Conducting a Fiscal Policy Supportive of External Adjustment and
Growth
16.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to gradually lowering the fiscal deficit
to 3 percent of GDP in the medium term. They intend to rebuild both fiscal and external
buffers and ensure fiscal sustainability, a fundamental prerequisite for sustained growth. The
pace of fiscal consolidation, in structural terms, is projected to average about 0.5 percent of GDP
annually over the medium term (1.2 percent of GDP in 2013), which should not be a major drag
on growth.8 The medium-term overall fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP corresponds to a
primary deficit that, when cyclically adjusted, would be near 1½ percent of GDP, below the debtstabilizing primary deficit (consistent with the gradual reduction of debt below 60 percent of
GDP). The redesigned public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) (Annex) confirms that Morocco’s
debt (about 62 percent of GDP at end-2013) remains sustainable, as the debt level is robust to
various shocks.9 Nonetheless, somewhat large public and external financing needs could
constitute vulnerabilities under shocks to real output growth and the primary fiscal balance.

As fiscal consolidation progresses, revenue and spending need to be reoriented to
better support growth and inclusiveness. While further fiscal consolidation is needed, the
reduction in the fiscal deficit should leave space for investment in infrastructure and human capital
and for well-targeted social protection, in order to best support medium-term growth prospects and
the authorities’ efforts to reduce poverty. In this context, reforms of the tax, subsidy, and pension
systems are important, as is the gradual reduction in the public wage bill.
18.
Morocco’s tax revenue as a share of GDP is among the highest in the region, but the
tax system is characterized by a narrow base and relatively high tax expenditures. Tax revenue
averaged close to 24 percent of GDP over the past three years, but a large share of the economy is
either exempt or evades taxation. According to the tax authorities, about 80 percent of corporate
taxes are paid by 2 percent of all enterprises
operating in the country. Similarly, more
than 70 percent of income tax receipts are
paid by wage earners, while self-employed
and liberal occupations pay
disproportionally low taxes. In addition,
entire sectors, such as agriculture, are
exempted, and the informal sector is large.
Tax expenditures were estimated at about
4 percent of GDP in 2013. Economic agents
perceive the narrow tax base associated with
high tax rates as one of the most important
constraints to growth (Figure 3). Furthermore, the VAT, which represents a large share of total
revenue, is not neutral (i.e., businesses cannot always fully recover their VAT credit). This has resulted
in a large stock of credits due to enterprises and cash-flow problems for those with limited liquidity.

The 2014 budget initiates a tax reform that aims to widen the tax base, help support
competitiveness, and bring more equity. A National Tax Conference in April 2013 helped shape a
strategy and action plan for reforming the system. The goal, which staff broadly supports, is not to
increase tax revenue, but rather to widen the tax base, review tax incentives and tax rates, and
improve tax administration, to make the system more resilient, fairer, and more supportive of
competitiveness. The 2014 budget introduces measures to start implementing the strategy, notably
by beginning to tax large agriculture firms, as a first step toward the full taxation of the sector,
launching the reform of the VAT regime, and introducing measures to better enforce the taxation of
the self employed and liberal professions. Staff welcomed those measures, while encouraging the
authorities to be bolder in the next phases of the action plan, particularly with respect to the
reduction of tax expenditures and with the enforcement of tax obligations of the self-employed and
liberal professions. Staff noted, and the authorities agreed, that in implementing a strategy to
broaden the tax base and lower tax rates, the gains from the former needed to be firmly established
before the latter are implemented, to avoid the risk of permanently lowering revenues.

20.
Some progress was made toward reducing the public wage bill, but more is needed to
achieve the authorities’ medium-term objective of a wage bill below 11 percent of GDP. At
close to 13 percent of GDP, Morocco’s public wage bill remains the highest in the region. Over the
past six years, it increased by 44 percent, mostly as a result of promotions and salary increases. The
average public sector compensation is estimated to represent about 3½ times the per-capita GDP
compared to an average of about 2½ times in the region and 1½ times globally. The authorities’
target is to bring the wage bill to below 11 percent of GDP in the medium term. In 2013, they
implemented measures to better control wage spending, and achieved a reduction of the wage bill
by 0.4 percent of GDP. Although the 2014 budget significantly reduces the net creation of new posts
from previous years, the delayed effect of measures taken as part of the social dialogue in 2011 will
only allow a minimal reduction in the

objective was an important part of fiscal

consolidation consistent with making
space for pro-growth, pro-equity
spending. Staff noted that the main issue
did not appear to be the size of the
payroll, but the average compensation of the workforce. The authorities concurred with staff that
more remained to be done, while noting the difficulty of the task at a time when subsidy and public
pensions are also to be reformed.
Sources: National authorities; World Bank WDI; and IMF staff calculations.

21.
Blanket subsidies of a number of energy and food products have been costly,
inefficient, and a source of fiscal vulnerability. Over the years, the subsidy system has become
overly expensive, costing over 6½ percent of GDP in 2012—almost the size of the overall fiscal
deficit, as much as spending on investment, and more than the spending on health and education
combined. The government estimates that only 9 percent of all subsidies benefit the poorest
quintile of the population, while 43 percent benefit the richest quintile. The contrast is even starker
for diesel and fuel subsidies: 75 percent of payments benefit the richest quintile. Furthermore, the
subsidy system is an important source of fiscal risk because it makes the budget hostage to
international energy prices.11

10

The draft budget programs the net creation of 3,400 positions, against an average of 12,800 net creations
annually over 2008–13.

Experience and Possible Ways Forward, Selected Issues (CR/13/110).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

22.
The authorities have started to reform the subsidy system, with the objective of
reducing its cost to 3 percent of GDP by 2016. Staff and the authorities agreed that the reform
needed to advance on three fronts: (i) lowering the total cost of subsidies, by adjusting the prices
and quantities of subsidized products; (ii) reducing fiscal risks by introducing measures to shield the
budget from world price fluctuations; and (iii) ensuring that, as generalized subsidies are being
reduced, the most vulnerable are adequately protected by well-targeted social programs. Staff
welcomed the important progress made recently on these three fronts:


Reducing costs. In 2013, the subsidy bill decreased by almost 2 percent of GDP, to
4.7 percent of GDP, as a result of the measures taken in 2012 and 2013 and lower world oil
prices. The 2014 budget targets a further reduction by close to 1 percent of GDP, in line with
the authorities’ medium-term target. To achieve this reduction, the authorities in
January 2014 took measures to remove subsidies on gasoline and industrial fuel not used for
electricity generation and to reduce the per-unit subsidy on diesel.



Reducing fiscal risks. In September 2013, the authorities introduced a mechanism to index
the prices of three subsidized energy products to world prices, a significant step toward
reducing fiscal risks. They also implemented a hedging strategy to protect the budget and
the population from significant spikes in diesel prices.



Expanding targeted social programs. To mitigate the impact on the poor, the authorities have
expanded two existing social programs (providing support to school-age children and
helping the poor with medical care). They have also introduced programs to support lowincome widows and physically disabled individuals. Furthermore, they are providing support
to the public transportation sector to ease the cost of higher fuel prices and limit the fare
increases.

The authorities emphasized the need for a gradual approach in reducing subsidies, to manage the
macroeconomic implications of the reform and foster greater social acceptance. Staff recognized the
difficult socio-political environment for reform and the need to adequately mitigate the potential
impact on the poor, and agreed that a gradual, sustained, approach was preferable. Staff stressed
the importance of clearly communicating the case for reform, as the authorities have done
extensively, and of explaining new measures as they are implemented.

The financial situation of the pension system remains tenuous.12 The main public
pension fund (Caisse Marocaine de Retraites, CMR) is expected to receive less in contributions than it
is paying in benefits starting in 2014. Under current projections, it is expected to exhaust its reserves
by 2021. The main private pension fund (Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale, CNSS) is projected to
start accruing flow deficits by 2021 and to exhaust its reserves in 2030. The 2014 budget pledges the
introduction of a parametric reform aimed at improving the actuarial situation of the CMR and
prolonging its viability by seven to 10 years.13 This is to be the first step toward broader structural
reforms to put the system as a whole (public and private) on a sustainable footing for the long term;
these include merging the current four funds into one or two funds, and setting incentives for
currently non-covered workers to become part of the formal pension system. Staff viewed this
reform as crucial to preserve fiscal sustainability and extend social protection, and welcomed the
determination of the authorities to adopt its first step in 2014.

12

See Box 1 of the Staff Report for 2012 Article IV and First PLL Review (CR/13/96).

13

The parametric changes that are considered include a gradual increase in the retirement age (from 60 to 65)
and the contribution rate (20 percent to 24 percent), combined with a reduction in the accrual rate (from
2.5 percent to 2 percent) and benefits (calculating pension based on the average of the final eight years’ salary
instead of the final year).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

24.
The draft Organic Budget Law (OBL) aims at modernizing the fiscal framework and
enhancing its efficiency. A draft OBL was adopted by the council of ministers in mid-January. It
includes welcome enhancements to the existing 1998 law, such as multiyear budgeting, program
budgeting, performance management and fiscal transparency. Ahead of its adoption in 2014, four
ministries are scheduled to start operating as pilot cases in program budgeting. The draft OBL also
addresses weaknesses in the budgetary framework that came to the fore in 2012 by making wage
expenditures appropriations binding ceilings and limiting the carryover of investment
appropriations, although with delayed effective dates. Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
strengthen and modernize their budget framework while encouraging them to incorporate best
practices before finalizing the law, to further reduce potential sources of fiscal risks, notably in the
areas of fiscal coverage (in particular autonomous agencies and public enterprises), fiscal policy
formulation and fiscal discipline (e.g., by ensuring that the cost of any new initiative is always fully
reflected in the budget to ensure adequate resources are available). Additional limitations on special
accounts were also included in the draft OBL, but tighter restrictions would be more appropriate.
The mission also encouraged the authorities to seek early parliamentary debate and adoption of the
new OBL with the provisions addressing the issues that came into play in 2012 taking immediate
effect. In this way, the 2015 budget can be fully prepared under the new legal framework.

B. Fostering a Business Environment Conducive to Growth and Jobs
25.
Governance and the business environment have improved, but much remains to be
done to promote investment and improved external competitiveness. As noted in paragraph 15
and figure 3, an inefficient bureaucracy and governance issues are among the main impediments to
doing business in Morocco.14 Reforms in this area have been driven by a dedicated National
Committee chaired by the head of government; these reforms helped Morocco gain 27 places
between 2011 and 2014 in the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators.15 Morocco now ranks 87
among 189 countries, owing to progress in the environment for starting a business, registering
property, and paying taxes. The authorities intend to continue their efforts in 2014, including the
implementation of a new procurement law, the submission to parliament in early 2014 of a law to
strengthen the independence of the competition council, which should improve entry and domestic
competition, and the full setting up of a national corruption watchdog. A much-needed reform of
the judiciary has also been announced; however, in light of the challenges ahead and gains made in
other countries, staff stressed that much remains to be done in streamlining government
bureaucracy, improving transparency, reforming the judiciary, and improving governance. This
reform effort also needs to include effectively implementing the anti-money laundering (AML)
framework, for Morocco to keep pace with more competitive emerging markets (see also ¶35).

14

Growth pay-offs of different categories of structural reforms are potentially large, as discussed in the 2012
Selected Issues Paper “Inclusive Growth in Morocco: Stylized Facts and Policies” (CR/13/110).
15

These indicators should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of respondents, a limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

26.
The authorities have engaged in active labor market policies, but the difficulty in
reducing unemployment suggests that more is needed to address the problem. The
unemployment rate has come down from 14 percent in 1999 to 9 percent in 2009; however, there
has been no further gain since 2009, despite relatively robust growth, with youth unemployment
worsening to 18.6 percent. To support their goal of reducing the unemployment rate to 8 percent by
2016, the authorities are revamping their labor market policies: reviewing existing support programs,
setting up an employment observatory, improving access to vocational training, and strengthening
labor market intermediation agencies.16 In addition, in cooperation with social partners, the
authorities recently introduced an unemployment insurance scheme (IPE). While staff supports the
authorities’ multi-pronged approach, it noted that there have been limited effects on
unemployment outcomes thus far. Staff observed that existing programs seemed to leave aside core
issues identified as crucial impediments to job creation by surveys conducted in Morocco as well as
the literature, notably those related to hiring and firing costs (Figure below and Box 1).17 In this light,
staff was encouraged by the authorities’ intention to engage in 2014 in a dialogue with social
partners on the existing labor code to review how it can best foster growth and employment while
providing adequate protection of workers’ rights. A number of initiatives aim at reducing the large
informal sector, notably through incentives for new entrepreneurs (e.g., lower social security
contribution rates) and efforts by the main private social sector pension fund to bring more
companies and workers into the formal sector. The VAT reform will also help in this respect.

Existing active labor market policies include: (i) a wage subsidy program to help unemployed graduates to
secure internships (Idmaj), (ii) training unemployed graduates to meet specific recruitment needs (Taehil),
(iii) an entrepreneurship program (Moukawalati). Two other new initiatives are in the pipeline: (i) Moubadara,
which encourages employment in NGO’s, and (ii) Taâtir, which focuses on the long-term unemployed.

See also the above-mentioned “Inclusive Growth in Morocco: Stylized Facts and Policies.” The paper finds
that if Morocco could achieve the benchmark score, which is an average of the seven best-performing
countries for an indicator measuring the restrictiveness of employment protection legislation, potential growth
could increase by 0.5 percent.

Box 1. Morocco: Growth and Unemployment
Understanding the relation between growth and employment is important when considering how to reduce
the high unemployment rate in Morocco (Figure A1). To this end, staff estimated the elasticity of employment to
GDP, based on the following equation:
Figure A1. Growth and Employment

(1999-2012): 4.2%

where E stands for employment at time t, and u is an
error term. Our estimates for and are 0.81 and 0.07
respectively, implying a long-term elasticity of 0.36. This
is relatively low: for the MENA region as a whole, the
elasticity is estimated to average 0.5.

Based on these estimates, staff explored scenarios to
identify the conditions in which the authorities’ target of
lowering unemployment to 8 percent by 2016 could be met (Figure A.2). Under the current growth projections, and
absent reform that would help increase the employment-growth elasticity, the unemployment rate would decrease
only to about 8.5 percent in 2016 from 9 percent

C. Adapting the Monetary and Exchange Rate Frameworks
27.
The fixed exchange rate regime has provided an important nominal anchor for the
economy. Over the past decade and until recently, Morocco achieved stable macroeconomic and
financial conditions under an exchange rate peg. The peg (to a basket of 80 percent euro/20 percent
U.S. dollar) has helped achieve price stability and insulate the economy from nominal shocks. In
addition, Morocco’s heavy reliance on trade with the euro area favored the maintenance of the peg.
However, growth has been relatively volatile. Furthermore, the current account balance has
deteriorated almost continuously since 2002, consistent with a gradual loss in competitiveness.
28.
Within the existing monetary and exchange rate frameworks, the current monetary
policy stance is appropriate. BAM has effectively anchored inflation expectations in the context of
the exchange rate peg. Inflation has averaged 1.7 percent over the past 10 years and never went
above 4 percent. Although liquidity remains tight, staff considers that the current monetary policy
stance is appropriate. The nonprimary output gap is moderately negative and risks to growth are
tilted to the downside, but monetary policy should remain cautious about the possible effects on
inflation of price increases related to the subsidy reform.
29.
Staff has been advocating for a while that Morocco would now be better served by a
more flexible exchange rate.18 As the economy opens up and becomes more vulnerable to real
external shocks, a flexible exchange rate would allow it to respond better to shocks and help
support competitiveness. In addition, the authorities’ plans for increased trade diversification, further
financial expansion, and broad-based market-oriented reforms to accelerate growth and create jobs
would require an exchange rate framework that provides more flexibility than the current one.
However, as discussed in previous staff reports, the monetary framework will also need to evolve in
line with a move toward a more flexible exchange rate. The adoption of a nominal anchor for
monetary policy, for instance through an inflation-targeting regime, to take over the exchange rate
would provide monetary independence and help maintain a more adequate policy mix combined
with a more open capital account.
30.
Recently, the central bank publicly announced the authorities’ intention to transition
to a more flexible currency regime over the next three years provided that supportive
macroeconomic policies are in place. This announcement was a welcome shift of the debate from
the “if/when” to the “how.” The Fund is helping build capacity to support this move, including
strengthening BAM’s forecasting and policy analysis capacity in preparation of a new monetary
policy regime, and with planned technical assistance on operational options for a more flexible
exchange rate regime. During the discussions, the authorities stressed the need to coordinate the
shift in exchange rate regime with other macroeconomic policies, and in particular, the importance
of improving the fiscal position ahead of transitioning away from the peg and defining a new
nominal anchor for monetary policy.

D. Enhancing Access to Finance While Further Strengthening the Resilience
of the Financial Sector
31.
The banking system has remained resilient, but the liquidity pressures and a recent
increase in NPLs should continue to be closely monitored. Staff concurred with the authorities
that a rather prudent business model and relative insulation from the euro zone debt crisis have
helped the financial sector remain systemically sound. Nonetheless, liquidity is still tight, banks are
facing an increase in NPLs, and their revenue is suffering from the slowdown in credit activity.


Liquidity. BAM has injected liquidity, primarily through seven-day advances. It has also put in
place a program that provides banks with liquidity using loans made to SMEs as collateral.
Liquidity provided under this program has been relatively small so far (about 6 billion dirhams).
BAM considered that it had sufficient elements in place to guarantee that credit risks are not
built up, including the strict eligibility criteria of the loans accepted and the application of a
15 percent haircut from market value to reflect the size of the perceived risk. BAM also noted
that the acceptance of loans made to SMEs as collateral does not involve any risk transfer to its
balance sheet because the recovery of the debts continues to be under the responsibility of the
commercial banks. Staff emphasized that credit risks should continue to be carefully monitored.



NPLs. BAM noted that NPLs are sufficiently provisioned and stressed that, in 2013, it requested
additional provisions for the third consecutive year. Besides, BAM noted that there is no
particular concentration of NPLs in any particular sector.



Regulatory framework. Overall, BAM is further strengthening banking regulation and supervision
in line with new Basel III standards. The capital adequacy ratio was increased in June 2013, and
BAM is incorporating the new definition of prudential capital and short-term liquidity in its
regulations. A FSAP update is planned for the fall of 2014.

32.
Improved access to credit, especially for SMEs, is still needed to foster higher potential
growth. Obtaining a bank loan is more difficult in Morocco than in the top emerging-market
performers (Figure 3). In addition, SMEs are particularly vulnerable to the current economic
difficulties.19 As noted above, some measures have already been introduced that should help
facilitate their access to credit; however, more is needed to help foster private sector development.
A recent World Bank survey concluded that sustained expansion of sound SME lending in the MENA
region would require strengthening credit information and the creditor rights framework.20 Despite
the setting up of a private credit bureau in 2009, however, Morocco scores poorly compared to
other emerging markets on its credit reporting system (Figure 3). There is also room to improve
legal rights with respect to debtors’ default and insolvency procedures. Providing better access to
credit for SMEs would also help their passage to the formal economy.

As noted in BAM’s 2012 annual report.

33.
Fostering financial inclusion to make finance accessible to a larger part of the
population is one of the authorities’ priorities. The goal is for two-thirds of the population to
have financial access by 2014, up from about 57 percent at the end of 2012. Microcredit is one
possible avenue to expanding financial services to the part of the population that is excluded from
the conventional financial system. The authorities are also taking steps to allow full-fledged Islamic
finance institutions to operate, possibly as early as 2014.
34.
The international expansion of Moroccan banks targets high-potential but riskier
markets and needs to be properly regulated and supervised. Major Moroccan banks have
successfully increased their presence in sub-Saharan Africa, and have grown aggressively over the
past few years, largely through acquisitions. At end-2012, sub-Saharan African operations
represented about 20 percent of the consolidated assets of some Moroccan banks and, in some
cases, more than 40 percent of their total revenue. This international expansion has diversified
Moroccan banks’ assets and revenue sources; however, it is also potentially bringing additional
credit and operational risks. The integration of the foreign subsidiaries’ information and risk
management systems with their parents is essential to the implementation of adequate controls.
Staff emphasized that BAM should spare no efforts to continue strengthening supervision in this
respect. BAM stressed that it is closely monitoring these activities and reinforcing coordination and
exchange of information with supervisory and regulatory agencies in host countries, including onsite supervision missions. In addition, staff also emphasized the need for cross-border resolution
agreements with other countries in the region, given the regional expansion of Moroccan banks.
BAM also participates in several regular groups of supervisors, including the French-speaking
banking supervisors (GSBF), which closely follows the international banking activity of domestic
banks through yearly meetings and quarterly conference calls.
35.
Morocco has undertaken significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime. It has
established the legal and regulatory framework to meet its commitments in its Action Plan
regarding the strategic deficiencies that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had identified in
February 2010. As a result, Morocco is therefore no longer subject to FATF’s monitoring process
under its ongoing global AML/CFT compliance process.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
After a difficult 2012, economic performance improved overall in 2013 despite a
persistently weak environment. The European crisis led to a net deceleration of underlying
economic activity, but a bumper crop and lower international oil prices helped sustain overall GDP
growth and reduce the current account deficit. Lower oil prices and policy action also contributed to
reduce the fiscal deficit after its sharp and unanticipated increase in 2012. The exchange rate peg
and prudent monetary policy helped keep inflation low. However, unemployment remained high,
especially among the youth, and much remains to be done to reduce poverty further.
37.
In an international and regional environment that remains risky, the outlook hinges on
the sustained delivery of the reform agenda. Growth in 2014 could reach close to 4 percent, as

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

the nonagricultural sectors accelerate and assuming a return to normal cereal production; however,
the economy remains vulnerable to global conditions. Although the world outlook is improving, the
international economic environment remains fragile and the regional context volatile. In this context,
it is important that the authorities continue the reforms undertaken to rebalance the fiscal and
external accounts, strengthen competitiveness, ensure stronger and more job-rich growth, and
improve social protection, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population.
38.
As fiscal consolidation progresses, revenue and spending need to be reoriented to
better support growth and inclusiveness. Fiscal consolidation remains needed to preserve fiscal
sustainability and support the external sector adjustment. The authorities’ fiscal deficit targets for
2014 (4.9 percent of GDP) and the medium term (3 percent of GDP by 2017) are appropriate. It will
be important to reduce the deficit in a way that leaves space for investment in infrastructure and
human capital and for well-targeted social protection, in order to best support medium-term growth
prospects and continue to reduce poverty.
39.
In this context, structural fiscal policy reforms have a key role to play. The reform of the
subsidy system remains a key pillar of a strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability, reduce fiscal risks,
and promote more effective and better-targeted social protection. The recently introduced
measures in those directions amounted to significant progress, and the authorities’ intention to
pursue these efforts is commendable. The reform of the pension system is also urgently needed to
ensure its viability and preserve fiscal sustainability. We encourage the authorities to adopt the
planned parametric reform of the main public pension fund as early as possible in 2014. To make
further space for pro-growth spending, it will also be important to gradually reduce the cost of the
public wage bill, by bringing the average compensation more in line with international standards.
We welcome the government’s efforts to begin to reduce tax exemptions, particularly in the
agricultural sector, to enforce tax filing and payment by those self-employed and in liberal
professions and to reform the VAT system.
40.
It is also particularly important to lay the foundation for a truly modern, stronger,
fiscal framework. The draft new organic law adopted by the council of ministers represents an
improvement over the current framework. It will be particularly important to seize the opportunity of
a new organic law to fully incorporate international best practices regarding fiscal coverage, policy
formulation and discipline. The law should be adopted and key provisions implemented without
delay, to enhance spending control and so that the 2015 budget can be fully prepared under the
new framework, per the authorities’ objective.
41.
Improving competitiveness remains necessary to consolidate Morocco’s external
position. The efforts made in recent years to diversify export markets and products and attract
additional foreign direct investment have already begun to bear fruit. Greater flexibility in the
exchange rate regime, in coordination with other macroeconomic policies, would help
competitiveness, enhance the capacity of the economy to absorb shocks, and support the
globalization and diversification of foreign flows. Recent progress notwithstanding, reforms to
improve the business climate, transparency, and the judiciary are still needed, to continue to attract

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and stimulate private investment. It is also important to implement appropriate policies to increase
the job content of growth.
42.
Monetary and financial policies have remained appropriate. Bank Al-Maghrib has a track
record of achieving low inflation. We support its efforts to strengthen its banking supervision
arrangements, including gradual adherence to the Basel III norms, and to ensure adequate
provisioning of NPLs, which increased slightly this year. We also welcome its close monitoring of the
banking sector’s international expansion to high or potential, but high-risk new markets. To increase
the potential growth of the economy, it remains necessary to continue to foster financial deepening
and increased access to credit, particularly for SMEs.
43.
The next Article IV consultation is proposed to take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex. Morocco: Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Public DSA
Morocco’s public sector gross debt ratio to GDP declined during 2000–10 before rising again, reflecting
a combination of external shocks and domestic vulnerabilities. At about 60 percent of GDP, public debt
is considered sustainable. The DSA shows the debt level to be resilient to various shocks, and
vulnerabilities linked to the profile of the debt appear moderate. However, under certain shocks, gross
financing needs (mainly linked to the rollover of existing debt) would exceed the benchmark of
15 percent of GDP, highlighting some risks despite the relatively moderate level of debt.
1.
The public DSA is based on the recently-revised DSA framework for market access
countries.1 Although the overall picture hasn’t changed significantly from the analysis conducted
using the previous framework, the current DSA takes a more in-depth look at risks and
vulnerabilities, particularly those linked to the profile of debt financing and gross financing needs. In
addition, stress tests have been enhanced to allow some interaction between variables.
2.
After steadily declining over the previous decade, Morocco’s public debt-to-GDP ratio
started rising in 2010 as macroeconomic performance deteriorated. Rising international
commodity prices contributed to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, mainly through the cost
of higher food and fuel subsidies. Public debt rose from 48 percent of GDP in 2009 to 60 percent in
2012. About half of this increase occurred in 2012 as the economy was severely impacted by the
crisis in Europe (Morocco’s main trade partner) and higher oil prices, and the authorities
encountered difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit.
3.
Risks to debt sustainability appear low to moderate (see heat map below). Baseline
projections are realistic when compared to a group of market access countries. Morocco’s projected
fiscal consolidation efforts aimed at lowering the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP in the medium
term do not appear exceptional relative to the distribution of other country cases. The debt level
remains below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets when
various shocks are assumed.2 Vulnerabilities linked to the profile of debt are moderate; relevant
indicators exceed the lower early warning benchmarks but not the upper risk assessment ones (see
chart). Gross financing needs would exceed the benchmark of 15 percent in case of a real growth or
primary balance shock. This highlights the importance of continuing on the path of fiscal
consolidation to reduce debt-financed deficits.

1

See “Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market-Access Countries.”

2

Under a scenario combining all shocks (real GDP, primary balance, real exchange rate, and real interest rate),
the debt level would peak at around 70 percent of GDP.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

External DSA
Morocco’s external debt-to-GDP is expected to remain sustainable over the medium-term,
but some vulnerabilities exist. The recent accumulation of external debt would subside and would
stabilise around 28 percent of GDP in 2018. However, with a 30 percent exchange rate
depreciation—the most extreme shock—the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 42 percent. The
shock to interest rates would also result in a significant increase of debt to GDP (39 percent),
indicating that the country could be vulnerable to volatility in the international bond market.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions
relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN
Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with
Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the
exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a
conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 80 percent
and 20 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value
of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international
exchange markets. As of January 7, 2014, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 12.62.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on February, 1, 2013. The discussions for the 2013 consultation were held in Rabat
and Casablanca during December 5–19, 2013.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the PLL Arrangement with
Morocco and Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation
On January 31, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the third review of Morocco’s economic performance under a program supported
by a 24-month Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement and concluded the 2013
Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
The PLL arrangement was approved on August 3, 2012 in an amount equivalent to SDR 4.12
billion (about US$6.2 billion or 700 percent of Morocco’s quota), (See Press Release No.
12/287). The Executive Board concluded the second review on July 31, 2013. The authorities
are treating the arrangement as precautionary..
The PLL arrangement continues to support the authorities’ home-grown reform agenda
aimed at achieving higher and more inclusive economic growth by providing an insurance
against external shocks. The PLL was introduced to meet more flexibly the liquidity needs of
member countries with sound economic fundamentals and strong record of policy
implementation but with some remaining vulnerabilities.
Following the Board discussion of the review, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing
Director, and Acting Chair made the following statement:
“Notwithstanding the continued unfavorable external environment and challenging domestic
conditions, Morocco’s macroeconomic performance improved in 2013, supported by strong
policy commitment and implementation, as well as the insurance provided by the PLL.
Important measures taken by the authorities helped reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities
and strengthen the economy’s resilience. Given significant downside risks and persistently
high unemployment, the economic outlook will depend on the sustained delivery of policy

and structural reforms designed to continue rebuilding policy buffers and promote higher and
more inclusive growth.
“The substantial reduction in energy subsidies achieved in 2013, along with increased social
assistance to the most vulnerable, helped strengthen the fiscal accounts and reduce
underlying fiscal vulnerabilities. Looking ahead, continued strengthening of public finances
will require a reorientation of revenue and spending to better support growth and
inclusiveness, along with the passage of a new organic budget law that incorporates best
practices with respect to fiscal discipline, coverage and expenditure control.
“Sustaining the recent gains in improving Morocco’s external position hinges on measures to
support its external competitiveness. Structural reforms in this area are a priority. More
flexibility in the exchange rate regime, in close coordination with other macroeconomic
policies, would also help and would increase the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
“Further reforms are needed to strengthen the business climate, transparency, and the
judiciary system and to improve the functioning of the labor market in order to attract foreign
direct investment and promote strong job growth. Broader financial inclusion including
greater access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises is also needed to foster higher
growth and boost employment.”
The Executive Board also concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation with Morocco.
The Moroccan economy has weathered the recent unfavorable regional and global economic
context relatively well. GDP growth is expected to have reached about 4.5 percent in 2013 on
the back of an exceptional agricultural season. Growth in other sectors has been dragged
down by the effects of the European crisis, but is expected to rebound in 2014 for an overall
growth rate of around 4 percent. Inflation is well under control, while the financial sector
remains sound. The 2013 current account deficit was reduced and international reserves have
been stable above four months of imports for more than a year, thanks in part to sustained
foreign investment and access to international bond markets at favorable terms. Lower
international oil prices and policy actions helped reduce the fiscal deficit from 7.3 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 5.4 percent in 2013.

helped reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities. Noting Morocco’s high unemployment rate
and the downside risks to the outlook, Directors advised sustaining reforms to continue
rebuilding policy buffers and promote higher and more inclusive growth.
Directors supported efforts to strengthen the public finances and support both fiscal and
external sustainability. They welcomed the reduction of energy subsidies in 2013 while
increasing social protection to the most vulnerable, and encouraged the authorities to sustain
such efforts. They advised that revenue and spending should be reoriented to better support
growth and inclusiveness in 2014 and beyond, through reforms aimed at broadening the tax
base, reviewing tax incentives and exemptions, reforming the VAT system, moderating the
public wage bill, and reforming the pension system.
Directors welcomed the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the new Organic Budget
Law as a step toward the establishment of a modern and improved fiscal framework. They
called for strengthening the provisions of the draft law pertaining to fiscal discipline,
coverage and expenditure control, in line with international best practice, and looked forward
to the law’s timely approval ahead of the preparation of the 2015 finance law.
Directors underscored that consolidation of Morocco’s external position hinges on improving
its external competitiveness. They stressed the critical importance of structural reforms in
this area. They noted that a move toward a more flexible exchange rate regime, in
coordination with other macroeconomic policies, would also help and would increase the
economy’s resilience to external shocks. In this regard, Directors welcomed the Fund’s
provision of technical assistance to the Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) to help prepare for a
smooth transition to more exchange rate flexibility. They recommended further reforms to
strengthen the business climate, transparency, and the judiciary system and to improve the
functioning of the labor market in order to attract private investment and promote strong job
growth.
Directors supported BAM’s efforts to strengthen banking supervision and regulatory
arrangements, including gradual adherence to the Basel III norms, as well as closer
monitoring of the banking sector’s international expansion. They underscored the importance
of financial deepening and increased access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises
for fostering sustained growth.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
January 31, 2014
Recent economic developments
In a continued unfavorable external environment, including sluggish growth in Europe,
Morocco’s main trading partner, and high international fuel prices, the Moroccan authorities
succeeded in fully reversing the deterioration in the external and fiscal positions of 2012,
making additional inroads toward external and fiscal sustainability, reducing vulnerabilities,
and strengthening the economy’s resilience and investor confidence. In the process, they
have demonstrated unwavering commitment to macroeconomic stability and pro-growth
structural reforms, and a high level of program ownership, which remained strong even
during the prolonged transition to a new government coalition in mid-2013. The authorities
are confident that Morocco’s well-grounded political and social stability, strong
fundamentals, and good track record of policy implementation remain unblemished, and will
continue to underpin the achievement of their goals of high and inclusive growth and strong
job creation.
Growth in 2013 is estimated at 4.8 percent, reflecting mainly the impact of good weather
conditions on agricultural production, with non-agricultural GDP slowing down significantly
since the fourth quarter of 2012, as a delayed impact of the recession in Europe. Inflation
remained low at less than 2 percent. The deterioration in the current account deficit in 2012
was more than fully reversed, with the deficit declining from 9.7 percent of GDP to
7.4 percent. The very good performance of high value-added exports of emerging sectors,
and broadly stable imports, including energy, along with an increase in tourism and workers’
remittances and higher grants, more than offset the decline in phosphates products and
other nonagricultural exports. With a significant increase in FDI, the reserve position
strengthened further to 4.3 months of imports. Continued commitment to fiscal discipline
and to reducing vulnerabilities, and reduced uncertainties after the change in the
government coalition have helped strengthen confidence, as evinced by continued favorable
market conditions and strong FDI, and recent signs of an economic recovery. The authorities
are projecting growth to remain robust at 4 percent in 2014, under the assumption of an
average agricultural production and a rebound in nonagricultural growth following stronger
confidence and firmer external demand.
Fiscal consolidation
The authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation has been demonstrated by their success
in meeting the 5.5 percent of GDP deficit target for 2013 (the most recent outcome is
5.4 percent), notwithstanding the significant slowdown in nonagricultural GDP (which is
crucial for tax revenue) and the 0.3 percent shortfall in grants compared to program
projections. This is a remarkable achievement that put the fiscal stance back on track for
meeting the authorities’ medium-term deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by 2017. This
improvement owed much to the measures taken by the authorities in mid 2012 and in 2013

MOROCCO

to reduce the subsidy bill, as described in the following section, and to strong expenditure
control, including on wages, goods and services, and investment spending. Despite slowing
nonagricultural growth, the authorities took the bold decision in April 2013 to reduce the
capital budget by 15 billion DH (25 percent of total new appropriations) to protect the deficit
target, in view of the shortfall in tax revenue and larger-than-projected carry-over from 2012.
However, despite the authorities’ efforts to improve nontax revenue, and in view of
continued shortfall in tax revenue and lower-than expected grants, they decided to moderate
capital spending growth further to achieve the end-year deficit target by cancelling
investment appropriations uncommitted by end-October. Nevertheless, total capital
spending in 2013 was 1 percent of GDP higher than projected under the PLL-supported
program, and declined only marginally compared to 2012, leading to improved budget
composition.
The authorities are committed to reducing the fiscal deficit further to 4.9 percent of GDP in
2014. The 2014 budget includes measures aimed at broadening the tax base by gradually
lifting tax exemption of large agriculture enterprises and bringing the informal sector into the
tax net, reducing distortions in the VAT by addressing the issue of tax credits and gradually
moving toward a two-rate VAT, and strengthening resources earmarked for social protection
and cohesion. Continued control of current spending will allow for increased appropriations
for priority social sectors, which account for 53 percent of the budget, and investment. Timely
approval of the budget, despite the late formation of the new government, and the
introduction of an adjuster to the capital budget to account for the size of carry-overs would
smooth budget execution and reduce uncertainty for the private sector.
Reducing key fiscal vulnerabilities
Structural fiscal reforms, as described below, and the strengthening of budget monitoring
and forecasting through greater internal coordination, and improved data availability in
response to the 2012 fiscal outcome were instrumental in achieving the 2013 fiscal deficit
target and significantly reducing vulnerabilities. The indicative character of wage
appropriations and the unrestricted carry-over of capital budget appropriations were
addressed by administrative order of the Head of Government for 2013. These measures
were renewed for 2014.
The draft Organic Budget Law (OBL) was approved by the Council of Ministers on January 20,
2014, clearing the way for its submission to Parliament. Implementation of the new OBL is
expected to be rolled over a 5-year period. The staff papers highlight the significant role that
the new OBL will play in modernizing and strengthening the budget framework and reducing
vulnerabilities, including those mentioned above. The papers also indicate areas where the
draft could be improved to strengthen the framework further. The authorities are grateful to
FAD staff for their comments and suggestions in this regard. They intend to take the
opportunity of the discussion of the draft in parliament to draw on these comments and
suggestions toward aligning the new OBL with best international practices, with due
consideration to Morocco’s constitutional and other constraints.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

The subsidy system is another key vulnerability that the authorities are successfully
addressing. As no consensus could be reached on transforming the universal subsidies into a
system of cash transfers, they developed a new strategy that appeared more politically and
socially acceptable. It combines a reduction of vulnerabilities through partial indexation of
some petroleum products; elimination of subsidies on the least socially sensitive ones and
gradual reduction for others, with an appropriate safety net to protect the poor and; the
extension of existing conditional social support programs focused on education and basic
health. In this regard, the authorities wish to underscore that the reduction of subsidies to
4.7 percent of GDP in 2013, down from 6.6 percent in 2012, was not exclusively nor even
primarily due to international price declines as indicated in the report, but most notably to
the domestic price hikes in 2012-13, combined with the price indexation mechanism,
including their impact in moderating consumption, and improved availability of hydroelectric
and other non-fuel energy. The ongoing investments in solar and wind energy and the readaptation of thermal power plants to coal will help reduce oil dependency. The authorities’
policies, including the measures taken this January and those already publicly announced for
2014, will bring the subsidy bill to the budgeted level of 3.7 percent of GDP this year. They
remain confident that their medium-term objective of bringing untargeted subsidies down to
3 percent of GDP will be met.
Other structural fiscal reforms
With regard to tax reform, and as indicated above, the authorities have started
implementation of the key recommendations of the national conference on taxation (Assises
Fiscales) held last April, with the objective of simplifying the system, broadening the tax base,
and enhancing equity and competitiveness. In this regard, the gradual introduction of
agriculture in the tax net, starting this year, is a milestone, although its revenue implications
are likely to be modest in the short term.
The parametric reforms of the main public pension system have been identified, as indicated
in the Written Communication. Implementation is to start under the next budget to be
followed by a more comprehensive reform of the system. Finally, the authorities’ objective of
bringing down the wage bill to 11 percent of GDP in the medium term is on track and should
be helped by the planned reform of the civil service with World Bank assistance, which
should also improve efficiency, governance, and the quality of service delivery.
Monetary and financial policies
The outstanding performance of Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) in maintaining low inflation over
the past three decades, and Morocco’s resilience to recent global turbulence, attest to the
appropriateness of the current monetary regime under the exchange rate peg. The small
overvaluation of the dirham calculated by staff has been reduced further and should not
guide policies in view of the high degree of uncertainty in such calculations. Moreover, there
is no sign of loss of competitiveness. On the contrary, recent development in FDI-financed,
high value-added exports provide evidence of improved competitiveness, as recognized by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

staff. The authorities are nevertheless considering moving to greater exchange rate flexibility
along with the resulting adaptation of the monetary policy framework. They look forward to
the upcoming TA mission to discuss options for an exchange rate policy that could better
serve Morocco and the modalities for its implementation, along with the other policy
requisites for such a move. Over the past several years, BAM has already significantly
strengthened its analytical and forecasting capabilities and enhanced transparency of its
decision making process, in preparation for an eventual move to a different monetary policy
framework. In this regard, BAM is grateful to the Fund for its high quality technical assistance.
In 2013, BAM focused on filling the liquidity shortage created by the 2012 decline in foreign
assets, and is extending refinancing facilities to banks to encourage credit to very small,
small, and medium-sized enterprises. BAM considers that tighter credit conditions are not
the main factor for lower credit growth. This slowdown is due mainly to subdued demand
and a wait-and-see attitude resulting from uncertainties in Europe and the transition to a
new government, even though banks were more vigilant in extending credit to some sectors
faced with excess supply conditions, such as real estate.
The financial sector remains sound, with improved bank capitalization and profitability and
reduced high loan exposures and connected lending. The moderate increase in NPLs reflects
the slowing economic activity and is expected to be reversed soon. BAM is in the process of
implementing Basel III requirements, as indicated in the staff papers. It is also closely
monitoring the expansion of Moroccan banks in other countries in Africa in close
cooperation with host supervisors.
Promoting high and more inclusive growth
Improving the business climate to achieve higher growth and employment is an overarching
objective of the authorities. Their recent efforts in this area have translated into a gain of 27
places in Morocco’s ranking under the Doing Business indicators between 2011 and 2014.
The authorities are working actively toward further improving this rating, with some
measures already included in the 2014 budget, as indicated above. A major reform of
education has been prepared to help rationalize the system and upgrade human resources
and skills, with implementation under way. The roadmap for a comprehensive reform of the
justice system has been approved and its implementation has started. The introduction in
2014 of a limited unemployment benefit financed by businesses and employees, with an
initial limited contribution of the budget, should help reach consensus on greater labor
market flexibility. Several active labor market policies and training initiatives are being
reinforced to help employability and reduce unemployment, in particular among the young,
with much of the focus in this area on supporting SMEs. Several initiatives are also being
launched to better integrate the informal sector into the modern economy. In this regard, the
authorities were surprised by the indication in Figure 3 that the informal sector in 2008 in
Morocco was the highest among selected 18 advanced and emerging market countries,
reaching some 45 percent. A survey conducted by the independent Planning Commission
estimated this share at 14.3 percent in 2007, down from 16.3 percent in 1999.
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

The authorities do not share staff view in paragraph 15, based on the Global Competitiveness
Report, that inefficient bureaucracy and governance issues are the most binding constraints
on competitiveness, growth and jobs. The issue of inefficient bureaucracy and its impact on
competitiveness has never been raised by staff, during Art IV consultation discussions. On the
contrary, on several occasions, staff recognized the high quality and efficiency of Moroccan
civil service.
Social inclusion and equity
The authorities consider that reducing poverty and exclusion, and addressing social and
regional inequality are crucial for long-term development. Major inroads have been made
toward meeting the MDGs, with absolute poverty reduced by more than half in two decades
(from 21 percent in 1985 to 8.9 percent in 2007), primary education enrollment rate doubled
to almost 100 percent, and significant reduction in illiteracy and improvements in women
and child health as well as other indicators. The coverage of RAMED (basic health services for
the underprivileged) has already reached 5.5 million people, 2/3 of the targeted population,
and the TAYSSIR program provides financial assistance to almost half a million poor families
to keep their young children at school. The National Initiative for Human Development plays
a crucial role in reducing social and regional disparities by improving access to infrastructure
and social services, in particular in rural and remote areas, enhancing capacity, and
promoting income generating activities benefiting 2½ million people. The recently
established Fonds de Cohesion Sociale is in charge of mobilizing resources to support
assistance programs for the poor, and will play a coordinating role for similar programs. Its
coverage was extended under the 2014 budget to vulnerable widows and physically
challenged persons.
PLL Review
Policy implementation under the PLL-supported program since the second review has
significantly strengthened, and the authorities succeeded in meeting the program targets for
2013. The indicative target for NIR for end-October was largely exceeded. The indicative
target for the fiscal deficit was exceeded by 0.3 percent of GDP only because the
announcement of an upcoming cancellation of capital appropriations unused by endOctober led to an unexpected but temporary acceleration of payment orders in the week
that preceded the cancellation.
The PLL has been very helpful in providing a valuable insurance against external shocks
during a period of international turbulence and in a difficult environment marked by high oil
and other commodity prices and weak growth in Europe. It anchored the authorities’
program at a time of uncertainty in connection with the change in the government coalition,
helped identify and address vulnerabilities, and provided a signal of the strength of policies.
It also helped access international financial markets at very favorable terms and, although it
was treated by the authorities as precautionary, it catalyzed other foreign assistance.

MOROCCO

My authorities are grateful to the Fund staff, management, and Board for their support, and
to other international financial institutions and the donor community, in particular the GCC
countries, for their assistance. The authorities believe that Morocco continues to meet the
PLL qualification and the four exceptional access criteria. They request Board approval of
their request for completion of the third and last review under the PLL and confirmation of
Morocco’s continued qualification for the facility. They are committed to fully implement
their program and will continue to treat the PLL as precautionary.
The authorities believe that the PLL still has a very useful role to play for countries like
Morocco with sound fundamentals, but faced with some vulnerabilities. In the case of
Morocco, uncertainty about the pace and timing of the recovery in Europe and about future
oil, food and other commodity prices, and possible renewed financial turbulence will
continue to pose risks that the PLL could help to mitigate in support of the authorities
adjustment and reform efforts.
