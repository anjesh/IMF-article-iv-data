ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Anthony Boote
January 17, 2008

Executive Summary
Economic situation: Following real GDP growth of over 12 percent in 2006, led by construction, growth is
expected to moderate to about 6 percent in 2007. Some further slowing is projected for 2008, but a recession is
not expected. Weaker activity in major tourist markets poses a risk, but the link to the U.S. dollar has led to a
significant depreciation of the real exchange rate and improved competitiveness.
Key issues: Despite the recent strong growth, Antigua and Barbuda continues to face policy challenges,
including achieving fiscal consolidation, lowering public debt, and diversifying exports.
•

Fiscal imbalances. Overall and primary deficits remained sizeable during 2006–07, notwithstanding policy
measures to increase revenues. The challenge in 2008 will be to reverse temporary spending pressures and
stay the course with tax reforms, allowing a significant reduction in fiscal imbalances.

•

Debt burden. While public debt declined in 2005 following debt relief, the debt burden remains high. The
intention to normalize relations with creditors is welcome, but strong fiscal measures will still be needed to
reduce the debt burden over the medium term.

•

Volatile growth. Risks to the medium-term outlook include natural disasters, a shock to tourist activity,
and higher international oil prices. Structural challenges (including export diversification, competitiveness,
and labor market flexibility) need to be addressed to raise growth durably.

•

Financial sector vulnerabilities. Strong credit growth calls for close monitoring of financial sector
soundness. Enhanced regulation of insurance companies and credit unions is also a priority.

Discussions: The authorities concurred on the need to advance fiscal consolidation in 2008 by containing
spending and staying the course with tax reforms. There was also broad consensus on the additional measures
required to reduce public debt to less than 60 percent of GDP by 2020. The authorities noted that consultants had
been hired to continue the work on a debt strategy. To enhance the resilience of the economy to shocks, the
mission recommended improvement of the investment climate, training to reduce skills mismatches, export
diversification, and telecommunications deregulation. The authorities indicated that reforms are either underway
or envisaged in these areas.

Antigua and Barbuda has enjoyed impressive growth in recent years. Following

2.
Despite the rebound in economic activity, fiscal imbalances have remained large,
reflecting a number of one-off expenditures in 2006–07 (Box 1). Tax revenues have
increased significantly, buoyed by the upturn in economic activity as well as the Antigua and
Barbuda Sales Tax (ABST) introduced in January 2007. But spending has also surged,
largely reflecting the effects of the CWC and one-time costs associated with the voluntary
separation program for public employees. As a result, the primary deficit is expected to
narrow only slightly to about 3¼ percent of GDP in 2007. Public debt, which fell from a peak
of 143 percent of GDP in 2002 to 107 percent in 2006, has remained broadly stable during
2007. Notwithstanding the fiscal imbalances, the authorities have continued to rollover debt
on the regional government securities market at relatively low rates.
3.
Broad money growth has strengthened in recent years. Monetary growth
accelerated in 2006, reflecting strong economic activity. In 2007, credit growth is expected to
remain strong, in line with estimated nominal GDP growth.
4.
Locally incorporated banks continue to face balance-sheet challenges. These
include high ratios of nonperforming loans (NPLs), low provisioning levels, and significant
government exposures. Competition in mortgage lending, including from insurance
companies, has lowered mortgage rates from 10–11 percent in 2004–05 to around 8 percent
in 2007, compressing spreads.

The Article IV discussions were held in St. John’s during September 25–October 5, 2007. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Meredith (Head), Nassar (both WHD), and Kovtun (PDR). Ms. Duttagupta (WHD)
supported the work of the mission from headquarters. The mission met with Prime Minister Hon. Baldwin
Spencer, Minister of Finance Dr. Errol Cort, other senior government officials, and representatives of the
financial and business sectors. Staff of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) also participated. Mr. Ladd (OED) joined for the final discussions.

5.
The external current account deficit has widened in recent years. The deficit
increased to 16 percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting imports associated with the construction
boom. It is expected to rise further in 2007, but will be financed almost entirely by foreign
direct investment.

to more normal levels and the global
economy slows, a recession is not expected. Medium-term growth is expected to remain
close to 5 percent—within historical norms—assuming there is no sustained deterioration in
the external outlook, including external financing conditions. Price developments are difficult
to assess due to lack of reliable data, but inflation is expected to remain contained in the
context of the regional currency board, with the pickup in 2008 reflecting higher oil prices.

7.
The outlook will continue to depend on exogenous factors as well as domestic
policy responses. Antigua and Barbuda remains vulnerable to external shocks, given its
dependence on imported oil, volatile tourism receipts, and exposure to natural disasters. The
turmoil in international financial markets and higher world oil prices could have an adverse
impact on global growth, which could, in turn, weaken prospects for Antigua and Barbuda.
On the domestic front, the fiscal outlook will depend on the ability of the government to stay
the course with tax reforms—and indeed strengthen implementation over the medium term—
while resisting spending pressures and further rationalizing the size and operations of the
civil service.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on achieving a significant improvement in fiscal balances,
placing the public debt on a sustainable path and accelerating structural reforms to
sustain growth and boost competitiveness. The authorities are firmly pursuing their fiscal
and structural reform agenda, along with efforts to enhance public awareness of the rationale
and benefits of the government’s program. Following introduction of the ABST and a
market-valuation-based property tax system, discussions focused on strengthening tax
administration and collection. On the expenditure front, although some measures have

5
already been taken (including the new Financial Administration Act and the partial rollout of
the FreeBalance software), much more remains to be done to effectively contain public
spending and rein in the accumulation of arrears.
A. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
9.
Achieving a primary fiscal surplus in 2008 is a key challenge. According to the
authorities, the limited progress to date in improving fiscal positions was partly due to delays
in enacting reforms, weaknesses in tax administration, and temporary expenditure spikes.
The mission emphasized the need to show significant progress in fiscal consolidation in
2008, based on the measures already implemented. The authorities agreed with staff that, as
one-off expenditure increases in 2006–07 are phased out (mainly the voluntary separation
program and CWC-related capital spending), such an outcome is achievable if the
government firmly controls spending and stays the course with tax reforms.
10.
Staff encouraged the authorities to adopt a formal budget proposal for 2008 that
is consistent with these objectives. In the event, the authorities presented a 2008 budget to
Parliament on December 3, 2007 that envisages a primary surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP,
consistent with the near-term objectives discussed during the mission. Expenditure is
budgeted to remain sizable, mainly in social and capital spending, financed by grants from
the PetroCaribe Agreement with Venezuela (Box 2).

of 2½ percent per year; and real public
sector wage increases of 2 percent per year. Under this scenario, debt would remain stable
relative to GDP and far above the authorities’ objective of reducing public debt to less than
60 percent of GDP in 2020, consistent with the ECCB benchmark. While fiscal gaps could be
filled via domestic and regional sources as well as a possible debt strategy, their significant
size may create pressures for further financing through arrears. The less favorable debt paths

disasters. 2
12.
The mission emphasized that, in
the medium term, additional measures are
needed to achieve public debt
sustainability. To achieve the ECCB
benchmark, a primary surplus of around
4 percent of GDP would be required. The
mission suggested a mix of revenue and
spending measures, including:

welcomed implementation of the
VAT, with registrations exceeding initial expectations and strong revenues likely
reflecting a large informal economy that was previously untapped. The staff
expressed concerns, however, about differential rates (the VAT rate for hotels is
10 percent, compared with 15 percent for other sectors) 3 and low filing rates. In
addition, the compliance rate in Antigua and Barbuda is about 70 percent, compared
with about 85 percent elsewhere in the region. The mission recommended
strengthening tax and customs administration and moving to a uniform VAT rate of
15 percent in 2009, including on hotels. These measures are projected to raise tax
revenues to about 24 percent of GDP by 2012 (close to the ECCU average). In line
with staff’s recommendations, the authorities announced in the 2008 Budget Speech
their intention to strengthen the administration of the ABST.

•

Property tax reform. Although the real estate sector has boomed in recent years, tax
on property continues to underperform. The mission welcomed the move to a marketvaluation-based property tax system in 2007 and the ongoing cadastral surveys as
important first steps toward strengthening tax collection.

•

Domestic oil pricing. While the 40 percent increase in gasoline prices in late 2005
helped restore effective tax levels, there have been no subsequent adjustments, and
the budget remains vulnerable to fluctuations in world oil prices. The mission
welcomed the authorities’ intention to move to a full pass-through system as
announced in the 2007 Budget Speech, and recommended that they do so in the

context of a regional initiative. In the 2008 Budget Speech, the authorities announced
their intention to develop a framework for quarterly price adjustments in 2008.

•

Public expenditure management. The mission emphasized the need to promote
efficiency, accountability and transparency in government financial operations. While
the Freebalance software has been installed in most ministries, it is critical that the
required IT support be put in place to strengthen central monitoring and control of
expenditure. This should also minimize further arrears with suppliers. Regarding
relations with other public sector entities, the mission recommended that the
government establish a transparent and commercial basis for dealing with the public
utility company (APUA), including full payment for all utility services received.

•

Civil service reform. The recent
voluntary separation program should
help contain the wage bill. However,
skill shortages have emerged in
certain areas, for instance in the
Internal Revenue Department. The
mission recommended that future
retrenchment programs be targeted at
areas where changing needs have
made staff redundant, while
redirecting resources to more
productive uses. In addition, the
authorities noted that rigidities in
public sector employment practices
inhibited the hiring and retention of
qualified staff in key areas and that
greater flexibility is needed to build
the capacity to formulate and
implement policies effectively.

B. Debt Strategy
13.
The authorities are committed to strengthening debt management and
normalizing relations with creditors. They have started the second phase of the debt
strategy with the assistance of international financial advisors. While the ultimate objective is
to normalize relationships with all creditors, the immediate focus is on resolving disputed
claims, regularizing arrears to statutory bodies, and preventing further accumulation of
arrears. The mission supported this approach, and recommended that, if a more
comprehensive restructuring is undertaken, the authorities should engage all creditors in an
open and collaborative dialogue and assure the stability of the domestic financial and social
security systems. A contingency plan should be designed to address a possible sudden lack of

8
access to regional financial markets. The capacity of the debt management unit should be
strengthened, as there could be scope for reducing overall debt costs within a prudent and
transparent debt management framework.
14.
Even with debt restructuring, substantial fiscal effort will be needed to achieve
fiscal sustainability. The mission noted that even with some write-off of existing debt, a
strong fiscal effort would still be needed to place public debt on a sustainable path and
increase the likelihood that investors would be willing to participate in future debt
restructuring. The authorities generally concurred with these views, and reiterated their
commitment to regularize arrears to statutory bodies and normalize relations with creditors in
the framework of a medium-term debt strategy.
15.
PetroCaribe. The PetroCaribe Agreement with Venezuela could provide significant
budgetary support. The mission commended the innovative and transparent measures that
had been taken to separate out the grant from the loan element of the program, while
underscoring the need to ensure that PetroCaribe funds are linked to social development
programs in the budget, consistent with overall fiscal objectives.
C. Addressing Contingent Risks
16.
Coverage of fiscal accounts. A comprehensive assessment of Antigua and Barbuda’s
public finances should include not only the central government, but also the broader public
sector. The weakness of data on public sector activities hinders a full assessment of the fiscal
position, including contingent risks to the central government. The mission underscored the
need to fully implement the regulations associated with the new Financial Administration
Act, which will allow the government to better monitor and control all public accounts.
17.
Pension reform. The Social Security System (SSS) is running down its liquid assets
owing to a cash deficit, reflecting the absence of government contributions to pay for the
social security benefits of its employees. The authorities announced in the 2008 Budget
Speech their intention to make these contributions. In addition, the government’s debt to the
system needs to be regularized, including from past unpaid contributions. Even with these
actions, the longer-term prospects for the system are a cause for concern. The mission
welcomes the ongoing actuarial review, and hopes that its findings will provide the basis for
timely reform actions to forestall the need for more drastic adjustments down the road.
Equally important is the need to reform civil service pensions, which currently are
noncontributory and unfunded, implying a large medium-term fiscal burden.
D. Enhancing Medium-Term Growth
18.
Medium-term growth prospects are broadly favorable, but need to be supported
by structural reforms. The unwinding of construction activity to more normal levels
strengthens the case for accelerating structural reforms so as to allow the private sector to
take full advantage of the increase in hotel capacity created in recent years.

9
•

Improving the investment climate. Delays in clearing goods at customs have been
identified as a major impediment to economic growth. The mission welcomed the
ongoing Customs Renewal Program, which is expected to substantially reduce the
process for clearing goods, thereby lowering the cost of doing business. Discussions
also focused on labor market reforms, including training to reduce skills mismatches,
and easing of labor market regulations. The authorities indicated that the Investment
Authority, established in 2006, serves as a one-stop center for all prospective
investors and that the USAID, through its Caribbean Open Trade Support (COTS),
has been supportive of private sector development and works closely with the
business community in identifying weaknesses in the investment environment.

•

Export diversification. The offshore financial sector remains a possible area for
diversification and job creation, notwithstanding the trade dispute with the U.S. in the
internet gaming sector. The mission welcomed the authorities’ efforts to expand the
variety of services offered by the offshore sector, and encouraged them to continue
strengthening offshore financial sector regulations.

•

Telecommunications deregulation. The authorities recognized that
telecommunications deregulation has been a catalytic source of growth in many
countries, and concurred with staff that pursuit of this objective in Antigua and
Barbuda is particularly important to reduce business costs and facilitate economic
diversification.
E. External Competitiveness

10
public debt, substantial fiscal adjustment—as envisaged under the “active” policy scenario—
will be necessary to underpin the stability of the regional currency board arrangement.
20.
Sustaining competitiveness in the medium term depends on upgrading the
capacity of the tourism sector. The depreciation of the effective exchange rate has
improved the attractiveness of Antigua and Barbuda as a tourist destination and helped to
reverse the declining trend in its share of tourist arrivals in the Caribbean region. The mission
stressed, however, that success in sustaining competitiveness will depend on upgrading the
productive capacity of the tourism sector. The authorities expect that the ongoing
improvements in hotel capacity (which has increased by about 20 percent since 2005) and
infrastructure, along with greater airport capacity and increased promotional efforts, would
help boost tourism outcomes.
F. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
21.
Strong credit growth calls for close monitoring of financial sector soundness. 5
In light of the rapid growth in private sector credit, the mission recommended frequent
assessments of credit quality and risk management, particularly through on-site examinations
by the ECCB. Discussions also focused on careful monitoring of short-term liabilities in
regional capital markets with a view to limiting potential roll-over risks and ensuring that
AML/CFT measures in the offshore financial sector are effectively enforced. The authorities
indicated that the ECCB has carried out on-site supervision of commercial banks in 2007 and
that they are awaiting the report.
22.
Enhanced regulation of insurance companies and credit unions is also a priority.
The mission commended the authorities for drafting prudential regulations for the
supervision of the nonbank sector, and urged that these regulations be passed and enforced
promptly to allow the effective supervision of all nonbank financial intermediaries. The
mission stressed that, as the nonbank sector grows in importance, it is critical that a build-up
of vulnerabilities be avoided.
G. Data Issues
23.
Improvements in all areas of statistical systems and data dissemination are
needed to facilitate surveillance, policymaking and public debate. The authorities
concurred with the mission that data deficiencies, in particular weaknesses in the collection
and dissemination of CPI data, compromise the quality of policy analysis and design.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Antigua and Barbuda’s economy has performed well in recent years. Growth
soared during 2006–07, led by booming construction activity, both public and private.
Inflation appears to have remained relatively low, and current account deficits have been
largely financed by FDI. Market confidence in government policies has enabled access to
financing from the regional securities market at reasonable rates.
25.
Recent tax measures appear to be working well. Key measures have been taken to
address Antigua and Barbuda’s longstanding fiscal problems. In particular, important and
broad-based tax reforms have been implemented—most recently the ABST in January
2007—and the revenue gains from these measures are materializing. The priority now is to
implement the tax measures in a uniform and transparent manner (including unifying the
VAT rate across sectors, and raising tax compliance to levels observed elsewhere in the
region), underpinning the perception that they are fairly designed and administered.
26.
Looking ahead, 2008 will be an important year for the government to
demonstrate fiscal strengthening in response to the measures taken. Firm expenditure
restraint will be needed to complement actions taken on the revenue side. In particular, it will
be important to ensure that spikes in investment and transfer spending in 2006–07 are
reversed, and that firm restraint is exercised on other components of spending. The risks to
the budget from fluctuations in world oil prices also need to be addressed by moving to a
flexible mechanism for retail prices. This should allow the government to achieve a primary
fiscal surplus in 2008.
27.
Additional fiscal measures will be needed over the medium term to significantly
reduce public debt. On the basis of measures already taken, the primary balance is projected
to remain slightly positive over the medium term, while the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain
well above the government’s longer-term objective. Additional fiscal adjustment—based on
a mix of revenue enhancement and further expenditure restraint—will be needed to place the
debt-to-GDP ratio securely on a downward path. Further downsizing of the public service
can play an important role, but needs to be complemented by more flexible employment
practices to enhance the government’s efficiency and capacity. The need for fiscal measures
is underscored by Antigua and Barbuda’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
28.
Although the recent growth outcome has been favorable, reforms to address
persistent structural weaknesses would enhance medium-term prospects and reduce
exposure to external shocks. Further reforms (including improving the investment climate,
training to reduce skills mismatches, diversifying exports, and deregulating
telecommunications) are needed to promote durable growth. Staff welcomes the authorities’
ongoing efforts to raise public awareness of the need and benefits of structural reforms.
29.
Financial system vulnerabilities call for close monitoring. The ongoing credit
boom could erode the quality of banking system assets, raising the importance of effective

12
onsite and offsite inspections. In addition, rapid growth of the unregulated nonbank financial
sector, in particular insurance companies and credit unions, is a growing concern. In this
context, the authorities’ efforts to prepare legislation for unified supervision of nonbank
financial institutions are well placed.
30.
Economic and social statistics need to be upgraded. Data remain very weak in
terms of coverage, timeliness, and reliability. Of particular importance for macroeconomic
analysis are data on consumer prices, national accounts, tourism, labor markets, public
enterprises, public sector debt and the balance of payments. The mission encourages the
authorities to strengthen their capacity in these areas, and to seek complementary technical
assistance from CARTAC, the CDB, and the Fund.
31.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. The Government’s Fiscal Objectives, Reforms, and Outcomes
Fiscal objectives. The United Progressive Party, which took office for the first time in 2004, adopted
an ambitious reform agenda to address fiscal imbalances and high debt. The government’s fiscal
targets were further elaborated in the 2006 Budget Speech, calling for: a current account surplus of
4 percent of GDP; an overall deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP in five years; and public debt of
less than 60 percent of GDP by 2016. The time frame for the latter target has subsequently been
extended to 2020, consistent with the objective set by the ECCB’s Monetary Council in July 2006.
Progress in reforms. Progress has been made in implementing tax reforms and reducing the wage
bill.
•
Key tax reforms. (i) the personal income tax was reintroduced in April 2005;
(ii) discretionary tax concessions were suspended in late 2005; (iii) a market-valuation-based property
tax system was introduced in 2007; and (iv) a VAT was implemented in January 2007.
•
Voluntary civil service separation. The program received over 1,000 applicants (10 percent of
civil service employment). Actual separations are expected to be completed by the first quarter of
2008.
•
Public expenditure reform. The Finance Administration Act was passed by Parliament in
November 2006, and implementation began with the 2008 budget. Technical assistance is being
provided by CARTAC in cash and expenditure management.
•
Social security reform. Key issues and options were discussed at a public symposium in July
2006 and a White Paper was published in late 2006. There is no timetable for the next steps, however.
Outcomes. Despite these reforms, the primary fiscal deficit deteriorated from 1¼ percent of GDP in
2004 to almost 4½ percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting a number of factors:
•
Implementation of the tax reform package (VAT and property tax) was delayed due to
capacity constraints, implying that its full effect will not be realized until 2008; the excise tax—
initially estimated to yield about 1 percent of GDP—was not implemented, and is temporarily off the
table as a policy measure.
•
Tax yields were affected by generous tax exemptions (under the property tax, corporate
income tax and also VAT) to investment projects associated with the 2007 CWC.
•
Revenue performance continues to be affected by weak tax compliance and enforcement.
Customs procedures are inefficient, reflecting delays in the anticipated reform of the customs
department.
•
Capital outlays and transfers to public enterprises sharply increased in 2006–07, largely
reflecting upgrading of public infrastructure in relation to hosting the CWC.
•
Delays in implementing the civil service reform imply that the associated wage savings will
not be fully realized until 2008.

14

Box 2. PetroCaribe Agreement
Under the PetroCaribe agreement, Venezuela supplies refined oil products to Antigua and Barbuda on
concessional terms. Venezuela delivers the products at market prices, but 40 percent of the value—if
world prices are in the range of US$50–100 per barrel—is financed at a 1 percent interest rate over
1
25 years.
PDV Caribe, a government-owned corporation, handles all operations under PetroCaribe, and
implements the authorities’ guidance regarding allocating the grant element. To cover the future debt
obligations to Venezuela, PDV Caribe invests in zero-coupon deposits that have the same present
value as the debt obligations. At current interest rates—around 7 percent—the grant element is about
50 percent of concessional financing.
To avoid excessive dependence on a single oil supplier, the authorities limit shipments from
Venezuela to about one half of total consumption. With imports of oil products amounting to about
10 percent of GDP at recent world prices, the Venezuela component is about 5 percent of GDP. With
40 percent of the latter value being concessional, and an implicit grant element of 50 percent, net
resources from PetroCaribe could amount to about 1 percent of GDP per year.
The authorities indicated that they intend to spend the grant element on social projects, consistent
with the PetroCaribe Agreement. At the time of discussions, the authorities were searching for
appropriate projects, and the extent to which resources from PetroCaribe would generate new projects
or support existing ones was not clear. The mission pointed to the need for careful planning in order
to minimize the potential impact on the budget in case of an unexpected termination of the agreement
Despite the innovative and transparent vehicle that has been designed for extracting the grant element,
some risks remain:
•

Credit risk. To date, the zero-coupon instruments have been acquired from one local bank,
implying a concentrated financial exposure. The authorities indicated that they intend to
diversify these placements as the size of the funds increases, but pointed to the limited scope
for this given thin regional financial markets.

•

Policy change risk. Although the long-term liability to Venezuela is backed by financial
assets in the first instance, the risk of a possible change in the government’s policy intent
remains, which could jeopardize debt sustainability over the long run.

•

Contingent liability risk. If the agreement terminates unexpectedly, the authorities would
need to provide resources for maintaining existing projects financed under the arrangement.

1/

The financed part is repaid in 23 equal payments after a two-year grace period during which the accrued
interest is capitalized.

Annex I: Debt Sustainability Analysis
A. Public Sector DSA
The public debt ratio fell sharply from over 143 percent of GDP in 2002
to 102 percent of GDP in June 2007 on account of debt relief in 2004–05 and rapid
expansion of the economy in 2006. However, the debt burden remains high and the
government continues to accumulate arrears to a wide spectrum of creditors. As debt
dynamics depend on the terms on which arrears are regularized and on the interest rate at
which financing gaps are filled, strong fiscal adjustment is key for placing debt squarely on
the sustainable path.
Debt sustainability analysis was

1/ The GDP path underlying the three scenarios is the same. Upper (lower) bands in active

around the central assumption of a
marginal interest rate of 8½ percent. The scenarios reflect debt reconciliation between central
government and statutory bodies conducted in late 2007, but exclude expected regularization
of arrears. Arrears are assumed to accrue at contractual interest rates without a reduction of
their face value.
In the baseline scenario with no regularization of arrears, the debt-to-GDP ratio
remains uncomfortably high for nearly the entire spectrum of financing conditions. The
debt ratio stays over 80 percent and remains highly vulnerable to various shocks such as a
slowdown in growth, a worsening of financing conditions, or fiscal slippages (Figure I.1 and
Table I.1).
On the other hand, the extra fiscal adjustment of the active scenario makes an
important difference to the dynamics. It places debt firmly on a downward path even under
unfavorable financing conditions. To illustrate the extent to which debt dynamics can be
affected by an expected regularization of arrears with statutory bodies, staff estimated the
debt path excluding the stock of unpaid contributions to these entities. The adjusted debt
stock declines only gradually in the long term, illustrating the need for further measures to
address the debt burden. On the other hand, the fiscal adjustment envisaged in the active

B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus one standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1–B3 using 1/2 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2008
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2008

Sources: Antigua and Barbuda authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
2/ Includes gross central government and government guaranteed debt and reflects reconciliation of outstanding debt to statutory bodies.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ An increase in 2008 reflects a guaranteed loan to finance airport development project.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
8/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
9/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
10/ Dynamics of GDP growth and the primary balance are taken from the average impact of 12 large natural disasters in the ECCU (Rasmussen, WP/04/224).
11/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

scenario places debt firmly on a downward path even in the case of unfavorable financing
conditions.
B. External DSA
While the absence of data on the international investment position poses a challenge for
assessing external debt sustainability, there is no obvious problem of sustainability at
current levels of the real exchange rate and the associated medium-term external
forecast. At the same time, reducing the public component of net external debt will depend
on the prospects for further fiscal adjustment.
At end-2006, the net external debt—proxied by the aggregated net external positions of the
public sector and the banking system—was estimated at 21 percent of GDP. This is
comparable with an estimate of about 16 percent obtained via an alternative approach in
which the stock of net debt is calculated as a sum of historical current account balances in the
balance of payments minus nondebt creating inflows such as foreign direct investment,
increases in imputed reserves, and debt forgiveness.
Debt sustainability was analyzed for both baseline and active scenarios. In both scenarios,
key assumptions included: (i) no debt relief; (ii) arrears accruing contractually or at penalty
interest rates; (iii) filling approximately a half of the fiscal gap through external sources at an
8½ percent interest rate; and (iv) maintaining the net foreign assets of the banking system at
its 2006 level of 20 percent of GDP.
In the baseline scenario, the debt path is declining very slowly and is moderately sensitive to
various negative shocks, including the current account shock and a combination of small
current account, interest rate and growth shocks (Figure I.2 and Table I.2). A sustained fiscal
adjustment is necessary to contain the public component of the overall external debt.

Annex II. Antigua and Barbuda: Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
Antigua and Barbuda does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund. Antigua and
Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S.
dollar since July 1976. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The last Article IV consultation
was concluded by the Executive Board on January 17, 2007 (IMF Country Report
No. 07/238). Several missions from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre
(CARTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) have visited Antigua and Barbuda
since the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities.
Relations with the World Bank Group
In September 2005, the World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern
Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 2006–09. The four-year
strategy supports the sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars:
(1) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability by
promoting greater social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. The CAS
envisages, under a high case lending scenario, US$10 million for investment lending and/or
Development Policy Lending to support policy reform efforts in the areas of growth and
competitiveness (including interventions on Public Sector Modernization and Public Utilities
Reform).
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
The CDB supports the economic and social development of Antigua and Barbuda through
policy dialogue and the financing of priority capital projects and technical assistance. As of
November 30, 2007, CDB has approved loans totalling US$49.3 million, of which
US$28.2 million are undisbursed.
Statistical Issues
Antigua and Barbuda participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although
major improvements are needed to facilitate effective surveillance and resolve significant
shortcomings with the real sector (including the consumer price index), fiscal and balance of
payments data. Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag
of eight weeks. An April 2007 data ROSC mission to assess monetary and financial statistics
noted some recent improvements and identified some shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary
statistics, which have a potential for detracting from the accurate and timely analysis of
monetary and financial developments and formulation of appropriate policies.

Appendix II. Antigua and Barbuda: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of August 2, 2007)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management.
The CAS, which covers the period FY 2006–09, does not include any lending to Antigua and
Barbuda under the base case scenario. However, during the implementation period, the
country could benefit from participation in the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility financed
through on-lending, possibly through the Caribbean Development Bank. Antigua and
Barbuda could also benefit from a GEF-funded Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate
Change Environmental Protection project, which seeks to assist in the incorporation of
climate change concerns in sector and regional planning for the OECS nations. Additionally,
Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from recently completed, ongoing and planned analytical
and advisory activities to support the CAS’ two main pillars including the following
activities: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth”-OECS growth and competitiveness study,
Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization report, a Caribbean Skills and Curriculum Study, a
report on Institutions, Performance and the Financing of Infrastructure Services in the
Caribbean (recently completed), Caribbean Financial Sector and Regulation report,
Caribbean Social Projection Strategy Review (draft recently completed), a regional study on
Crime, Violence and Exclusion (recently completed) and an OECS private sector financing
study (recently completed). Under the High Case lending scenario, US$10 million is planned
for investment lending and/or Development Policy Lending to support policy reform efforts
in the areas of growth and competitiveness (including interventions on Public Sector
Modernization and Public Utilities Reform).
The previous CAS, which covered the period FY 2002–06, did not include any lending to
Antigua and Barbuda.

5
Appendix III. Antigua and Barbuda: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of September 30, 2007)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) supports the economic and social development of
Antigua and Barbuda through the financing of priority capital projects and technical
assistance (TA) and policy dialogue on major developmental issues. CDB’s involvement
with Antigua and Barbuda has covered such areas as:
• Assisting in the development and
implementation of macroeconomic, social
and sectoral policies geared towards
achieving sustainable economic growth;
• Developing infrastructure to
encourage private sector investment;
• Improving the human resource
skills base to promote economic growth and
diversification;

• Directly and indirectly lending
funds to the agriculture, tourism and manufacturing sectors; and
•

Helping in emergency disaster rehabilitation.

Major projects currently under implementation include:
• A consolidated line of credit to the Antigua and Barbuda Development Bank to
help in its lending to the housing, education, and micro and small enterprise sectors.
• A basic education project to upgrade the learning environment in secondary
schools, strengthen institutional arrangements in the Ministry of Education and improve the
delivery of education services.
• An airport and seaport security improvement project to help in upgrading security
at the international airport and deep-water harbour to meet new international standards.
• A loan to support the transformation of the intra-regional airline LIAT (1974) Ltd.
to profitability by increasing operational efficiency and strengthening its institutional
capabilities.
Over the years, institutional weaknesses have resulted in delays in the timely completion of
several projects under implementation. As at the end of July 2007, undrawn balances totalled
US$28.2 million. Of this undrawn balance, the loan to support the transformation of LIAT
(1974) Ltd. accounted for US$21.8 million.

Appendix IV. Antigua and Barbuda: Statistical Issues
(As of December 19, 2007)
Antigua and Barbuda has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since October 2000. Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, although staff’s analysis was affected by the shortcomings with real sector, fiscal,
and balance of payments data outlined below. Recommendations of an April 2007 data
ROSC mission assessing monetary and financial statistics compiled by the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB) are also outlined.
1.

Real sector statistics

GDP is compiled in current and constant (1990) prices using the outdated methodologies
prescribed in the 1968 System of National Accounts. Compilation has been hampered by the
absence of trade data, which has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in
some sectors, especially construction and wholesale and retail trade. The Central Statistical
Office (CSO) has restarted compilation, with merchandise trade data extracted from data files
provided by Customs since the fourth quarter of 2004. The Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Centre (CARTAC) plans to work with the ECCB in developing a program to
improve the compilation of national accounts through the development of a supply and use
table as a precursor to rebasing the national accounts.
The consumer price index uses expenditure weights derived from a Household Income and
Expenditure Survey conducted during February 1998−January 1999. However, the survey
and price collection exclude Barbuda. There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus
little coverage of the labor market developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked
Survey for the private sector was conducted in 2003, though the coverage of Barbuda was
limited. Results of the 2001 population census have been analyzed and published.
2.

Government finance statistics

Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the ECCB are
compiled broadly in line with the methodology set out in the 1986 Government Financial
Statistics Manual. For several years however, Antigua and Barbuda has not been reporting
government finance statistics to the Fund for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook and IFS
publications. The authorities participated in a December 2007 regional workshop introducing
the GFSM 2001 methodology (particularly for compiling cash based fiscal statistics) to
ECCB member states.

7

3.

Monetary and financial statistics

Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of eight weeks.
In July 2006, the ECCB started reporting monetary and financial statistics to the Fund using
standardized report forms; the associated data have been published in the IFS Supplement
since September 2006. The depository corporations survey does not include the accounts of
credit unions that accept deposits; the ECCB is taking steps to collect reliable data on credit
unions.
An April 2007 data ROSC mission to assess monetary and financial statistics noted some
recent improvements and identified some shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics,
which have a potential for detracting from the accurate and timely analysis of monetary and
financial developments and formulation of appropriate policies. In particular, (i) the
methodological soundness of monetary statistics can be improved by adopting internationally
accepted concepts and definitions, expanding their institutional coverage, and revising the
classifications of financial instruments and the basis for recording; (ii) the transparency of
monetary statistics can be improved, for example, by releasing monetary data to all users at
the same time and strengthening the validation of the disseminated data; (iii) the timeliness of
the dissemination of the data on broad money and credit aggregates can be improved to meet
best international practices; and (iv) the access to officially disseminated monetary data and
metadata can be improved.
4.

External sector statistics

Annual balance of payments statistics are provided to the Fund by the ECCB, but are not
reported in the format recommended in the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual (1993). The latest balance of payments data provided for redissemination in the
International Financial Statistics refer to 2005. Partial provisional 2006 data have been
produced by the ECCB and are expected to be finalized in early 2008.
The GDDS metadata (last updated in October 2002) identify priorities for improving the
balance of payment statistics over the short term, including plans to improve merchandise
trade statistics and visitor expenditure estimates for cruise passengers. Medium-term
priorities include compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics and partial international
investment position tables containing information on debt and monetary operations, both
under the guidance of the ECCB.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 3, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
On February 4, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda. 1
Background
Macroeconomic outcomes have strengthened significantly in recent years. Real GDP growth
averaged 5 percent during 2003–05, and is estimated to have reached 12 percent in 2006.
Economic activity was sustained by construction—mainly in hotels, but also public investment
related to the Cricket World Cup (CWC). In 2007, growth is expected to moderate to about
6 percent, as construction activity slows. The external current account deficit widened in recent
years due to surging world oil prices and construction-related imports. Money and credit growth
have strengthened in recent years, reflecting strong economic activity. While recent growth
outcomes have been favorable, Antigua and Barbuda remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks,
given its dependence on imported oil, volatile tourism receipts, and exposure to natural
disasters. High debt levels also leave it vulnerable to a tightening of regional and international
financing conditions.
Despite the rebound in economic activity, fiscal imbalances have remained large, reflecting a
number of one-off expenditures in 2006–07. Tax revenues have increased significantly, buoyed
by the upturn in economic activity as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax (ABST)
introduced in January 2007. But spending has also surged, largely reflecting the effects of the
CWC and one-time costs associated with the voluntary separation program for public
employees. As a result, the primary deficit is expected to narrow to about 3 percent of GDP in
2007. Public debt, which fell from a peak of 143 percent of GDP in 2002 to 107 percent in 2006,
has remained broadly stable during 2007. Notwithstanding the fiscal imbalances, the authorities
have continued to reissue debt on the regional government securities market at relatively low
rates.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

2
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) and the customer-weighted REER (which
tracks REER movements relative to main tourism customers) have depreciated since 2002 with
the weakening of the U.S. dollar. However, given the high level of public debt, substantial fiscal
adjustment will be necessary to underpin the stability of the regional currency board
arrangement.
There has been progress in implementing broad structural reforms. On fiscal issues, the
authorities intend to enhance revenue performance, including the introduction of a more flexible
mechanism for retail fuel pricing in 2008. They also intend to improve the investment climate,
reduce skills mismatches, diversity exports, and deregulate telecommunications, with a view to
enhancing the resilience of the economy to shocks.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Antigua and Barbuda’s recent strong economic growth and relatively low
inflation, and commended the authorities for their ongoing efforts to improve the country’s fiscal
position. Looking forward, Directors supported the authorities’ continuing efforts to address
structural weaknesses in order to reduce the country’s exposure to external shocks and
promote durable growth. This should entail, in particular, improving the investment climate,
reducing skills mismatches, diversifying exports, and making regulations in telecommunications
more efficient.
Directors agreed that it will be important for the government to demonstrate fiscal strengthening
in 2008. They commended the implementation of broad-based tax reforms, including the VAT,
and looked forward to their uniform and transparent implementation. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to introduce a fuel price adjustment mechanism to achieve greater passthrough of oil price increases. Firm expenditure restraint would allow the surge in spending in
2006 and 2007 to be unwound.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthen debt management and their
ongoing efforts to normalize relations with creditors. They looked forward to the early clearance
of external and internal arrears. Directors stressed that additional fiscal measures will be
essential, over the medium term, to placing the debt-to-GDP ratio securely on a downward path.
Expenditure restraint will be critical to this effort, including, in particular, civil service reform to
contain the wage bill and enhance efficiency in the public sector.
Directors noted that the real exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals, with the
depreciation in recent years having contributed to improved competitiveness. They emphasized
that maintaining competitiveness will depend on the authorities maintaining their commitment to
sustained fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, which will also underpin the regional
currency arrangement.
Directors cautioned that rapid growth in private sector credit could erode the quality of loan
portfolios. They welcomed efforts to further strengthen financial sector supervision, including
through unified supervision of nonbank financial institutions.

3
Directors saw a need for strengthening economic data in terms of coverage, timeliness, and
reliability. They encouraged the authorities to enhance the resources devoted to this area, and
supported the provision of technical assistance as appropriate.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 2007:
STATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA ON
THE IMF STAFF REPORT
Between September 25th and October 5th 2007, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda
welcomed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials for the annual Article IV
Consultation. We were pleased to once again have the opportunity to engage the Fund
staff on the fiscal and other economic challenges facing Antigua and Barbuda and to
exchange ideas on how best to meet these challenges. Over the two week period of the
Article IV Consultation, the Fund staff met with a wide range of public sector officials
along with representatives from the private sector and civil society. Through these
various meetings the Fund was able to undertake a comprehensive assessment of
macroeconomic developments in Antigua and Barbuda. At the conclusion of the mission,
the Fund and the Government held a joint press conference where the IMF presented its
findings and engaged the media in discussions on the various issues facing the Antigua
and Barbuda economy.
While the Government agrees that the fiscal balances are not yet at sustainable levels, it
must be emphasised that there has been significant adjustment in fiscal performance over
recent years. Indeed, the primary balance has declined from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2003
to 2.8 percent of GDP for 2007. This was made possible through aggressive reforms on
the revenue side which have contributed to revenue increases of over 20 percent. The
strong revenue performance was boosted by robust economic growth and ongoing efforts
to strengthen the key institutions that are responsible for revenue collection. We concur
that adjustments on the expenditure side have been less aggressive than the interventions
on the revenue side. However, the Government has been and remains adamant that
measures to reduce expenditure must be undertaken with caution and should not
precipitate economic and social hardship on the population. Such an approach is even
more critical given the persistent increases in international prices for oil and non-oil
commodities and the implications of these external price shocks for the economy as a
whole. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to transforming the
macroeconomic landscape of Antigua and Barbuda and will continue to pursue policies
and strategies that will bring about fiscal sustainability and at the same time encourage
investment and promote economic growth.
We are pleased with the Fund’s assessment of economic growth prospects for Antigua
and Barbuda and concur that the Antigua and Barbuda would grow at a rate of just over 6
percent in 2007 compared to growth of over 12 percent in 2006. For 2008 and into the
medium term, the Government anticipates that economic growth would average between
5 and 6 percent – a medium term projection that is not significantly dissimilar to the 5
percent estimated by the Fund. We expect that economic growth will be driven by a
number of private sector and public sector development projects. It is also expected that
the tourism sector will continue to grow as the Government intensifies marketing
programmes in traditional and non-tradition markets and as efforts to capitalise on the

2
increased room capacity developed during preparations for Cricket World Cup 2007
begin to bear fruit.
With respect to the fiscal accounts, we agree that achieving a primary surplus in 2008 is
critical to moving the Government closer to attaining its fiscal objectives. Following the
one-off resource outlays in 2006 and 2007, particularly for CWC 2007 related expenses
and for the implementation of the Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Programme
(VSEP), which slowed progress in reducing the fiscal balances, the Government will
focus on greater expenditure controls and further enhancing revenue performance in
2008. The Government’s commitment to moving ahead with its home-grown adjustment
programme is reflected in Budget 2008, which estimates current account and primary
surpluses of about 1 percent of GDP.
We expect to achieve these outcomes through the continued implementation of key
expenditure management programmes – particularly the FreeBalance system and the
Human Capital Accountability Programme (HCAP). In addition, we intend to enact the
regulations for the Finance Administration Act and will seek to finalise the new
Procurement Act. These measures along with ongoing efforts to reorganise the Treasury
Department will all help to curtail expenditure and firmly establish new and modern
procedures for more effective financial management. On the revenue side, the
Government will continue to undertake various measures aimed at enhancing tax
administration thereby further boosting revenue performance. In particular, it is expected
that the Customs Renewal Programme, which faced some challenges over the past
several months, will move apace in 2008. This has been made possible through the kind
assistance of the Government of Jamaica, the Organisation of American States and the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Country Open
Trade Support (COTS) programme. Further, the Government has established an
oversight committee to assist the Inland Revenue Department to better achieve its
mandate and to more effectively meet its revenue targets.
Another critical component of the Government’s programme to transform the
macroeconomic environment in Antigua and Barbuda is its debt management strategy.
This strategy was developed with the financial assistance of the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and with the technical assistance of the international debt
advisory firm, Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin (Europe) Ltd. Our debt management
strategy has focused on normalising relations with creditors, assessing the Government’s
payment capacity, reducing the overall level of debt, and establishing more prudent
borrowing procedures. We commenced implementation of this strategy in 2007 and have
already begun to realise positive results which are reflected in a further decline in the
debt to GDP ratio to 97 percent. This is a significant achievement given that in 2002 and
2003, the debt to GDP ratio exceeded 140 percent. While the public debt remains high,
we are encouraged that as the implementation of this debt management strategy continues
in 2008, we will realise further reductions in the debt stock that would ensure the
achievement of debt sustainability.

3
At the same time that this Government is seeking to correct the large fiscal imbalances
that characterised the Antigua and Barbuda economy for many years, we are also
dedicated to implementing policies and strategies that will encourage investment and
promote the growth and development of the private sector. This is indeed a difficult
undertaking but we have managed to generate some successes on the fiscal side while at
the same time realising economic growth, which averaged over 7 percent between 2004
and 2007. The Government is very cognisant of the need for various structural reforms to
ensure sustainable growth. An important part of the Government’s plans to encourage
private sector development is the Antigua Barbuda Investment Authority (ABIA). This
institution has the responsibility for facilitating and promoting investment in Antigua and
Barbuda. It serves as a one-stop-shop for all investors – whether local or foreign and
represents a more transparent and predictable mechanism for granting concessions and
tax incentives.
Along with the ABIA, the Government enacted legislation to support the development of
micro and small businesses. We are very cognisant of the role of small businesses in
generating employment, reducing poverty and promoting economic growth. In this
regard, the Small Business Development Act was passed in 2007 and provides fiscal
incentives and concessions for small businesses and offers technical assistance for small
business owners in areas such as budgeting, accounting, product development, marketing,
development of business plans and general management procedures. Also, a Loan
Guarantee Scheme will be established in 2008 and is intended to provide micro and small
businesses with greater access to financing. We believe that these interventions along
with the fiscal reform initiatives are critical for the transformation of the economy of
Antigua and Barbuda.
One of the major constraints to the policy making process in Antigua and Barbuda has
been limited availability of reliable and timely data. The Government has recognised the
need to strengthen the Statistics Division in order to ensure that critical economic and
social data can be readily obtained. This process is expected to commence in 2008 with
financial and technical assistance provided through the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB). The programme will focus on enhancing human resources, reorganising the
Statistics Division, and providing appropriate tools and equipment for data collection,
analysis and dissemination.
In conclusion, the Government remains grateful for the support and assistance provided
by the Fund. We welcome the opportunity to engage the Fund staff on the wide range of
fiscal and other economic issues that are important to Antigua and Barbuda. While these
discussions with the Fund have proven instructive, the Government has and will continue
to pursue its own policies and strategies. These policies and strategies have been based
on the overarching principle of balancing macroeconomic transformation with the need to
safeguard the economic and social welfare of the people of Antigua and Barbuda. The
Government will continue to utilise the technical expertise of the Fund and other
international and regional institutions in its ongoing effort to promote fiscal and
economic sustainability in Antigua and Barbuda.
