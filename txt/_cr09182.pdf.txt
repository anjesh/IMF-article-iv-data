PARAGUAY
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Paraguay
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Daneshwar Ghura
April 20, 2009
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Context. Following a period of stagnation and financial instability that led to a financial crisis in
2002, the authorities have been implementing strong macroeconomic and pro-growth policies,
supported by two successive SBAs. The economy was successfully stabilized and began to grow well
above average. A new administration took over in August 2008 promising more emphasis on social
issues but the global financial crisis and political difficulties have delayed some of those plans.

•

2007 Article IV consultation. The last Article IV consultation was concluded in June 2007.
Directors stressed the importance of continuing to adhere to the strong macroeconomic policies in the
authorities’ program, as well as the structural reforms, including enhancing prudential regulations,
strengthening the financial position of the Central Bank, sharpening expenditure control systems and
improving the investment climate.

•

2008 Developments. The economy grew nearly 6 percent, but—as in many other countries—there
was a noticeable deceleration in the last quarter. Inflation was contained at 7½ percent at end-2008
(the upper bound of the Central Bank’s target). The fiscal position remained strong and the
consolidated public sector reached a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP, owing to a large reduction in
capital spending in 2008. Consistent with the pattern of commodity prices, the external position
strengthened significantly in the first half of the year but weakened in the second half. Monetary
policy was mostly accommodative and interest rates were reduced at the end of the year to provide
liquidity to the banking system.

•

2009 Policies. To counter the adverse effects of the global crisis, the authorities have adopted an
Economic Recovery Plan. The authorities and staff concurred that a relaxation of the fiscal stance and
the continuation of a flexible monetary policy was appropriate. Staff recommended a deepening of
ongoing structural reforms, especially to strengthen the financial position of the central bank, and to
reinforce financial oversight and regulation, particularly of the large cooperative, pension fund and
insurance sectors.

•

Discussions took place during March 4–18, 2009. The mission met with Finance Minister Borda,
Central Bank President Corvalán, Deputy Finance Minister Caballero, senior government officials,
and representatives of the banking community and the private sector. The staff team consisted of
P. Alonso-Gamo (head), M. Mlachila (WHD), S. Maziad (SPR), A. Lemgruber (FAD) and J. Gasha
(MCM). A. Santos (WHD) joined the mission for a few days to introduce the new mission chief to
the authorities. The mission was assisted by T. Roy, the Fund’s resident representative in Asunción,
and it liaised with World Bank and IDB staff. J. Maciel (OED) participated in the meetings.

I. ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND
1.
Context. The rapid deterioration in the global environment has started to affect the
region, including Paraguay. The Paraguayan economy performed very well over the past five
years, with real GDP growth averaging about 5 percent annually—the best in a generation.
The fiscal position strengthened considerably, reducing public debt sharply and bringing the
debt ratio to relatively low levels. Throughout this successful period, Paraguay was supported
by two successive Fund arrangements. With the rapidly deteriorating global economy,
however, short-term economic prospects have significantly worsened.
2.
Output. Real GDP growth is estimated to have reached nearly 6 in 2008, after a
record performance of 6¾ percent in 2007. Growth accelerated to about 7½ percent in the
first half of 2008, supported by the continued

Fiscal. Fiscal policy was strong and counter-cyclical in 2008. Revenue performance
was remarkable, notwithstanding lower royalties.

significantly worsened in the first two months of 2009, due in part to a sharp decline in
customs revenue.
5.
Monetary. Monetary policy remained accommodative throughout 2008. In particular,
credit growth peaked at 75 percent and

•

Credit growth has decelerated, but remains high. After reaching about 75 percent in
mid-2008, the growth of credit to the private sector decelerated to 40 percent in
February 2009.

•

Preference for liquidity has increased. Demand for guaraní and dollar liquidity has
increased, and banks have redeemed their holdings of maturing sterilization paper
(LRMs).

7.
External. The external position was very strong throughout the first half of 2008, but
started to weaken as the global slowdown and financial crisis unfolded, with the current
account shifting to a deficit and external credit lines to the private sector being reduced. As a
result, the current account recorded a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP in 2008. Exports started
declining in September 2008, in particular meat exports, whose main markets practically
closed because of oversupply and import substitution from other countries. Imports also
decelerated on account of lower oil prices and lower demand for agricultural sector inputs.
The foreign exchange market was under pressure during August–November 2008 and, to
ease pressures, the Central Bank sold some US$400 million (80 percent of all foreign
currency purchases accumulated during the first half of the year). During August–October
2008, the guaraní, which had appreciated by 23 percent between end-2007 and June 2008,
was allowed to slide back to its level at the beginning of the year. Net international reserves
stood at US $2.86 billion at end-2008 (430 percent of short-term debt on a remaining basis),
and have remained stable since. There has been some progress in resolving external disputed
claims.3
2

Liquidity ratios (measured by the ratio of liquid assets, comprising cash, reserves, accounts in banks and
lending in interbank market, to total assets) showed a modest deterioration from 24.3 percent at end-2007 to
23.5 percent at end-2008. Nonperforming loans nearly doubled, from G371 billion to G714 billion during the
same period.

The Paraguayan authorities are currently defending themselves in the case brought against them by import
verification companies at the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement for Investment Disputes.

7
8.
Politics. After 61 years of uninterrupted government by the Colorado Party, President
Lugo was elected last year on a platform for change, social justice, and fight against
corruption, with the goal of addressing deep-seated poverty issues, by increasing social and
infrastructure expenditure, while maintaining growth and macroeconomic stability. The
government lacks a majority in Congress, however, rendering difficult the implementation of
the ambitious reform agenda. Plans to reactivate the economy with the help of external
financing may face difficulties in getting approved by Congress.
9.
Social. Paraguay’s poverty rate remains high, and the social situation is now
deteriorating due to the economic slowdown, even if the decline of food and energy prices in
recent months brought moderate relief to poor households. Falling commodity prices and the
drought have worsened living conditions for poor peasants and farm workers, and the
government had to quell social unrest among sesame farmers by promising financial
emergency aid. In the urban areas, faltering economic activity is causing business failures
and layoffs.4
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Paraguay is confronting the challenges of the global economic slowdown from a
position of relative strength, as a consequence of the sound policies pursued in recent
years. These policies have led to solid growth, continuous budget surpluses, significantly
lower public debt ratios, and a remarkable increase in international reserves. However, the
economic outlook has significantly worsened, largely because of the sudden change in the
external environment and a regional drought. Growth has decelerated sharply and the
external accounts have come under strain, with lower imports leading to a drop in tax
revenue in early 2009 .The legacy of two years of very rapid credit expansion could lead to a
deterioration in bank portfolios. Moreover, experience suggest, contagion from Brazil and
Argentina poses a major risk (Box 1). Should economic conditions deteriorate further, the
government’s lack of a majority in Congress could complicate efforts to attain political
consensus on tough decisions, and there may be pressures to follow populist policies.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Focus. The discussions focused on policies that could help limit the negative impact
of the global economic slowdown and financial crisis, and return quickly to a higher and
sustainable growth path, safeguarding the hard-fought economic gains. Although the impact
of the global crisis has been relatively limited to date, the projected sharp decline in
Paraguay’s growth rate is likely to put to considerable strains on the financial sector.
4

In a recently published study, the UNDP estimated that in the absence of decisive policy measures extreme
poverty would rise from 19.4 percent of the population (2007) to 22.5 percent during 2009, reversing any gains
that were achieved during recent years of high economic growth.

8
12.
Authorities’ plan. To help limit the adverse effects of the global crisis, the
authorities have adopted an Economic Reactivation Plan. The plan is set in a medium-term
context, with measures to address immediate challenges as well as medium-term structural
weaknesses. As a first step, it envisages implementing fully the 2009 budget approved by
Congress, which is more expansionary than the one submitted by the executive in September
2008—without introducing cut-backs via a financial plan. The budget envisages an overall
deficit of ¾ percent of GDP.5 Key elements of the plan include: (i) implementing a fiscal
stimulus in 2009–10, mainly by increasing significantly capital expenditures and conditional
cash transfers (CCT); (ii) increasing liquidity available to the banking system to facilitate
lending; (iii) obtaining higher levels of external financing from international financial
institutions (including contingency credit lines); and (iv) addressing medium-term structural
issues, including public financial management and control, and financial sector reforms.
13.

Against this background, the policy dialogue focused on three themes:

•

Short-term fiscal and monetary policies to sustain domestic demand during the
downturn while preserving stability.

•

Policies geared to strengthen the banking system in the face of a slowdown of
economic activity, while reinforcing preparedness against spillover risks of the
global credit crunch.

•

Medium-term structural policies to sustain growth and reduce poverty through a
carefully planned reform agenda.

5

In the past, the executive had to resort to implementing a financial plan aimed at containing the budget
approved by Congress within reasonable limits.

Box 1. Paraguay: Risks and Channels of Contagion
Paraguay enters the current episode of financial turbulence from a much stronger position that in
previous crises. Reserve coverage of short-term debt is three times higher than in 2001 (but import coverage is
broadly the same), while external public debt as a percent of GDP is half the level of seven years ago. The
banking system has also strengthened; with the NPL ratio at 1 percent in 2008 against 21 percent in 2003 and the
return on assets has increased from 0.4 to 3½ percent. However, the global economic slowdown and financial
crisis bring considerable risks.
Trade linkages have increased while direct financial linkages have marginally decreased.
• Trade openness (measured as the sum of total exports and imports) has increased by half, to nearly
70 percent of GDP. The increase reflects in part the expansion of primary commodities (soy) and other primary
exports (meat), for which Paraguay directly competes with its immediate neighbors from MERCOSUR. Its
dependence on imports from

• Vulnerabilities remain. Despite reduced direct financial linkages and thin undeveloped capital markets, the
deterioration of global sentiment in late 2008 (combined with the sharp decline in commodity prices) has
considerably affected Paraguay.
The impact of the 1998 Brazil crisis and the 2001 Argentina crisis on Paraguay provides some insights to
which extent the country could be affected if regional conditions deteriorate further. Although the nonagriculture GDP contraction was smaller the year following the Argentinean crisis than after the Brazilian crisis
(-1.3 against -2.1 percent respectively), the impact on the banking sector (with a loss of 30 percent of deposits)
and on the exchange rate was more severe. Paraguay weathered better the Brazilian crisis because of a number of
factors: the magnitude of the depreciation in Argentina was larger than the one in Brazil; the 2001 crisis spilled
over into the domestic banking system through a local subsidiary of an Argentinean bank; six months after the
start of the Brazilian crisis, Paraguay benefited from a large loan from Taiwan, allowing it to revert its
contractionary interest rate defense. Similar specific factors would also matter this time, should conditions
deteriorate.

There is little information on short-term financing provided directly by agro-exporters, less so on their evolution over time. Some
estimates suggest that they could represent about half of total bank credit.

A. Short-Term Policies to Address the Economic Slowdown and Spillovers
from the Global Economic Crisis6
14.
Macroeconomic outlook. In the wake of the global recession, Paraguay’s real GDP
is expected to decline to about ½ percent in 2009 before recovering very gradually towards
its long-term growth potential. The sharp slowdown is due to the large negative terms-oftrade shock and a regional drought, affecting agriculture and decelerating both investment
and private consumption. The output gap is expected to turn negative in 2009 (about
3 percent of GDP), with considerable downside risks. Inflation is expected to decline from
7½ percent at end-December 2008 to 5½ percent by end-2009, before declining to 5 percent
by 2010. Downward pressures from the unwinding of the food and energy supply shocks,
combined with a decelerating demand, would be partly offset by higher imported inflation
and inflation inertia. The external current account deficit is expected to improve to 1 percent
of GDP in 2009, reflecting much lower imports.
15.
Fiscal stimulus. In the face of a weakening economy, staff concurred that there is
scope for fiscal easing. Given the comfortable and sustainable public debt situation (below
20 percent of GDP, see Appendix 1), the authorities can afford a targeted fiscal stimulus of
about 3 percent of GDP for 2009. Although automatic

Staff advocated renewed efforts in executing the capital
budget, improving inter-ministerial coordination, and higher social spending, including
substantial increases in outlays for the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Moreover,
in light of the current decline in tax revenue, there is need to continue to improve tax
administration and resist tax concessions. The authorities agreed and expressed concern
about political pressures to increase current expenditures and introduce tax concessions.8

Fiscal Policies in an Adverse Environment” Selected Issues Paper.

The World Bank could provide additional resources of US$100 million, the IDB could make available loans
up to US$250 million (including an emergency credit line); several international donor agencies have
significant approved but undisbursed loan portfolios.

Congress considers introducing unfunded old-age pensions, increasing fiscal incentives for companies that
hire new staff, and delaying the introduction of the PIT.

Staff expressed concern about the inclusion in the approved budget of yet another sharp
increase in the wage bill (about 16 percent compared to the outcome for 2008).9
16.
Monetary policy. Staff supported the relatively accommodative monetary stance at
current policy rates (reduced by 200 basis points in October and November 2008), but
cautioned against excessive further liquidity injections (Box 2). The authorities argued in
favor of prudent monetary easing to facilitate loan repayments in view of sharply lower
export revenues. Since September 2008, credit growth rates have been declining, due to the
economic slowdown and an increase in lending rates. Banks have become more cautious in
lending—preferring to hold higher levels of liquidity10. Staff noted that an excessive increase
of liquidity could put pressures on the exchange rate and stressed that the authorities had to
be prepared to tighten policy if there was evidence of excess demand in the foreign exchange
market and/or if inflation pressures reappeared.11 In the event of liquidity shortages due to
unexpected financial system distress, staff agreed that there is scope for a further temporary
easing of monetary conditions through a new facility for collateralized short-term lending,
The authorities and staff agreed that using international reserves to fund fiscal expenditures,
as proposed in Congress, should be firmly resisted.
17.
Exchange rate flexibility. The authorities and staff concurred that the exchange rate
should remain flexible to facilitate adjustment in the face of external shocks and
fundamentals. Staff estimates that the guaraní is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3)
and that exchange rate policy since October 2008 has been appropriate, as limited
interventions help avoid a disorderly adjustment that could jeopardize the stability of the
dollarized banking system, while preserving the reserve cushion. Staff stressed the need to
avoid unsterilized intervention through domestic liquidity injections, as such a policy would
fuel outflow pressures.

The executive’s budget proposal envisaged no increase in salaries (except for wage drift), but an increase by 5
percent, plus additional hiring of staff and increased benefits in the health sector and police introduced by
Congress have inflated the overall wage bill.

10

Higher than the normal level of excess liquidity. The latter is explained by structural inefficiencies in the
interbank market. Planned reforms in the payments system should alleviate this problem.

About 45 percent of liquid assets in guaranís and the rest in U.S. dollars.

Box 2. Paraguay: Credit Developments in 2008–Early 2009
Credit grew rapidly during the first half of 2008., fueled
by negative real interest rates since mid-2007. Bank credit
to the private sector (in guaranis and dollars) has expanded
strongly, peaking at 75 percent (y-o-y) in May 2008. Credit
expansion was mainly directed to the fastest growing
sectors: agriculture and trade. Bank credit was also
complemented by crop pre-financing credit lines by
international commodity trading companies, such as Cargill.
Credit expansion continued at the same pace in Q3,
despite growing signs of a worsening economic
environment. Foreign exchange inflows were declining
while deposits in commercial banks stagnating, and
subsequently declining. There was a reduction in LRMs,
reflecting both lower supply and demand, with less need to
sterilize given the decline of NIR, and less appetite for
LRMs given the desire to continue expanding private sector
credit, which carried higher rates. Banks also made
increasing use of their free reserves at the central bank.

Although modest at the aggregate level, the reversal was
severe for some of the smallest banks. Three banks
representing about 20 percent of the banking system
experienced a monthly loss of deposits larger than
7 percent, leading them to reduce its lending activity. The
pattern of deposit loss suggest flight to quality while the
expansion of credit by some banks (mostly foreign banks)
reflected an extension of interbank credit in favor of the
most affected institutions. Broadly speaking, there seems to
have been a limited credit crunch that affected some of the
smaller, domestically-owned banks. Since October, liquidity
pressures have declined for all banks. The main problem
affecting all banks is the structural shortage of longer-term
liquidity.

The situation changed drastically in October 2008. With
the deterioration of market sentiment and a consequent cut
in external credit lines, the central bank shifted to allow
greater exchange rate flexibility while decreasing reserve
requirements and reducing the policy rate. Commercial
banks started to accumulate a buffer of higher reserves by
continuing to reduce their outstanding stock of LRMs, and
kept credit to the private sector broadly flat.1 Deposits
declined by about 3 percent.

Using CGER-type methodologies,1 the assessment suggests that, as of end-2008, the guaraní was
broadly in line with fundamentals, with an estimated overvaluation of 1–5 percent. The REER had
been falling until 2005, when that trend was

approach also suggests that the guaraní is
in line with fundamentals, with virtually no overvaluation in the medium term. The estimated
current account (CA) norm was about zero percent of GDP, while the underlying current account deficit
in 2008 is estimated at -0.4 percent (after stripping the effect of the peak in oil prices). Using the
standard CGER trade elasticities, eliminating the gap between the estimated CA norm and the
underlying current account deficit in 2008 would require a real depreciation of about 1 percent.
The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests
an overvaluation of about 3.5 percent in the medium
term. In the ES approach, the sustainable current
account deficit, which stabilizes the NFA position at the
2007–08 average, is estimated at 1 percent of GDP. A
real depreciation of about 3.5 percent would close the
trade account gap of 1.3 percent between the equilibrium
and the projected trade balance.

estimated overvaluation of some 6–8 percent. Using
cointegration analysis over the period 1990Q1–2007Q2, a long-run relation was obtained between
Paraguay’s REER and fundamentals, including: terms of trade, productivity differential, trade openness,
fiscal balance , CA balance, and NFA. The resulting ERER points to an overvaluation of the actual
REER of about 8 percent at the end-2008. Re-estimating the equation over a shorter time period
(1991Q1–2001Q4) to eliminate the effect of an extended period of undervaluation on the equilibrium
REER results in a smaller estimated overvaluation of about 6 percent.2

These methodologies take a holistic approach in assessing the exchange rate by using three approaches: (i) the macroeconomic
balance; (ii) the external sustainability; and (iii) the equilibrium real exchange rate. For details on the methodologies see

B.

Policies to Enhance the Financial Sector12

18.
Staff emphasized that further strengthening the financial sector should be an
integral part of the Economic Reactivation Plan. Noting that Paraguay had suffered from
five consecutive financial crises during the period 1995–2003, with considerable economic
dislocation and fiscal costs, staff stressed that the framework for crisis mitigation and
resolution needed updating and strengthening, drawing on Paraguay’s own historical
experience (Box 4). Staff recommendations drew on the Fund’s cross-country experience and
best practices in dealing with financial sector issues and contingency planning, including:
•

Cooperatives. Financial cooperatives are steadily increasing their participation in the
financial system—accounting for approximately 25 percent of deposits and almost
28 percent of credits by end-2008—but are lightly supervised. The “General
Regulatory Framework for Cooperatives”, which entered into effect in 2007, aimed at
establishing capital requirements, classification of loans and provisioning
requirements, liquidity requirements, as well as introducing a basic framework for
carrying out effective supervision. However, an effective framework is still being
developed, as norms governing the operations of cooperatives are less stringent than
those for banks and finance companies. There is therefore a need of significant action
in these areas without delay. Priorities in this area include (i) strengthening
supervision and auditing regulations; (ii) improving the system of statistics and data
analysis; and (iii) enhancing the administrative and operational capacities of the
supervisory agency (INCOOP).

•

Protection of depositors. A deposit guarantee fund (FGD) was created in December
2003. While depositors paid their contributions, the government has fallen behind in
its commitment to bolster the FGD’s capital base. Staff encouraged the authorities to
honor promptly the financial commitments to the FDG, so as to enhance the resilience
and credibility of the deposit insurance system.13

•

Bank restructuring and resolution. The framework for restructuring and resolution
has some shortcomings. In particular, the responsibility for the ultimate liabilities in
case of bank intervention needs to be clarified. Since end-2008, staff of the

12

Financial sector reforms have received extensive technical assistance from the Fund (e.g., central bank
recapitalization, prudential regulation and supervision, see Information Annex), and from the World Bank
(payments system).
13

The fund is currently worth US$80 million, of which US$60 million is in cash (deposits at BIS of
US$50 million and US$10 million in local currency deposits at the BCP). As of February 2009, the Fund
covered about 1½ percent of total deposits and 4 percent of eligible deposits, well short of the 10 percent target
set by law. According to the 2003 original FGD law, the government is expected to contribute about
US$50 million in interest-free, non-negotiable bonds, but so far has only contributed US$20 million.

15
Superintendency of Banks (SIB) is covered by an insurance against personal liability
in cases of bank intervention and resolution, but the SIB also needs formal powers to
apply administrative sanctions and remedial procedures. Staff noted that any
restructuring event should aim at consolidating the financial system, while ensuring
that public financial support is repaid over time.
•

Foreign exchange pressures. In a dollarized economy, the central bank’s foreign
exchange position should be seen to be strong enough to withstand a sudden increase
in the public’s preference for foreign currency. As noted by the 2005 FSAP report,
the large proportion of unhedged borrowers and the difficulty in executing collateral
suggest that foreign-exchange-induced credit risk for private sector balance sheets
could be significant. Staff noted that in the event of high pressures, the BCP should
bolster its lender of last resort capabilities through international support, if needed. To
moderate the pressures on the exchange rate, the authorities tightened the regulations
on net foreign assets positions, reducing the limit for long positions from 50 percent
to 30 percent of capital, and introducing a limit of US$1million for the change in the
daily position.

19.
In response, the authorities indicated that they are strengthening the policy
framework to respond to financial stress. They identified the main vulnerabilities to the
financial sector as stemming from liquidity concerns, the high level of dollarization, the
drying-up of external credit lines, and a deterioration of credit quality. The liquidity
framework has been improved through the introduction in October 2008 of a short-term
facility providing liquidity at a penalty rate (FLIR).14 In addition, the Central Bank reduced
reserve requirements to provide additional liquidity to the system.15 The bank resolution
framework is being strengthened, while the Superintendency of Banks has stepped up
monitoring of the institutions under most financial strain, including by establishing recently a
Financial Stability Department to monitor the effects of the global financial crisis. The
authorities are also discussing with banks the capitalization of part of the exceptionally
strong profits generated in 2008 to enhance the capital buffer of the system.
20.
Medium-term financial policies. While significant efforts have been made in
improving the resilience of the financial system to withstand periods of distress, and in
developing capital markets, more needs to be done to have modern institutions and
frameworks in place (Appendix 2). In particular, there is a need to recapitalize the Central
14

To date, no financial institution has used the facility, out of concern for a negative signaling effect. The
penalty rate is 10.5 percent.
15

By 4½ percentage points on foreign-currency denominated deposits and by 2 percentage points on domestic
currency-denominate deposits in November 2008. In February 2009, reserve requirements on FX term deposits
of 361-540 days were reduced to 16.5 percent, and those on deposits of over 540 days were reduced to zero as
were those on domestic currency deposits of over 360 days.

16
Bank, strengthen the regulatory framework for commercial banks and establishing a
comprehensive regulatory supervisory framework for cooperatives.16
•

Central Bank. The cost of bank bailouts during previous financial crises led to the
BCP’s capital becoming negative, impairing its capacity to conduct policy and
function properly. It is estimated that the BCP has a capital shortfall of about
6 percent of GDP. The government expected to send, by end-2009, legislation to
Congress to allow for a recapitalization through a transfer of marketable treasury
bonds that might, in the medium term, replace LRMs.

•

Commercial banks. In April 2007, the authorities developed a comprehensive
strategy to improve governance rules, enhance the independence of the
Superintendency of Banks, strengthen “fit and proper” criteria, and strengthen capital
requirements. The authorities have been implementing the strategy, a key component
of which was the implementation of Resolución 117 in October 2008—on assets
classification and provisioning requirements. However, significant shortcomings
remain in order to increase the compliance with Basel Core Principles of Effective
Banking Supervision. In particular, the Banking Law and Central Bank Law need to
be amended to: (i) improve governance rules; (ii) enhance the independence and
sanctioning capacity of the Superintendency of Banks (SB); (iii) further strengthen
“fit and proper” criteria; and (iv) strengthen capital requirements.

16

Other financial intermediaries that are in need of strengthened regulatory and supervisory frameworks are
insurance companies and pension funds, which according to some estimates account for about 10 percent of
financial system assets (of approximately 50 percent of GDP).
17

Which replaced Resolución 8 of 2003.

17
Box 4. Paraguay: Lessons from Previous Banking Crises, 1995–2003
Paraguay experienced five financial crises during an eight-year period from the mid-1990s. These episodes
illustrate what and what not to do when confronted with banking crisis. While the response was generally
inadequate in the first three crises, the authorities, notably the Superintendency of Banks (SBP), responded
appropriately and in a timely manner to the 2002 and 2003 crises. The authorities’ learning experience is
evidenced by cost of the crises, which amounted to only 1 percent of GDP in the last two episodes against
15 percent for the earlier crises.

It was the byproduct of a rapid financial
liberalization without adequate
safeguards in terms of sound prudential
regulations and enforcement. The crisis
was triggered when two large banks
failed to meet their clearing obligations.

largest banks with
16 percent of

The authorities decided to honor
deposits in the intervened banks,
without imposing sanctions on the
banks that did not improve their
performance.

1997

The crisis occurred principally due to the
authorities’ inadequate response to the
first crisis, as regulatory forbearance and
generous de facto deposit guarantees
allowed financial institutions and
depositors to continue with the status
quo without paying adequate attention to
risk. The first private bank was eventually
intervened.

were also affected.

The authorities closed two banks.
Despite the SIB increased reluctance
to provide support, the coverage of

regulatory forbearance, accounting
flexibility and transfer of public sector
deposits to weak banks allowed them
to survive.

1998

The financial situation of the fourth
largest bank deteriorated and its liquidity
dried up while depending increasingly on
public sector deposits.

The bank was closed.

2003

It was mainly a result of fraud in a
medium-size locally owned bank.

8th largest bank with
5 percent of deposits.

The bank was closed.

Among the lessons that can be drawn from the crises:
• An effective banking resolution strategy needs to identify which banks are solvent or insolvent. Supporting
fundamentally insolvent institutions is unlikely to succeed, and even more so if inefficient bank owners
continue running their banks.
• Generous de facto deposit guarantees distort incentives and encourage excessive risk-taking over time.
Guarantees should be limited and accompanied by an effective restructuring plan and otherwise remove the
pressure from the authorities to rapidly resolve the underlying banking problems.
• Defining responsibility. Who bears the ultimate cost, i.e. the Treasury, needs to be clarified upfront in order
to avoid burdening the central bank balance sheet with non-performing assets.
• Private sector lending takes a long time to recover, even if other indicators of bank behavior like
profitability typically recover easily after crises. This is true even from a regional (Mercosur) perspective.1

C. Medium-Term Policies to Sustain Growth and Reduce Poverty
21.
Structural reform agenda. The key medium-term policy challenge facing the
authorities is to return to and sustain the high real growth rates of the past five years, while
further reducing poverty. Discussions focused on creating room in the budget to meet
additional social and infrastructure expenditure needs, strengthening the budgetary
framework, sustaining growth and boosting competitiveness, and on measures aimed at
directly reducing poverty.
22.
Fiscal and budgetary measures. Paraguay has one of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP
ratios in Latin America. Staff estimates that with a combination of tax policy changes and
administrative improvements, the tax ratio could be increased significantly over the medium
term. There are significant weaknesses in the budgetary processes, notably Congress’
virtually unlimited powers to change the entire budget. At the same time, the quality and
structure of public expenditures needs to be improved. Specifically, there is need to curb the
rapid growth of wages and salaries and increase infrastructure spending.
•

Tax reforms. While considerable
progress has been achieved since
2004, additional reforms are
needed to expand the tax base.
The authorities eliminated the use
of VAT credits against the tax on
agricultural income (IMAGRO),
which will impose a fairer burden
on agriculture (the main
economic activity in Paraguay) in
the medium-term.18 In addition,
the personal income tax (PIT)
became effective from January 1, 2009, although its yield will be substantially
affected by extensive exemptions and deductions, and the lack of withholding
mechanisms.19 Other tax policy recommendations are to (i) limit the use of reduced
VAT rates and exemptions; (ii) lower the number of products subject to the excise tax
but at higher rates; and (iii) rationalize the special regime for small taxpayers.
Regarding tax and customs administration, staff suggested the following measures:
(i) submitting to Congress the new tax procedures code; (ii) enhancing audit capacity
on taxpayers; (iii) improving customs control; (iv) establishing HR policies for tax

The current stock of VAT credits can be used to continue offsetting IMAGRO revenues. Given the size of the
stock (around US$250 million), the IMAGRO revenues are estimated to pick up only by 2011.

Congress recently approved a draft law to postpone once again the PIT implementation.

19
and customs administrations; and (v) implementing a comprehensive management
system in tax and customs administration.
•

Expenditure reforms. Public expenditure management and control need to be
improved to increase accountability and reduce the already high fiscal rigidities.
Priority areas on public financial management (PFM) and budgetary framework
include: (i) consolidating all accounts into the “Single Treasury Account”; and
(ii) strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework to better integrate it with
the annual budget cycle.20 A major challenge is the need to limit Congress’ ability to
modify the budget envelope, particularly salaries. In addition, the government should
work on a comprehensive pension system reform that ensures financial sustainability
and improves efficiency and coverage.

•

Budget execution. Staff

recommended renewed efforts
in increasing the execution
rate of the budget, especially
capital expenditures, a key
component of the authorities’

noted that they have

implementation capacity. Staff
also stated the importance of
adopting a comprehensive
public investment system in order to enhance efficiency and accountability of the

Enhancing Growth. The focus should be on reforms that could increase Paraguay’s
growth potential. While in recent years considerable progress has been achieved in
improving the business climate,21 lasting improvements in the operations of the state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) proved elusive. Important reforms that could boost growth include: (i) a
fundamental restructuring of SOEs; (ii) a significant upgrade of infrastructure, especially in
electricity, telecommunications, and roads; and (iii) a strong effort to promote FDI.
•

SOE Enhanced Accountability and Restructuring. Reforms of SOEs should build on
the progress realized by the Consejo Supervisor de las Empresas del Estado (CSEE)

20

For instance, to include recurrent costs of any investment.

21

For instance, increasing the ease of starting a business and the creation of a one-stop export window.

20
and draw the lessons from its shortcomings. In particular, the establishment of an
information system with scorecard methodology—which increased transparency—
was a notable achievement, though it fell short on the provision of reliable financial
data. However, performance of SOEs has not improved. Going forward, staff and
authorities agreed that the focus of reforms should be on: (i) establishing a proper
incentive and sanctioning system; (ii) adopting comprehensive strategic and business
plans for all SOEs, linked to a realistic performance management monitoring; and
(iii) encouraging increased participation of the private sector, such as PPP
mechanisms. Additional efforts will need to be deployed in improving two poorly
performing companies—INC (cement production) and Petropar (oil products).
•

Infrastructure. Paraguay’s economic infrastructure needs considerable upgrades in at
least three areas: electricity, telecommunications, and roads. In the electricity sector,
it is unfortunate that Paraguay, with abundant hydro-electricity, faces power cuts and
lack of capacity for new business projects. There is a serious need to upgrade
transmission and distribution of electricity. Regarding communications, COPACO’s
monopoly in telephone landlines and internet connectivity has led to inefficient
service at high unit costs. Liberalization of the sector, which is quite profitable, would
undoubtedly bring in private capital and improve the quality of services to the public.
The expansion of the feeder road network would improve market access and raise
incomes of rural communities.

•

FDI Promotion. FDI inflows have been relatively limited in Paraguay, compared to
other economies in the region. The country could capitalize on its advantages, such as
relatively cheap real estate and energy, to make more determined efforts to attract
FDI. Despite a very low corporate income tax rate (10 percent), key impediments
have been: weak infrastructure, widespread informality, and perceived low
transparency in the judiciary process, particularly with regard to the respect and
enforceability of contracts.

24.
Social Investment. Growth alone will not be sufficient to reduce poverty
meaningfully. There is need for renewed efforts in addressing shortcomings in health and
education. In the short run, direct efforts to combat extreme poverty are required.
Developments of the past five years show that although growth has helped reduce the overall
level of poverty, extreme poverty rose from 15½ percent in 2005 to 19½ percent in 2007,
mostly due to rising food prices. Staff recommended the significant scaling up to the CCT
program. The program has been quite successful, and has led to a meaningful improvement
on several poverty indicators among the covered population.22 In order to institutionalize and
safeguard the program, it would also be useful to adopt appropriate legislation in this regard.
22

For an overview and assessment of the CCT program, see, Box 3, IMF Country Report 08/268.

21
The authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations and indicated that their medium-term
coverage target is 120,000 households (about 2 ⁄3 of the extremely poor). They also intend to
embark on the construction of low-income housing, and land reform.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Overall. Paraguay is well placed to confront the global financial turbulence and
economic recession, in large part due to the prudent macroeconomic policies pursued in
recent years. Continued fiscal surpluses, which led to a considerable decline the public debt
burden, provide the government with sufficient margin to conduct counter-cyclical policies
until a global economic recovery takes hold. With an appropriately designed an implemented
recovery plan, Paraguay has the capacity to weather the current crisis, supporting economic
activity in the immediate future, addressing social needs, while setting the basis for a return
to sustained and broad-based growth.
26.
Fiscal policy. The government’s plan to support the economy through fiscal stimulus
measures appropriately focuses on public investment and effective social programs to
mitigate poverty, financed by external official resources. To achieve the desired impact, it
will be important to improve public financial management and inter-ministerial coordination
so as to ensure the plan’s timely and effective implementation, especially of the public
investment program. In addition, tax and customs administrations need further improvement
to prevent a deterioration in compliance levels and avoid undesired revenue falls. Finally,
setting the recovery program in a medium-term context would help articulate priorities better,
encompassing an appropriate mix of short-term temporary measures with immediate impact
on employment and growth, and medium-term sustainable programs to develop much-needed
infrastructure and advance the social agenda.
27.
Monetary policy. In part as a result of the weakening import prices, inflation is now
on a firmly downward trend, well within the Central Bank’s target range. Improved
fundamentals have led to renewed confidence in the guaraní and the authorities have so far
reacted appropriately to the adverse economic conditions. Monetary policy has been eased,
and the central bank has injected liquidity into the financial system by retiring sterilization
bills. Close monitoring of developments is key, and the authorities will need to respond
promptly to signs of inflationary or balance of payments pressures.
28.
Exchange rate and external policies. Exchange rate flexibility continues to serve
Paraguay well by acting as a shock absorber in the face of commodity price fluctuations and
strong regional linkages. Staff analysis indicates that as of end-2008, the exchange rate was
broadly in line with fundamentals. While the banking system remains relatively wellsheltered from global turbulences, a tightening of external financing is to be expected. Hence,
the proposed external financing from international financial institutions to cover the fiscal
stimulus would provide much-needed relief.

22
29.
Financial sector. The banking system is solid and staff welcomes recent
improvements of prudential regulations, which should not be diluted. Efforts are required to
improve incentives for medium-term savings, since the lack of long-term domestic funding
constrains banks’ capacity to meet the private sector’s financing needs, while avoiding
directed credit schemes that would only erode confidence. In addition, measures to
strengthen regulation and supervision of cooperatives, insurance and retirement plans are
urgently needed, given the large amounts of funds intermediated by these sectors, and the
risks of contagion stemming from any perceived weaknesses.
30.
Structural Reforms. Staff urges the authorities to continue to make progress in all
areas of the reform agenda. A particular priority is to implement a strategy to strengthen the
central bank balance sheet, since its chronic negative net worth could weaken monetary
policy. Administrative steps have been taken to improve supervision and launch much–
needed reforms of SOEs, but these need to be accompanied by decisive actions to enhance
their efficiency and make them financially viable, removing important bottlenecks in the
productive capacity of the economy. Finally, efforts to improve the business environment
need to be sustained, especially in the area of contract enforceability.
31.
Risks. On the external front, exports would suffer if commodity prices remain
depressed and export demand falls—particularly in the wake of a slowdown in trading
partners affected by tightening credit conditions. Remittances will also be negatively
affected, and foreign direct investment and financing are likely to be lower in 2009–10.
Maintaining a strong reserve position is needed to bolster confidence, especially in view of
the high dollarization of the banking system. On the domestic front, the main risks would
stem from a slow implementation of the recovery plan, which could blunt is effectiveness as
an anti-cyclical tool and erode support for reforms, or the emergence of financial weaknesses
in a cooperative or small bank that might threaten contagion. On the political front, the
fragmentation in Congress might thwart the government’s ability to adopt effective anti-crisis
measures and implement its reform agenda. Pressures from interest groups may also emerge
to backtrack on recent reforms or to increase spending on distortionary or non-sustainable
measures that would undermine macroeconomic stability.
32.
Consultation. The staff proposes that the next Article IV Consultation take place
within the 12-month cycle.

Figure 1. Paraguay: Real Sector Developments
After a strong acceleration of growth in 2007 and early 2008, supported by two record years of agricultural production,
GDP started to decline sharply. The unwinding of supply shocks, which had had a spillover effect into core inflation until
mid-2008, contributed to the decline of core inflation.

APPENDIX 1: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Paraguay’s external and public debt outlook is quite robust to alternative
assumptions for the underlying macroeconomic variables. Indeed, a scenario setting key
variables at their historical averages significantly improves the overall debt dynamics beyond
the baseline. Additional temporary negative shocks to key variables, such as interest rates,
the exchange rate, and GDP growth, would lead to some increase in the level of public and
external debt, but the ratios return to a declining path once conditions normalize.
Public debt levels are quite low and are likely to remain so under various scenarios.
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline from 19 percent to
15 percent. Under the most adverse scenario, the debt level would rise to about 27 by 2014.
The main risks to debt sustainability that are not explicitly considered in the current DSA
framework are a sharper and prolonged decline in GDP growth should the global crisis prove
far worse than expected, and approval by Congress of highly expansionary expenditure
policies.
Similarly, external debt levels remain low and are projected to remain around
20 percent of GDP in the medium term. Paraguay has been conservative in contracting
external debt. Given strong real GDP growth over the past few years, this contributed to a
significant reduction in external debt in 2008 to below 20 percent of GDP from almost
25 percent in 2007. In the coming years, external debt ratio is expected to increase by about
2 percentage points of GDP due to the increase donor financing of public investment and the
below-trend GDP growth as a result of the global recession. In the medium term, debt ratios
will stabilize as growth returns to its trend level. The shock simulations indicate that the
extreme shock would be that of currency deprecation, which would raise the debt to GDP
ratio by about 10 percentage points in the medium term.

APPENDIX 2: FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM AGENDA
The financial system in Paraguay continues to recover after several years of financial
distress. Even in the midst of the global financial crisis, the banking sector remains liquid,
well-capitalized, and profitable, while the growth of deposits and credit to the private sector
remains strong. The authorities continue the implementation of their ambitious reform
agenda, started in 2004, and significant progress has been achieved in several areas,
including strengthening the regulation and supervision of banks and cooperatives, developing
the incipient capital markets, and revamping the payment systems.
Strengthening the Financial Position of the BCP
The authorities intend to implement a new strategy to recapitalize the BCP. The
previous strategy to strengthen the financial position of the Central Bank—the capital need is
estimated at about 6 percent of GDP—contemplated resolving the flow and stock problems
sequentially.1 However, given that the former strategy involved resolving old account
discrepancies between BCP and the Ministry of Finance, it would have been exceedingly
difficult to implement politically.
•

The new strategy involves resolving the stock problem of the BCP by transferring in
several tranches marketable bonds by the 6 percent of GDP needed, regardless of the
pending reconciliation issues, which will continue in parallel. At the end of the
process, the Treasury bonds will replace LRMs in the market. The authorities expect
to send legislation to Congress to this end by end-2009.

Banking Supervision and Regulation
In June 2007 the Paraguayan authorities designed a strategy to improve banking
regulation and supervision, and increase compliance with the Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision (BCPs). The strategy included the following steps:2
•

Approval of amended Resolution 8 on credit requirements, portfolio classification,
and provisioning requirements by September 2007. The resolution was approved and
entered into effect fully in October 2008 (as Resolution 1). This rule established:
(i) stricter information requirements for the granting of loans; (ii) more stringent

1

The strategy contemplated the following steps: (i) increase BCP’s income by a guarantee to cover losses up to
0.3 percent of GDP by transfers from the central government budget; (ii) regularize claims between Central
Bank and Ministry of Finance that are uncontroversial and not subject to legal dispute; (iii) obtain the
certification of the Attorney General the quantification and resolution of disputed claims between the BCP and
the Ministry of Finance; and (iv) once legal clarification has been obtained, write-off nonperforming assets from
the Central Bank balance sheet, and recapitalize the Central Bank with bonds.

2

According to the last FSAP assessment conducted in 2005, Paraguay only fully or partially complied with
20 percent of the Principles.

41
criteria for portfolio classification; and (iii) higher provisioning requirements for the
nonperforming loan portfolio.
•

Implementation of regulations on the opening of financial institutions and credit
risk management practices, and strengthening of the Superintendency of Banks
(SBP) financial risk unit by December 2007. For the first time, the SBP prepared a
draft rule establishing criteria for the opening of new financial institutions and
introducing internal procedures for the analysis of the related applications. The SBP
finalized the regulation on credit risk management practices, which entered into effect
in January 2009, and introduced a generic provision of up to 1.5 percent of the total
portfolio, increasing the provision coverage significantly. The SBP also reinforced its
financial risk unit by increasing the number of professional staff and launching an
active training program.

•

Implementation, by end-2008, of additional regulatory reforms including those
related to the strengthening of on-site and off-site supervision, and the
improvement of financial and operational risk management practices. The SBP also
created a new Financial Stability unit to coordinate the work related to the impact of
the financial crisis. In addition, since end-2008, SBP supervisors are protected legally
by an insurance policy to cover the legal defense costs that the officials may incur.

•

Modification, by end-2010, of the current banking legislation and regulations
(including the General Banking Law, GBL; and the Organic Law of the Central Bank,
OLCB) with a view to increasing the independence, sanctioning capacity,
management capacity, and corporate governance rules of the SBP and strengthening
capital requirements. The authorities intend to send to Congress amendments to the
laws that address these deficiencies in 2009. Congress approval is expected by end2010.

Developing Capital Markets
In February 2008, the authorities adopted a strategy for the development of capital
markets. Key elements of the strategy included: (i) improving the general business
environment; (ii) enhancing the securities market regulation; (iii) and developing market
infrastructure. In order to make the strategy more operational, a number of priority measures
need to be implemented, including: (i) the development of mechanisms for cooperation and
information sharing among key institutions such as the Comisión Nacional de Valores
(CNV), Superintendency of Banks and Superintendency of Insurance; (ii) amend
requirements for rating agencies to facilitate their operations; and (iii) approve the laws
related to payment systems (central security depository, dematerialization of securities, and
clearing and settlement).

42
•

The law amending the requirements for the operation of rating agencies has already
been cleared at the technical level by the BCP, SBP and CNV, and is awaiting
approval in the Senate. The new law will allow for the replacement of the publishing
of the SBP rating system, CAMEL, for ratings by independent firms.3

•

A draft of a formal Memorandum of Understanding for information sharing between
CNV and SBP has been prepared, and is expected to enter into effect in the coming
months.

•

The CNV has received important additional budgetary resources for the 2009 period,
which will allow the institution to increase its staff, provide further training, and
expand and upgrade its technological requirements.

Upgrading the Payments System
The authorities are working on legal and infrastructure improvements to the payments
system. The current payments system in Paraguay is quite weak. The infrastructure for
payments, clearing and settlements of securities remains basic, risky and inefficient; and an
adequate legal framework for settlement, dematerialization, custody, netting arrangement,
repo operations, and electronic transactions is lacking.
•

With IMF and World Bank TA, the government has prepared a draft law to
significantly address these weaknesses. The law, which is awaiting the final approval
of the Economic Cabinet and is expected to be sent to Congress soon, will cover the
legal framework for the Real Time Gross Settlement (RGTS) system, the securities
depository, and the Automatic Clearing House. The law will also formally entrust the
oversight and regulation of the entire payment system to the BCP.

•

At the same time, the World Bank is providing TA and financial assistance to the
BCP to set up the infrastructure for an automated RTGS. The pre-qualification
process for designating a technology vendor will start soon. The BCP authorities have
already provided financial resources for up to US$4 million to complete the project.

Strengthening the Supervision and Regulation of the Cooperative Sector
The authorities are also implementing a number of reforms to improve the regulation
and supervision of financial cooperatives. Cooperatives are steadily increasing their
participation in the financial system accounting for approximately 25 percent of deposits and

3

The legal requirement of publishing the supervisory entity’s own rating of financial institutions was
considered by the 2005 FSAP a practice not in line with international accepted standards (Basel Core
Principles).

43
28 percent of credits by end-2008.4 The “General Regulatory Framework for Cooperatives”,
which entered into effect in 2007, aimed at establishing capital requirements, classification of
loans and provisioning requirements, liquidity requirements, as well as introducing a basic
framework for carrying out effective supervision by enhancing information requirements, insitu and extra-situ supervision. However, an effective supervisory framework is still being
developed, as norms governing the operations of cooperatives are less stringent than those for
banks and finance companies.5 Priorities in this area include (i) strengthening supervision and
auditing regulations; (ii) strengthening the system of statistics and data analysis; and
(iii) enhancing the administrative and operational capacities of the supervisory agency
(INCOOP).
•

By end-2009, the twenty largest cooperatives will report monetary and financial
statistics to the BCP. In the next months, INCOOP and BCP will sign a Memorandum
of Understanding to this end.

•

The authorities are working on the establishment of a deposit insurance fund, which
they expect to be ready by end-2009. The draft law intends to establish a deposit
insurance coverage of 55 minimum salaries or US$14,000—the coverage for banks
and finance companies is of 75 minimum salaries—which will cover approximately
97 percent of the total 620,000 accounts.

•

The authorities have launched a pilot project on a credit bureau. This is expected to be
fully operational by early 2010.

INCOOP has received US$3 million from the IDB for a program of institutional
strengthening that will cover training, technological upgrade, and advice for enhancing
regulation and supervision.

4

Cooperatives have approximately 820,000 associates, with about US$1 billion in credits. The twenty largest
cooperatives (Type A cooperatives) account for about 75 percent of deposits of the cooperatives system.

5

For example, there are no minimum capital requirements for cooperatives, versus a requirement of
US$3 million for banks and US$1.5 million for finance companies; and risk-weighted capital adequacy
requirements are 10 percent for banks and finance companies, whereas cooperatives have a reserve requirement
of 8, 6, and 4 percent depending on their size.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní.
The exchange rate regime is a managed float. The exchange rate is determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market, but the central bank intervenes in the foreign exchange
and monetary markets to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations in real effective terms. The
U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. On May 30, 2008, the average interbank
rate for the U.S. dollar was G4,070

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central
Bank of Paraguay (CBP) is subject to a full safeguard assessment in respect to the
arrangement approved on May 31, 2006. A safeguards assessment of the CBP was completed
in October 2006. The report stated that while the CBP has made some progress in
strengthening the safeguards framework since the 2003 safeguards assessment,
vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting and program data reporting
to the Fund.

ANNEX 2. PARAGUAY—WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
(As of March 31, 2009)
The ongoing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved in December 2003. A new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will be submitted to the Board of Executive Directors for
consideration on 5 May, 2009. The new CPS proposes an envelope of US$500 million for
FY09-FY13 and a rich non-lending program in the Government’s priority areas. The CPS
will be flexible to accommodate changing needs and priorities, and frontloaded to assist the
authorities in addressing the global crisis. Recognizing that governance is at the forefront of
the Government’s reforms agenda, the CPS is focused on improving governance and building
state institution, as well as reducing poverty and enhancing growth. A program for the initial
two years of the CPS has been identified (US$265 million).
At the moment the Bank’s portfolio consists of two projects under implementation:
•

Road Maintenance Project (US$74 million, approved in FY07).

•

Secondary Education Reform (US$24 million, approved in FY04).

Two projects are awaiting effectiveness pending Parliamentary approval:
•

Sustainable Agricultural Development (US$37.5 million, approved in January 2008).

•

Additional Financing for the Community Development project (US$9.0 million,
approved in FY08).

In addition, a Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project for US$64 million is
scheduled for consideration by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on 14 April 2009.
The four World Bank-financed projects presently under implementation or awaiting
ratification by Parliament have a total value of US$144.5 million in commitments, of which
US$119 million remain undisbursed as of March 31, 2009.
In addition to loans, the Bank has mobilized grants for the institutional strengthening of
Congress (US$0.4 million) and the Ministry of Finance (US$0.3 million); for improving the
management of indigenous lands (US$1.7 million); to support social development in two
municipalities (US$0.9 million); to promote development in indigenous communities
(US$1.6 million), and to improve biodiversity and forestry (US$0.3 million from the
Institutional Development Fund and US$0.3 million and US$0.9 million from the Global
Environment Fund). Paraguay has also elected to become a governance and anti-corruption
(GAC) pilot country. On the analytical front, in FY07 the Bank completed a Land Tax Study
and an Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (jointly with the Interamerican Development Bank
and the European Union). A Secondary Education Attainment Assessment and the Policy

ANNEX 4. PARAGUAY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Following a data ROSC mission in January–February 2006, the authorities’ response to the
report and the mission’s recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on June 30,
2006. The country is a GDDS participant.
A. Real Sector
National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA, were
released in 2005. However, no comprehensive regular program for data collection through
economic censuses and surveys exists (an industrial survey was conducted in 2002) and
source data for nonfinancial services, household consumption, and changes in inventories are
insufficient. Major areas of concern include: (i) the 1994 reference year needs to be updated;
(ii) excessive use is made of fixed coefficients for value added and household consumption;
(iii) changes in inventories are obtained residually; (iv) informal activities are not monitored;
and (v) supply and use tables have been compiled only until 1997. While the periodicity of
annual GDP meets GDDS recommendations, timeliness does not because data are
disseminated with a lag of 11 months. An STA mission on the compilation of quarterly
national accounts (QNA) was fielded in August 2007 and August 2008. Production of
definite QNA series would need to await a revision of the national accounts base year and the
compilation of supporting basic data, which are tentatively scheduled for completion by
2009/10.
Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular and
timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a new
CPI index based on the 2005–06 household budget survey. The geographic coverage of the
CPI is limited to Asunción (the capital) and expenditure weights are representative of the
consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI has a base weight period of December
1995 and its basket (150 items) is not fully representative of current national output;
electricity, water, gas, and services are not covered.
Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and quality of
employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. However, frequencies
remain at the annual level, and the publication lag is close to one year. Wage indices are
updated twice a year.
The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector statistics and
constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA. The authorities
have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of the recent
compilation of a new CPI and the production of provisional QNA series.

9
B. Fiscal Sector
The Government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal purposes and for reporting to
WHD are broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual on Government
Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The authorities have not yet prepared a plan to
migrate to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Monthly data are
available for the central administration (budgetary central government). The asset position of
the social security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration
include data of the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the
statistics of the nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations ––four
employer social insurance schemes. These social insurance schemes are treated as financial
corporations in the monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium- and long-term
external debt are reliable and available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available
on request, but need to be fully integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies
remain in recording short-term supplier and commercial credit of the public sector.
Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data reported by the monetary and fiscal
authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting more transparent.
Annual data covering general government for 2006 have been reported for publication in the
2007 edition of the GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no outstanding debt data and no
breakdowns for expenditure by function have been provided for publication in the GFS
Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS.
C. Money and Banking Sectors
Paraguay completed the establishment of a unified compilation and reporting system for the
whole range of monetary data. This new system intends to harmonize monetary data for use
within the BCP, for reporting to STA for publication in IFS, and for operational and
monitoring purposes. A revision of the classification criteria has led also to a marked
reduction in the discrepancies of interbank positions. However, the lack of coverage of the
credit cooperatives remains a matter of concern since they account for around ¼ of deposits
and loans of the banking sector. The BCP, with assistance from STA, plans to include
monthly data of the 20 largest credit cooperatives in the monetary survey during 2009. The
Superintendency of Banks publishes a detailed and informative report on the soundness of
the financial system.
D. External Sector
The classification of the balance of payments and the international investment position (IIP)
follows the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition. Quarterly and
annual data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001 onwards on the
central bank website, and are reported only once a year to STA for publication in the IFS.
Improvements have been made in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially in the
coverage of foreign direct investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions.

10
Special studies by the central bank have improved the estimation methods for remittances of
Paraguayans abroad and unregistered trade transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.
Also, there are deficiencies in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to
register due to Paraguay’s open capital account. An STA mission on Balance of Payments
Statistics assisted the BCP in November 2006 in implementing recommendations of the
ROSC mission. In particular, the mission focused on: (1) assessing the surveys used to
capture data on services, direct investment, nonfinancial private sector portfolio investment,
and other investment; (2) reviewing and updating the statistical techniques used to calculate
unrecorded trade; (3) reassessing the treatment of the binational hydroelectric energy
enterprises in the external sector accounts; and (4) reviewing and preparing a preliminary
template for reporting data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Paraguay
On May 1, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Paraguay.1
Background
The Paraguayan economy performed very well over the past five years, with real GDP growth
averaging about 5 percent a year—the best in a generation. The fiscal position strengthened
considerably, thereby reducing public debt sharply to relatively low levels. The economy grew
by nearly 6 percent in 2008, but growth decelerated in the last quarter of the year. Paraguay’s
macroeconomic outlook has been negatively affected by the deterioration in the global
environment. The agricultural sector has suffered from the decline in commodity prices,
aggravated by the effects of a drought. Economic growth in 2009 is expected to decelerate to
about ½ percent. In part reflecting the weakening global environment, inflation in Paraguay is
now on a firmly downward trend, and is projected at 5½ percent by end-2009, well within the
Central Bank’s target range. The budget recorded a sizeable surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in
2009, mainly on account of good revenue performance and low capital expenditure execution.
However, tax revenue performance during the first quarter of 2009 has been lackluster, in part
due to weak imports. The external current account deficit is expected to moderate to 1 percent
of GDP, largely as a result of significantly lower imports, notwithstanding a decline in exports.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The government has reacted to the adverse economic conditions by adopting an Economic
Recovery plan. This plan, which encompasses policies to address both immediate challenges
and medium-term structural weaknesses, includes: (i) a fiscal stimulus of about 3 percentage
points of GDP in 2009; (ii) steps to provide liquidity to the banking system to enhance lending;
(iii) securing additional external financing from multilaterals (including contingent credit lines);
and (iv) addressing key medium-term structural issues, including with respect to public financial
management and financial sector reform.
The government’s fiscal stimulus focuses on public investment in infrastructure and social
programs, including targeted conditional cash transfers. Its full implementation would be
consistent with an overall deficit of ¾-1 percent of GDP in 2009, expected to be financed by
disbursements from multilaterals and bilateral donors. Key to the success of the recovery
program will be its effective and timely implementation, while transparent monitoring should help
ensure that resources are spent efficiently.
Executive Board Assessment
While Paraguay has been affected by the global economic crisis, as other countries in the
region, Executive Directors observed that the country faces the global downturn from a position
of relative strength. The commendably prudent macroeconomic policies pursued in recent years
have helped build significant buffers to address external shocks. Against the backdrop of a
significant deterioration of the short-term outlook, Directors supported the authorities’ economic
priorities to consolidate macroeconomic stability, implement critical structural reforms, especially
in the financial sector, and strengthen social conditions, with an emphasis on poverty reduction.
Directors concurred that the recent fiscal surpluses and decline in the public debt burden
provide the government with a margin to conduct well-targeted counter-cyclical policies. They
welcomed the authorities’ economic recovery plan aimed at weathering the current crisis, and
advised that the fiscal stimulus be focused on public investment and targeted social programs to
reduce poverty. Directors underscored the need to improve public financial management and
inter-ministerial coordination to ensure the plan’s timely and effective implementation. Given the
revenue shortfalls so far this year, Directors encouraged further improvements in tax and
customs administrations, and recommended that the authorities refrain from granting tax
concessions.
Executive Directors supported the current accommodative monetary policy, given the slowdown
of the economy and the downward trend of inflation. Nonetheless, they recommended close
monitoring of developments to enable the authorities to respond promptly to signs of inflationary
or balance of payments pressures. They encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their
efforts to strengthen the central bank’s balance sheet to improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy. Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate regime continues to serve Paraguay well

3
by acting as a shock absorber in the face of commodity price fluctuations and strong regional
linkages. They noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
Directors underscored the need to press ahead with structural reforms, especially in the
financial and state-owned enterprise sectors. They welcomed the strengthening of the banking
system, while recommending continued vigilance in the face of rapid credit growth. Directors
encouraged the authorities to enhance significantly the regulation and supervision of financial
cooperatives and retirement plans, given the large amounts of funds intermediated by these
sectors. They also saw a need to improve the prudential framework for insurance companies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to finance fully the Deposit Guarantee Fund.
They emphasized the need to address operational and financial weaknesses of state-owned
enterprises, which create significant bottlenecks in the productive capacity of the economy.

Statement by David Vogel, Alternate Executive Director for Paraguay,
and Jose Maciel, Advisor to Executive Director
May 1, 2009
On behalf of the Paraguayan authorities, we would like to thank the staff for a well-written
report, which clearly highlights the country’s robust economic performance and the
challenges lying ahead. After the implementation of two Stand-By Arrangements, the
country now faces the challenge to maintain the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and to
keep advancing towards higher economic and social developments.
General Remarks
Last year’s GDP growth reached 5.8 percent, averaging a 4.8 percent growth over the last
5 years, which is well above Paraguay’s historical growth rate of 3.7 percent per annum.
This outcome was possible thanks to the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies
and structural changes, which have been helped by a positive external environment.
Favorable commodity prices contributed to a great expansion of the agribusiness sector,
which also benefited from exceptional weather conditions. However, the drop in these
prices, together with a severe drought and the decline of the export meat markets due to the
international crisis, has affected the continued expansion of the primary sector. Despite these
unfavorable conditions, modest growth is still expected in 2009.
Presently, economic policies in Paraguay seek three objectives that are fully synergetic: to
consolidate macroeconomic stability over the medium term; to continue the process of
transforming the economy through critical structural reforms; and to significantly boost
social conditions, with substantial emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable groups of
society.
Fiscal Sector
The fiscal results attained in 2008 were remarkable, with a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in
the central government accounts. Tax revenues increased approximately 1 percent of GDP
and current expenditures were adequately controlled. The prudent fiscal policies
implemented in recent years and the relatively low public debt allow the authorities to
undertake a fiscal stimulus plan aimed at coping with the economic slowdown stemming
from the international crisis. In this regard, the 2009 budget includes increases in capital
spending and also higher social spending to finance the conditional cash transfer program in
order to reach 120,000 families. Precisely, the wage bill increase approved by Congress is
largely the result of new personnel hired for health, education and security sectors, areas
where social spending is much needed.

2
Consistently, the Economic Reactivation Plan is the government’s response to the crisis. The
plan has been presented to different economic, social and political actors, with the objective
of gaining social ownership. The overall cost of the plan is projected to reach 2-3 percent of
GDP in 2009-2010. To finance the plan, the government is balancing the use of its domestic
savings and external financing through the IDB, the World Bank, among others. The
authorities are committed to closely monitoring the plan in order to ensure that it is welltargeted, transparent and coherent with the government’s economic and social objectives.
The formulation and implementation of fiscal policy in the recent past have been oriented to
achieve a coherent balance between taxes and public spending. On one hand, a system of
low tax rates has been established, which is broad-based and easy to collect. The Personal
Income Tax is the critical tool to attain the government’s objective of increasing revenues.
However, it was rejected by the Congress that passed a legislation to postpone its
implementation until 2010. The President vetoed the bill and, apparently, there are not
enough votes in Congress to overcome the veto, therefore, the income tax would be finally
operational in Paraguay.1 On the other hand, there has been a great deal of improvement in
tax administration, which has allowed a substantial increase in tax revenues and more
transparency in the system, while critically reducing rent-seeking opportunities. The
authorities are encouraged by the positive results achieved so far, although they are aware
that much remains to be done.
Monetary Sector
Headline inflation reached 7.5 percent year-on-year in December 2008, within the upper limit
of the Central Bank referential range. At end-March 2009, annualized inflation dropped to
3.4 percent as a consequence of the global economic slowdown and thanks to a coordinated
management of monetary and fiscal policies. The authorities concur with the staff’s
projections for inflation in 2009 and 2010 (5½ percent and 5 percent, respectively).
The above-referred inflation outlook has given room to the authorities to react promptly to
the adverse economic conditions. In this vein, monetary policies have been eased and the
Central Bank has injected liquidity into the financial system by lowering reserve
requirements and by decreasing the interest rates of its sterilization instruments.
Financial Sector
The banking system remains solid and has become more stable following improvements in
prudential regulations, notably the adoption of a new rule regarding portfolio classification
and provisioning requirements, which was approved in 2007 but fully implemented by
1

Congress needs an absolute majority of votes to prevail over the veto and confirm the bill.

3
October 2008. The recent strengthening of the financial system and its limited exposure to
foreign banks’ credit had shielded the banking system from the global financial crisis.
Although the projected drop in growth in 2009 could put a strain on the financial sector, as
mentioned by the staff, the authorities believe that the impact would be significantly
contained given the critical improvement in the regulation and supervision of the system. It
is important to recall that recent banking crises in Paraguay, which are very well presented by
the staff in Box 4 of the report, have led to conservative behavior, not only in supervisors, but
also in bankers, who are more cautious when making loans. This also explains the
stabilization of credit, which, starting from a very low base, is currently growing at a much
lower rate than a year ago, as well as the low Non-Performing Loans ratio, which is currently
at 1 percent. In general, the global credit crunch has had a limited impact on the financial
system.
As noted, the regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and finance companies has
been steadily improved since the last FSAP conducted in Paraguay, which has been an
important contribution. Many improvements have been introduced in this area, and presently
the degree of compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision
has substantially increased. During the recent Spring Meetings, the authorities requested an
FSAP update, which is tentatively schedule for the spring of 2010.
The cooperative sector, especially the savings and loans cooperatives, is the main concern of
the authorities and they are taking immediate actions to increase a more effective control on
the sector. In this regard, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
are working together to assist the sector. Recently, the IDB approved a loan to provide
technical assistance to strengthen the supervision and regulation of the cooperatives.
Moreover, this issue was recently discussed by the Economic Cabinet, which created a
National Technical Committee led by the Ministry of Finance to coordinate efforts and
monitor the effectiveness of the resources provided by the IFIs. The authorities have also
required the IMF’s technical assistance on this matter.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD)—created by law in 2003—is funded by banks and the
State. Although there have been some delays, the government is committed to fulfilling its
obligations. The government has already paid $20 million and another $6 million is
budgeted for the present year, according to the schedule of payments approved by the
authorities. Regarding bank restructuring and resolution, the same law that created the FGD
has established the framework for bank resolution, which clearly identifies the
responsibilities in case of troubled banks. In recent years, this framework was successfully
used with the resolution of a finance company.
The implementation of the Payments System is a work in progress. On one hand, the legal
framework is being prepared with the help of IMF and World Bank technical assistance.
Once the Economic Cabinet approves the final draft of the bill, it will be sent to Congress.

4
On the other hand, the Central Bank is going ahead with the acquisition of the technological
equipment with the assistance of the World Bank. According to recent estimates, the system
would be implemented by the second quarter of 2010.
External Developments
After being in a strong position in the first semester of 2008 and despite a weaker global
environment in the second semester, exports registered record levels in 2008. At the same
time, the current account registered a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP at the end of the year.
The guaraní had appreciated by 17 percent annually by September 2008, and the Central
Bank of Paraguay had accumulated record levels of international reserves. The trend shifted
between then and March 2009, and the Central Bank had to intervene in the exchange market
to avoid a sharper depreciation of the currency. Presently, the guaraní is stabilized at around
the same level it was a year ago, and the international reserves at the Central Bank have been
increasing to almost $3 billion, the equivalent to 4¼ months of imports. The authorities
agree with the staff’s appraisal that the guaraní exchange rate is in line with fundamentals.
The projected bill to use international reserves to fund fiscal expenditures, as mentioned in
the staff report, was promptly deactivated by the monetary authorities, who approached
Congress to explain the issue. At present, the draft bill has been withdrawn from Congress.
The new government is firmly committed to resolve the issue of international dispute claims.
The General Attorney of the Republic and the Legal Advisor to the Treasury are working
together to find a resolution to the cases in dispute.
Final Remarks
Paraguay has benefited considerably from Fund programs and its technical assistance. The
authorities consider that the sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms consistent
with the Fund’s advice allow the country to be well positioned to face the current global
crisis. Prudent fiscal and monetary management in recent years permitted a continued
decline in the debt ratio and substantial savings that now give the country the possibility of
implementing a stimulus plan to cope with the declining growth prospects.
The authorities are well aware of the challenges ahead, but they are determined to continue
working towards improving the business climate and promote investment, thus achieving
higher and sustainable economic and social developments. Finally, they would like to thank
the staff and Management for their continuous support and advice, and they are committed to
maintain the ongoing policy dialogue.
