STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. A fundamental improvement of the policy framework over the past decade has
helped Indonesia weather recent crises well. However, there exists room for policy
calibration to address near-term challenges and for policy changes to ensure higher,
sustained, and equitable growth over the longer term. The political cycle is picking up with
presidential and parliamentary elections both expected in early 2014.
Outlook and risks. Growth is projected to ease to 6 percent in 2012 from 6.5 percent
in 2011, as weaker external conditions are somewhat offset by a moderate fiscal stimulus.
However, strong domestic demand, underpinned by robust credit growth, will likely push
inflation to 5 percent by year˗end. Risks to the outlook arise from a possible larger-thanenvisaged slowdown in external demand as well as global risk aversion spikes, and their
impact could be amplified by policy missteps.
Responding to global uncertainty. The moderate fiscal stimulus in the 2012 budget is
appropriate, given weaker external demand. Reducing excess liquidity would improve the
effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy. Increased flexibility of the exchange rate,
combined with judicious use of reserves when warranted, would address market tensions
during bouts of heightened risk aversion.
Enhancing the policy framework. Revamping the monetary policy framework would
help better guide market expectations, while increasing fiscal flexibility would strengthen
economic resiliency. Replacing costly and inefficient energy subsidies with targeted cash
transfers would create room for critically needed increased infrastructure and social
spending. Further steps to strengthen financial sector oversight and the systemic crisis
response framework would help safeguard financial stability.
Improving growth outcomes. A young population and rising inequality call for growth
that is both higher and whose fruits are shared more broadly. This requires better
investment and improvements to the business environment. Maintaining an open trade
and investment regime would ensure that Indonesia remains an attractive destination for
foreign investors.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.

Indonesia’s economic performance has been impressive in recent years (Figure 1). A

fundamental reform of the policy framework over the past decade left Indonesia in a strong position
when the global economy turned sour after 2007. Major macroeconomic policy initiatives this past
decade have included legally enshrining fiscal discipline as well as the adoption of inflation targeting
and a more flexible exchange rate policy. As a result, growth has averaged 5.5 percent
during 2002−11, inflation has declined sharply over the medium term, and public debt has fallen
from around 76 percent of GDP in 2001 to under 25 percent currently. The strong policy framework
ensured that Indonesia came out of the 2008 global financial crisis as well as the initial stages of the
Euro-area problems, much better than its Asian peers. Indeed, at 6.5 percent, economic growth
in 2011 was the highest in 14 years and by mid˗2011, international reserves had nearly doubled from
post-Lehman lows.
2.

Strong fundamentals notwithstanding, Indonesia is being affected by the weakened

global environment. CDS and EMBI spreads have generally remained more elevated for Indonesia
than its peers, suggesting that risk perceptions remain significant despite the strong economic
outcomes. Starting in August 2011, Indonesia has also experienced sharp bouts of capital outflows.
This occurred against the background of a worsening global environment, but also coincided with
some policy developments. Bank Indonesia (BI) significantly lowered its policy rate, allowed market
interest rates to fall below the policy rate, and stepped up purchases of government debt, leading to
a buildup of liquidity. Similarly, inflation expectations picked up early this year in anticipation of a
necessary fuel price hike that, in the event, did not materialize. Some announced changes to the
trade and investment regime have also weighed on investor sentiment. So far this year, the rupiah
has been among the most depreciated of Asian currencies, and inflation has picked up even as
growth has slowed.
3.

The challenge is to build on past policy successes to navigate through near-term

global uncertainties and improve growth outcomes further over the longer run. The first
objective warrants some recalibration of monetary policy and contingency planning. As regards the
longer term challenges, there is pressing need to increase social spending and infrastructure
investment. Steps to improve the business climate, including by maintaining an open trade and
investment regime, and further reforms to the macroeconomic policy framework, would also better
secure strong and high quality growth.

NEAR-TERM MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
With growth easing, but inflation expectations persistent, the policy mix for the baseline calls for an
accommodative fiscal stance as embodied in the FY2012 budget and tighter monetary policy. Should
downside risks materialize, there would be roles for both fiscal and monetary policy, with scope for the
latter somewhat limited by the extensive easing that has already occurred.

A. Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook
4.

Growth is easing on account of the weakened external environment, offset partly by

continuing strong domestic demand, while inflation is picking up (Figure 2). Export volumes
declined by 4.7 percent (y/y) during the second quarter of 2012, while import growth accelerated to
25.3 percent (y/y) during the same period. The latter reflects continued strong investment, which
grew at 20 percent (Q2 y/y), mostly by the private sector. However, part of this is due to a strong
inventory buildup that is unlikely to continue. Robust private consumption and a wider fiscal deficit
have also provided some support to growth thus far. Overall, real GDP growth has eased to
the 6.3−6.4 percent (y/y) range during the first half of 2012 from 6.5 percent in 2011. With external
demand expected to remain weak and inventories to level out, economic growth is projected at
6 percent for 2012 before it picks up again in 2013. Headline CPI inflation bottomed out at
3.7 percent (y/y) in January, but with sequential momentum strong for both core and noncore items,
it rose to 4.6 percent in July. With output at or near potential, inflation is expected to end the year at
5 percent, within the authorities’ target range of 4.5±1 percent.
5.

Financial markets have been unsettled in recent months. Capital outflows prompted

some loss of reserves during the second half of 2011. Both the rupiah and equity markets again
came under pressure during the spring of 2012 when outflows picked up sharply, compounding
pressures on the exchange rate from the weakening current account. Bank Indonesia initially resisted
market pressures, which contributed to illiquidity in the foreign exchange market, with
onshore/offshore spreads widening sharply in early May. Market conditions improved subsequently
after BI increased its sales of foreign exchange, while also allowing the rupiah to depreciate at a
faster rate. During May and June, international reserves fell nearly $10 billion to $106.5 billion
(compared to a high of $124.6 billion in August 2011), but have since stabilized. Long tenor bond
yields increased by 50 bps in May while equities declined by over 13 percent in May−June, though
both have since recovered to their April levels.
6.

There are significant external risks to the outlook, accentuated by domestic factors.

Overall, the financial channel appears more important for Indonesia than global growth or

commodity prices (Box 1). Specific sources of risk include a strong intensification of the Euroarea crisis and a hard landing in China. The former would manifest through the capital
account, where vulnerability lies in high foreign ownership of local currency debt and low
interest rates. Direct trade linkages with Europe are limited, but a hard landing in China could
have a significant impact on the current account (Box 2). Other risks include policy
coordination problems in the event of distress at a domestic financial institution and an
inflation surprise, due to a surge in global food prices.
7.

Authorities’ views. The authorities’ outlook was slightly more optimistic, with 2012 growth

forecast at 6.3−6.5 percent and BI confident that inflation will remain at around 4.5 percent. They
agreed that sizable external risks were posed by both the Euro-area problems and a possible sharp
slowdown in China. They emphasized the interconnectedness of the risks, with the Euro-area problems
spilling over into slower growth in China, which would then have knock-on effects on Indonesia, not
just directly, but also through the impact on other Asian destinations for Indonesia’s exports.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.

Normalizing liquidity would help safeguard continued economic and financial

stability. Surplus liquidity and strong credit growth (26 percent currently) risk adding to price and
exchange market pressures, as well as leading to asset quality deterioration (Figure 3). Increasing the
policy rate does not appear necessary at this stage—staff analysis suggests that monetary
tightening could be achieved by allowing short-term rates to drift back toward the policy rate, which
has been unchanged at 5.75 percent since February (Box 3). In recent months, unsterilized sales of
foreign exchange have helped absorb some excess liquidity, money market rates have risen
30−50 bps and in August BI raised the lower bound of its interest rate by 25 bps. However, a further
gradual withdrawal of excess liquidity would allow money market rates to drift up further and help:
(i) arrest any generalized price pressures; (ii) limit the scope for asset price bubbles to form such as
anecdotal evidence suggests may be a risk in some segments of the property market; (iii) ensure
that credit growth does not accelerate further and cause NPLs to rise too far from current generally
comfortable levels (iv) ameliorate pressures on the rupiah during bouts of global risk aversion by
increasing the attractiveness of Indonesian financial assets for foreign portfolio investors.
9.

Risks to the baseline could be addressed through contingency planning. Bank Indonesia

should be prepared to increase the policy rate if inflation accelerates further. As regards external risks,
there is only limited scope for monetary policy, given the potential adverse impact on portfolio inflows
of lower interest rates, which are already negative in real terms. Nevertheless, if market stress reaches

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Global Spillovers to Indonesia: Risks and Transmission Channels1
There are currently important downside risks for Indonesia arising from abroad. A key question for
policymakers is what the impact on domestic growth would be in the event of these risks materializing. A good
understanding of the transmission channels is also crucial for determining the appropriate policy response.
Staff analysis using extrapolations based on
historical relationships suggest that financial shocks
have a larger impact on Indonesian growth than do
shocks to external growth or commodity prices. A
one standard deviation decline in global growth
(equivalent to 0.6 percentage points) would reduce
Indonesian growth by 0.2 percentage points within a
year, while an increase in the VIX by one standard
deviation (8 points) would result in lower Indonesian
growth of about 0.3 percentage points. The impact of
global growth on Indonesian growth is somewhat lower
than for other Asian economies as expected, given the
greater importance of domestic demand in Indonesia.
Higher oil prices (used here as a proxy for commodity
prices in general) support growth as Indonesia is a
commodity exporter.
The external shocks are transmitted to Indonesia
through the following channels:





Trade channel. A one standard deviation decline in
global growth would lower real exports of goods
and services by about 8 percent (the relatively low
contribution of net exports to Indonesian GDP
explains the moderate impact on GDP growth).
Chinese GDP growth has about one-fifth the impact
of global growth on exports controlling for
commodity prices, roughly commensurate with its
share of exports.
Financial channel. The relatively large impact of the
VIX on domestic GDP growth appears to work
through its impact on net portfolio and other capital
flows, which is highly and immediately susceptible
to global risk aversion (a one standard deviation or
8 point rise in VIX lowers portfolio and other flows
by about $1.5 billion). The financial system has only
limited exposure to Europe and little reliance on
foreign wholesale funding, but contagion would still
occur through a retreat by foreign investors from
local capital markets, especially the bond market
where their presence is large in Indonesia.

Box 2. China’s Growth Pattern: Implications for Indonesia1
China’s rapid growth in recent years has contributed to robust demand for raw materials. Strong growth, together with
the shift in composition toward investment in the 2009 stimulus package, has played an important role in the global
commodity boom. Moreover, China has become an important part of the global supply chain in many manufacturing sectors
such as electronics.

Indonesia has benefited from China’s rise mostly through
commodity trade. Indonesia has not become part of the
Asian manufacturing supply chains, but has emerged as the
top regional resource exporter. The influence from China has
been both through commodity prices as well as production
and export volumes. The effects have been most pronounced
in non˗oil and gas commodities, namely coal, palm oil, and
rubber. By the 2011 peak, global prices of rubber and palm oil
had tripled since 2005, while coal prices had more than
doubled. High global prices have spurred investment in these
sectors across the Indonesian archipelago.



China is now a top importer of coal (about 16 percent of
2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011
global imports), palm oil (25 percent) and rubber
(30 percent). Since 2009, China’s contribution to global
import growth in these commodities has been very high. It is also among the top importers of these commodities from
Indonesia.



For Indonesia, the three commodities together account for about 30 percent of total export value in 2011, ahead of oil
and gas (at about 20 percent). The share was only 13 percent in 2005. Investment has increased capacity and led to
greater production and export volumes. For example, average coal export volumes increased at about 20 percent per year
from 2005 to 2010. As a result, Indonesia has already surpassed Australia as the top global exporter of coal, Thailand as
the top exporter of rubber, and Malaysia as the top exporter of palm oil.

Going forward, a change in China’s growth rate and pattern could have significant implications for Indonesia. A
slowdown in China’s growth would impact on Indonesia through both direct trade and commodity price effects. Given the
importance of commodity exports to China in recent years, a drop in China’s commodity imports could significantly influence
domestic investment and consumption in Indonesia. China’s slowdown would also have an impact on Indonesia’s other major
trading partners, adding to the export volume effects. Also, a shift in China away from investment toward consumption would
also impact on Indonesia through the commodity channel.
Numerical estimates suggest that the impact on Indonesia’s GDP of slower Chinese growth could be significant.



Using current trade projections and assuming similar global price effects on coal and other commodities, as well as
spillovers to other trading partners’ demand as in Ahuja and Myrvoda (forthcoming), suggest significant effects on
Indonesia’s exports. Effects on domestic demand and imports are estimated using empirical relationships for Indonesia
between changes in terms of trade and investment, and imports and domestic demand. This approach shows that the
impact of a 1 percentage point reduction in China’s growth could lower Indonesia’s GDP to up to half a percentage point.
The magnitude of impact could be lessened if investment remained more resilient than historical relationships imply
(e.g., because of increased public investment) or export volume were less affected (e.g., due to Indonesia’s cost
competitiveness in coal production).



This result is consistent with some other recent studies, but the exact magnitude remains uncertain. A recent study using a
factor augmented VAR (Ahuja and Myrvoda, forthcoming) suggests that a 10 percent decline in China’s real estate
investment would shave about 1 percent off Chinese growth. Another analysis employing panel data (Nabar and Ahuja,
forthcoming) suggests that a 4 percent slow down in China’s fixed investment (which would be equivalent to a 10 percent
decline in China’s real estate investment according to Ahuja and Myrvoda) would lead to a 0.4 percentage point decline in
Indonesia’s growth. In the VAR study, however, Ahuja and Myrvoda find negligible impact on Indonesia’s growth of a
slowdown in China’s real estate investment. It could be the case that given Indonesia’s only very recent rapid rise as a
commodity exporter to China, historical patterns are not picking up all the effects on Indonesia in the VAR study.

Box 3. Lending Conditions and Monetary Policy in Indonesia: What Matters?1
Policy interest rates are expected to anchor short-term money market rates that act as benchmarks for
retail deposit and loan rates, which ultimately affect output and inflation. Historically, retail rates have
closely followed the policy rate. Recently, however, money market rates have been allowed to fall well below the
policy rate, although BI still considers the latter to be the main signal of its overall stance. This raises the
question of what matters more for output and inflation: the BI policy rate or short-term lending conditions more
generally, as measured by the spread between the money market and policy rates. This question is of current
relevance when real lending rates have fallen below their historical levels and credit growth has risen sharply.

To explore this question we estimate an extended Global Projection Model (GPM) for Indonesia using
Bayesian techniques. The global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of taking into account both
domestic and global shocks (and uncertainty) as well as macrofinancial transmission mechanisms into the design
of monetary policy. To that end, our model incorporates such global factors, which then allows us to decompose
the importance to monetary policymaking of different types of shocks.
The estimates obtained from the model indicate that the policy rate and its spread with the money
market rate are separately important. Specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in the spread leads to a
0.15 percent change in the output gap, compared to 0.13 percent for the policy rate. Inflation dynamics are
driven largely by supply side and global price developments, with about 40 percent of the dynamics accounted
for by domestic supply and another quarter by global prices. Inflation dynamics are, however, also significantly
influenced by the output gap (a 1 percent reduction in the output gap decelerates inflation by 0.26 percent).
Taken together with the impact of the spread on the output gap, this suggests scope for currently reducing
inflationary pressures by lowering the spread rather than hiking the policy rate itself.
The model estimates and impulse responses shed other important insights for monetary policymaking.
First, there are significant second-round effects of headline inflation on core inflation, with a 1 percentage point
increase in the difference in headline from core leading to a 0.45 percentage point increase in core inflation. This
result is also broadly confirmed by OLS regressions, which shows inflation to be persistent in Indonesia (as does
the Bayesian model). We also find that a measure of interest volatility controlling for policy rate changes (a
GARCH 1, 1 model of JIBOR volatility conditional on the policy rate and itself) has a negative impact on the
output gap. This again highlights the potential benefits of more effectively anchoring short-term market interest
rates to the policy rate.

near˗Lehman levels, BI should ensure ample liquidity in both the foreign exchange and rupiah markets.
10.

Increased exchange rate flexibility, combined with judicious use of reserves when

warranted, would help address market tensions. Foreign exchange shortages can lead to a
downward spiraling of confidence, leading to further pressures on the exchange rate, thereby
creating a vicious circle. The overall external position is strong—reserves are adequate, and
preliminary model estimates from the CGER and pilot EBA suggest that from a medium-term
perspective the real effective exchange rate is moderately undervalued by 0 − 10 percent relative to
fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 4). While allowing the exchange rate to move fully to
reflect trends, interventions to smoothen sharp and temporary supply˗demand mismatches would
help bolster market confidence. A more explicit public statement regarding the primacy of the
domestic price stability over the exchange rate consideration would also be helpful.
11.

Strengthening the monetary policy framework would help better guide market

expectations. Bank Indonesia has formally maintained the policy rate as an indicator of its policy
stance; but in September 2011, it announced a 50 bps reduction in its deposit facility rate on
account of heighted uncertainty in the global financial system and the need to stimulate money
market transactions. Bank Indonesia’s interventions along the entire yield curve through a variety of
instruments have also contributed to uncertainty about the monetary framework. This in turn could
weaken BI’s ability to guide interest rate expectations. Consistent with its inflation targeting
framework, BI could usefully reiterate that its operational target is to keep the overnight money
market rate broadly in line with the policy rate. Bank Indonesia could also rationalize its open market
instruments and refrain from intervening in the secondary market for government paper, except in
cases of extreme market dysfunction.
12.

A more coherent and predictable monetary policy framework, by reducing interest

rate volatility, could benefit investment (Box 5). More effective communication by BI of its policy
objectives would better guide market expectations regarding interest rates. Further, market
conditions will be more stable if BI’s foreign exchange and rupiah operations are both predictable
and supportive of market making by participants. For example, BI’s introduction of U.S. dollar term
deposit facility in response to recent foreign exchange pressures may allow BI to play a larger role in
intermediating foreign exchange liquidity among banks, but could also reduce incentives for
interbank trading. Similarly, while BI has generally kept system liquidity high to address the
segmentation of the rupiah money market, improving the infrastructure and legal basis for the
interbank repo market would provide a more lasting solution. Finally, the heavy interventions

Box 4. Indonesia: External Position
Indonesia’s external position appears moderately stronger than implied by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. Preliminary model estimates from the Pilot External Sector Report suggest that Indonesia’s
medium-term structural current account balance should be a deficit of 2 percent of GDP, compared with the
0.2 percent surplus recorded in 2011. Much of this estimated gap reflects prospective fiscal consolidation in advanced
economies, as well as needed larger domestic social safety nets. The current account is expected to turn into a small
deficit of around 2 percent in 2012 and in the medium term. This deficit would be consistent with the estimated
current account norm as well as with the increase in both public and private investment needed to boost potential
output growth.
This current account deficit would likely be funded by trend growth in foreign direct investment. FDI is
expected to continue as foreign investors should be attracted by Indonesia’s medium-term growth prospects. While
external debt as a proportion of GDP is low, portfolio inflows could remain volatile, given the uncertain global
environment and the high proportion of government bonds held by offshore investors. Capital flow management
measures implemented since mid˗2010 were warranted, and should continue to be accompanied by two-sided
exchange rate flexibility.
Preliminary model estimates indicate that the real effective exchange rate is currently moderately
undervalued by 0−10 percent. However, this undervaluation reflects the nominal depreciation of the rupiah
resulting from portfolio outflows over the past 12 months.



Based on CGER, the REER deviation from estimated equilibrium shows similar results as those suggested by
the CGER during the 2011 Article IV consultation, showing an average of 5 percent undervaluation. The
deviation ranges from 6 percent overvaluation (macrobalance approach, which computes the REER
adjustment needed to close the current account gap), to 10 percent and 11 percent undervaluation (external
sustainability approach, which calculates the REER adjustment needed to stabilize the net foreign asset
position, and equilibrium real exchange rate approach, which derives the deviation from an equilibrium
relationship between REER and a set of fundamentals, respectively).



Based on the preliminary External Balance Assessment (EBA) model estimates from the Pilot External Sector
Report , the real exchange rate appears to be at equilibrium according to the real exchange rate method.1

Current levels of reserves are well above all standard metrics and the IMF’s composite adequacy metric. They
remain in the middle of the range among regional peers. Looking ahead, more flexibility of the nominal exchange
rate, combined with some intervention to provide adequate market liquidity, would be advisable.

Box 5. Investment: Macroeconomic Volatility and Financial Depth1
Rising investment has become a key driver of Indonesia’s recent robust growth and its continuation is important to sustain
growth going forward. This raises the following question: What macroeconomic policy-related variables are important for
determining investment? While attention generally and rightly focuses on the levels of the macroeconomic variables, regression
results suggest that reducing the volatility of interest and exchange rates, as well as capital markets deepening, may also be
important.
Investment has recently performed strongly but there exists
room for improvement. After collapsing in the late 1990s, the
investment-to-GDP ratio recovered very sluggishly, and has only
recently regained earlier levels. Strong recent investment has focused
on the booming mining sector. Infrastructure needs, however,
remains pressing, and the public investment ratio is among the
lowest in the region. To achieve Indonesia’s long-term growth
objectives outlined in the economic master plan, high investment
needs to be sustained. Putting in place the necessary infrastructure,
which is cited as one of the main growth constraints for Indonesia in
numerous business surveys, also calls for substantially boosting
public investment from the current low levels.
At the aggregate level, investment in Indonesia is negatively
correlated with interest rate volatility, exchange rate volatility,
and the real lending rate, while it is positively correlated with
improvements in the terms of trade. Prudent macroeconomic
policies have reduced the cost of capital and the recent high
investment growth is being supported by strong regional demand for
commodities, which has, in turn, strengthened Indonesia’s terms of
trade. On the other hand, continued volatility of exchange and
interest rates has hurt investment. Notably, interest rate volatility is
becoming an increasing factor in affecting investment, as indicated
by the nearly doubling of the magnitude of the coefficient in
regression estimates for the post-2005 period.
Firm level estimation results confirm the important role interest
rate volatility plays in firms’ investment decisions. Regression
equations with firm-level data show that interest rate volatility
negatively affects investment, and confirm that the responsiveness of
investment decisions to interest rate volatility has increased
significantly in the more recent sample period.
The empirical results also point to the importance of continued
financial market deepening and development. Firms’ investment
decisions are highly affected by their internal cash positions, which
suggest that financial markets are not sufficiently developed. Notably,
investment decisions by large firms are more responsive to their cash
positions than smaller firms. This could be an indication that the
current bank-centric financial market in Indonesia is not meeting the
needs of large firms who would typically be expected to rely also on
other capital markets, such as the bond market to raise resources.
However, financial markets in general, and the local currency bond
market in particular, are very thin in Indonesia in regional
comparison.

by BI in the government bond market that have helped to depress yields could deter banks
concerned about the large order flows from taking market making positions.
13.

A permanent solution to strengthen BI’s balance sheet issues would be helpful. The

authorities are currently considering swapping a part of BI’s holdings of nonmarketable,
non-interest-bearing government debt for higher yielding securities. This will help arrest any market
perceptions that balance sheet considerations may impinge on BI’s monetary policy decisions.
However, depending on assumptions about future interest rates, the swap could only postpone the
need for a recapitalization for a few years. Replacing the remaining nonmarketable debt should be
considered, but a more comprehensive reform of BI’s financial relationship with the government, to
cover also issues such as cost-sharing of reserve accumulation, taxation, and dividend distribution,
could permanently strengthen BI’s balance sheet while also limiting scope for political interference
in monetary policymaking.

Authorities’ Views
14.

The authorities are committed to exchange rate flexibility to reflect fundamentals,

with interventions limited to smoothing sharp fluctuations. The tensions that had arisen in the
foreign exchange market in May were anomalous and when they had become apparent, BI had
quickly acted to restore order.
15.

Bank Indonesia is confident that a mix of prudential tools, combined with the

drawdown of excess liquidity that has already occurred to date, would help achieve its
near˗term objectives. Such a policy mix would control potential financial risks, ensure sufficient
credit to sectors that enhance domestic productive capacity, and help meet the inflation target. The
rise in overall credit growth was mostly for investment financing. This would ease any supply˗related
inflationary pressures and underpin sustained economic growth. Further improvements to the
efficiency of the banking system would allow credit growth to continue with little increase in risks,
provided prudential tools were employed to curb excessive credit to specific sectors. With this
objective in mind, BI had recently placed some prudential limits on consumer lending and on
mortgages for high value residential property.
16.

The authorities are, nevertheless, aware that addressing all of their objectives required

some further development and clarification of their monetary policy framework. They
recognize the importance of fleshing out and communicating to the market their evolving policy
framework. The framework would minimize market volatility while retaining low inflation by ensuring
that supply-side constraints continued to ease and also ensure financial stability. The authorities

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

have initiated a review of the monetary policy framework with the objective of eventually
announcing a fully articulated and internally coherent revised framework. A key plank of such a
framework would include macroprudential policies, allowing for a greater mix of tools with which to
balance multiple objectives. Prudential policies could, for example, help to redirect credit across
sectors while interest rates were geared toward ensuring that aggregate credit conditions remained
appropriate to maintain growth in productive capacity and toward meeting inflation objectives.
17.

The authorities underscored the link between interest and exchange rate volatility and

inadequate financial market development. They recognize well the unintended consequences for
market development of their interventions and choice of policy instruments. Such tradeoffs had,
however, been necessary. For example, large foreign participation in the market for central bank bills
had been associated with excessive volatility that had led them to replace the bills with nontradable
bank deposit facilities. The authorities ascribe the high volatility to the generally thin financial
markets in Indonesia. Money supply and credit were very low in Indonesia in international
comparison and other capital markets relatively thinner (Figure 4).

C. Fiscal Policy
18.

The moderate stimulus embodied in the 2012 budget is appropriate, given the

downturn in external demand, but expenditure composition is not ideal. The 2012 deficit is
expected to rise to 1.8 percent of GDP, up from 1.1 percent in 2011, but still under this year’s budget
ceiling of 2.2 percent of GDP. An upward adjustment of subsidized energy prices was proposed by
the government for this year in April, but put off by parliament unless oil prices exceed a revised
higher threshold. Phasing out energy subsidies to provide room for raising public infrastructure and
social expenditures, as previously recommended by the Fund, remains a priority in the view of the
staff. The postponement of the price adjustment will boost energy subsidies to 3.5 percent of GDP,
compared with the 2.6 percent of GDP in total allocated to all of development spending. The impact
on overall expenditure growth will likely be limited by the under spending on other items, including
public investment. Also, budgeted cash payments to compensate for fuel prices increases will
provide some savings if a price adjustment is not implemented.
19.

If external risks materialize, any sizable and prolonged economic slowdown should be

addressed by the budget, given the limited scope for further monetary easing. Additional
discretionary spending would be the best channel, given weak automatic stabilizers and the higher
growth impact of expenditures, particularly capital spending. Ideally, a list of infrastructure projects
that could be quickly ramped up could be prepared, but given expenditure execution constraints,

other avenues for injecting fiscal stimulus, such as direct cash transfers, may also need to be
considered.
20.

Sufficient buffers exist to mitigate any short-term disruption to market financing. The

government has secured $5 billion contingent financing from the World Bank and bilateral partners.
In addition, the government has cash balances of over 2 percent of GDP. By comparison, the
government’s gross financing requirement for 2012 is around 3 percent of GDP.
21.

Increasing fiscal flexibility is a priority. By and large, fiscal policy has not been

countercyclical in Indonesia, whereas enhancing fiscal flexibility to maintain growth stability is
increasingly important in a volatile global
environment. Given that public debt has fallen

22.

Authorities’ views. The authorities are confident that there exists sufficient scope to use

fiscal policy to offset growth risks, should they materialize. The budget for this year includes
provisions allowing government to ask parliament for speedy authorization to modify and increase
spending if growth and unemployment indicators deteriorate. They also saw scope for expediting
some infrastructure investment, in particular in east Indonesia.
23.

The authorities emphasized room to increase fiscal flexibility within the existing fiscal

framework. While a reassessment of fiscal rules could be considered eventually, there existed
significant space under the existing 3 percent of GDP legal limit on annual deficits, to enhance fiscal
flexibility by reducing rigidities in the expenditure framework and increasing revenues. In the area of
expenditure, the main priority remained to address energy subsidies. There also existed room to
raise resources by increasing the tax intake, particularly from the natural resource sector. Overall,
both revenue and expenditure reforms, by making the budget more nimble, could strengthen the
authorities’ abilities to respond to shocks.

D. Financial Sector Stability and Supervision
24.

The banking sector is sound, but warrants continued monitoring. Indonesia stands out,

regionally and internationally, in strengthening corporate and financial sector balance sheets
(Figure 5). Furthermore, banking system asset quality remains satisfactory and banks currently
remain profitable and well capitalized, with the capital to risk weighted asset ratio at 16 percent.
However, going forward, rapid loan growth could adversely impact both loan quality and capital
ratios. Aggressive expansion by banks into lending to small and medium enterprises with limited
credit histories and developments in the property market warrant especially continued close
monitoring.
25.

Bank Indonesia monitors financial stability regularly and good progress is being made

to meet Basel III requirements. Recent stress tests have analyzed the spillovers from Europe using
various scenarios related to both the trade and funding channels. The results showed that larger
banks had sufficient buffers to withstand severe shocks, but several smaller banks could experience
declines in capital levels below 8 percent. Banks in Indonesia are expected to meet the capital
requirements associated with Basel III, but a number of borderline banks may require special
attention. The authorities are also aware of the impact of credit growth on capital and have noted
that banks will need to start formulating ways to increase their capital soon.
26.

The authorities have taken several important steps recently to strengthen financial

stability. These include: (i) passage of the Financial Services Authority (OJK) law, with the objective
of gradually transferring responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking, insurance,
capital markets, pension funds, and other financial institutions to the new entity, to be completed by
end-2013; (ii) establishment of a high level forum for coordinating financial stability; (iii) finalization
of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among all entities currently responsible for financial
stability; and (iv) the drafting of a revised Financial System Safety Net (FSSN) law.
27.

It will be important to address gaps to ensure a smooth transition and finalization of

all the above initiatives. Maintaining proper oversight of the supervisory and regulatory functions
during the OJK transition is critical. Clarification of certain provisions of, or amendments to, the laws
in line with the recommendations of previous Fund technical assistance will also be necessary. For
example, the OJK law introduces the concept of a macroprudential policy framework, but does not
clearly define the roles or responsibilities for BI or OJK in this area. Similarly, the FSSN draft law
provides for differential treatment of solvent and insolvent institutions without defining solvency.
More critically, as the legislation is still pending, an operational safety net is not yet in place to
support the effective management of a systemic crisis. Also, the MOU does not specify the roles and

responsibilities of each agency during normal or crisis times, which could lead to decision-making
challenges.
28.

In June 2012, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) warned that Indonesia had not

made sufficient progress in addressing identified AML/CFT deficiencies. The deficiencies focus
on the incomplete CFT legislative framework. A draft CFT law is expected to be discussed by
parliament this September, and the prompt passage of this law could prevent potential AML/CFTrelated sanctions and blacklisting.
29.

Authorities’ views. Both the Ministry of Finance and BI recognize the importance of

ensuring that gaps do not arise during the transfer of all of their existing supervisory responsibilities
to the OJK. They emphasized that they had been careful to select highly qualified and experienced
staff for the new agency, which should ensure a smooth transition. As regards the financial sector
safety net, a temporary government decree with broadly the same features as the FSSN law could be
promulgated in the event of a crisis if the law is not yet in place in time. The authorities were
confident that the CFT law would be adopted as scheduled, but meanwhile planned to dispute the
FATF conclusions.

SECURING SUSTAINED AND EQUITABLE GROWTH
A young population, relatively high youth unemployment, and rising inequality call for growth that is
resilient and whose fruits are shared more broadly. Better investment (physical and human), a
strengthening of the macroeconomic policy framework, and improvements to the business
environment, can help achieve these objectives.

A. Medium-Term Outlook
30.

Growth could exceed the recent high of 6.5 percent with the right policies and

provided global economic conditions remain broadly favorable over the medium term.
Indonesia is reaping the benefits of a demographic
dividend, investment in relation to GDP has now
recovered to the levels seen in the mid˗1990s after a
long and very sluggish recovery, and low public debt
provides ample room, in principle, for increasing
social and infrastructure spending. Indonesia’s
external position is also moving toward its
medium˗term equilibrium. The emergence of modest
current account deficits over the medium term is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

consistent with its demographic profile and increase in investment needed to boost potential output
growth. Prospects for continued strong foreign direct investment to finance the deficits are
enhanced by its strong macroeconomic fundamentals.
31.

Achieving improved growth outcomes will, nevertheless, require further initiatives.

Despite strong growth, income inequality has been
rising (Box 6). Investment in physical capital remains
sensitive to financial market volatility and its
composition is an issue. In particular, there exists
significant room to increase infrastructure investment,
which has been identified by numerous business
surveys as a major constraint in Indonesia, while staff
analysis suggests it can make growth more inclusive.
Maximizing the long˗term benefits of the current
transitionary demographic dividend also requires greater investment in human capital. Indonesia’s
labor force has been expanding more rapidly than its population. Today, 45 percent of the
population is under 25, and the average age of the working population is currently 30−34. However,
this demographic dividend will crest in the next decade, as the working population ages, and
by 2035, Indonesia will have an aging ratio close to that of Japan in the early 1990s. However, social
indicators are currently weak, with infant and maternal mortality among the highest in the region,
and public investment in health and education very low in international comparison (Figure 6).
32.

Authorities’ views. The economic Master Plan, unveiled in 2011, recognizes the need to

strengthen investment in both infrastructure and human capital formation. The plan aims to
transform Indonesia into one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2025. The hope is that the
strategy will raise living standards, lift millions out of poverty, and greatly expand access to
education and health care. The plan targets investments of $468 billion over 2011−15, of which
nearly half will be in infrastructure.

Box 6. Indonesia: Income Equality, Infrastructure, and Education1
Despite robust growth and significant reduction in absolute poverty, Indonesia’s income inequality has
risen during recent decades. Is there a role for infrastructure and education, both priorities in the authorities’
economic Master Plan, in arresting this trend? An empirical cross-country study indicates that the answer
is “yes.”
With impressive growth, Indonesia’s poverty rate
has declined, but like in many other parts of the
world, income inequality has been increasing.
The percentage of the population living under
$1.25 per day has declined from 48 percent to
18 percent during 1999−2010. However, the latest
rural and urban Gini indexes are higher than those
in 1999. The income share of the richest quintile has
also risen while that of the lowest quintile has fallen.
A defining constraint in Indonesia is infrastructure.
Basic infrastructure quantity and quality indices
capturing information in three key infrastructure
sectors—communication, power, and road network for
76 advanced and emerging market economies
during 1980−2010, created as part of the study—show
that Indonesia continues to lag regionally in both the
quantity and quality of its infrastructure.
Regression results confirm the value of
infrastructure and education spending in reducing
inequality. The regressions, which include a set of
standard control variables, indicate that both the
quantity and quality of infrastructure have
internationally had a significant positive impact on
income equality. Infrastructure and income
distribution may have two-way causality. Income
inequality could prevent the poor from accessing
infrastructure services, while at the same time
inadequate infrastructure may worsen income
inequality. To overcome this endogeneity problem,
both infrastructure indexes enter the regressions with
one lag.
The results also reinforce the importance for
income distribution of increasing the share of
formal sector employment in Indonesia.
Specifically, the higher the share of employment in
industry is, the more equal is income distribution.

B. Macroeconomic Policies to Foster Stable and Inclusive Growth
33.

Fiscal reforms to increase capital investment remain a priority. Budget execution still

represents a challenge. While capital spending is increasing in absolute terms, only 80 percent of the
budgeted amount was executed in 2011, with about half disbursed only in the last two months of
the year. Measures taken to improve capital execution have not fully brought about the anticipated
results—in the first half of 2012, only 19 percent of budgeted capital spending was disbursed, a
pattern broadly similar to previous years. The government has taken several other recent steps to
improve the implementation of infrastructure projects. A new procurement regulation has been
adopted and budget preparation and payment processes streamlined. However, project
development and preparation still remain significant bottlenecks.
34.

Government schemes to facilitate infrastructure investment have met with limited

success but remain promising, provided fiscal risks are well monitored. The public˗private
partnership (PPP) program is being held back by weaknesses in project selection and preparation,
especially at the local government level. A government guarantee fund for PPPs has been set up
with the aim of ring fencing fiscal risks. But its current low capital and the continued potential
involvement of the budget to provide guarantees beyond the scope of the fund pose some fiscal
risks. The budget would need to provide room for further capital infusions into the fund over the
medium term. As regards purely private infrastructure investment, a critical constraint is land. The
land acquisition law approved in late-2011 could be an important means for unlocking this
bottleneck now that the presidential decree on its implementation has been issued. However,
administrative regulations still need to be finalized and further reforms in the area of land will be
required to ensure that land titles are clear.
35.

As debt continues to decline, there may be scope to increase the deficit to allow for

greater social and investment spending. Under the current baseline, public debt is projected to
decrease to 17.6 percent of GDP by 2017. However, due to constraints in expenditure execution, the
existing deficit ceilings have not become binding yet, suggesting that focus in the near term should
remain on improving execution.

Authorities’ Views
36.

The authorities agree that spending execution, particularly in investment, remains a

challenge, but are hopeful about the efficacy of recent initiatives. The decentralized fiscal
structure in Indonesia imposed significant coordination challenges. Nevertheless, even if capital
execution rates in relation to budgeted amounts had not significantly improved, the absolute
volume of investment spending had been increasing significantly due to the reforms undertaken to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

date. Additional measures about to be adopted to streamline procurement would further ease
bottlenecks. As regards the PPP program, the authorities acknowledged that progress had been
weak despite seven years of trying, but that with one major successful example in place now to
serve as a model for future projects, progress would be accelerated.
37.

The authorities were of the view that considerations to increase the deficit ceiling

should only be taken up at a later date. The issue would only be relevant once the composition of
current spending and the execution of capital spending improved and the deficit ceilings became
binding. An important means of increasing social and investment spending in the medium term was
to address the issue of energy subsidies, which was recognized in the authorities’ roadmap.

C. Deepening Financial Markets
38.

Financial deepening will be key to mobilizing domestic savings to fund both private

and public investment, as well as providing a greater range of financial products. Low bank
credit reflects, in part, the continued aversion to debt since the 1998 financial crisis. In particular,
most firms, especially in the dynamic resource extraction sector, choose to finance investment
through retained earnings. There is anecdotal evidence that a significant proportion of resident
savings are intermediated offshore. The contractual savings sector has yet to take off, due to low
levels of formal employment, along with the lack of enforcement of existing pension requirements.
Insurance and investment funds have grown from a small base, but do not contribute significantly to
the pool of domestic long-term savings.
39.

Promoting financial sector development requires a comprehensive strategy based on a

well˗sequenced set of measures. One of the initial priorities should be to facilitate the
development of the money and secondary government bond markets. This could provide better
benchmarks for long-term financing, and promote market-making activities. Another key pillar
would be expanding the supply of long-term savings through the growth of the pension and mutual
funds industry, which would depend a great deal on the design of the expanded social insurance
schemes. Demand for credit will benefit from overall improvements in the business climate that
would encourage firms outside the resource sector to seek external funding for new investments.
40.

Authorities’ views. The authorities are extremely keen to develop and deepen financial

markets. The key challenge was deciding on the appropriate sequencing of reforms. They welcomed
technical assistance from the Fund in this regard.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

D. Labor Markets and Social Protection
41.

Labor reforms and increased social spending would help unlock more equitable

growth. On the surface, Indonesia compares well to its peers in creating employment, at least in
relation to population growth. However, youth unemployment rates are among the highest in the
region and much of the employment is in the informal sector, which is less efficient and masks some
underemployment. Reforming Indonesia’s labor laws, which are relatively rigid in international
comparison, would help create greater formal and youth employment. Improved public spending on
infrastructure, health, and education would also better equip the young for the formal labor market
and lead to more equitable growth.
42.

Strengthening social protection is very much on the authorities’ radar screen. The

current social protection system has two elements. The first is a targeted cash transfer program and
the second a contributory social insurance program for civil servants and formal sector employees.
Although participation is mandatory in the latter, evasion is high and coverage is very low. The
National Social Security System (SJSN) Law, when implemented, will provide a comprehensive and
radical reform to the system. The law, approved in 2004, creates five social security programs: health
insurance, employment injury, pension, old˗age savings, and death benefits. Importantly, the new
system will cover the entire population, including in the informal sector. The law requires the
establishment of administrative bodies for the new programs. Following the passage of the law on
the Social Security Administrative Body (BPJS) in 2011, two administrative bodies will be set up:
(i) BPJS Health, managing the health fund; and (ii) BPJS Employment, managing the other four funds.
Both bodies will be established by transforming current insurance schemes and the transformations
are required to take place by 2015.
43.

Further steps are, however, required to implement the new social security system. The

benefits provided by, and contribution rates to, the system will have to be determined. If they are
set inappropriately, the state might incur substantial contingent liability. All formal and informal
sector workers will have to be registered and assigned identification numbers. It is, as yet, unclear
how collection of contributions will be managed, especially for informal sector workers.
44.

Authorities’ views. The authorities underscored their continuing commitment to

implementing the social security reforms. They agreed that benefits and contribution rates would
need to be set in a way that ensured the continued soundness of the fiscal position. They noted that
the timetable for the reforms allowed sufficient leeway to gradually roll out the new schemes, with
due attention to all the implementation challenges.

E. Business Climate
45.

While progress has been made, there exists scope to further improve the business

environment. Indonesia has improved its position in the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness index (CGI). At 46th, its current rank is supported by its strong macroeconomic
environment (23rd, up from 89th in 2007), but infrastructure, institutions, and security remain weak.
These weaknesses are also echoed in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, where Indonesia’s
overall ranking was less favorable. Constraints identified there included access to electricity,
resolving insolvency, and contract enforcement. Concerns about the business environment are also
prominent in the mining community, with mineral extraction companies according Indonesia a
relatively weak international ranking (in particular, as regards the stability and predictability of the
tax regime) in a recent survey. Finally, the 2010 FSAP noted that weaknesses in the legal and
governance framework, including the lack of creditor rights, had undermined investor confidence.
46.

A number of trade and investment measures announced in recent months have

weighed on investor sentiment. These measures can broadly be divided into five categories:
(i) export restrictions and taxes on raw resources; (ii) tighter import licensing requirements,
quantitative limitations, and pre˗shipment inspections; (iii) requirements for majority stake
divestment by foreign mining companies; (iv) point of entry restrictions on some imports; and,
(v) single ownership limits on commercial banks. Many of the measures contain exceptions to their
applicability, which limits their economic impact. The mining divestment regulation does not apply
to existing companies and the single ownership regulation for banks is applicable to existing
shareholders only in banks that have weaker financial and corporate governance ratings. Overall,
coordination appears lacking as some of the implications of the measures may not have been fully
thought through (for example, increasing mineral processing on shore would require a substantial
increase in electricity generation) and the unintended consequences of some of the other measures
(such as on points of entry) have led them to be subsequently postponed or amended.
47.

Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledged that they faced a number of challenges in

effectively communicating the motivations behind some of their recent initiatives. There was a need
to increase value added in Indonesia as continued reliance on simply exporting raw materials would
not create the types of jobs necessary to improve living standards. The banking regulation was
aimed at improving corporate governance and did not limit acquisition of domestic banks by strong
foreign banks. The authorities were indeed in the process of renegotiating some mining contracts,
but only to ensure a more equitable distribution and in a manner that respected the sanctity of
contracts. Furthermore, there were domestic policy coordination challenges in a very diverse and
vocal democracy that had led to, or necessitated, some of the initiatives. The authorities had

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

introduced the measures in a manner, or were working through them currently, to ensure that
Indonesia’s external commitments continued to be fully respected.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.

In terms of its fundamentals, Indonesia is in a strong position from which to navigate

through current global macroeconomic uncertainties. Its reliance on domestic demand as a
driver of growth provides a floor to the risks represented by a possible significant global economic
slowdown. Its corporate and financial sector balance sheets are healthy and, following the exemplary
reduction in public debt achieved over the past decade, there currently exists enviable fiscal space to
support growth, if necessary. The recently weakening external current account is a natural and
desirable consequence of its movement toward the long-term equilibrium implied by Indonesia’s
fundamentals and desirable policies.
49.

Risk perceptions, however, remain elevated, underscoring the importance of

addressing policy uncertainties going forward. Recent spikes in global risk aversion have
impacted on Indonesia, with reserves declining by nearly 15 percent from the August 2011 peak.
Inflation expectations have also picked up sharply. To a large extent, global factors lie behind these
developments but domestic policies have also played their part. Easy monetary conditions have
amplified the impact of capital outflows. Similarly, lack of timely adjustments to subsidized fuel
prices have resulted in suppressed inflation when global commodity prices recovered. If not
managed carefully, the transition to a unified financial supervisor may raise financial vulnerabilities,
especially if the passage of effective FSSN legislation is delayed. The announcement of a number of
trade and investment related measures have also led to some questioning of Indonesia’s continuing
commitment to an open trade and investment regime.
50.

Bank Indonesia is encouraged to normalize liquidity. This would help arrest incipient

inflation and financial sector risks from building up and will also bolster resiliency to spikes in global
risk aversion by ensuring that Indonesian financial assets remain sufficiently attractive to investors. In
the staff’s view, the current conjuncture calls for reliance on the traditional tools of monetary policy,
as prudential measures aimed at specific sectors will not tackle the underlying condition of easy
money—limits on any specific sector will only lead to pressures elsewhere in the broader economy.
51.

Expeditiously completing the review of the monetary policy framework would be

helpful. This would help better guide market expectations and thereby enhance BI’s ability to
influence financial market conditions indirectly and in a way that better nurtures financial market

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

deepening. Moreover, by reducing volatility stemming from uncertainty regarding BI’s policy stance,
this could provide more support for private investment than policies to boost lending to specific
sectors.
52.

It will be critical to address remaining gaps and inconsistencies during the

implementation of planned financial sector reforms. Maintaining proper oversight of the
supervisory and regulatory functions during the OJK transition will require close coordination by
relevant agencies. Most critically, an FSSN law amended to take account of previous Fund
recommendations should be adopted as soon as possible to provide a sound legal framework for
the effective management of a systemic crisis.
53.

The authorities’ continuing commitment to exchange rate flexibility is welcome. The

exchange rate is moderately undervalued from a medium-term perspective, but continued two˗way
flexibility of the rate is a critical tool in the authorities’ arsenal to address external risks. The
authorities are also advised to pay close attention to conditions of foreign exchange market
liquidity, as illiquid conditions can significantly damage market confidence and hence give rise to
perceptions of risk when fundamentals, such as the level of reserves and the growth outlook, do not
warrant them.
54.

Continuing with fiscal reforms should remain a priority. There is ample room to improve

both the composition of fiscal spending and its execution. As recommended previously, costly and
inefficient energy subsidies could be replaced with direct cash transfers to the vulnerable. This
would create greater fiscal room to spend on pressing infrastructure, health, and education needs. It
would also enhance economic equity. Reforms to streamline and expedite budget execution
processes have led to increases in absolute amounts of government capital spending and should
continue.
55.

An open foreign trade and investment regime remains important. While it is

appropriate for Indonesia to seek to move up the value chain, it would also be important to do so in
a manner that preserves the attractiveness of Indonesia as a destination for foreign trade and
investment. The authorities are encouraged to develop a coordinated framework that balances their
industrial policy considerations with economic openness. In this regard, their continuing
commitment to Indonesia’s external obligations, such as under the WTO process, is welcome.
Moving up the value chain should occur naturally as Indonesia builds up its comparative advantages
outside the resources sector with greater investment in human capital, reduction in the costs of
doing business, and deepening of financial markets.

Persevering with structural reforms will yield significant dividends. The authorities have

an economic master plan that is well targeted at some of Indonesia’s growth constraints. Increasing
the rate of growth and making it more equitable will require reforms to the labor market and the
business climate. Changes to the social security regime, as planned by the authorities, will better
protect the vulnerable.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard





Medium
Another bout of global risk aversion.
This could be triggered by European
policy slippages, political uncertainties
or a tail risk event of a disorderly exit of

Bank deleveraging and fiscal austerity
would depress activity in the Euro-area
more than envisaged

Expected Impact of Risk






2. China’s hard




3. Inflation surprise


Medium
Marked slowdown of investment
coupled with weak external demand
could lead to a hard landing in China
The Chinese authorities will likely try to
mitigate the risk through monetary and
fiscal stimulus as well as continuous
attempt to rebalance the economy
toward consumption
Low
Food price spike possibly due to
harvest cycle and food import timing

Low
Failure of a small or medium-sized bank
that does not have much liquidity and





Medium
Financial channel is expected to
dominate through capital outflows as
global risk aversion rises.
Weaker global growth would reduce
exports and FDIs, lowering Indonesia’s
growth
With a small export sector, direct trade
impact on the economy is not
expected to be large
Small direct exposure to EA banks
limits damage from bank deleveraging
High
A sharp fall in commodity prices as well
as commodity demand from China
would affect Indonesia’s growth
through lower export earnings,
investment as well as FDIs in the sector
The demand for Indonesia’s main
commodities may not be as much
affected as those associated only with
Chinese investment (i.e., metal)
Medium
A possible sell-off in the bond market,
leading to a yield spike and weaker
rupiah
Improved food import policy helps
mitigate the impact
Medium
A bank failure (and a messy resolution)
could damage consumer and investor
confidence in the capacity of the
authorities
The authorities are aware of the
resolution implications

Recommended Policy Responses









Fiscal stimulus is the preferred route
given the room
There is less scope to reduce policy rates
from the current low levels




BI should tighten monetary stance
Policies should aim to eliminate supply
bottlenecks



Close coordination by relevant agencies
to ensure effective supervision is
maintained during OJK transition. A
prompt passage of the financial safety
net law is needed
Emergency protocols should be
developed in the absence of the law
Contingency plans should be formulated
for recapitalization or intervention




1

Exchange rate should be allowed to
move flexibly to absorb shocks, but the
authorities should not shy away from
foreign exchange intervention in the thin
and volatile market
BI to be ready to ensure ample liquidity
in both foreign exchange and rupiah
markets Emergency liquidity support
should be available for viable banks
Fiscal stimulus could be used if downside
risk on growth is persistent

This IMF reflects staff views on the sources of risks and the overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities. The risk assessment matrix shows
relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline path, which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff. Staff’s subjective
assessment of the relative likelihood among those low probability events is noted in the matrix (ranging from “low” to “high”) is consistent across different country reports
prepared in a given period.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

APPENDIX II: INDONESIA—PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Public Debt
Public sector debt has been declining as a share of GDP since 2000 despite the global shock in 2009.
The ratio fell to a record-low level of 24.5 percent in 2011 (Figure II.1) owing to prudent fiscal
management and low fiscal deficits in the last decade. Lower interest rates and high real GDP
growth also contributed to debt consolidation. Foreign-currency debt has fallen to less than half of
total debt, as the improved fiscal position facilitated government access to the domestic capital
market.
The baseline scenario projects a further moderate decline in public sector debt. Despite a larger
fiscal deficit, public debt is likely to fall to about 23.5 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting robust
economic growth. In the medium term, continued low levels of fiscal deficit and strong economic
growth will support a further decline in public debt to 18 percent of GDP by 2017. Such a strategy
will accommodate extra resources for development spending and deliver a small primary deficit
around 0.8 percent of GDP.
Public debt is sustainable and robust to macroeconomic and oil price shocks. All the standard stress
tests suggest that the debt ratio is likely to remain modest even under shocks from contingent
liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, and higher interest rates (Figure II.1). Fiscal contingent
liabilities amounting to 10 percent of GDP could raise the public sector debt to 24.5 percent of GDP
by 2017 (at the 2011 level), while currency depreciation of 30 percent would raise the debt ratio to
about 21.5 percent of GDP. An increase in real interest rates would have a smaller, but still sizable,
effect with the debt ratio reaching 21 percent by 2017. Other macroeconomic shocks have an even
more limited impact.

B. External Debt
Indonesia’s external debt continues on a steady downward trend, after a temporary increase in 2009.
Following a decade of a continuously improving external position, the sharp nominal depreciation of
late 2008 and early 2009 temporarily led to an increase in the external debt-to-GDP ratio from
30 percent to 32 percent. However, strong growth and the rapid turnaround in the exchange rate
are quickly reversing this increase, with the ratio projected to reach about 26 percent of GDP
by 2012 (Figure II.2).
The baseline scenario projects external debt to continue on a declining path over the medium term,
reaching 19 percent of GDP by 2017. A weakening current account balance—projected to just under

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

3 percent of GDP by 2017—is expected to be more than offset by: (i) sustained high real GDP
growth in the range of 6−7 percent per year; (ii) increasing non-debt-creating (i.e., FDI) flows; and
(iii) some further real appreciation. At -2.5 percent of GDP, the medium-term noninterest current
account balance would remain comfortably above the debt-stabilizing level (-3.6 percent of GDP).
External sustainability is robust to most shocks. The external debt ratio is expected to follow a
declining path, and remain at manageable levels, under all standardized-shock scenarios. A one˗time
30 percent real exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact, raising the debt ratio by
10 percentage points in 2012, and 4 percentage points over the baseline by 2017.

1/ Coverage of public sector debt consists of the gross debt of the central government.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

APPENDIX III: INDONESIA—TRANSITION TO GFSM 2001
The presentation of central government operations in the main text of the staff report is currently
compatible with the national presentation of the budget. The accounting of government operations
in Indonesia is on a cash basis, covers only the central government and is, therefore, not fully
compatible with the GFSM 2001 format. To ensure the comparability of IMF staff projections with
the authorities’ forecast, the staff report table is in the same format as the budget presentation.
However, to promote international comparability of government operations, preliminary data
consolidated to the general government level in a GFSM 2001 compatible format is also presented
in this appendix (see following table ).
The Indonesian authorities are in the process of moving to accrual accounting, and they are
planning for full implementation by 2015. Although budget reporting by local governments is
beginning to improve, it is still subject to long lags, does not follow GFS reporting standards, and
does not have a homogenous classification of expenditures. The Ministry of Finance does not obtain
comprehensive and timely information on borrowing and debt, making it difficult to monitor
general government debt trends.

ANNEX II: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
Background
The working relationship between the IMF and the World Bank in Indonesia is acknowledged by
both sides to be very strong with joint working programs in many areas and close coordination
through frequent meetings between resident offices and with headquarters missions, including the
Article IV consultation.
Key Areas with Joint Programs
Budget


The reform agenda for budget and treasury remains a high priority for both institutions. The
strategic framework for joint work is built into joint Bank/Fund budget missions. Currently,
the Bank support is being provided through the GFMRAP program, trust funds, and DPLs,
with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations, including accounting reforms,
improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform; (b) improved linkages
between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of a medium-term
expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of budget flexibility
at the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight through systems
and organizational reform.

Taxation


Taxation is a priority for the Fund and the Bank with improving tax revenues an important
issue for both macroeconomic security and the investment climate. The Fund has a
longstanding program of support for the tax department in Indonesia. This program has, in
recent years, focused on tax policy and donor coordination, with donor coordination quite
important given the size of support for a solid program of tax reform in Indonesia. The Bank
support for tax administration reform is largely executed through the comprehensive
Program for Indonesian Tax Administration Reform (PINTAR), which was approved in 2009,
and trust funds. The participants will check with their respective colleagues, but generally
anticipate that the current division of labor will continue.

Asset Liability Management


4

The Bank and Fund have been leading an effort to improve asset liability management,
including at the Treasury and Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance and Bank
Indonesia. We envision that the Bank and Fund team will continue to work together as
needed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Financial Sector


The Bank has focused on broad monitoring of the financial sector with special emphasis on
issues that are important for the investment climate (as part of Development Policy Loan
programs). Most recently, through its Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and
Modernization Development Policy Loan, the Bank is supporting the implementation of
reforms aimed at maintaining stability, increasing diversification, and enhancing financial
sector inclusion in Indonesia. The Fund has concentrated on the banking system per se, with
emphasis on bank regulation and supervision. A joint Bank/Fund FSAP was completed in
2010 and some recommendations have been followed through by the authorities. The Bank
is to provide technical assistance to implement select FSAP recommendations concerning
nonbank financial sector.

Statistics


The Bank has a major program with the statistics agency that was launched in 2010. The
program is being designed to focus on improvements in key statistical series that should
improve the ability to understand the Indonesian economy, executed through an
institution-wide approach, i.e., including significant IT and personal/institutional reforms.
There is a quick-wins program being introduced while the longer˗term reforms play out, and
the Fund has indicated that it is prepared to continue to assist in the area of government
finance statistics.

Macroeconomics


The Fund continues to take the lead in macroeconomic areas, with the Article IV and other
missions, staff reports, and policy notes on arising issues, including the stance of fiscal,
monetary, and exchange rate policies, the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy,
macrofinancial linkages, and how events in the global economy are likely to impact
Indonesia. The Bank has also taken on a larger role, including on macroeconomic
monitoring, public policy dialogue, and capacity building, and there is an ongoing need for
close coordination with the Fund. The Bank team has been assisting the Ministry of Finance,
Fiscal Policy Office, to improve capacity for macroeconomic monitoring, forecasting, and
evidence-based macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis.

These threads of work are expected to be continued by both parties, and regular meeting(s) will
explore other ways to improve existing synergies. These include keeping each other informed about
ongoing work, and requests to each other in areas of interest and through periodic meetings. Issues
being addressed include, for the Fund, the impact of structurally high inflation rates and associated
higher volatility on real interest rates; and for the Bank, the link between macro/fiscal policy and real
economic outcomes including growth and poverty, resource-sector fiscal revenues, and
longstanding problems in the implementation and effectiveness of government spending.

DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2011)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative loans to Indonesia reached $27.17 billion as of endDecember 2011. In 2011, the ADB approved a total of $580 million to Indonesia or 3 percent percent
of the total loans approved by the institution for the year. The sectors with the largest shares in
cumulative lending are public sector management (17.5 percent), agriculture and natural resources
(14.9 percent), finance (14.5 percent) and energy (14.1 percent).1
Between 1966 and 2011, ADB provided 517 Technical Assistance grants to Indonesia amounting to
$359.1 million. The TA grants were financed from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund, the Japan
Special Fund, and other sources. Measured by cumulative TA approvals, Indonesia is the second
largest recipient of TA support from the ADB.
ADB approved a new Country Partnership Strategy 2012−2014 (CPS) with the Government of
Indonesia covering the period 2012−2014. The strategy is aligned with the Government’s mediumterm development plan for 2010−2014 as well as the Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion
of Indonesia Economic Development 2011−2025. The CPS is closely attuned to the needs of
Indonesia as large middle-income country and guided by the government’s commitment to “propoor, pro-job, pro-growth and pro-environment” development. The two strategic CPS pillars are
inclusive growth and environmental sustainability with climate change, mitigation and adaptation.
ADB will support government efforts to achieve more inclusive growth by helping to connect poor
people and regions to market by upgrading infrastructure improving logistics, and enhancing skills
base needed to boost investment, productivity, and employment, and by strengthening local
government’s capacity for public service delivery.2

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Annual and quarterly GDP data are published in a timely manner for both expenditure and
production sides with 2000 as the base year. The estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain
quality. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, and seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not
published. In addition, no survey of nonfinancial services is prepared. The Fund has recommended: (i) development of a
system to continuously update the census of businesses; (ii) introduction of comprehensive annual establishment surveys
for nonfinancial services industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least 20 years;
(iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000; and (v) enhancing the convergence
exercise on trade data between Bank Indonesia (BI) and Ministry of Finance (MOF). The revision of the base year of
national accounts to 2010 is in progress with technical assistance from STA, and GDP estimates based on improved data
sources and methodology are expected by 2013.
Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance.
Government finance statistics: Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month
lag, but subnational (provincial and local) government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of
this data is variable. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by the recent decentralization
initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational governments. Substantial efforts are in train, and
significant progress has been made to overcome these problems, ranging from the planned adoption of advanced
accounting and statistical standards, to the introduction of best practice budget management processes, and the
development of computerized financial management information systems.
Against this background, the MOF and the Ministry of Home Affairs are committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal
statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, so as to make better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the
current efforts. The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics is generally adequate. The new expenditure
classification introduced in the 2005 budget is generally consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) on functional codes and classification, although the data are compiled on a cash basis.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, the Fund staff has recommended in the
short term: (i) establishment of a register of all extrabudgetary units; and (ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent
with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of accounts to ensure that general government units report all transactions and
balances over which they exert control. Over the medium term, priority should be given to (i) establishing the underlying
reporting arrangements necessary to obtain timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and (ii) developing
GFSM 2001 operating statements, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of which should
be published on the MOF websites. Currently a system has been set up to allow for an automatic conversion of budget
files to GFSM 2001 data; however, these data are yet to be published on the MOF website.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

INDONESIA

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics
are compiled by BI on a timely basis. With STA assistance, BI has compiled and reported monetary data using the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary
statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. Bank Indonesia has also compiled monetary data for Other
Financial Corporations (OFCs), comprising only finance companies. To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have
also recommended the expansion of the coverage of Other Depository Corporations (ODCs) to include mutual funds and
the coverage of OFCs to include insurance companies and pension funds. Additional challenges include timely revisions
of published banking sector data after supervisory verification.
In addition, with assistance from STA, BI has compiled and reported FSIs to the Fund, which are published on the IMF’s
FSI website. The FSIs were initially reported on a semi-annual basis. However, starting with the Q4:2011 data, BI has
started reporting quarterly FSIs to the Fund. The FSIs for Indonesia comprise of 11 core FSIs, 12 encouraged FSIs for
deposit takers, 2 encouraged FSIs for OFCs, and 3 encouraged FSIs for Real Estate Markets. A STA mission in 2011 has
recommended BI to coordinate with other relevant institutions to explore the possibility to compile FSIs for Nonfinancial
Corporations and Households.
Balance of payments: Trade data have been improved during recent years. Starting in with 2006, the import/export
transactions of free trade zones are covered in goods data of balance of payments statistics.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial
improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using
a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have a low response rate and the
coverage of the directory of enterprises should be improved. Other areas that need improvement include the recording
of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the
errors and omissions item has been significant at times and appears to be related to the under˗coverage of assets in the
financial account. Financial transactions data are reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP),
except for data on direct investment.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI. External debt statistics have
improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the recent
initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI, the IIP
and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of
private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the
accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating rescheduling and debt reductions received
by the private sector from external creditors.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the
SDDS requirements. It uses SDDS flexibility options for
the timeliness of the labor market categories
(employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings)
and general government operations. It is also availing
itself of flexibility options for the periodicity of labor
market categories (employment and unemployment).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
September 7, 2012
This statement provides an update on developments since the staff report was finalized. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The latest data are in line with the staff’s projections. Domestic demand indicators
remain strong, with consumer confidence, cement sales, and motor vehicle sales continuing
to hold up, supported by robust credit conditions. Concerns about the widening current
account deficit have, however, put some pressure on financial markets in recent weeks. The
rupiah weakened by 0.8 percent during August 22−29, and equities and bond prices have
drifted down moderately.
2.
The government has submitted its initial 2013 budget proposal to parliament. The
budget assumes real GDP growth of 6.8 percent and CPI inflation of 4.9 percent (y/y)
in 2013. This compares to growth of 6.3 percent and inflation of 5.0 percent projected in the
staff report. At 1.6 percent of GDP, the overall deficit target in the draft budget is slightly
lower than the staff’s projection of 1.8 percent of GDP. The authorities are expecting
revenues to grow by 12 percent relative to the 2012 revised budget. The draft budget also
proposes to increase capital spending by 15 percent over 2012. While the budget proposal
contains provisions for a modest hike in subsidized electricity prices, there are currently no
plans to raise subsidized domestic fuel prices. Under current WEO oil price projections and
the staff’s baseline macroeconomic assumptions, we currently project the energy subsidy bill
to reach 3 percent of GDP in 2013, broadly unchanged from the staff report and consistent
with the authorities’ own estimates.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 25, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Indonesia
On September 7, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Indonesia.1
Background
Indonesia’s economic performance remains strong. At 6.5 percent, growth in 2011 was the
highest in over a decade. Growth is now easing modestly on account of the weakened external
environment, offset partly by continuing strong domestic demand. Exports have declined in
volume terms so far in 2012, while import growth has accelerated sharply on account of strong
investment, which grew at 20 percent (Q2, year-on-year). Robust private consumption and a
wider fiscal deficit have also provided some support to growth this year. With external demand
expected to remain weak and inventories, which have built up significantly in recent months,
expected to level out, economic growth is projected at 6 percent for 2012 before it picks up
again in 2013.
Headline CPI inflation bottomed out at 3.7 percent (year-on-year) in January, but with sequential
momentum strong for both core and noncore items, it rose to 4.6 percent in July. Inflation is
expected to end the year at 5 percent, within the authorities’ target range of 4.5±1 percent.
The fiscal stance is expected to continue to provide a moderate stimulus, with the 2012 deficit
projected to rise to 1.8 percent of GDP, up from 1.1 percent in 2011. An increase in subsidized

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

energy prices, proposed by the government for this year in April, was put off by parliament,
unless oil prices exceed a revised higher threshold. The postponement of the price adjustment
will boost energy subsidies to 3.5 percent of GDP, compared with the 2.6 percent of GDP in
total allocated to all of development spending.
Both the rupiah and equity markets came under pressure during the spring of 2012 when
outflows picked up sharply, compounding pressures on the exchange rate from the weakening
current account. Bank Indonesia (BI) initially resisted market pressures, which contributed to
illiquidity in the foreign exchange market, with onshore/offshore spreads widening sharply in
early May. Market conditions improved subsequently after BI increased its sales of foreign
exchange, while also allowing the rupiah to depreciate at a faster rate. The current account is
expected to record a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP this year, funded mostly by strong foreign
direct investment inflows.
Despite some tightening of liquidity conditions and the imposition of prudential limits on
consumer and property lending in recent months, financial conditions remain accommodative.
As global conditions deteriorated and domestic inflation slowed during August 2011−
February 2012, BI eased monetary policy. Since May, unsterilized sales of foreign exchange
have helped absorb some excess liquidity, money market rates have risen 30−50 basis points
(bps), and BI has increased the lower bound of its interest rate policy corridor by 25 bps.
However, liquidity remains high in historical comparison and credit growth (26 percent year-onyear) continues at a robust pace.
Banking system asset quality remains satisfactory and banks are profitable and well capitalized.
The authorities have taken several important steps recently to strengthen financial stability.
These include: (i) the establishment of a Financial Services Authority that will be fully
operational by end-2014; (ii) establishment of a high level forum for coordinating financial
stability; and (iii) finalization of a Memorandum of Understanding among all entities currently
responsible for financial stability. However, the passage of an effective financial system safety
net legislation remains outstanding.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound economic management, which
has helped Indonesia maintain a strong economic performance despite a challenging global
environment. Directors noted that, although downside risks remain elevated, the economy’s
sound fundamentals and ample buffers would allow counter cyclical policy responses, if
needed.
Directors noted that, while inflation is within the target band, excess bank liquidity and rapid
credit growth warrant continued vigilance and a tightening bias for monetary policy. More

3
broadly, they welcomed the ongoing review of the monetary policy framework, and encouraged
the authorities to strengthen their communications strategy to send clearer signals to financial
markets and better inform market expectations.
Directors commended the soundness and resilience of the financial system, noting that banks
are well capitalized and profitable. They welcomed various initiatives underway to bolster
financial regulation and oversight, and recommended careful implementation to minimize
transitional risks. They also encouraged the authorities to move quickly to address the
remaining gaps in the regime against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to exchange rate flexibility. They
underscored that official intervention in the foreign exchange market should take place in the
context of a well defined strategy to limit short run volatility. Further development of domestic
capital markets would also aid the intermediation of capital flows, reducing volatility. Directors
took note of the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is moderately under valued.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent fiscal policies grounded on a strong fiscal
framework that has led to a build up of fiscal buffers and a decline in the public debt. They
generally considered the modest fiscal stimulus in 2012 to be appropriate in the face of
headwinds to growth from the external environment. Directors encouraged the authorities to
further advance with fiscal reforms, highlighting the need to improve budget execution, re orient
government spending toward the social sectors and infrastructure, replace energy subsidies
with targeted cash transfers to the vulnerable, and boost revenue collections.
Directors agreed that deeper structural reforms hold the key to sustained, broad based
economic growth. In particular, an open foreign trade and investment regime will be crucial, and
should be balanced carefully against domestic industrial policy considerations. In this context,
Directors encouraged the authorities to push ahead with reforms to increase Indonesia’s
productivity and competitiveness. These would include more investment in human capital, a
reduction in the cost of doing business, deepening of financial markets, and labor market
reforms. Infrastructure and supply bottlenecks also need to be addressed.

and Iss Savitri Hafid, Advisor
September 7, 2012


The Indonesian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the fruitful dialogue during
the Article IV consultation. The consultation, which focused on policy to address near term
challenge and to secure sustainable and equitable growth over the longer term, was
constructive and timely. The authorities find the staff report comprehensive and they broadly
agree on most of the major policy thrusts. As such, this statement will provide more
background of policy making for emphasis and clarification.

Recent Economic Development and Outlook:


Amid the uncertainty in the global economy, Indonesian economy’s resilience was well
maintained, charting higher than expected growth of 6.5% in 2011. The economic
performance was achieved with better than expected inflation rate –recording 3.8%, lower
than the outlook envisaged in last year consultation-, strong external position, prudent fiscal
deficit, and sound financial stability.



Moving forward, the economic growth in 2012 is expected to remain strong at 6.1% – 6.5%
although with risk tilted to the downside. Despite weak of global demand and slowdown of
regional economy, economic growth will be sustained owing to solid investment and
domestic consumption. Meanwhile, fiscal stance will continue to provide stimulus and is set
to record deficit by 2.2% of GDP, with emphasis on expanding budget absorption for
investment. This will be followed with well maintained public debt and external debt levels.
Inflation, despite having strong domestic demand and potential pressure on some components
of volatile food, remains benign and is expected to reach the mid-point of the target of 4.5%
+ 1. In terms of financial stability, various indicators have also continued to show strong
resilience of this sector despite the solid credit growth which reached around 26%. Current
account remains sound and will be moving along its medium-term norm, predicted to record
deficit of some 2% of GDP in 2012, which would be mostly financed by FDI flows.
International reserve in July 2012 stood at $106.6 billion and is adequate to cover 5.6 months
of imports and government’s external debt services payments.



While the authorities manage to maintain the economic performance, it encounters increasing
challenges in their effort to safeguard macro economy and financial stability, as well as to
attain sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The challenges emerge from global and
domestic economy. From global sphere, with unfolding global economic and financial crisis,
Indonesia is facing uncertainty and risks relating to the strength of global economic recovery
and its impact to regional economy, the fluctuation of commodity prices, and the volatile
capital flows. From domestic side, challenges come from the continuing excess liquidity in
the financial sector, the need to improve government spending quality and execution rate, as
well as the urgency to expedite the structural reforms remain important policy agenda.
Subsequently, the authorities see the focus of the staff report as appropriate.

Monetary Policy


To achieve and maintain price stability in securing the macroeconomic and financial
condition is always the core mandate of monetary policy in Indonesia. Following the
adoption of inflation targeting framework in 2005, Bank Indonesia (BI) has continuously
made important and bold steps to strengthen the effectiveness of its monetary policy. This is
to meet the increasing complex challenges to monetary policy making decision to secure the
inflation targets in supporting macroeconomic and financial system stability, arising from
both global and domestic conditions. The task is not easy because, as rightly pointed out by
Staff, the inflation in Indonesia is also influenced by supply shock. The first Selected Issue
Paper (SIP) concluded that 40 percent of inflation dynamic in Indonesia is attributable to
domestic supply condition. Naturally this condition is well explained due to the geographical
condition of Indonesia –an archipelago country—and other imperfection in market structure,
including the supply limitation of goods.



Notwithstanding the current challenges, BI has initiated a re-evaluation of its monetary
policy framework and made some fine tuning for its monetary policy operation. BI strives to
optimize all monetary transmission mechanism, and not merely relies on interest rate
response. Based on this framework, since mid of 2010 BI has adopted a policy mix of
monetary and macroprudential policies, which consist of five areas, namely the interest rate
response, the exchange rate policy, the capital flow management, the macroprudential policy,
and monetary policy communication and coordination. The timing and magnitude of each
policy will be determined on the BI’s assessment with regard to the state of economy and
macroeconomic outlook within the 2-year framework.



The exchange rate policy is an important area in managing the stability in Indonesia. The
authorities take note and share that the risk perceptions in Indonesia remain high –although
decelerating – compared to the strong economic performance and peer group. Nonetheless,
they view that this is attributable to the domination of portfolio flows in the economy
especially before 2011. Combined with foreign players domination amid the shallow and
segmented financial markets, the capital flows vulnerability has caused volatility of rupiah
exchange rate which in turns harming the confident level in the financial market, and hence
the real sector. To tackle the risks, the exchange rate policy is geared toward maintaining its
stability and consistent with overall macroeconomic outlook so as it will complement the
interest rate response in achieving the price stability. This has been done through various
measures including intervening in foreign exchange market, limiting the speculative
pressures, introducing USD term deposit, and improving a longer-term source of foreign
exchange supply. The authorities have also consistently conveyed their policy message on
the exchange rate namely to smooth-out the excessive fluctuation but not to commit on a predetermined level.



Along with intervention strategy in the FX market, BI also purchases the government bonds
in the secondary market. Thus far, the dual intervention strategy in the FX and bond markets
stabilized both the currency and the government bond price from unnecessary overshooting
fluctuation. BI’s strategy in the bond market, besides having positive impact in smoothing
the government bond market volatility, also buttresses the policy to accumulate stock of

government bond to be used as monetary instrument in the open market operations and
supports the liquidity management of banking sector. Currently, BI has been quite active in
utilizing those bonds as a reverse repo instrument in day-to-day open market operation. The
authorities acknowledge the plausibility of market distortion in this strategy and would like
to underscore that the implementation has always been conducted with a measured pace both
in term of magnitude and timing. BI also continues to strengthen its market surveillance to
carefully weigh the impact this dual intervention strategy such that could mitigate the
unintended consequences from this operation.


The continued excess liquidity condition has further weakened the interest rate channel in
monetary policy transmission mechanism in Indonesia. To address the excess liquidity
phenomenon and to strengthen monetary policy operation associating with the endeavor to
stimulate the interbank transactions, BI has widened its operational corridor from 200bps
around the policy rate to a non-symmetric corridor (-200bps and +100bps from the policy
rate). This policy would address the continuing build-up of excess liquidity condition in the
financial sector –due to the securities’ issuance—among others through the encouragement to
find other asset placements rather than the BI’s securities (SBI). The implementation of this
strategy would always take into account (i) the need to secure the inflation target as the main
objective of macroeconomic policy, and (ii) the need to ensure sufficient yield of rupiah
assets’ holding. As deemed necessary, the operational corridor can be adjusted accordingly,
as witnessed during the recent decision of increasing the lower end by 25bps.



Thus far, the decision to widen the operational corridor has addressed the liquidity
management in money market without triggering unnecessary pressure on inflation and
hindering the capital inflows to the economy. The declining trend of money market rate is
justifiable due to the excess liquidity condition in banking sector. Meanwhile, contrary to
Staff assessment, the inflation dynamic has progressed as expected. Based on July 2012
Consensus Forecast, the inflation expectation for 2012 and 2013 have been revised down
from 4.8% and 5.5% in June 2012 to 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively. BI’s surveys to consumer
and retailer for 3 month and 6 month price expectation have also pointed out to the same
direction. The latest estimation of BI models on the inflation forecast for 2012 and 2013 is
further confirming that the inflation rate is well within the target. Given the above condition,
the authorities have raised inquiry on the conclusion of the first paper of SIP which shows
that the lending condition (0.15) is more sensitive compare to the policy rate (0.13). As the
numbers are not substantially different, this finding may also be interpreted that the
combination of policy rate and widening of operational corridor work as effective as the
lending condition to manage the output gap and the inflation target.



The authorities note the high credit growth could raise concern on the financial stability as
well as the inflation management. Nonetheless, the authorities underscore the importance of
maintaining a healthy credit growth to support the much needed investment as staff has
rightly pointed out in the report. Indeed a decomposition of the strong credit growth shows a
comfortable expansion of credit channeling to productive sectors, in which the highest
growth by June 2012 goes to investment and working capital credit reaching 29.1% and
28.2% respectively. Meanwhile the consumption credit which grew by 19.6%, contributed

only a third of the total credit growth of some 25.6%. Furthermore, the banking
intermediation is backed up by the well above 8% of capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and below
5% of gross non-performing loan (NPL). This trend is expected to enhance capability of the
supply side responses to demand in the medium to longer run and prevents the economy from
overheating; and is within the framework of financial deepening. That said, BI again conveys
its firm commitment to safeguard the financial stability. To maintain a healthy credit growth,
BI enhances supervision through adoption of risk based supervision, enhancement of early
warning function, and adoption of macro prudential measures such as Loan-to-Value (LTV)
ratio for automotive and mortgages credit.


The authorities share the importance of communication for enhancing the effectiveness of
monetary policy. BI has strengthened its monetary policy communication through a number
of measures, including monthly press release and media communication after the board
meeting and monetary policy reports (monthly, quarterly and annually) to provide assessment
of the state of economy, economic forecast going forward, and BI monetary policy response
and direction. Monthly meeting with market player is also conducted not only to share BI’s
views on monetary policy but also to gather market inputs. With respect to current policy
setting, BI has begun to communicate its ongoing review initiative on monetary policy
framework and the intention on its recent refinement of monetary policy operation.



The authorities acknowledge that there are rooms to improve and strengthen the effectiveness
of monetary policy. This has always been the heart of monetary policy framework and will
be carried out continuously. In this regard, they re-iterate the request to have a financial
deepening TA from the Fund, which is expected to help constructing an integrated guidance
encompassing various sectors in the economy, whilst taking into account the impact on
macro and financial stability.

Fiscal


The authorities continue to display its firm commitment to fiscal sustainability and strong
public finances. On the revenue side, they strive to increase tax base by holding national tax
census, as well as to increase purchasing power of the poor people and SMEs by raising
taxable income threshold. In addition, the authorities intensify collection through improving
tax payable administration including the effectiveness of auditing and investigation function,
enhancing VAT record and reporting, and reviewing submission for obedient taxable person
for VAT & taxpayers.



To accelerate budget absorption spending in 2012 central and regional budget, a team of
Evaluation and Monitoring Budget Absorption was established under the auspice of
President Work Unit (UKP4). The team monitors and addresses problem that hamper budget
execution which mainly lies in the preparation stage. It is expected that the new procurement
regulation (adopted end of July 2012) and the streamlined budget preparation and payment
process would facilitate better absorption in the future.



The revised 2012 budget is expected to play effective countercyclical role in anticipating
global crisis to maintain the growth momentum. The parliament has approved the new
Budget law which allows the government to request additional budget financing with swift

parliament approval to secure the implementation of prioritized programs. The authorities
share view on the importance to contain energy subsidy and will conduct this through
quarterly electricity price adjustment and limitation in fossil fuel subsidy volume. Further,
the revised budget law has provided flexibility by allowing the government right to make
price adjustment if the average Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) increase more than 15% from
the assumption used in budget.
Financial Sector Policy


The authorities sustain its intensive financial sector reform aiming to optimize the financial
sector’s contribution to the national economy, in particular by enhancing the intermediation
function, bolstering financial sector resilience, strengthening the supervision function, and
fostering the financial inclusion. As part of its efforts to enhance bank resilience, BI amended
the calculation for risk-weighted assets to increasingly reflect the risks faced by the banks in
their CAR and to conform to international standards. In addition, BI sets the loan-to-value
level for mortgages and down payments on motor vehicle loans in order to enhance bank
prudence when allocating such loans.



Transition to coordinate the supervisory function under Financial Service Authority (OJK) is
well in progress. Coordination between BI and OJK are directed in the Article 7 and its
explanation in OJK Act which set the OJK to be in charge of regulation and supervising
institutional issues aspect, soundness aspect (among other liquidity, rent ability, solvability
asset quality, CAR, Legal Lending Limit, LDR and loan provision) and prudential aspect.
These tasks are considered as regulating and supervising micro prudential of financial
institution. BI, instead, will be responsible for macro prudential issues that are those not
listed in Article 7. To enforce those regulations, OJK will help BI to conduct moral suasion
to the banks. To strengthen those duties, BI has submitted draft of BI Act amendments to the
Government. The proposed amendments would give mandates to BI to prescribe and
implement the macro prudential regulation. Transition toward OJK will be carried out in a
cautious and gradual manner. The authorities appreciate support and technical assistance
from the Fund in this matter.



The authorities are aware of the FSSN law importance to support the effective management
of a systemic crisis. The FSSN Law has been drafted to align with existing laws which
regulate OJK, BI and Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), and has been
submitted to the parliament. Separately, the MOU has been established to facilitate
coordination among all entities responsible for financial stability and national crisis
management protocol (CMP) while waiting for the parliament process for FSSN law. The
responsibility of each institution will depend on the nature of the crisis and will follow the
national CMP which also consist CMP under each institution.



The authorities continue to improve implementation of AML/CFT regime. A number of steps
have been taken to prepare a draft bill for legislation by parliament. The bill on Counter
Financing Terrorism has been included in the national Legislation Program 2010 – 2014. The
draft has been recently updated after engaging with international and bilateral partners and
receiving technical assistance to address its main deficiency.

Fostering Stable and Inclusive Growth


The authorities are fully aware that rising investment is important for stable and inclusive
growth. The authorities have recently announced the 2013 budget and work program with
main theme on strengthening domestic economy for to increase and expand prosperity.
Under this theme, the government with the Parliament agreed to emphasize on several
strategic issues, those are (i) enhancing competitiveness through improving investment and
business climate and accelerating infrastructure development and employment creation as
outlined in the Master Plan for Economic Expansion and Acceleration (MP3EI 2011 – 2025);
(ii) increasing economic resilience through strengthening food security, electrification ratio
and energy conversion; and (iii) increasing and expanding people’s prosperity through
human resource development and acceleration of poverty alleviation as outlined in Master
Plan for Poverty Alleviation (MP3KI 2012 – 2025). Accordingly, budget allocation for
capital spending in 2013 will increase by 14.9% from the 2012 allocation and will focus on
energy security, food security and domestic interconnectivity.



To implement the MP3EI, an-interdepartemental committee has been set up to coordinate the
implementation the master plan, monitor and evaluate implementation, and adopt measures
to address any obstacle in project implementation. The team has intersectoral unit and cover
issue of regulation, connectivity and human resources aspect as well as corridor
(development) unit. In addressing issue of connectivity and infrastructure, the authorities
continue to promote PPP to mobilize private sector involvement in infrastructure investment.
The Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund which was established to accelerate
infrastructure development through PPP, has adopted policies toward better guarantee
framework to help encourage pipeline development by making the scheme more acceptable
to market. Further, to increase the viability of PPP projects, the authorities are nearing
completed of a so-called a Viability Gap Fund that will provide cash to companies to defray
the construction costs for PPP projects. The schemes – which will be funded by the
remaining over budget (SAL) – aim to make the project with a strong orientation toward
public welfare (such as toll roads, village interconnectivity roads and clean-water
installations) more commercially viable.



The authorities are aware that some trade and investment measures recently announced could
have weighed on investor sentiment. However, they also wish to highlight their support for
down-streaming of the industries to stimulate more new industries. This goal will be
conducted in a cautious manner while preserving external commitment in the international
trade.

Conclusion


In summary, Indonesian authorities recognize the challenges they face in their effort to
ensure higher, sustained and inclusive growth. They will continue to monitor the economic
situation closely and stand ready to ensure that macroeconomic and financial stability are
well maintained. In that regard, they acknowledge the staff’s advice on such issues, and look
forward to a continued fruitful engagement with the Fund.
