EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Strong macroeconomic conditions and sound domestic policies have significantly
improved Israel’s growth performance and prospects, notwithstanding political
uncertainties and the latest hostilities. During 2004−06, the economy expanded in the
4−6 percent range annually; the fiscal deficit was more than halved; the current account
surplus moved toward 5 percent of GDP; and structural reforms improved the supply-side of
the economy. Financial markets have been remarkably stable, even during the hostilities in
the north in the summer of 2006.
For 2007, real GDP growth is forecast to be about 4 percent or somewhat more, with
low inflation. The risks to growth lie on the downside and include a disruptive unwinding of
global current account imbalances as well as geopolitical uncertainties. Inflation would
remain below the Bank of Israel’s 1−3 percent target range but return toward the midpoint
during 2007, assuming unchanged exchange rates and energy prices. Under this scenario, the
shared view was that monetary policy could afford some easing but that a fundamental
change in the policy stance was not required.
The discussions also focused on fiscal and financial sector policies and frameworks. The
resilience of the economy to shocks needs to be strengthened, notably through reduction of
the 90 percent public debt-to-GDP ratio. Therefore:
•

Staff supported the government’s objective to limit central government real spending
growth to 1.7 percent annually (excluding war-related outlays), with a view to reducing
the deficit to 1 percent of GDP by 2009. However, staff advocated aiming at an outturn
appreciably below the 2007 draft budget’s 2.9 percent of GDP deficit ceiling, cautioning
against tax cuts if revenues during the year turned out higher than projected.

•

Staff pressed for more medium-term fiscal policy analysis in budget documents, more
forward-looking fiscal planning, and better fiscal governance.

•

Staff argued for adapting prudential policies and practices to rapid financial deepening,
which is contributing to higher growth but also raising new risks. Key priorities include
strengthening the independence of the regulatory authorities and providing them with
adequate resources, harmonizing the regulatory requirements for different institutions and
savings products, and improving collaboration between supervisors.

The authorities underscored their objective to do more to combat poverty. Staff
concurred that an Earned Income Tax Credit, which is under discussion to achieve this goal,
could be useful. However, it should be considered as part of a broader, preferably budgetneutral program to address poverty, which is to be studied by a newly-formed National
Economic Council.

investment. While revisions are likely––data
for 2006Q3 are more preliminary than usual because of the war––growth is widely forecast
to average about 4½ percent or more in 2006 and continue apace in 2007.
2.
As spare capacity was reduced through mid 2006, inflationary pressure built
and the Bank of Israel (BoI) raised its policy rate, but since then the pressure has
abated and the rate has been cut. The CPI rose by 1.6 percent during2006H1, leaving
prices in June 2006 some 3.5 percent above last year’s level, or above the BoI’s 1−3 percent
target range (Figure 2). Concurrently, wage

Box 1. Key Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Monetary policy: In line with staff advice, the authorities have improved the transparency of
monetary policy by (i) giving greater prominence to the analysis of inflation dynamics in the Inflation
Reports; and (ii) initiating the publication of minutes from policy meetings.
Fiscal policy: Fund staff has been pushing for giving debt reduction priority over further tax cuts. The
implementation of the VAT reduction in mid-2006 went counter to this advice. While the 2006 fiscal
performance was strong and public debt has fallen more than projected, the debt remains high.
Structural Fiscal Reform: Fund staff has advocated the adoption of a multi-year budget framework
to help ensure that future budgets are better insulated from political pressures and reflect long-term
priorities. The authorities were concerned about the ensuing loss of budget flexibility and staff now
suggests other avenues to strengthen the medium-run orientation of fiscal policy (see para. 23)
Financial Sector: In line with staff advice, the authorities have taken measures to reduce banks’
exposure to credit risk, including by increasing required provisions. But more progress is needed in
further improving risk-based supervision and advancing the implementation of Basel II.

3.
Tight expenditure policy together with the recovery significantly reduced the
central government budget deficit, anchoring investor expectations during the war, but
public debt remains high (Table 2, Figure 3). Following years of unsuccessful
implementation of the Deficit Reduction Law (DRL), the government buttressed the
framework in 2004 with a 1 percent ceiling on

A June VAT cut (annual cost: ½ percent of GDP) as well as conflict-related spending (1 percent of GDP) and
revenue losses (½ percent of GDP) unexpectedly added to the deficit, while receipts deemed one-off and related
to FDI and other activities (1 percent of GDP) detracted from it. Previously legislated tax cuts added (½ percent
of GDP) to the deficit.

is about 6½ years, with a fairly smooth repayment profile; only about one quarter of the debt
is foreign and some 80 percent of that is either guaranteed by the U.S. government or
nontradable, below-market-yield paper held mainly by Jewish foundations located abroad.
Accordingly, Israel’s ten-year government bond yields are standing only about 80bp above
those on comparable U.S. paper.
4.
Israel’s external position has improved (Tables 3, 4, Figures 4–6). Exports are
strong and following a decade of deficits, the current account has been in surplus since 2003,
now reaching just under 5 percent of GDP. While Israel has a net external liability position
of some 20 percent of GDP, it is less
vulnerable than that suggests. The reason 110

is that its liabilities are mainly FDI and

to about 3½ percent. This is higher than
staff estimates of the “equilibrium” (or net foreign asset-stabilizing) current account balance,
a deficit of just over 1 percent of GDP, but which, by its nature, comes with a sizeable
margin of error. At the same time, the real effective exchange rate stands some 10 percent
below its 1986−2006 average, which (consistent with the difference between projected and
“equilibrium” current account) suggests some undervaluation.
5.
Financial soundness indicators are recovering (Table 5). Stock and bond markets
performed well in early 2006 and the market swings since the spring have been similar to
those in advanced (rather than emerging) market economies, notwithstanding the conflict.
The improved economic outlook and enhanced fiscal policy and credibility continued to
attract strong foreign capital inflows through 2006Q3, even during the hostilities, which
testifies to the growing resilience of the economy.
6.
However, weaknesses remain and date back to the boom-bust cycle that started
in the early 1990s, a time when the financial sector was still largely in public hands.
Accordingly: (i) bank profitability and capitalization, although benefiting from economic
growth, have generally not been strong; (ii) problem loans remain high (especially in the
construction sector) relative to bank capital and loan loss provisions; and (iii) nonfinancial
corporate leverage is considerable.

With privatization and banks’ preparations for Basel II risk management has
been improving, but new risks are emerging. The development of, and exposure to, new
financial instruments and risks has rapidly accelerated in response to the cessation of the
practice of requiring institutions to buy guaranteed nontradable government bonds; the
pension reforms; the

households are faced with a wider array of risk-return choices and institutional investors are
moving out of government paper into corporate bonds, equity, and foreign assets. The
prudential regime has yet to catch up with the implications of the wider choices available to
investors, the assumption of investment risk by households, and the extension of nonbank
institutions into credit and new instruments.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Growth Prospects: Fundamentally Strong but with Downside Risks
8.
The conditions for activity in 2007 were widely considered propitious and real
GDP growth forecasts of the authorities and the staff are in the vicinity of 4 percent or
higher. Factors that bode well for growth include: broad-based activity, improved household
and corporate balance sheets, continued strong external demand, low risk premia and an
ample supply of funds for investment, broadly neutral monetary policy, and somewhat
expansionary fiscal policy (see para. 18). But the fiscal impulse to the economy is likely to be
small because the economy is very open and the public debt high. While the exchange rate

8
has been appreciating, the sheqel was still seen as undervalued on a multilateral basis, which
is consistent with Fund staff estimates, and thus no hindrance to growth.
9.
All were concerned about the downside risks for growth in 2007. The authorities
emphasized geopolitical uncertainties but agreed that a sharp unwinding of global current
account imbalances with a global economic downturn, investor flight from risk, and renewed
oil price hikes were also potential risks.
10.
Over the medium term, real GDP growth was seen near 4 percent, closing a
small output gap (Table 6). Falling population growth––from 2.4 percent in 2000 to
1.6 percent in 2007––is beginning to hold back output. Assuming a continuation of the
upward trend in labor force participation, the authorities thought that potential growth was
3½−4 percent, which is in line with staff views, and that slightly higher growth would close
the small remaining output gap.
B. Inflation Outlook: External and Domestic Forces
Pushing in Opposite Directions
11.
Headline inflation is likely to stay below the BoI target range for some time but
is projected to return toward the midpoint later in 2007. There was agreement on the
following points:
•

•

The exchange rate has been appreciating since the war and the pass-through, which
has been unexpectedly large and rapid,

exchange rate and energy prices had

levels, inflation would likely be around the

Overall, assuming a stable exchange rate and oil prices as well as market interest rates, yearon-year inflation would gradually increase toward the BoI midpoint later in 2007. This is
consistent with markets’ expectations of about 1.4 percent year-on-year inflation for the
coming 12 months.
12.
The risks around this central scenario for prices are significant but appear
broadly balanced. Wage developments present an upside risk if activity evolves as projected
or energy prices start rising again: (i) the latest minimum wage hikes (totaling 7½ percent)

9
will be feeding through the economy; and (ii) following two years of no public sector wage
negotiations and only limited (if any) wage increases, the public sector union is asking for a
large hike to make up for lost purchasing power. On the other hand, a sudden weakening in
external demand or further appreciation of the exchange rate would soften price pressures.
C. Monetary Policy: Balancing Short- and Medium-Term Pressures
13.
Under these circumstances, the BoI saw some room for monetary policy easing.
BoI officials explained that the August 2006 rate hike had been partly motivated by concerns
about the potential for capital outflows and a depreciation of the sheqel because of the war.
These have not materialized. On the contrary, the exchange rate soon appreciated again,
buoyed by capital inflows even during the war. Amid slowing year-on-year headline
inflation, moderating wage pressures, and falling inflation expectations, the BoI thus decided
to cut rates again by 25bp for November, hinting at one more cut for December, which it has
since implemented.
14.
Staff concurred and considered that a fundamental change in the policy stance
was not needed for as long as the downside risks to inflation did not grow noticeably.
The central scenario was for above-potential economic growth and rising headline inflation
in the year ahead and thus a significant addition of stimulus appeared unnecessary, unless the
downside risks––notably those related to an exchange rate appreciation––increased
materially. The BoI broadly agreed with staff’s analysis of the fundamental drivers of
inflation and related risks over the medium term, which are significant, as staff model
simulations suggest (Box 2). Accordingly, it intended to proceed cautiously in changing
rates, also because of lingering uncertainties related to the 2007 budget and the geopolitical
situation.
15.
The BoI was concerned about the frequency with which inflation had been
outside the 1−3 percent target range since the adoption of this target. The key reason is
the rapid transmission of the volatile exchange rate to domestic prices because housing rent
and some other service contracts are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. BoI officials
considered that frequently missing the target range might destabilize inflationary
expectations. However, the BoI’s experience is not unusual among inflation-targeting
countries.4 Also, in the staff’s view, it did not detract from the success of the BoI’s monetary
policy, as evidenced by stable inflation expectations. However, maintaining this performance
would require convincing the public that inflation can temporarily be outside the target range
while policy is consistent with price stability over the medium term.

Box 2: Monetary Policy—Baseline Forecast and Risk Assessments
The central scenario assumes a small negative
output gap that closes in 2007; and stable
exchange rates and oil prices. Headline inflation
would then likely remain below the 1-3 percent
target range for the first half of the year but
return toward the mid-point thereafter.

The central scenario is subject to several risks. Their potential policy rate implications––determined
with a model of the economy, as explained in IMF Country Report 06/121, Chapter III––are
illustrated below:

Staff thought that publishing an inflation forecast might help anchor inflation
expectations going forward but BoI officials were not convinced. Staff considered that the
minutes of policy discussions, which have been published since May 2006 and complement
the Bank’s Inflation Report, were useful for that purpose. However, the report did not include
an explicit inflation forecast together with a discussion of technical assumptions and risks,
which is unlike standard practice among inflation-targeting central banks in other advanced
economies. BoI officials replied that they had published fan charts in some past Inflation
Reports and would not rule out doing so again in the future. But their main concerns were (i)
the conceptual difficulty of publishing a forecast other than at the mid-point of the target
range; and (ii) their inflation forecast record, which would probably be poor on account of
the exchange rate. Alternatively, the forecast range would have to be so wide as to be of little
use as an anchor.
D. Fiscal Policy: Advancing the Consolidation Effort
17.
All interlocutors agreed that the public high debt was constraining policy
options and needed to be lowered. A debt sustainability analysis suggests that there is little
room for more public support during period of relatively low growth––even more so during
recessions––without causing adverse debt dynamics (Figure 7). Furthermore, there is a need
to begin preparing for a growing proportion of older and needier citizens in the future, even if
Israel’s population is still relatively young. In fact, assuming that the central government
achieved its deficit targets for 2007-09 and maintained the deficit at 1 percent of GDP
thereafter—implying balance or surpluses in years of high growth—it would take until at
least 2025 to reach a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent, a level that is considered an upper
bound reference value for many advanced economies. At that time, Israel’s old-age
dependency ratio and social needs would be similar to those of many advanced economies
today that are struggling to advance welfare reform amid slowing potential output growth.

18.
The authorities explained that their consolidation strategy was to stick to the
pre-war central government expenditure path except for a temporary deviation on
account of war-related spending. For 2007, real expenditure growth would be held to
1.7 percent upon excluding war-related outlays (equivalent to ¾ percent of GDP). Keeping
expenditure within this constraint required measures equivalent to just over ½ percent of
GDP. The budget proposed freezing welfare benefits; cutting railroad investments; and
various other measures, including across-the-board cuts. Concurrently, revenues would fall
by about 1½ percent of GDP relative to 2006 because some receipts in that year were deemed
one-off in nature (1 percent of GDP) and previously-scheduled tax cuts (½ percent of GDP)
would kick in. Overall, the central government budget deficit in 2007 was therefore expected
to be no higher than 2.9 percent of GDP, assuming real GDP growth of 3.8 percent and
average inflation of 1.4 percent.5 War-related spending would continue to affect the 2008
budget but in 2009 the pre-war deficit target of 1 percent of GDP would be attained. Under
this baseline scenario, the public debt would fall below 85 percent of GDP in 2009.

War-related expenditure
1/ Staff baseline projections (excludes credit).

19.
Staff supported the central government
expenditure policy but, pointing to the
significantly larger general government deficit–
–expected at over 4 percent––and the challenges
presented by the high debt, underscored the
need for greater ambition with respect to deficit
reduction in 2007. The mission specifically
cautioned against new tax cuts, even if revenues
turned out stronger than projected, and in this
connection was also critical of the June 2006 VAT
cut that had been implemented at short notice amid
buoyant tax receipts. To bring the 2007 deficit
closer to the pre-war targets the mission called for
pruning the many tax expenditures, which account
for the equivalent of roughly 5 percent of GDP.

13
20.
The authorities emphasized that 2.9 percent of GDP was a ceiling and not a
target for the budget deficit in 2007. They defended the VAT cut because it had served to
diminish expenditure demands and were hopeful about their ability to hold the line on the
deficit, notwithstanding pressure to raise spending on defense and welfare. This would be
studied by two commissions, including a newly-formed National Economic Council (NEC).
However, judging by past attempts, they thought that lowering tax expenditures would be
very difficult.
21.
There was agreement on the need to adhere to the consolidation path over the
medium run. The authorities intend to reduce the central government deficit to 1 percent by
2009. The mission underscored that the expenditure growth ceiling needed to be respected
and further tax cuts be eschewed. The reasons are that: (i) once currently-scheduled rate cuts
have been implemented, statutory income and consumption tax rates will be in line with
those in advanced economies with similar welfare aspirations; and (ii) staff analysis suggests
that giving debt reduction precedence over tax cuts would boost growth.6 Together with some
progress in curtailing the many tax expenditures, this would allow some overperformance
against the 2009 fiscal targets and could bring the general government account (accrual
basis) close to balance (implying surpluses for the central government cash balance) in just
over 5 years. This medium-run target for the general government––which a number of other
advanced economies have chosen––would create more room for policy maneuver,
maintaining the debt on a declining path even in the presence of shocks that could
temporarily set back the adjustment effort.
E. Fiscal Governance: Building Awareness of
Medium- and Long-Run Challenges
22.
Staff considered that the frequent fiscal policy slippages in the past and the high
debt ratio were partly due to a budget debate that is overly focused on the short run
and weaknesses in the fiscal policy framework. The DRL lacked stability and credibility,
although the adoption of a real expenditure growth ceiling had improved fiscal performance.
However, that ceiling had already been raised once, from 1 to 1.7 percent, and had been
suspended repeatedly because of the geopolitical events. Moreover, the frequent and
noticeable deviations of fiscal outcomes from targets detracted from the predictability of
fiscal policy and thus might be harming economic activity. Overall, staff thought that there
was insufficient awareness of the risks posed by the high public debt in a political economy
environment that is not naturally conducive to debt reduction (Box 3).
23.
The mission thus proposed various options to strengthen the policy framework
and raise awareness of the detrimental impact of the public debt:

1/ No specific deficit targets were given for the years 1995-1997. The only requirement was that the deficit, as percent of GDP, would decrease compared to its level
in the previous year. Numbers underlined represent the deficit targets that the government decided on when it presented the budget for this year.
2/ No specific deficit targets were given for the years 2001-02. The only requirement was that the deficit, as percent of GDP,
would decrease by 0.25 percentage points compared to the previous year, and that the deficit in 2003 would be up to 1.5 percent
of GDP. Numbers underlined represent the deficit targets that the government approved when it presented the budget for this year.
3/ In 2004, the DRL was amended to include ceilings on expenditures growth between 2005-10. Accordingly, budget expenditure,
indexed to the CPI, would not increase by more than 1 percent each year and the budget deficit would not exceed 3 percent of GDP.
4/ In the 2005 budget, the original deficit target was 3 percent of GDP, but it was later revised upward to account for the estimated
cost of Gaza disengament of 0.4 percent of GDP.
5/ In 2006, the DRL was further modified, with the 1 percent cap on the growth in real expenditure rising to 1.7 percent, starting in 2007,
with the deficit target falling gradually to 1 percent by 2009.
6/ Actual deficits reflect the revisions made to the national accounts in July 2006, the result of which raised the GDP series by a cumulative 5 percent through end of 2005.

•

Better budgetary preparation and transparency, in line with the recommendations of
the 2003 Fiscal ROSC. Specifically, the mission called for the budget documentation
to include a medium-term fiscal scenario based on unchanged policies; a listing of all
the policy changes and their fiscal impact; a systematic assessment of the impact of
shocks and forecast errors on fiscal variables; and a long-term fiscal sustainability
analysis.

•

Stronger fiscal governance mechanisms. Staff thought that one option for Israel could
be a committee of independent experts, possibly similar in structure to the new
National Economic Council, that regularly publishes comprehensive fiscal policy
analysis and advises on the design and implementation of the fiscal framework. But
other options that built on existing commissions or institutions might well deliver
similar results.

24.
The authorities were sympathetic to the staff’s views and endorsed the call for
more medium-term fiscal policy analysis but saw no pressing need for significant
institutional change. Governor Fischer thought a committee of independent experts was
unnecessary because the BoI could deliver the required analysis––indeed, the Bank already
evaluates the budgets in its Recent Economic Developments reports of the fall. The MoF
noted that several commissions/councils were already looking into fiscal matters. Also, the
transparency of public finances had been improved by publishing for the first time large
portions of the defense budget. Nonetheless, Minister Hirchson agreed on the need to
enhance the exchange of information between the MoF and the Knesset Finance Committee,
which has only one professional staff to conduct fiscal analysis. He was considering
establishing an MoF-Knesset working group to achieve this goal.

15

Box 3: The Political Economy and Fiscal Institutions
A selected issues paper (Chapter I) finds that, as in other countries, fragmented parliaments and short
average government duration have boosted public debt and deficits in Israel. International experience
suggests that various fiscal governance mechanisms can counter political economy biases to fiscal
policy, notably:
•

Enhanced budgetary transparency and analysis. A review of budget documents in best-practice
countries—including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and some EU countries—reveals many
areas for improvement in Israel.

•

Independent fiscal policy assessment. Countries have found various mechanisms useful to broaden
the debt reduction constituency, from independent agencies that conduct fiscal analysis to ad-hoc
committees that report on specific aspects of the public finances.

F. Financial Sector Policies: Balancing Competition and
Stability in the Quest for Growth
25.
Financial sector reforms are a key element in the authorities’ strategy to boost
growth. New developments include: a financial contracts law that provides for repurchase
agreements; a real time gross settlement system (which reduces banks’ settlement risks); and
a primary dealer system, which has helped heighten interest of foreign financial
intermediaries in local currency bonds. Proposals have been made to permit the sale of asset
backed securities by banks; foster the portability from one tax-supported savings product to
another; and free up the annuity market.
26.
There was agreement that the many reforms, while diversifying the economy
and contributing to higher economic growth, had altered the risk profile of financial
institutions and their products. Staff was concerned that as global liquidity conditions
tighten, financial institutions might be faced with a combination of rising interest rates and
risk premia. In this setting, several issues needed attention:
•

The growing share of risk borne by households. The share of household saving in
risky assets––held on their behalf by insurance companies as well as provident and
pension funds––is growing rapidly. Staff considered that this required strong
disclosure requirements, more robust governance structures, better investment advice,
and more investor education. The authorities explained that past reforms had fostered
the growth and independence of investment advice, which was also being subject to
closer supervision. And laws were under preparation to strengthen disclosure
requirements on provident funds and allow foreign mutual funds and investment
advice companies from certain countries to offer their services without the need for a
local license.

•

The relatively low profit and capital in banks, particularly if viewed against the high
levels of poorly performing loans. However, the authorities argued that the collateral
held against problem loans was adequate; that banks were moving increasingly into
mortgage and consumer lending, profitable and relatively less risky activities; and
that efforts were underway to switch to a more risk-based approach to bank
supervision, notably in the context of work toward the adoption of Basel II.

•

The new risks taken on by institutional investors. Insurance companies and pension
and provident funds are still developing the corporate governance and risk
management capabilities to manage the credit, legal, operational and other risks that
come from venturing into new product areas. The authorities reported that they
intended to introduce risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies and
step up on-site supervision.

17
27.
All concurred that the new risks required a commensurate and coordinated
response from prudential policies and practices. Stronger enforcement requires more
independence for supervisors. In this regard, staff pushed for prompt adoption of the draft
BoI law;7 moving the supervision of insurance companies, provident funds, and pension
funds outside the MoF; and granting the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) more extensive
regulatory powers, commensurate with those of the BoI and Commissioner of Insurance. The
authorities reported that work on a memorandum of understanding between all supervisors
was ongoing and staff pressed for this to also cover contingency planning.8
28.
For the future, the authorities considered some unification of regulatory and
supervisory functions useful, a topic that would be studied by a government-appointed
commission. Staff observed that all options for restructuring had pros and cons (Box 4). Key
was that any restructuring provide for (i) more independent supervision, supported by a
strong governance structure; (ii) adequate resources for supervision, including a salary
structure that enables the new institution(s) to attract top-quality staff; (iii) a strong
regulatory capacity for the new institution(s); and (iv) less prudential gaps and a level playing
field across financial service industries. Moreover, there was agreement that restructuring
should not set back the ongoing work on improving prudential policies and practices.
G. Combating Poverty
29.
The authorities explained that they intended to place greater emphasis on
combating poverty. More than one fifth of families are considered poor because their
(equivalent) incomes are less than half the median income. There was agreement that
sustaining the adjustment and reform momentum required addressing the challenges posed
by sectors and workers with skills that faced falling demand and that the most efficient policy
responses were better education and training. The authorities were particularly concerned
about poverty among jobholders. They elaborated that, therefore, the minimum wage had and
would be increased; labor market legislation would be better enforced; and the number of
foreign workers reduced––the mission questioned the benefit of these measures. Moreover,
the authorities were considering introducing an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). While
attractive in principle, the mission underscored that much depended on the design of this
program, particularly its fit within the local tax and welfare benefit system as well as labor
market programs and regulations. Some interlocutors were also concerned that an EITC
would benefit some segments of the poor in Israel more than others and thus might trigger

7
8

See IMF Country Report 06/120, page 15.

Regarding AML/CFT the authorities drew attention to the following points: (i) there had been agreement to
allow Israeli banks to continue to provide clearing services for Palestinian banks, subject to proper identity
checks and other safeguards; (ii) the BoI had asked all Israeli banks to conduct an examination of the
compliance by their banks with the AML/CFT rules imposed by the local laws where their overseas branches
and subsidiaries are based; (iii) the BoI is imposing AML/CFT regulations on credit card companies; (iv) a
MONEYVAL evaluation is tentatively scheduled for late 2007; and (v) the ISA had conducted 9 AML/CFT onsite inspections.

18
demands for more support under other programs. In the staff’s view, these technical and
political economy interactions demand that EITC be considered in the context of a wider,
budget-neutral review of poverty reduction and employment policies, which is envisaged by
the National Economic Council.
Box 4: Financial Sector Supervision
Given the changes in the financial sector, the authorities intend to examine how best to adapt the structure
of supervision, which is presently performed by several entities. There are many models, all with some
advantages and disadvantages over the present structure (see Selected Issues paper, Chapter II).
Key potential advantages of an integrated supervisor:
•

reflects more closely the increasingly integrated financial markets in Israel, where products
offered by different sectors have many common characteristics;

•

fosters use of the experience in one sector to address supervisory weaknesses in other sectors,
mitigating regulatory arbitrage;

•

leverages synergies and economies of scale that reduce cost.

Key potential advantages of separate supervisory entities:
•

narrower focus of supervision and therefore enhanced accountability and more effective delivery;

•

more checks and balances because of less concentration of powers;

•

avoids major restructuring and related disruptions to important ongoing supervisory activities
(e.g., introduction of Basel II).

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The economy is performing very well and the key challenge for policymakers is
to strengthen its resilience to shocks, particularly through public debt reduction. Strong
growth and a benign external environment offer an opportunity to advance fiscal
consolidation and strengthen institutional structures that should not be missed. Continued
headway along both dimensions is crucial to nurture the confidence of investors and create
room for policies to respond to unexpected changes in economic and social conditions
without risking adverse debt dynamics.
31.
The foundation for continued real GDP growth of 4 percent or more in 2007 is
strong but the risks lie mainly on the downside. The recovery has become increasingly
broad based and the impact of the conflict in the north on economic activity has been limited,
which bodes well for the year ahead. However, external downside risks loom, notably a
disruptive unwinding of global imbalances, investor flight from risk, and geopolitical
uncertainties. And, from a domestic perspective, the central scenario assumes a stable
political and benign security setting. On both accounts downside risks prevail.
32.
Inflation is forecast to return toward the mid-point of the 1−3 percent range
later in 2007. Wage developments, including in the public sector, and energy prices present

19
upside risks if activity evolves as projected. But these are offset by downside risks related to
a potential weakening in external demand or further appreciation of the exchange rate.
33.
Accordingly, for as long as the downside risks to inflation do not grow
noticeably, a fundamental change in the monetary policy stance is not needed. There
might be room for some further easing because headline inflation is projected to run below
the mid-point of the target range for some time. But the central scenario is for abovepotential economic growth and thus a significant addition of stimulus appears unnecessary,
unless the downside risks for prices related to external demand and the exchange rate––
which might be somewhat undervalued––increase markedly.
34.
The publication of minutes of discussions has added to the transparency of the
monetary policy process but some scope is left for doing more. While inflation has
temporarily been outside the target range, inflation expectations have remained wellanchored thus far. However, maintaining this performance would probably be easier if the
Bank were to publish regularly an inflation forecast, as is common practice among inflationtargeting central banks in advanced economies.
35.
Fiscal policy has strengthened considerably and should target an appreciable
overperformance relative to the proposed budget deficit ceiling for 2007.
Notwithstanding the war, the central government deficit is projected to fall to 1½ percent of
GDP in 2006, which reflects remarkable expenditure discipline. Also, the 2007 draft
expenditure budget commendably advances the consolidation of the public finances.
However, no effort should be spared to hold the 2007 budget deficit considerably below the
2.9 percent budget ceiling and rapidly lower the 90 percent debt-to-GDP ratio.
36.
For the medium run, fiscal policy needs to remain on a predictable and credible
path toward a significantly lower debt-to-GDP ratio. The 1.7 percent real expenditure
growth ceiling must be adhered to rigorously and debt reduction be given priority over tax
cuts. Together with some cuts in the many tax expenditure programs, this would bring the
general government accounts close to balance in just over 5 years, rapidly lower the debt
ratio, and create a buffer against shocks as well as room for more policy maneuver.
37.
A more holistic and forward-looking fiscal policy debate would likely facilitate
public debt reduction. Budget documents need to include an analysis of medium-term fiscal
policy challenges and risks. This would also foster the constituency for deficit and debt
reduction, which tends to be smaller than those for immediate tax cuts or expenditure
increases. Mindful of existing institutions, it might also be useful to introduce independent,
nonpartisan fiscal governance mechanisms that appraise policies in a forward-looking
manner.
38.
Accelerated financial deepening is fostering economic growth but also raising
new challenges for supervisors, whose resources, independence, and cooperation need
to be buttressed commensurately. Economic agents and corporations are assuming new
risks and the traditional dividing lines between financial institutions are becoming
increasingly blurred. Key policy priorities are: passing swiftly the draft Bank of Israel law;
re-enforcing risk-based supervision, notably in the context of accelerated progress toward

20
implementing Basel II; adding resources to the supervision of insurance companies and
pension and provident funds, and moving this activity outside the Ministry of Finance,
consistent with future plans for the structure of supervision in Israel; improving the
regulatory infrastructure for insurance companies; and aligning prudential policies and
practices across all sectors.
39.
Israel has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards and its
macroeconomic statistical system is generally adequate for Fund surveillance.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

3/ As of October, 2006.
4/ The Bank of Israel set the policy rate at 5.0 percent for December 2006.
5/ As of July, 2006.
6/ National definition, cash basis.
7/ International definition, accrual basis. On the difference between central and general government deficits during 2001-05: some 0.4 percent of GDP is
accounted for by local governments' deficits and the remainder by the difference between accrual and cash bases accounting. On the latter, the key factor
is the CPI indexation component that is paid on all NIS debt when it matures and is recorded below the line in the central government balance, but above
the line in the general government balance when it accrues.

For purposes of Fund relations, the West Bank and Gaza are considered to be under the authority of Israel
within the terms of Article XXXI, Section 2(g) of the Articles of Agreement. The Article IV mission did only
focus on the Israeli economy and did not meet with representatives of the Palestinian Authority.

35
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of June 9, 2005 Israel’s exchange rate regime is officially classified as
independently floating. This step by the Government of Israel was taken to remove
the last vestige of a policy in which the exchange rate of the NIS fluctuated within the
limits of a crawling band. In practice, however, the NIS has been floating since 1997,
when the Bank of Israel stopped intervening to protect the band.

standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Technical Assistance:
For purposes of the Fund’s operational activities, the West Bank and Gaza (WBG)
continue to fall under Israeli jurisdiction in accordance with Article XXXI, Section
2(g) of the Articles of Agreement.
The IMF has provided technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the
WBG, with a focus on assisting the PA in establishing economic and financial
institutions, and in monitoring and reporting on fiscal developments and institution
building. In particular, technical assistance has been provided in the areas of tax and
customs administration, expenditure management (Fiscal Affairs Department); in the
areas of bank supervision (Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department); and in the
areas of national accounts and monetary statistics (Statistics Department).

APPENDIX II. ISRAEL STAFF RESEARCH, 2005−07
Monetary Policy and Inflation
“A Simple Forecasting and Policy Analysis System for Israel: Structure and Applications,”
(Natan Epstein, Philippe Karam, Douglas Laxton, and David Rose, 2006, IMF Country
Report 06/121).
•

Develops a simple forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS) model to prepare
baseline forecasts and risk assessments for monetary policy and the Israeli economy.
The model is designed to support policy analysis for an inflation-targeting regime and
captures the essential small, open, flexible-exchange-rate economy linkages between
the policy rate and output, inflation and the exchange rate. Conducts risk assessments
on three key sources of uncertainty underlying the baseline forecast— exchange rate,
output gap, and oil prices—and reviews model properties and performance.

“Inflation-Targeting Practices in Israel,” (Allan D. Brunner, 2005, IMF Country Report
05/134).
•

Examines Israel’s monetary policy under the inflation targeting regime with an eye
toward understanding why breaches of the targeting range have been occurring and
how to address them. Argues that putting a great deal of weight on outside forecasts
of inflation in setting the policy rate induces price instability. Maintains that, in order
to provide a solid anchor for market expectations and for the inflation targeting
regime, the Bank of Israel should rely more on its own forecasts of inflation.

Fiscal Policy
“The Political Economy and Fiscal Institutions in Israel,” (Mario Catalan, 2007, Selected
Issues).
•

Analyze the political economy factors that have affected fiscal policy and
performance in Israel. Finds that fragmented parliaments and short average
government duration have boosted public debt and deficits. Argues that strengthening
fiscal governance mechanisms can counter political economy biases to fiscal policy,
notably through enhanced budgetary transparency and analysis and independent fiscal
policy assessment.

“Fiscal Consolidation in Israel: A Global Fiscal Model Perspective,” (Selim Elekdag, Natan
Epstein, and Marialuz Moreno-Badía, 2006, Working Paper 06/253).
•

Employs the IMF’s Global Fiscal Model to quantify the costs of delaying fiscal
consolidation in Israel. Finds that early consolidation through expenditure cuts would

37
result in a substantial increase in Israel’s long-term output growth relative to the case
with delayed fiscal adjustment. Using an alternative fiscal instrument, it also finds
that delaying tax cuts would result in long-run cumulative real GDP that is five times
larger than when the tax cuts are immediately implemented.
Financial Sector
“Financial Sector Supervision Structures: Assessing the Alternatives for Israel,” (Natan
Epstein and Richard Pratt, 2007, Selected Issues).
•

Reviews the international experience with various financial supervision structures.
Examine the key advantages of the different models and provide a neutral assessment
of the existing options. Highlights that any restructuring must provide for more
independent supervision, supported by a strong governance structure; adequate
resources for supervision; a strong regulatory capacity; and a level playing field
across financial service industries.

“Corporate Balance Sheets and Investment: Empirical Estimates for Israel,” (Marialuz
Moreno-Badía, 2006, IMF Country Report 06/121).
•

Analyzes the empirical relationship between corporate leverage— and other
indicators of financial health— and investment in Israel, using dynamic panel data
techniques. Finds that weak balance sheets may well have contributed to the
investment decline of recent years. Leverage, measured as the debt-to-assets ratio, is
found to have a large negative effect on investment.

“The Reform of the Capital Markets in Israel,” (Richard Pratt, 2006, IMF Country Report
06/121).
•

Reviews and analyzes the capital market reforms in Israel. Highlights that, together
with the forced divestiture of banks’ holdings of mutual and provident funds, actions
that the authorities have taken to remove the legal, tax, and regulatory barriers to the
further development of capital markets, are leading to growth and innovation in the
creation of new instruments for investment and risk management. Maintains that the
rapid development of the capital markets have created new supervisory and
regulatory challenges.

“Banking Sector Developments and Issues,” (Jonathan L. Fiechter, Michael Moore, John
Palmer, and William Ryback, 2006, IMF Country Report 06/121).
•

Reviews developments and issues affecting the banking system in Israel and
examines the supervision function by the Bank of Israel. Argues that while the
banking system has grown stronger in recent years following the 2001-2002
recession, the level of problem loans remained stubbornly high, contributing to a low
level of profitability. Finds that the caliber of the BoI supervisors is strong and

38
supervisors are highly qualified, but highlights the need to increase efficiency in the
operations of the supervisory function.
Structural Reforms
“Active Labor Market Policies,” (Gil Mehrez and Franziska Ohnsorge, 2005, IMF Country
Report 05/134).
•

Reviews labor market policies in Israel and examine the extent to which active labor
market policies (ALMP) can reduce unemployment. Argues that while institutional
barriers and distortions are broadly in line with other industrial countries,
expenditures on ALMPs are very low by international standards. Finds that increasing
ALMP expenditures from 0.2 percent of GDP to 0.7 percent would reduce the longrun unemployment rate by about 0.8 percentage point in the long term. Also finds that
the welfare reforms in recent years have enhanced incentives for job seekers and have
contributed to rising labor force participation and declining unemployment rates.

39
APPENDIX III. ISRAEL: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Israel is generally in observance of the Special Data Dissemination Standard, meeting
specifications for coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and dissemination of advance release
calendars. Macroeconomic statistics are of generally high quality and broadly adequate for
surveillance, although there are few shortcomings particularly in monetary and government
finance statistics. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, a
Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), and a
Response by the Authorities were published on the IMF website on March 24, 2006.
Banking statistics are not based on balance sheet reporting, but instead on a selection of data
reported by banks to the regulatory authorities. Current information does not permit full
sectorization of the economy in the monetary statistics, and more detailed information on
instruments also would be useful. The Bank of Israel has indicated its intention to develop a
comprehensive reporting system for statistical purposes. Bank of Israel officials have also
expressed their intention to report monetary statistics to the Fund using the IMF Statistics
Department’s standardized report forms.
The methodology underlying the reported overall annual fiscal balance is not in conformity
with internationally accepted best practice, as interest expenditure excludes the inflation
component. The authorities are gradually moving toward implementation of the methodology
that is standard in other countries, so that the discrepancy will decline over time. Data
submitted by the Central Bureau for Statistics for the 2006 Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook present cash and accrual data for revenue and expense, as well as transactions in
non-financial assets, broadly following the GFSM 2001 format. However, data on
transactions and stocks of financial assets and liabilities, the compilation of which requires
MoF collaboration, have not been submitted. Within-year monthly reports on central
government operations―compiled by the MoF―cover only the main aggregates of
budgetary accounts, not broken down by components.
Balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled on a quarterly
basis and follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. External sector data
were not examined in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes.

On December 25, the Bank of Israel
lowered its policy rate by 50 bps to
4.5 percent for the month of January. This
followed a significant appreciation of the
sheqel during the first half of December. The
decision somewhat surprised markets, which
were expecting a 25bp drop in the policy rate,
but stemmed the appreciation of the exchange
rate. Nonetheless, the sheqel remains
appreciated against the U.S. dollar relative to
staff’s end-November baseline. The rate cut is
consistent with the staff report’s central
scenario and risk assessment (Box 2). In
December, the CPI came in at 0.1 percent
below last year’s level.

The 2006 central government budget deficit turned out lower than widely
estimated, reaching 0.9 percent of GDP. Indications are that revenues were significantly
higher than earlier projected. On January 3, the Knesset passed the proposed 2007 budget,
which targets a deficit of no more than 2.9 percent of GDP. Since the release of the staff
report, the government approved an increase of about 0.3 percent of GDP in defense
spending, which is to be offset by cuts across various ministries. The overperformance in
2006 lends further support to staff advice to hold the 2007 budget deficit considerably below
the 2.9 percent budget ceiling.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Israel
and Nir Klein, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 19, 2007

General
The Israeli authorities thank the staff for the constructive and candid policy
discussions in Jerusalem. They appreciate staff’s high quality set of papers, which present a
balanced assessment of economic developments and address topical issues for the Israeli
economy.
Notwithstanding the considerable shocks1 the Israeli economy experienced in the past
year, economic performance remained strong, recording a substantial growth for a third year
consecutively. The financial system revealed remarkable resilience, and despite the
significant uncertainties that arose, financial market indicators continued to improve, with the
Tel Aviv Stock Exchange index reaching record-high levels. The strong economic activity
has largely benefited from relatively benign global conditions, which were reflected in the
continuation of strong external demand and significant capital inflows, and were underpinned
by prudent policies that reinforced investors’ confidence. In 2006 the current account surplus
increased to a record level of around 5 percent of GDP. Fiscal policy remained responsible,
and despite the increasing security spending needs, the expenditure envelope was maintained,
allowing a further reduction in the relative size of the public sector. The confluence of tight
expenditure policy and higher-than-expected revenues also enabled a substantial reduction of
the debt-to-GDP ratio to 88 percent. Monetary policy continued, during the first eight
months, with the end-2005 gradual tightening; however, toward the end of the year, the
moderation of inflationary pressures brought about a policy of interest rate cuts.
The authorities recognize the challenges ahead and are committed to pursue prudent
policies to support strong and sustainable economic growth. In this regard, they proceeded, in
2006, with the implementation of their ambitious reform agenda, geared toward greater
competitiveness and flexibility. This progress has been also recognized by the World
Economic Forum, which ranked Israel 15th (among 125 countries) on the competitiveness
index - an 8 steps climb from the 2005 ranking. The economy’s high degree of development
together with the authorities’ commitment to maintain a market-based economy, good
governance and democratic pluralism place Israel as a natural candidate for OECD
membership. The authorities hope to complete the accession process successfully and
become an integral part of the OECD in the near future.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
By and large, the Israeli economy, in 2006, continued the strong cyclical upswing that
was recorded in the past two years, with GDP growth projected at 5 percent - similar to the
1

These shocks included the hospitalization of Prime Minister Sharon, early elections and the establishment of a
new government, geo-political uncertainties regarding the formation of the new Palestinian government led by
the Hamas and the war in the north. The high energy prices also had an adverse effect on economic activity.

2
average growth in 2004-05 - driven by the rapid expansion of the business sector (6.3
percent). In the first half of the year economic performance accelerated to 5.9 percent, with
buoyant exports and significant increase in private consumption as the main drivers.
However, the outbreak of the war in Lebanon (mid-July), which affected economic activity
and sharply reduced incoming tourism, led to contraction in the third quarter (1.1 percent).
Recent economic indicators point out that economic growth is continuing again at a fast pace.
Consequently, the Bank of Israel (BoI) has recently revised its GDP growth projection for
2007 upward by 0.6 percent to 4.6 percent.
Overall, the strong economic performance and outlook largely reflect the continuous
improvement of the external stance. Despite the deterioration in the terms of trade (excl.
diamonds, ships and aircraft), acceleration of imports (excl. diamonds) and a sharp decline in
incoming tourism, the high external demand for Israeli products contributed to the increase of
the current account surplus, for a fourth year consecutively, to a record-high level estimated
at around 5 percent of GDP for 2006. The capital and financial accounts also demonstrated
great vigor. Notwithstanding the remarkable level of foreign direct investment (9 percent of
GDP), net capital exports continued to increase, reflecting inter alia the ongoing adjustment
process to the series of far-reaching reforms that were introduced in 2005.2
The strong economic activity was clearly reflected in labor market developments.
The unemployment rate declined from 8.8 percent in the second quarter of 2006 to 8.3
percent in the third quarter of the year, thus continuing the gradual decline from the recordhigh level of 10.9 percent at the end of 2003. This decline took place despite a significant
increase in the participation rate and was reflected in the absorption of more than 200,000
new employees (increase of 9 percent) in the past three years. In 2006, high labor demand
also contributed to nominal wage increase in both the business (3.8 percent) and public (4.2
percent) sectors, however, in view of the surge in labor productivity, unit labor cost growth
remained low, thus mitigating inflationary pressures from the supply side.
Fiscal policy
Despite the political transition and the increasing security needs, the authorities
continued, in 2006, with their strategy of fiscal consolidation and remained committed to the
key principles that were agreed upon during the budget preparations at the end of 2005. The
tight expenditure envelope, which adhered to real spending growth of 1 percent (annually),
was maintained, and together with the buoyant revenues, contributed to the reduction of the
budget deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP and to the fall of the debt-to-GDP ratio to 88 percent. In
2006, fiscal restraint and a firm privatization process continued to support the business
sector’s activity and were reflected in downsizing of the public sector to 47 percent of GDP,
compared to 56 percent in 2002.
Looking forward, the authorities are committed to continue with fiscal retrenchment.
However, to allow a temporally increase in the defense-related expenditures following the
war, and in view of the government’s decision to raise the limit of public spending growth (in
2

These reforms included the removal of several restrictions on institutional investors’ investment abroad as
well as a reduction of the tax rate differential on investments in Israel and abroad.

3
real terms) to 1.7 percent from 2007 onward,3 the authorities saw merit in adjusting the
deficit ceilings for 2007 and 2008 upward, yet maintaining a downward pattern of the deficit
rules.4 While acknowledging that the spending increase may result in a temporally increase
of the deficit (compared to the 2006 actual level), particularly given the potentially lower
growth of revenues,5 the authorities share staff’s assessment on the need to give debt
reduction high priority. According to the Deficit Reduction Law (DRL) the central
government deficit will not exceed 1 percent of GDP from 2009 onwards, noting their
intention to refer to the deficit rule as a ceiling and not as a target.
The authorities recognize the need to further strengthen fiscal governance
mechanisms. Accordingly, the government established a National Economic Council (NEC)
– an expert advisory body to the Prime Minister - that will support the government’s decision
process on economic and social issues. Among other things, the NEC is responsible for
analyzing the budget proposal and its long-term effects before its submission to the
government, suggesting alternatives if needed and designing policy measures to promote
growth and reduce social gaps. Furthermore, the authorities took some steps to increase
control and transparency of the budget such as, publishing around one third of the defense
budget and setting a limit for approval of the budget to the end of the calendar year.
Monetary issues
In 2006, the rapidly varying inflationary forces, largely affected by unpredictable and
sharp fluctuations of exchange rate and oil prices, shifted the monetary policy stance from
tightening to easing. During the first five months of the year, the mounting inflationary
pressures, stemming mainly from significant depreciation of the Sheqel (in the first quarter),
strong domestic demand and an energy price hike, pushed headline inflation slightly above
the upper limit of the inflation target range (1-3 percent), thus contributing to the
continuation of a gradual policy rate increase from the record-low level of 3.5 percent
(September 2005) to 5.25 percent (May 2006). The outbreak of the conflict in the north
prompted an additional 25bp policy rate increase (August 2006) with a view to mitigating the
impact of a potential increase in risk premium and its adverse impact on financial and foreign
currency markets. These concerns, however, faded away toward the end of the year following
the significant appreciation of the Sheqel against the US dollar, which alongside the decline
of energy prices, pushed the inflation rate downward below the lower limit of the inflation
target range. Consequently, the Bank of Israel (BoI) has gradually reduced the policy rate to
4.5 percent in January, allowing a negative interest rate gap between Israel and the US.

3

The 2007 budget was approved early this month. The cap of 1.7 percent on expenditure growth is in line with
annual population growth.
4
5

The 2007 and 2008 deficit ceilings were increased to 2.9 and 2 percent of GDP, respectively.

In 2007, government’s revenues may decline due to the planned reduction in tax rates and the fact that some of
the 2006 revenues were deemed to be one-off in nature.

4
Overall, CPI declined in 2006 by 0.1 percentage points,6 which is significantly below
the lower limit of inflation target range. Nonetheless, the BoI adheres to the flexible inflation
targeting approach, thus permitting short-run deviations from the target in order to smooth
the changes in interest rate and preserve financial stability. The BoI will continue to closely
monitor price developments, with the intention of achieving the inflation target over the
medium term. In this regard, the BoI’s baseline scenario, which assumes inter alia stability in
exchange rate and energy prices, indicates that the inflation rate will gradually increase
toward the mid-point of the target range later in 2007. This scenario is broadly in line with
staff’s assessment.
It is worth noting that, despite the transformation in the political domain and to some
extent the deterioration in the security situation, financial stability has maintained and
inflation expectations for both the short and long term remained within the inflation target
range. This serves as a testimony to Israel’s strong economic fundamentals as well as to
investors’ confidence that the authorities will continue to carry out growth-supporting
policies and maintain price and financial stability.
This year, the BoI continued to improve monetary policy transparency by starting
publication of the minutes of the interest rate discussions in the format adopted by central
banks of advanced economies throughout the world. Together with the semi-annual inflation
reports, the minutes describe the considerations that led to the interest rate determination as
well as of the risks and challenges ahead. Additionally, the Bank of Israel is currently
engaged in promoting the new Bank of Israel Law, which among other things defines internal
and external control mechanisms for the Bank, and will make transparency obligatory, while
at the same time ensuring the Bank's essential professional independence.
Financial sector developments and policies
Although the Israeli banks have a relatively low level of profitability and
capitalization, and have relatively high level of problem loans, the authorities note with
satisfaction that since 2004 there has been a positive trend in most financial indicators. In this
regard, banks have reported higher earnings, improved capital ratios, decreased levels of
NPLs (including the construction sector) and increased levels of loan-loss reserves.
Moreover, the banks have been improving, under the guidance of the Banking Supervision
Department, their internal controls, which further contribute to their soundness and stability.
The implementation of Basel II, which until now has been lagging behind other countries,
will get the highest priority in the 2007 working plan of the Banking Supervision Department
with substantial resources devoted to this project.
The authorities are fully aware of the need to devise a better supervisory system of
the financial sector. This consideration of supervisory architecture is still at an early stage.
Therefore, staff's discussion of pros and cons of various supervisory structures, as well as the
discussion of strengths and weaknesses of the existing Israeli supervisory system makes an
important contribution to this process. While this process may take time, already three
6

The CPI excluding housing, fruit and vegetables – a usual measure for core CPI – rose by 0.9 percentage
points.

5
supervisors – BoI, Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Israel Securities Authority (ISA) –
coordinate the supervisory rules and procedures at the highest level as well as through ad-hoc
forums at which staff of those agencies meet in order to achieve consistency in, for example,
rules governing conflict of interest. The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, the
drafting of which is in its final stage, will further enhance this cooperation.
Structural reforms and poverty reduction
The authorities are continuing with their reform agenda to boost competition and
efficiency in the markets. In the past year they split up the Israel Oil Refineries into two
separate companies (Ashdod and Haifa) and privatized the company in Ashdod with the
intention of privatizing the second (and largest) oil refinery in Haifa during 2007. A step
toward full privatization of the post services has been taken this year with the establishment
of the Israel Post Office Company. In 2007 the authorities intend to sell the government’s
remaining share of Bank Leumi to the private sector. Additionally, ongoing efforts are made
to reform the electricity and water sectors, merge several municipalities and sign an “Open
skies” agreement with the EU in order to promote competition in air transportation.
The authorities acknowledge the essential need to reduce poverty and decrease
inequality. In recent years, they addressed these issues mainly by introducing various
measures designed at stimulating labor force participation through negative incentives such
as cutting transfer payments and tightening eligibility criteria, which is one of the factors that
had a positive effect on the rise in the participation rate. Active Labor Market Policies such
as vocational training, aimed at enhancing the skills of the unemployed in order to integrate
them in the job market, were also implemented, though with relatively limited success. The
merits of other measures, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which subsidizes
low wage working families, are still being examined.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On January 19, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Israel.1
Background
Strong macroeconomic conditions and sound domestic policies have significantly improved
Israel’s growth performance and prospects, notwithstanding political uncertainties and the
hostilities in the north during the summer of 2006. Since 2004, the economy expanded in the
4−6 percent range annually, with real GDP growth reaching an estimated 5.0 percent in 2006.
Key drivers of the expansion included improving internal security and productivity; buoyant
external demand; exceptionally benign financial conditions, notably falling risk premia; and
sound macroeconomic policies. Concurrently, the current account surplus continued to widen to
an estimated 5 percent of GDP for 2006.
Inflationary pressures are subdued and monetary policy has been easing as of late. As spare
capacity was reduced through mid 2006, inflationary pressure first built and the Bank of Israel
(BoI) raised its policy rate to 5.5 percent for August 2006. However, since then an appreciation
of the sheqel has been passing through swiftly to domestic prices and energy prices have fallen.
As a result, Consumer Price Index inflation moved below the BoI’s 1−3 percent target range and
the Bank cut its policy rate in several steps to 4.5 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Tight expenditure policy together with the recovery reduced the central government budget
deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2006, notwithstanding unexpected expenditure related to the
hostilities in the north. For 2007, the central government budget deficit is expected to widen on
account of higher expenditure related to these hostilities and moderating revenue growth but is
targeted not to exceed 2.9 percent of GDP. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been falling faster
than expected but remains high at just under 90 percent of GDP.
Financial soundness indicators have been recovering although some weaknesses on bank
balance sheets that relate mainly to previous boom-bust cycles remain. Financial markets
performed well during 2006 and the improved economic outlook and enhanced fiscal policy and
credibility continued to attract strong foreign capital inflows.
For 2007, real GDP growth is forecast around 4½ percent. The risks to growth lie on the
downside and include a disruptive unwinding of global current account imbalances as well as
geopolitical uncertainties. Inflation would remain below the Bol’s 1−3 percent target range but
return toward the midpoint during the second half of 2007, assuming unchanged exchange
rates and energy prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on the strong performance of the economy and
the notable improvements in macroeconomic policies. Executive Directors identified the need to
further strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks, particularly through public debt reduction,
as the key challenge facing policymakers.
Directors considered the foundation for continued rapid economic expansion in 2007 to be
strong. However, downside risks, notably a disruptive unwinding of global imbalances, investor
flight from risk, and geopolitical uncertainties are significant.
Directors supported the recent easing of monetary policy given falling inflationary pressure.
They noted that amid buoyant activity inflation is forecast to return toward the mid-point of the
central bank’s target range later in 2007. Absent an increase in downside risks to prices, notably
related to continued appreciation of the sheqel, a further significant addition of stimulus does not
appear necessary.
Directors welcomed the increased transparency resulting from the publication of minutes of
monetary policy discussions. This has contributed to keeping inflation expectations well
anchored despite more volatile headline inflation. Directors generally viewed that the BoI should
consider the regular publication of its inflation forecast, to further bolster transparency and
stabilize expectations. In this regard, a few others urged caution, considering forecasting
difficulties.
Directors praised the strengthening of fiscal policy and advised an appreciable overperformance
relative to the proposed central government budget deficit ceiling for 2007. This would
contribute to a rapid lowering of the high public debt ratio and thereby create more room for

3
policies to respond to unexpected changes in economic and social conditions without risking
adverse public debt dynamics. Directors stressed that fiscal policy should stay on a predictable
and credible path toward a significantly lower debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium run. Real
expenditure growth should be held at or below the 1.7 percent ceiling and debt reduction should
be given priority over tax cuts. Together with some cuts in the many tax expenditure programs,
this could bring the general government accounts close to balance in just over 5 years, rapidly
lower the debt ratio, and create a buffer against shocks as well as room for more policy
maneuver.
Directors advocated a more holistic and forward-looking approach to fiscal policy. In particular,
budget documents should include a comprehensive analysis of medium-term fiscal policy
challenges and risks. It was viewed that consideration could be given to the introduction of
independent, nonpartisan fiscal governance mechanisms that could appraise policies in a
forward-looking manner, building on existing institutions. This could foster the constituency for
deficit and debt reduction.
Directors welcomed the accelerated financial deepening that is fostering the economy’s
integration with the rest of the world and adding to growth potential. However, they pointed out
that this process calls for the resources and independence of financial supervisors to be
buttressed commensurately. Accordingly, they highlighted several policy priorities, including
quick passage of the BoI law; re-enforcing risk-based supervision through accelerated
implementation of Basel II; improving the institutional framework for insurance supervision; and
aligning prudential policies and practices across all sectors. Efforts to strengthen the anti-money
laundering and terrorist financing regime should continue.
Directors welcomed advances in the areas of privatization and labor market policy, as well as
the authorities’ intention to place greater emphasis on combating poverty.
Directors observed that Israel meets the Special Data Dissemination Standard specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and that quality of the data is adequate for the
purpose of surveillance.

and projections
1/ Preliminary estimates.
2/ IMF staff projections.
3/ As of October, 2006.
4/ The Bank of Israel set the policy rate at 4.5 percent for January, 2007.
5/ As of September, 2006.
6/ National definition, cash basis.
7/ International definition, accrual basis. On the difference between central and general government deficits during 2001-05: some
0.4 percent of GDP is accounted for by local governments' deficits and the remainder by the difference between accrual and cash bases
accounting. On the latter, the key factor is the CPI indexation component that is paid on all NIS debt when it matures and is recorded
below the line in the central government balance, but above the line in the general government balance when it accrues.
