Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Japan
Approved by James Gordon and Tamim Bayoumi
June 17, 2010


This report is based on discussions held in Tokyo during May 10–19. The team
comprised Mr. Gordon (Head), Ms. Kochhar, Messrs. Kang, Danninger, Syed, and
Tokuoka, Ms. Berkmen (all APD), and Mr. Steinberg (OAP). Mr. Lipsky joined the
mission for the policy discussions and to chair a seminar co-hosted by OAP and the
Ministry of Finance on reshaping the global financial landscape and the implications for
Asia. Messrs. Kotegawa and Yamaoka (both OED) participated in the policy discussions.



Counterparts. The mission met with Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Shirakawa, Senior
Vice Minister of Finance Noda, Senior Vice Minister of the Cabinet Office Furukawa,
Senior Vice Minister of the Cabinet Office Ohtsuka, Vice Minister of Finance for
International Affairs Tamaki, BoJ Deputy Governors Nishimura and Yamaguchi, and other
senior officials, academics, and private sector representatives.



Context of past surveillance. In its last consultation, Fund staff and the authorities agreed
on the need for fiscal consolidation with adjustment to begin once the crisis abates. Staff
also supported the BoJ’s accommodative monetary policy stance and recommended
strengthening the resilience of the banking sector to a protracted slowdown. There was a
consensus that growth needed to be rebalanced towards stronger domestic demand.



Selected Issues Papers assess the impact of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms on
growth in Japan and explore policy options to raise medium-term growth (investment and
household spending).



Japan’s exchange rate is market determined. Japan has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of current
international transactions, with the exceptions of those notified to the Fund in accordance
with Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51) and UN-sanctioned restrictions on external
payments for security reasons.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: Japan’s economy continues to improve led by robust exports and policy stimulus
while deflation pressures appear to be easing. The recent turmoil in Europe has raised
the uncertainty and downside risks around the outlook and sharpened the focus on
Japan’s high public debt ratio, which is one of the highest among advanced economies.
Bringing down the debt ratio will require a large and protracted adjustment that will be
made more credible by an early increase in the consumption tax. Further easing
measures by the Bank of Japan would support the recovery and help combat deflation.
Policy messages:










The cyclical upswing offers an opportunity to embark on critical reforms. Fiscal
adjustment should start in FY2011 (starting April 2011) beginning with a modest
consumption tax hike.
To put the public net debt ratio firmly on a downward path, the authorities should
aim for a 1 percent of GDP annual reduction in the structural primary deficit over
ten years. Achieving this goal will require a combination of additional tax rate
increases, expenditure containment, and entitlement reform.
A fiscal rule capping the level of public debt and targeting a primary surplus would
strengthen credibility and help lock-in fiscal gains.
Further easing measures by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could help support the recovery
and reduce deflation pressures.
Supervisors should ensure that banks properly manage risks from a slower recovery
and heightened market volatility and take appropriate steps to strengthen their
capital position.
To raise potential growth and support fiscal consolidation, structural reforms should
aim to raise labor participation, improve access to financing for innovative firms,
and increase productivity in new growth sectors (e.g., health care and environment).
I. INTRODUCTION

1.
Japan’s economy is gaining strength, but vulnerability to sovereign risk is rising.
Sizeable policy support and strong external demand, especially from Asia, are driving the
recovery, but large fiscal deficits driven by fiscal stimulus and the recession have pushed
public debt to unprecedented levels. With global scrutiny of public finances on the rise, the
need for early and credible fiscal adjustment has increased. At the same time, deflation has
re-emerged, while the financial system faces a number of challenges including from renewed
financial market turmoil and changes in global financial regulations.
2.
The new government has signaled a greater willingness to consider needed fiscal
reforms. In response to growing concerns over Japan’s public debt, Prime Minister Kan has
voiced support for greater fiscal discipline and an early debate on the consumption tax—
issues which will likely feature in the government‘s medium-term growth and fiscal
strategies due at end-June. The future direction of reforms, however, will likely depend on

4
the outcome of July Upper House elections with possible ramifications for the government’s
policy priorities.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Japan’s export-led recovery continued to strengthen through the first quarter
of 2010. Following a deep recession—GDP declined 5.2 percent in 2009—growth
accelerated to 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of 2010 amid signs of exports spilling
over to domestic demand.

Labor market. The labor market is
gradually recovering. The
unemployment rate declined from its
peak in mid-2009 to 5.1 percent in
April 2010, while the ratio of job
offers-to-seekers has begun rising
from depressed levels. Total
earnings grew for the first time in
March (1 percent y/y) after having
fallen continuously since the
Lehman shock.

Consumption. Despite a sharp fall in
disposable household income,
private consumption contributed
positively to growth in 2009.
Spending was supported mainly by
fiscal stimulus, especially subsidies
on “green” durable goods that
accounted for much of the spending
growth.



Exports. Japan’s real exports have
rebounded after falling by almost
40 percent (y/y) at the trough of the
crisis. Strong demand from Asia,
especially for capital goods, has
supported the recovery, pushing
export growth to 30 percent s.a.a.r.
in Q1 2010. The rebound, however,
has lagged that of other advanced
economies due to the yen’s
appreciation and a shift in demand
away from higher-value added
products in which Japan specializes.

Deflation has re-emerged, mainly reflecting the large output gap as well as
structural factors. Since the onset of the Lehman crisis, consumer prices have steadily
declined as a result of an unwinding of the commodity price boom and falling demand.

product and labor markets, lower

Output gap. Since the onset of the
global crisis, core inflation in Japan
has fallen by more than in other
advanced economies. A significant
part of the decline can be attributed
to Japan’s deeper recession and
larger output gap (estimated at
around 6 percent of GDP at end2009). With the recovery gaining
strength, core inflation has
stabilized at around -1.1 percent
since late 2009.1

Financial markets have been hit hard by the renewed global turmoil. After
showing signs of recovering through March of 2010, equity prices have fallen and the yen
again appreciated on Europe-related fears, but the fallout on money and credit markets has so
far been limited.

1

Core inflation (excluding fresh food) fell to -1.5 percent (y/y) in April 2010 as a result of a one-off
administrative price change related to the introduction of high school tuition waivers which staff estimated to
have lowered the CPI by ½ percentage point. The impact of the price change is expected to disappear after one
year.

6







Financial conditions. Financial
conditions continued to improve
in 2009, but remain tighter than preLehman reflecting the yen’s real
appreciation and falling equity
prices. Since end of March 2009,
the Nikkei index has rebounded by
around 20 percent (as of end of May
2010), but the rally has lagged that
in the rest of the region and
elsewhere, partly reflecting
weakness in bank shares.
Money markets. The 3-month
LIBOR-OIS spread, an indicator of
counterparty risk, has gradually
narrowed to pre-Lehman levels. The
BoJ’s liquidity operations have
helped to stabilize short-term
money markets, but term spreads
beyond 3 months still remain
elevated.
Sovereign debt markets. Despite
higher public debt and larger
deficits, 10-year Japanese
government bond (JGB) yields have
been stable at around 1.2–
1.4 percent, supported by ample
demand domestically and safe
haven flows. The market has also
been aided by rising corporate
savings, which have been channeled
into JGBs through the banking
system.

The current account surplus has fallen, but the recovery in external demand has
stemmed the decline.




Current account. The current
account surplus shrank further
in 2009, as a result of lower global
interest rates and a stronger yen.
Although export volumes recovered
along with world demand, the
recovery was not as pronounced as
in other countries. As a result, the
trade surplus remained roughly
unchanged at around 1 percent of
GDP, while the income balance
deteriorated in line with low global
interest rates.
Exchange rate. Since the Lehman
shock, the yen has appreciated by
16 percent in real effective terms
(down from close to 25 percent in
early 2009), reflecting an
unwinding of yen carry-trades and a
flight to safety, most recently from
Europe-related concerns.

Recent events in Europe have increased the chances of a tail risk event (Box 1).
A loss of market confidence in sovereign debt could lead to a sudden rise in risk premia
worldwide and push up long-term interest rates in Japan. Under such a scenario, growth
would slow sharply, further prolonging deflation, and undermining the fiscal position. A
sharp slowdown would also spill over to the rest of the region through reduced trade and
capital flows.
The Authorities’ Views
10.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks.



Near-term outlook. Officials noted that the outlook had improved in recent months on
the back of robust exports and encouraging signs of strengthening domestic demand.
This view was shared by the BoJ’s Policy Board, which raised its growth forecast in
the April semi-annual Economic Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices to
1.8 percent in FY2010 and 2.0 percent in FY2011. With concerns over deflation
diminishing with the strong recovery, the BoJ forecasts core inflation (excluding fresh
food) to turn positive in FY2011, in line with staff’s projections.



Risks. The authorities noted that the uncertainty around the economic outlook had
increased in light of the renewed financial turmoil. In addition, they expressed
concern about rising asset price inflation and a possible hard landing in China, which
is a significantly larger export market than Europe (19 vs. 12 percent of exports
in 2009).

9

Box 1. Potential Impact of Global Sovereign Distress on Japan.
To assess the impact of sovereign distress on growth, two downside tail-risk scenarios were
explored using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model.

1. Sovereign debt crisis and increased risk premium. Assessing the macroeconomic
implications of a sharp rise in government bond yields, this scenario assumes an increase in
the risk premium by 100 basis points for the U.S. and 200 basis points for the euro area
without offsetting fiscal policy. If the risk premium in Japan remains unaffected, growth
would slow through the export and exchange rate channel by between 0.5 to 1 percentage
points in 2010. If, on the other hand, the risk premium in Japan also increases (by 100 basis
points), growth could fall by as much as 2 percentage points. Given depressed demand,
deflation would worsen by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point below the baseline in 2011.

2. Double dip in the advanced economies.

Both tail risk scenarios can potentially occur together significantly affecting exports and growth
prospects. The two scenarios, however, have opposite exchange rate effects. Some of the
appreciation pressures created by a flight to quality in the second scenario would be offset by a
depreciation from a loss in trade in the first scenario. Overall, the negative impact on the growth
rate could be as large as 2–3 percentage points, with deflation remaining below the baseline by
about 1 percentage point in 2011. If accompanied by an independent growth slowdown in China
(e.g. by 5 percent) growth in Japan could be dampened by a further ½-1 percentage point given
the importance of Asia as an export destination (about 50 percent of overall exports).
In the event that inflation expectations become unanchored and deflation self propagates, a
forceful policy response may be needed. With interest rates already at the zero bound,
unconventional measures may be needed, such as full-scale quantitative easing, to stimulate
activity and anchor inflation expectations. In contrast, fiscal policy has limited room to respond
and adjustment would need to proceed, although possibly at a more moderate pace. However, if
the slowdown was linked to a rise in the sovereign risk premium, fiscal consolidation may need
to accelerate to restore confidence in public finances.

10
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Japan’s recovery continues, but vulnerability to sovereign risk has risen. Timely and decisive
policy action and strong external demand are driving the recovery, but large fiscal deficits
have pushed public debt to even higher levels. With global scrutiny of public finances
increasing, the need for policy action to rein in the large fiscal deficit has risen. Such efforts
would be helped by additional measures to combat deflation and policies to spur growth
while safeguarding financial stability. Against this backdrop, this year’s Article IV
consultation focused on policies to achieve lasting fiscal adjustment, measures to support the
recovery and combat deflation, and reforms to raise medium-term growth.

The severe recession and the fiscal response have pushed debt to unprecedented
levels.


Fiscal developments. The overall
fiscal deficit is estimated to have
widened to 10¼ percent of GDP
in 2009 compared to 2½ percent of
GDP in 2007, reflecting lower
nominal GDP, fiscal stimulus, and a
sharp drop in corporate revenue. The
deficit is projected to narrow
moderately to 9¾ percent of GDP
in 2010, with a modest reduction in
stimulus and a gradual recovery in
revenue.



Debt position. Net public debt rose sharply from 80 percent of GDP in 2007 to
110 percent of GDP at end-2009 (215 percent in gross terms), one of the highest among
advanced economies.



Fiscal risks. Although the near-term funding risks are lowered by the large share of
public debt held domestically (95 percent), sizeable household savings, and a current
account surplus, the capacity of the market to absorb JGBs will gradually diminish as
population aging reduces saving.2

13.
The authorities are planning to release their medium-term fiscal strategy by
end-June. A strategy for reducing Japan’s public debt will need to take into account Japan’s
comparatively low expenditure ratio and a low revenue share from indirect taxes.


Expenditure. The scope for further
spending cuts is limited. General
government expenditure including
social security was 33 percent of
GDP in 2007, the lowest among G-7
economies. Since the early 2000s,
non-social security expenditures have
been flat, but social security related
spending has risen and will continue
to do so with an aging population.

Tax revenue. Japan’s overall tax
revenue is small by international
standards at 18 percent of GDP
in 2007, partly due to the low
consumption tax rate at 5 percent. In
addition, the personal income tax
system features large deductions that
serve to reduce average tax rates. By
contrast, the corporate tax rate
(40 percent) is comparatively high.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
14.
Fiscal adjustment should begin in FY2011 to capitalize on the cyclical recovery
and be sustained for at least a decade. Staff analysis suggests that stabilizing the net debtto-GDP ratio at 140 percent of GDP (240 percent in gross terms) in 2014 and placing it
firmly on a downward path would require a reduction of the structural primary deficit by
about 1 percent per year for the next 10 years (see Appendix I). This adjustment path would
strike a balance between reversing the debt dynamics in a decisive manner (benefiting
medium-term growth prospects) and safeguarding the recovery given Japan’s low current trend
growth (estimated at 1 percent). Announcing an upfront increase in the consumption tax
would strengthen credibility of the adjustment plan and boost confidence in the long-term
viability of the social security system.
15.
Adjustment could be achieved in a number of ways centered around an increase
in the consumption tax rate (see table). Given the limited scope for cutting expenditures,
fiscal adjustment will need to rely mainly on new revenue sources and limits on spending
growth. In addition to letting fiscal stimulus expire (savings of 1–2 percent of GDP), the
main elements of a credible package could include:


Comprehensive tax reform. A gradual increase of the consumption tax to 15 percent
beginning in FY2011 and distributed over several years, could generate 4–5 percent of
GDP of revenue. This measure could be combined with a reduction of personal income
tax allowances and corporate tax reform to stimulate domestic investment. The progress
made in introducing a single number system for taxpayers and social security should
help in strengthening collections.



Limiting expenditure growth. Containing public spending growth and reforming
pension entitlements in line with rising life expectancy could generate additional
savings of around 3–4 percent of GDP over the next decade. Measures could include
freezing non-social security spending in nominal terms; limiting fast-rising health-care
costs and other social entitlements; introducing an income cap on social transfers; and
raising the statutory retirement age (currently at 65 years).

16.
Fiscal adjustment may dampen activity in the near term, but would raise growth
over time (Box 2). Based on GIMF model simulations, staff estimates that relative to its
baseline, the fiscal reform program would slow growth by about ⅓ percentage point per year
on average over the first 3–5 years. Thereafter, GDP would expand at a faster rate than in the
baseline as public debt declines and gains in confidence boost investment and consumption.
If accompanied by reforms to boost productivity, longer-term growth benefits could be
larger.

13
Box 2. Estimating the Growth Impact of Fiscal Adjustment1
Simulations based on the IMF’s GIMF model were used to assess the possible growth impact
of a 1 percent of GDP per year fiscal adjustment over the next decade. The scenario assumes a
phased-in increase of the consumption tax (raising revenues by 5 percent of GDP) and a
decline in corporate income tax (reducing revenues by ½ percent of GDP). In addition, the
scenario assumes a decline in government consumption by 2 percent of the GDP and in public
investment by ½ percent of GDP. The rest of the adjustment comes from transfers. The
simulations also assume some frontloading of adjustment with more than half of the adjustment
taking place within the first 3 years, mainly as a result of higher consumption taxes.
In the short-term, fiscal adjustment could
depress growth by as little as
0.3-0.5 percentage points per year. The
negative impact stems from a reduction in
domestic demand as a result of a gradual
increase in consumption taxes, lower
government consumption, and declining
public investment. The demand effect is
magnified by the limited scope for
monetary policy at the zero interest rate
bound, but could be partly offset by the
positive investment response from a
reduction in corporate taxes.

However, in the medium term, assuming accrued benefits from improved consumer and
investor confidence, growth could rise above the baseline by about ½ percent per year. In
addition to higher investment from lower corporate taxes, the main growth benefits from fiscal
consolidation are:



Reduction in precautionary savings. Part of the decline in consumption due to higher
consumption taxes would be offset by a reduction in precautionary savings. In particular,
younger generations appear concerned about fiscal sustainability and the pension system
and are potentially saving more now than otherwise.



Reduction of the risk premium. Japan is likely to pay a risk premium on its debt over the
long term in the absence of fiscal consolidation. Such an increase in risk premium would
increase the cost of capital, depressing investment and growth.



Confidence effects. A credible fiscal consolidation could also improve business
confidence and encourage investment.

As these benefits are likely to materialize gradually, the negative demand effects will dominate
in the short term. Fiscal adjustment will also raise national savings compared to the baseline,
pulling up the medium-term current account balance. In contrast, real GDP could be depressed
significantly if no policy action is taken, with risk premium increasing gradually over time and
potential GDP declining as investment prospects worsen.

17.
Fiscal adjustment would be aided by the adoption of a fiscal rule. An explicit
long-term fiscal rule would strengthen the commitment to cap public debt and anchor
expectations of sustainable fiscal policy. Such a framework was recently adopted in Germany
and has generally been effective in constraining debt growth in Switzerland (“debt brake”).3
In Japan, a new fiscal framework could target a primary fiscal balance consistent with a debt
limit and be based on prudent economic assumptions and narrowly defined escape clauses.
18.
Given the large and growing public debt stock, effective debt management
remains critical. The authorities have gradually raised the average maturity of outstanding
public debt (including short-term financing bills) to an estimated 5–5 ½ years. Nonetheless,
gross public financing needs for maturing and new debt is large partly due to a sizeable
increase in short-term financing bills.4 Adopting an asset-liability management approach
covering both JGBs and financing bills could strengthen public debt management and the
monitoring of maturity risk.

15

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
19.
The authorities are determined to tackle fiscal consolidation to maintain public
confidence.


Timing and composition. While the authorities shared the view that fiscal
consolidation was needed, they stressed that given downside risks, including from
external developments and deflation, the timing and pace of the adjustment should be
decided prudently. That said, they agreed that current events in Europe provided
greater urgency to embark on reforms. In this regard, options were being explored to
limit JGB issuances in FY2011 to the current level. The authorities shared the staff’s
conclusion that revenue measures focused on raising the consumption tax would be
necessary to close the fiscal gap. They observed that a higher consumption tax would
have the additional advantage of reducing the cyclical volatility of the tax base. They
also indicated that discussions were ongoing about a possible reduction in the
corporate income tax rate.



Growth effects. The authorities concurred that credible fiscal consolidation could
have positive confidence effects in the near term, potentially overcoming the negative
demand effects from fiscal consolidation. They also noted that raising trend growth
through their soon-to-be-released growth strategy would support adjustment.



Fiscal strategy. As part of a possible fiscal rule, the authorities are considering a
“pay-as you-go” requirement (where new expenditures would be funded by offsetting
spending cuts or additional revenue) and introducing a multi-year expenditure
framework to strengthen budget discipline and planning. The authorities stressed that
any medium-term adjustment plans would need to be based on prudent
macroeconomic assumptions and include sufficient flexibility to avoid the fiscal
strategy being derailed by unexpected swings in growth. Because of synergies
between fiscal and structural reforms, the authorities were exploring the possibility of
comprehensive reform legislation linking fiscal consolidation to growth enhancing
measures and social security reforms.



Debt management. Given the large domestic investor base, the authorities saw little
near-term financing risk. They indicated that demand for long-term debt was robust,
particularly among life insurance companies, and that they would continue
lengthening maturities of JGBs to reduce roll-over risks. The authorities stressed that
in assessing fiscal risks, short-term financing bills should be treated separately from
JGBs since the former are primarily used for cash management and are backed by the
government’s foreign exchange reserve holdings.

16

B. Monetary Policy Options to Combat Deflation
Background
20.
To combat the recession and re-emergence of deflation, the BoJ adopted a
number of additional measures:


Reducing term premia. In December 2009, the BoJ introduced a 3-month funds
supplying facility to lower short-term interest rates that was doubled in size in
March 2010 to 20 trillion yen. The introduction of the new facility was followed by a
modest decline of the 3-month interest rate and coincided with a leveling off of the
inflation rate. In December 2009, the BoJ also unwound its commercial paper and
corporate bond purchasing program in response to improved market conditions.



Communications. In December 2009, the BoJ clarified its understanding of medium
to long-term price stability to correspond to an inflation rate in “a positive range of
2 percent or lower” (previously “in the range approximately between 0 and
2 percent”). The BoJ also reiterated that an inflation rate of 1 percent was the midpoint of most Policy Board members’ understanding of price stability.



Loan facility. To “strengthen the foundations for economic growth”, the BoJ
announced in April 2010 the introduction of a new facility that would supply funds at
a very low interest rate to private banks to finance lending to innovative firms.



Dollar swap agreement. In response to financial market strains in Europe and to
preempt any emerging dollar funding pressures, the BoJ re-activated in May 2010 its
dollar swap agreement with the U.S. Federal Reserve and re-established its U.S. dollar
funds supplying operations.

early 2007. If deflation expectations spread and growth slows again, the risk could rise that

17
deflation self-propagates by depressing wage growth, discouraging investment, and
undermining the fiscal position.
22.
Additional easing measures could address deflation risks and support the
recovery.


Additional easing. Building on the BoJ’s success in lowering short-term interest rates,
consideration could be given to extending the size and maturity of its funds supplying
operations to 6 months or beyond to reduce still elevated term-spreads. Such action,
in turn, might alleviate some appreciation pressures on the exchange rate. In addition,
the BoJ could consider purchasing a wider array of assets, such as low-rated corporate
bonds, to stimulate activity and help close the output gap.



Supporting growth. As part of the BoJ’s proposal to support growth, consideration
could be given to improving access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SME), which are an important source of innovation and change but continue to face
financing constraints according to the Tankan survey. For example, the BoJ could
broaden the scope of acceptable collateral to include low-rated securitized SME
loans, which could encourage the development of a new market for lending to SMEs.

23.
If the recovery falters and deflation worsens, the BoJ could consider a formal
quantitative easing framework to stimulate activity and anchor inflation expectations.
Such a move, however, would need to be balanced against the risks that large scale purchases
of JGBs without a credible fiscal strategy in place would undermine fiscal discipline and
raise sovereign risks.
24.
During this period of heightened uncertainty, clear communication is essential.
This is especially so in light of a number of administrative price changes (e.g. to high school
tuition and tobacco taxes) and the rebasing of the CPI in 2011 which could affect inflation
expectations. The BoJ has already clarified that the Policy Board does not “tolerate” year-onyear inflation that is equal to or below zero percent. To further guide expectations, the BoJ
could consider communicating its intention to maintain easy monetary conditions until Policy
Board members’ one-year core inflation forecast exceeds 1 percent (the midpoint of the
understanding of price stability) provided that financial imbalances remain absent under the
“second perspective.”5

5

The BoJ’s Policy Board bases its monetary policy on the assessment of economic developments from two
perspectives. The first perspective involves analysis of the most likely outlook for economic activity and prices
1–2 years ahead. The second perspective assesses a broad variety of risks to the outlook, including lowprobability but high-cost events (such as asset bubbles) over a longer time horizon.

18
The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
25.
The BoJ remains open to further policy options, but at this juncture, views its
monetary policy stance as appropriate.


Deflation. The BoJ viewed deflation as primarily the result of large excess capacity in
an environment of structurally low inflation and judged the growing recovery to have
contributed to an easing of deflationary pressures. As a result, in its current economic
outlook report, Policy Board members projected deflation to end in FY2011, one year
earlier than previously anticipated.



Monetary stance. With the recovery gaining strength, officials thought that the current
accommodative monetary policy stance with a virtually zero policy rate was
appropriate. Along with the economic recovery and improvement in prices, the
stimulating effects of the current easing measures would be more enhanced.
Conditions in the commercial paper and corporate bond markets have returned to
normal with credit spreads declining and funding constraints appear having abated. As
a result, the BoJ saw little benefit from expanding the range of eligible collateral as
current facilities already accepted a wide range of financial assets including assetbacked securities and banks were not facing liquidity constraints. Expanding eligibility
to include lower-rated assets was unlikely to have a significant impact while raising
substantial risks, such as moral hazard and distorting resource allocation.



Communication. Officials felt that the BoJ’s monetary policy communication was
effective and that the market had fully internalized the Policy Board’s intention of
consistently maintaining accommodative monetary conditions. They had reservations
about linking the BoJ’s policy more explicitly to the inflation outlook and mentioned
that recent international experience had underscored that focusing narrowly on
inflation could result in overlooking the build-up of financial imbalances. The BoJ
reiterated that it remained committed to explaining its monetary stance, assessing both
the economic and price outlook and risks from its “two perspectives”.
C. Strengthening the Financial System

Background
26.
The banking sector has returned to profitability and strengthened its capital
position.


Profitability. Following their first annual loss in five years, both regional and major
banks returned to profitability in FY2009. The turnaround mainly reflected a pickup
in fee income, lower credit costs, and gains on securities holdings.



Credit quality. NPL ratios rose for major banks to around 2 percent while falling
marginally for regional banks to under 4 percent, partly due to an easing of loan
classification criteria in November 2008.

19


Capital ratios. Major banks’ Tier-1 ratios have increased to around 9 percent in the
first half of FY2009, bolstered by common equity issuances amounting to over
¥3 trillion, while the ratio for regional banks remained stable at 8.7 percent.

27.
Bank lending has been declining since end-2009, partly reflecting weak
corporate demand and a pickup in bond issuances by large companies.


SME credit. Overall bank lending
has declined, primarily due to weak
corporate demand as well as a shift
back to market funding by higherrated companies. Meanwhile
lending to SMEs continued to
contract, despite the earlier
expansion of public credit
guarantees.



JGB holdings. As loan demand has fallen, banks have shifted to holding more
government bonds, with the share of JGBs in total assets growing from 11 to
16 percent since September 2008.

Policy Issues and Staff views
28.
The main risks to the financial system are from a slow recovery and increased
market volatility.


Credit risk. Nonperforming loans could rise if the recovery slows and financial
conditions tighten. Prolonged deflation could further undermine bank profitability
through low net interest margins. In this environment, supervisors should encourage
banks to rigorously monitor credit risks and, where appropriate, take action to
restructure distressed borrowers.



Market risk. Despite the progress in
reducing banks’ stockholdings
(which declined by an estimated
6 percent in FY2009), major banks
still carry significant equity exposure
as a share of Tier 1 capital (around
50 percent). In contrast, banks,
especially regional ones, have
increased their exposure to interest
rate risk along with their larger JGB
holdings. Supervisors should
highlight the importance of proper

risk management and emphasize the need to follow prudential guidelines, as recently
done by the FDIC in the United States.


Spillovers and volatility. Japan’s financial system so far has largely been unaffected
by recent events in Europe. According to BIS data, Japanese banks’ direct exposure
to Southern European banks is limited at around $40 billion (½ percent of total
assets), but reliance on European cross-border funding is large ($484 billion
representing two-thirds of cross-border financing). While Japanese banks thus far
have not experienced funding problems, the impact of a sharp pull back by European
banks or prolonged market volatility could be substantial U.S. dollar funding
pressures (similar to the Lehman shock). In this regard, the BoJ’s recent decision to
join other central banks in re-establishing US$ swap facilities with the U.S. Federal
Reserve provides a useful backstop.

29.
Japanese banks may need to raise additional capital and boost core profitability
to adjust to changes in global regulations and the domestic environment.


New global financial regulations. To strengthen the resilience of the financial system,
the Basel Committee (BCBS) has proposed strengthening capital standards and
limiting leverage. Although the impact will depend on the definition and level of the
capital standards and leverage ratios, these changes could have an impact on major
banks in Japan who rely relatively heavily on hybrid capital and deferred tax assets or
hold significant amounts of JGBs. Although Japanese banks’ average leverage ratio,
(measured by Tier 1 to total assets) is low by international comparison, banking
systems in countries with similar levels of leverage tend to have higher core Tier 1
capital ratios. To ensure financial stability, the authorities should continue to stand
ready to inject public funds where necessary and facilitate the consolidation of banks
with weak capital bases.6



Japan Post. Proposals to double Japan Post’s deposit ceiling (to ¥20 million) and
broaden its range of lending activities would increase the size of an already large
financial institution, raising the potential for systemic risk. New lending activities
may also weaken profitability of private banks through unfair competition.

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
30.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the risks and policy
directions, and noted that they were monitoring developments closely.

6

The authorities have made ¥12 trillion in public funds available to help banks bolster their capital ratios, of
which about ¥300 billion has so far been tapped.

21


Credit risk. The authorities shared staff’s concerns regarding credit risks, particularly
if the recovery should falter. However, they noted that bank credit costs had declined
over the last year, and cautioned against impeding the ability of banks to play their
intermediary role and support the recovery.



Interest rate risk. The supervisors acknowledged that the rising share of JGB holdings
posed interest rates risks to bank portfolios. The BoJ’s March Financial System
Report notes that a 100 bps value of interest rate risk relative to Tier 1 has risen to
around 12 percent for the major banks and to around 30 percent for the regional
banks. To contain these risks, banks are required to adopt appropriate risk
management tools, including various stress-tests. On their own part, supervisors were
using prudential guidelines to monitor these risks, such as the outlier criteria which
flags institutions whose interest rate risk exceeds 20 percent of the sum of Tier 1 and
Tier 2 capital.



Spillovers from Europe. The authorities shared the view that direct risks to Japan’s
financial system from exposure to Southern European banks were low. Moreover, the
recent improvement in profitability had bolstered the resilience of the banking
system. Nevertheless, they remain vigilant regarding potential liquidity pressures,
particularly if stresses were to spread to other parts of Europe.



Japan Post. The authorities noted that Japan Post was subject to the same supervisory
oversight as private banks. They considered it difficult to predict the impact of the
proposed doubling of Japan Post’s deposit ceiling, but noted that deposits at Japan
Post had declined in recent years indicating that a higher deposit ceiling may have
only a limited effect on regional banks. They also expected that as reforms were
finalized, the provisionally titled Committee for Postal Reform would ensure a level
playing field with respect to private banks in Japan.

31.
The authorities stressed the importance of carefully examining the impact of any
changes in global financial regulations, especially as the global recovery was still fragile
and bank loans were weak.7 Imposing additional burden on banks might raise the risks of
discouraging bank intermediation. Also uncertainties in future regulations and too abrupt
changes in regulatory frameworks might harm banks’ lending attitude. The authorities also
pointed out that Japanese banks rely less on risky business models and have more stable
sources of funding, such as household deposits. With the impact studies on the proposed
BCBS reforms still underway, the precise calibration of the new rules not expected before
year-end, and extremely limited exposure of Japanese banks’ to risky structured products and
Southern European government bonds, it was too early to determine whether banks would
need additional capital.
7

These topics were discussed in a seminar co-hosted by the OAP and the Japanese Ministry of Finance during
the Article IV mission (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/new051910a.htm).

22

D. Reforms to Raise Medium-Term Growth
Policy Issues and Staff Views
32.
Growth enhancing structural reforms would support fiscal adjustment. In the
outline of the growth strategy (to be finalized in June), the authorities focused on creating
new demand in areas such as the environment, health, and technology. Rapid growth in these
sectors would make an important contribution towards reaching the government’s ambitious
long-term real growth target of 2 percent. In addition, supply-side reforms to foster start-ups,
boost employment, and raise competition could complement demand measures in boosting
medium-term growth (Box 3):

Boosting employment. Staff supports the authorities’ plans to raise female labor force
participation by addressing workplace needs for families with children. Introducing a
new, more flexible regular labor contract could improve employment by encouraging
new hires, especially among temporary workers.

Presently, the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) does not undertake any alternative investments
(such as venture capital, real estate and private equity). By contrast, a number of OECD countries allocate nontrivial shares of their assets to such investments, including CalPERS in the U.S. (14 percent), New Zealand
Superannuation Fund (11 percent), Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (11 percent), and Korea
National Pension Service Fund (2.5 percent).

23

Box 3. Exploring Supply-Side Reforms to Raise Growth
This box summarizes policy options to boost consumption and investment, which are discussed in more
detail in two Selected Issues chapters.1
Private consumption. Japan’s private consumption
share at 55 percent of GDP is low compared to the
G-7 (versus 60 percent). Weak consumption reflects
stagnant disposable income, in particular wages, and
low household property income (representing
4 percent of disposable income in 2007 compared
to 20 percent in the United States). To stimulate
private consumption, wages and property income
could be supported by:
 Service deregulation. Raising productivity in
services, particularly in health care, would boost
wages and corporate profits, which in turn could
further boost income through higher stock returns
and dividend payouts.
 Labor reform. Creating a new regular contract
with weaker employment protection could
encourage firms to hire more regular workers. This
would not only lead to more human capital
investment, but might also address concerns about
inequity between regular and non-regular workers.

spending. For example, promoting reverse home
mortgages could help retirees to access home equity but may require public support as for instance in
the United States, where insurance to banks is provided.

Business investment. At 23 percent of GDP, aggregate investment in Japan is close to the OECD
average, but the share of investment by SMEs and firms in the services sector—the main source of
employment in Japan—has fallen significantly. Staff analysis suggests that this is largely due to credit
constraints and that despite progress with financial restructuring, excess leverage and dependence on
debt financing has held back investment. Germany displays a similar pattern, but there is less evidence
of financing constraints or detrimental effects of debt for U.S. and U.K. firms in recent years.
Promoting investment by SMEs and firms in the services sector would provide an additional engine of
growth. Priorities should include promoting more risk-based (as opposed to collateral-based) lending;
measures to facilitate a wider range of securitization (beyond real estate and other fixed assets); and
widening the pool of venture capital funding for start-ups. Investment could also be strengthened by
facilitating restructuring, including through phasing out full credit guarantees and assisting the exit of
nonviable companies through out-of-court workouts and further bankruptcy reforms.

“Boosting Private Consumption in Japan” and “Raising Medium-Term Growth: What Role can Investment Play?”



Increasing competition. Further deregulation and market opening, particularly in
health, childcare, and other services, would give a boost to productivity and make
Japan a more attractive destination for foreign investment.

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
33.
The authorities view the growth strategy as important to help support the fiscal
adjustment. While full details of the growth strategy had yet to be agreed, the authorities
recognized that some of the reforms put forth by the staff—specifically, to foster start-ups
and boost employment—could complement their own efforts.


Start-ups. The authorities broadly agreed with staff's assessment regarding Japan’s
low business start-up rates and limited venture capital, but expressed reservations
about staff's policy suggestions regarding the use of public assets. The authorities
cautioned against making venture capital investments with public pension assets,
noting that the level of risk may not be appropriate for public funds. While
recognizing that reforms are needed to increase risk-based lending to SMEs, the
authorities view credit guarantees as an effective tool to support SME employment,
which accounts for almost 70 percent of the labor force.



Boosting employment. The authorities were optimistic about measures to increase
female participation in the labor force by both addressing workplace needs for
families with children and introducing policies that would increase the supply of
childcare services. The authorities also shared staff's concerns about the widening gap
between regular and non-regular workers.
V. EXCHANGE RATE, EXTERNAL STABILITY, AND SPILLOVERS

34.
Based on staff analysis, the current value of the yen is consistent with mediumterm fundamentals. The yen has appreciated significantly in real terms during the crisis but
remained broadly constant during late 2009 and early 2010.

Exchange rate assessment. In terms
of the IMF’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates (CGER)’s three
analytical methods, the yen’s
effective exchange rate is estimated
close to its medium-term

The real effective exchange rate is
also currently close to its long-term



Exchange rate framework. Despite the yen’s appreciation, the authorities have not
intervened in foreign exchange markets. The staff continues to support the official
policy that the exchange rate should be market determined, with intervention only
justified to counter disruptive exchange rate movements.

35.
Risks to external stability are currently limited, but heightened risk aversion
could lead to disorderly capital flows. A sustained increase in risk aversion could unwind
yen-carry trades leading to further yen appreciation. Corporates with large holdings of
foreign assets could also begin repatriating overseas funds.
36.
Over the medium term, Japan’s current account surplus will likely remain close
to its equilibrium level with modest growth spillovers to the region. The medium-term
current account balance is projected at around 2 percent of GDP, below levels seen earlier
this decade (3½ percent during 2002–07) owing to lower export demand and population
aging.9 The narrowing current account surplus will help facilitate global rebalancing,
although a sizeable fiscal consolidation, if realized, would lead to a larger current account
surplus. Growth spillovers to the region could be negative in the near-term, as fiscal
adjustment would restrain import demand, but over the longer term positive confidence
effects of consolidation could boost domestic and import demand.
37.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s medium-term outlook for external
balances. They noted that the recent global turmoil and safe haven flows had pushed the yen
higher and this could hurt competitiveness if it persisted.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Timely stimulus and strong external demand have supported the economic
recovery. With the output gap gradually closing, deflationary pressures have begun to ease.
The outlook, however, is subject to considerable uncertainty and risks due to global
sovereign debt concerns. If risk aversion intensifies, further yen appreciation and falling
external demand could weaken the recovery.
39.
Global events have sharpened the focus on Japan’s fiscal problems and raised
the urgency for credible fiscal adjustment. In this light, fiscal adjustment should begin
next year centered around a gradual increase in the consumption tax and followed by a
sustained reduction in the structural primary deficit over the next decade. Sustained
consolidation will require comprehensive tax reform, limits on non-social security spending
growth, and entitlement reforms. A fiscal rule featuring a public debt cap and a primary
surplus target could strengthen credibility and lock-in fiscal gains.

9

The current account norm is estimated 2.8 percent of GDP, and the current account stabilizing NFA at 2009
level is 1.7 percent of GDP.

26
40.
Further easing measures by the BoJ could support the recovery and address the
risks of deflation intensifying. To stimulate activity, the BoJ could extend the maturity of its
funds supplying operations and broaden asset purchases. In a period of heightened
uncertainty, clear communication will also be critical. To better guide expectations, the BoJ
could communicate a stronger intention to maintain policy accommodation until its one-year
core inflation forecast is one percent or above, provided that financial imbalances remain
absent.
41.
The banking sector has continued to improve, but faces a number of challenges.
Banks have returned to profitability and bolstered their capital bases, but risks remain from a
slow recovery and market volatility particularly that emanating from overseas markets.
Banks also face challenges in adapting to new global financial standards. Under these
circumstances, the authorities should ensure that banks follow proper risk management and
stand ready to assist banks, where necessary, in strengthening their financial positions.
42.
An ambitious pro-growth agenda would help support fiscal adjustment. The
government’s new growth strategy aims to promote demand in areas such as the
environment, health and technology. In addition, supply-side reforms to promote start-ups,
boost employment, and increase competition, especially in services, could complement
demand measures in boosting medium-term growth.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. JAPAN: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY10
Staff has updated its assessment of Japan’s public debt sustainability. This annex looks at
three scenarios: i) a no adjustment scenario which leads to a continued rise in the net debt
ratio; ii) a policy adjustment scenario that would reduce the net debt GDP ratio to
100 percent by 2030; and iii) a delayed and more gradual adjustment scenario, where the net
debt ratio would remain at an unsustainably high level long into the future.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Both real GDP growth and the inflation rate are assumed to
converge to 1 percent over the long term (as a result, nominal GDP growth is around
2 percent per year over the next 10 years). The nominal interest rate growth differential is
assumed to converge to 1¼ percent (pre-crisis average since 2000) over the long run.11
No adjustment scenario. With no adjustment, net public debt would rise and approach
250 percent of GDP by 2030. The no adjustment scenario assumes withdrawal of stimulus
(1½ percent of GDP), a modest expenditure adjustment (1 percent of GDP), and unchanged
tax policy (no increase in the consumption tax) over the next 10 years, which altogether
produces an improvement of 2½ percent of GDP in the structural primary balance.
Policy adjustment scenario. Achieving

8.5 percent of GDP, of which

4 percentage points from expenditure reforms (by freezing non social security spending in
nominal terms and limiting growth in social security spending).

1/ Net debt of the general government including the social security fund.

10

The analyses focus on net debt of the general government including the social security fund.

11

Consequently, nominal interest rates are assumed to rise to 3¼ percent (compared to 1.3 percent currently)
over the long run, while growth remains at its 1 percent potential.

12

More specifically, this assumes a combination of i) a consumption tax hike by 10 percentage points
cumulatively (3 percentage points each in 2011 and 2013, and 2 percentage points each in 2015 and 2017); and
ii) a corporate tax cut by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2011.

33

Average adjustment per year

Under this scenario, the net debt GDP ratio
would peak at 140 percent (240 percent of
GDP in gross terms) in 2014 and then
decline to below 100 percent by 2030.
Compared to other countries, the
consolidation pace of about one percentage
point per year can be considered ambitious,
as international experience shows that few
advanced economies have succeeded in
maintaining an adjustment of 1 percent of
GDP or higher annually over 10 years,
possibly reflecting reform fatigue.

Delayed and more gradual adjustment scenario. A further delay relative to the policy
adjustment scenario would leave net public debt at unsustainably high levels (around
140 percent of GDP) long into the future. In this scenario, the start of the consumption hike is
delayed by 3 years to 2014 relative to the policy adjustment scenario and the overall
improvement of the structural primary balance between 2010 and 2020 is reduced to
8.5 percent of GDP (from 10 percent of GDP in the policy adjustment scenario).
Sensitivity analysis. The debt sustainability results are sensitive to macroeconomic
assumptions. In particular, a higher interest rate growth differential (than the baseline of
1¼ percent) would lead to an even faster pace of debt accumulation. For example, in the
policy adjustment scenario, assuming an interest rate growth differential of 4 percent would
fail to stabilize the public debt ratio, while a modestly higher differential of 2 percent would
still bring down the debt ratio but to a higher level. Returning to the public debt ratio to its
pre-crisis level by 2030 would require an adjustment of 12-15 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JAPAN
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
Approved by James Gordon and Tamim Bayoumi
June 25, 2010
The following information has become available since the preparation of the staff report.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The cabinet led by new Prime Minister Naoto Kan endorsed a New Growth Strategy on
June 18, 2010 and a Fiscal Management Strategy on June 22, 2010.
The New Growth Strategy, which builds on an earlier outline from December 2009, targets a
nominal GDP growth rate of 3 percent (2 percent in real terms) over the next decade. It also
aims to bring the unemployment rate below 4 percent from the current 5 percent range.
Measures. The strategy identifies seven key areas for development including the
environment and energy, healthcare, growth of the Asian economy, tourism and local
revitalization, science and technology, employment, and finance (see Box). Noteworthy
measures include efforts to increase Japan’s infrastructure industries overseas (such as high
speed rail), a phased-in reduction of corporate taxes from 40 percent towards the level of
other major advanced economies, and increased childcare services to strengthen female labor
force participation.
Staff views: The new growth strategy contains a number of elements that could help raise
potential growth. Measures aimed at boosting exports of infrastructure industries and
reductions in corporate taxes could raise domestic investment and help Japan capture a larger
share of the growing demand in the region. Other reforms to improve health care, increase
labor participation, and strengthen education could expand labor supply and raise
productivity. The staff report suggests some additional supply side measures focused on
increasing employment, deregulating services, and encouraging more risk-based lending by
private financial institutions that would complement efforts to raise trend growth.
The Fiscal Management Strategy outlines the government’s fiscal plan for the coming
decade to restore confidence in public finances and support sustained growth:

2


Short term: the government will make “utmost efforts” to cap the issuance of new
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in FY2011 (begins April 2011) at the FY2010
level (¥44 trillion). There is also a commitment that central government primary
spending (General Account excluding debt and interest payment) will not exceed the
FY2010 level over the next three years.



Medium- to long-term: the government commits to halving the government primary
deficit in percent of GDP by FY2015 and achieving a primary surplus by FY2020 at
the latest (central and local governments). It aims to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio
around FY2020 targeting a steady decline of the debt ratio from FY2021 on. To help
achieve this goal the government plans to introduce a “pay-as you-go” rule requiring
that any new expenditure be funded by permanent reductions in expenditures or by
additional revenue-raising measures.



Measures. The strategy does not identify the composition or timing of possible
revenue measures, but the government has called for a swift bipartisan discussion on
the details of a comprehensive tax reform package, including changes to the
consumption, income, and corporate taxes. The Prime Minister also mentioned the
need to address equity concerns arising from a potential future increase of the
consumption tax, for example, through reducing the rate on some products. On the
expenditure side, the strategy is explicit about the need for medium-term spending
caps, but does not discuss specific entitlement reforms that may be necessary.



The government also issued a
Medium-term Provisional Economic
Fiscal Calculation to illustrate the
size of the adjustment required.
Under “conservative”
macroeconomic assumptions1 the
authorities estimate that the primary
balance budget in FY2020 would fall
¥21.7 trillion (or 4 percent of GDP)
short of the targeted primary balance
without new revenue measures.

1/ The sum of gross JGBs (excluding Fiscal Investment and Loan Program
bonds), local government bonds, and borrowing of the Local Allocation Tax
Special Account. This does not conform with the staff's definition of gross
public debt, which includes short-term financing bills (shorter than one year).

Staff views: Staff welcomes the fiscal adjustment strategy as an important step forward to
laying out a medium-term adjustment path. The adjustment path envisaged is more gradual
than under the staff’s policy adjustment scenario and stabilizes the debt-ratio at a later date
(FY2020 versus FY2015) and at a higher level. This leaves the fiscal position more
vulnerable to potential adverse shocks for a prolonged time. Moreover, the strategy lacks
specifics on new revenue measures to achieve this adjustment and in staff’s view will only

become fully credible once details of the necessary revenue measures are agreed on including
the timing and scale of a consumption tax increase. Staff also welcomes the intention to
adopt a pay-as-you go rule, which will enhance fiscal discipline, but still sees a need for a
cap on public debt to anchor expectations.

Box: Key Policy Areas of Japan’s New Growth Strategy
Environment and energy. Reduce dependence on fossil fuels and expand Japan’s
technology leadership by providing incentives to increase the supply and use of renewable
energy and revitalize forestry.
Health care. Address demand pressures from population aging by promoting advanced
medical services through deregulation and developing international medical business
(medical tourism) through more flexible visa issuances.
Growth of Asian economy. Expand overseas operations of infrastructure industries by
taking advantage of Japan’s leadership in transportation and communication technology
and through support from public financial institutions (e.g., Japan Bank for International
Cooperation). Attract foreign companies to Japan by cutting the effective corporate tax rate,
developing global human resources, accepting more foreign skilled labor, and promoting
economic partnerships, including through a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).
Tourism and local revitalization. Encourage tourism by developing special tourism areas,
and expediting issuance of tourist visas. In parallel expand markets for existing housing and
home renovation, and strengthen public services by opening management to the private
sector.
Science and technology. Foster innovation and growth and enhance international
competitiveness through higher public and private R&D spending, better human resource
development including through university reforms, and improved communication
technology.
Employment. Strengthen female labor force participation by improving child care services
and adopting more flexible work arrangements.
Finance. Develop the financial sector by promoting the establishment of an integrated
exchange for securities, other financial instruments, and commodities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV
Consultation with Japan
On July 2, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
Japan’s economy continues to improve led by robust exports and policy stimulus.
Following a deep recession in 2009, growth accelerated to 5 percent (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the first quarter of 2010 amid signs of exports spilling over to
domestic demand. Strong demand from Asia, especially for capital goods, has
supported exports, while subsidies aimed at consumer durables has lifted household
spending. With the sharp fall in demand last year, deflation has re-emerged with core
inflation averaging around -1 percent since late 2009.
The current account surplus shrank further in 2009 to 2.8 percent of GDP, as a result of
lower global interest rates and a stronger yen. The trade surplus remained unchanged
at around 1 percent of GDP, while the income balance deteriorated in line with lower
global interest rates.
Financial markets have been hit hard by the renewed global turmoil. After showing signs
of recovering through March 2010, equity prices have fallen and the yen again
appreciated on higher risk aversion. Since the Lehman shock, the yen has appreciated
by 16 percent in real effective terms, while ten-year Japanese government bond (JGB)
yields have been stable at around 1.2–1.4 percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Looking forward, the recovery is expected to continue but its pace will likely moderate.
GDP growth is projected to rise to 2.4 percent in 2010 with the pace of the recovery
likely to slow in the second half of the year as stimulus measures expire and export
growth levels off. Growth of 1.8 percent is expected in 2011. With a narrowing of the
output gap, headline inflation is projected to turn positive in late 2011. Considerable
uncertainty surrounds the outlook from the global market turmoil, a possible slowdown in
the advanced economies and China, and a potential worsening of deflation.
With global scrutiny of public finances on the rise, the need for early and credible fiscal
adjustment has increased. The severe recession and the fiscal response have pushed
the overall fiscal deficit to 10¼ percent of GDP in 2009 and the net public debt ratio to
110 percent of GDP, one of the highest among advanced economies.
To combat the recession and re-emergence of deflation, the Bank of Japan (BoJ)
adopted a number of additional measures over the past year. These include introducing
a 3-month funds supplying operation to lower short-term interest rates, re-activating its
U.S. dollar swap line to ease emerging funding pressures, and introducing a new loan
facility to support private bank lending to innovative firms.
Executive Board Assessment
Japan’s economy is gaining strength, helped by strong external demand and timely and
sizeable policy support. With domestic demand gradually improving and deflation
easing, the recovery is expected to continue—albeit at a more moderate pace. The
recent turmoil in Europe, however, has heightened risks to the outlook and Japan’s
vulnerability to sovereign risk.
Against this backdrop, Directors underscored the urgency of credible fiscal adjustment.
The key challenge is to bring down public debt to more sustainable levels—through
decisive and sustained fiscal action—while ensuring adequate support for the still
nascent recovery and a more balanced economy. Directors welcomed the Fiscal
Management Strategy recently announced, laying out a medium-term consolidation
path, and looked forward to agreement on specific measures. They generally agreed
that adjustment efforts should focus on a gradual increase in the consumption tax,
supported by comprehensive tax reform, limits on non-social security spending growth,
and reforms to entitlement programs. The pace, timing, and composition of
consolidation measures would need to be carefully planned, with special attention to
their impact on consumption, investment, and growth. Directors commended the
government for its plan to adopt a “pay-as-you-go” expenditure rule. Introducing a cap
on public debt would help strengthen the credibility of the fiscal consolidation plans.
Directors considered the accommodative monetary policy stance appropriate, and
welcomed various measures by the BoJ to combat deflation and support growth. They
encouraged the authorities to stand ready to take additional easing measures, if
deemed necessary in response to weakening recovery or renewed deflationary
pressures. In this regard, consideration could be given to extending the maturity of the
funds supplying operations and broadening the range of asset purchases, while being
attentive to moral hazard risks. Directors stressed that, given growing uncertainty, clear

3
communication would be crucial, with a few recommending that the BoJ more explicitly
link its intention to maintain policy accommodation to its inflation forecast, provided that
financial imbalances remain absent.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to a market-determined
exchange rate, which would help facilitate a rebalancing of growth away from exports.
They noted the staff’s assessment that, following the sharp appreciation since the
outbreak of the crisis, the yen’s current level is broadly in line with its longer-term
equilibrium value. Nevertheless, carry trade activities and their impact on the exchange
rate would need to be monitored closely.
Directors noted that, while the profitability and capital base of the banking sector have
improved, banks still face risks from a slow recovery and their sizeable securities
holdings, as well as challenges in adapting to new global financial standards. It would
therefore be important for supervisors to ensure that banks follow proper risk
management; take appropriate steps to facilitate borrower restructuring; and stand
ready, when necessary, to assist banks in strengthening their financial positions.
Directors emphasized that the unprecedented size of required fiscal consolidation,
including to address the challenges of population aging, brings to the fore the need for
structural reforms to promote domestic demand-led growth. The formulation of the “New
Growth Strategy” is a welcome step, entailing the development of potentially dynamic
areas, such as energy, environment, health, and technology. This could be
complemented by supply-side measures aimed at increasing employment, raising
productivity in nontradable sectors, deregulating services, and encouraging more riskbased lending by private financial institutions.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Japan is also available.
