STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 20, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook: Despite strong macroeconomic performance under the Fundsupported program (2009–12) with economic activity steadily accelerating and inflation
declining sharply, poverty remains pervasive and the economy vulnerable, exposing this
progress to reversal. Limited fiscal space and shocks to revenues often offset by
expenditure adjustments have not supported pro-poor and critical investment spending
necessary for inclusive growth, giving rise to mounting social demands to share in the
benefits of the accelerating growth.
Focus of consultation: The discussions focused on medium-term policy measures to
preserve macroeconomic stability while promoting inclusive growth, improve
transparency and good governance in the natural resources sector; and foster financial
stability and development.
Key policy recommendations:


Maintain the fiscal anchor of no (net) central bank financing of the budget while
creating fiscal space through enhanced domestic revenue mobilization, and
improving the quality of public spending through public financial management
(PFM) reforms, and building more robust buffers against external shocks.



Implement measures included in the updated governance matrix agreed with the
World Bank and the recommendations of the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) and the National Conference on Mineral Resources Management
(NCMRM) to enhance transparency and good governance in the management of
natural resources.



Accelerate reforms of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) and the financial sector
by (i) passing the central bank law to strengthen its independence and governance,
(ii) completing its recapitalization, and (iii) strengthening its analytical capacity,
(iv) disengaging from non-core activities, and (v) implement FSAP recommendations
to promote financial sector stability and development.

BACKGROUND
1.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) achieved strong macroeconomic performance
under the Fund-supported program (2009–12) with economic growth steadily accelerating and
inflation declining sharply. However, poverty remains pervasive and the economy vulnerable,
exposing this progress to reversal. Limited fiscal space and shocks to revenues often offset by
expenditure adjustments have not supported pro-poor and critical investment expenditures
necessary for inclusive growth. Poor alignment of the budget with the priorities set in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) also contributed. As a result, the DRC would most likely not reach
any of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the 2015 deadline (Text Table 1 and
Table 8).This is born out from the preliminary data from a recent household survey, which indicate
that poverty declined only marginally from 71 to 63 percent between 2005 and 2012 despite
economic growth averaging 6.3 percent over this period.

2.
Domestic political uncertainty is taming the implementation of structural reforms. Lack
of progress in structural reforms, particularly in the management of natural resources, was the main
cause for not completing three reviews under the previous Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement, which expired on December 10, 2012. A cabinet reshuffle, rumored since early 2013
and confirmed by President Kabila in late October following the conclusion of a “National Dialogue”
is yet to take place. This uncertainty is paralyzing economic decision-making process, including
initiation of discussions on a new Fund-supported program.

3.
There has been growing optimism for the return of lasting peace in the DRC. First, in
February 2013, a Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework for the DRC was signed in
Addis Ababa by the United Nations Secretary-General and 11 African heads of state committing the
signatories to work for a sustained peace in the Great Lakes region. Second, in November the DRC’s
army, backed by the UN peacekeeping force, defeated a major rebel group (M23) and is shifting its
attention to some other rebel groups. However, peace remains fragile as some institutional reforms
under the peace agreement are yet to be fully implemented.
4.
The authorities have been receptive to the Fund’s policy advice under the Article IV
consultation, but some key recommendations have been implemented with varying degrees
of determination. The authorities maintained the fiscal anchor1 adopted in 2009, which has been
the pillar of the current macroeconomic stability. However, the recommended increase in
international reserve coverage of imports to better hedge against external shocks fell short of target
and some structural reforms, including the recapitalization of the BCC stalled. For other reforms,
such as improving transparency and management of natural resources and strengthening the BCC’s
supervision and analytical capacity progress remained slow.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
5.
The DRC’s macroeconomic performance in 2013 was strong (Figure 1, Tables 1–4).
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated at 8.5 percent in real terms up from 7.2 percent
in 2012. Benefitting from the benign global environment, the DRC continues to gain from strong
trade and investment inflows from non-European countries. The mining sector remains the main
driver of growth, particularly copper production, which increased by 52 percent in volume terms,
with the commercial and construction sectors also performing well. Nonetheless, estimating overall
growth is challenging given the lack of comprehensive source data and weak institutional capacities
for compiling national accounts by the National Statistics Institute (Institut national de la
statistique—INS).
6.
Inflation fell to a historic low and the exchange rate remained stable, but reserve
coverage stagnated. Inflation fell further in 2013 to 1.0 percent at end-December, benefiting from a
restrictive fiscal policy, control of the monetary aggregates, and the absence of major import price
shocks.2 The exchange rate remained remarkably stable in 2013, and the US$50 million accumulated
international reserves were only sufficient to keep the reserve coverage unchanged from 2012, at
7.7 weeks of imports of goods and services.

1

The anchor, adopted in the context of the ECF-supported program, consists of a zero financing from the central
bank (apart from the use of counterpart funds from HIPC and MDRI).

2

There is a significant pass-through from international food prices and the exchange rate to inflation (WP/13/226).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7.
Budget execution in 2013 was consistent with the fiscal anchor. The domestic and
overall fiscal balances were contained at 0.2 and -1.7 percent of GDP respectively, despite a
significantly weaker revenue performance in 2013 compared to 2012. Total revenue (excluding
grants) fell by 1.9 percentage points of GDP on account of lower bonus and license payments in the
mining and telecommunications sectors and weaker value added tax (VAT) performance3
(1 percentage point of GDP) that were partially offset by a strong performance in direct taxes.
Consistent with the fiscal anchor, spending adjusted downwards with exceptional spending (security
and elections) dropping the most (1.1 percent of GDP). Domestically-financed capital spending
nevertheless increased by 1.0 percent of GDP, resulting in an overall fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2013. Payments of domestic arrears (0.3 percent of GDP), brought financing needs to
2.0 percent of GDP, of which 0.4 percent was met with a drawdown of debt relief-related deposits
and the balance with external financing.
8.
Despite deterioration in the external current account, the external position remained
in surplus in 2013. This surplus of US$65 million (0.2 percent of GDP) is lower than the 2012 figure
because the current account deficit widened by 2.1 percentage points of GDP to 10.1 percent of
GDP in 2013. This higher deficit is in turn essentially due to higher mining related imports and
higher profits repatriation, which have been reclassified, resulting in almost a doubling of the
income deficit (Table 4).
9.
There has been very little progress on the structural reforms launched three years ago
at the BCC. Recapitalization has not moved forward and the BCC continues to perform activities that
are nonessential for the conduct of monetary policy, namely management of the hospital center and
the mint. Further, the budget constraints imposed on the BCC could limit its ability to implement
effective monetary policy given its difficult financial situation.
10.
Medium-term economic growth prospects remain favorable. The economy is projected
to grow at 8.7 percent in 2014 and on average 7.5 percent during 2015–18. The mining sector is
expected to remain the main driver of growth, including with the investment phase of the
Sino-Congolese joint venture (Sicomines) accelerating. Growth is also expected to be buoyed in the
construction, commercial, transport, and communication sectors, which benefit from mining
investments. The medium-term growth projections could be even stronger if the current deficit in
electricity production is addressed to support mining production. In 2014, headline inflation is
targeted at 4 percent, which appears achievable in light of current trends and projected commodity
prices. Average inflation is expected to remain low at around 5 percent during 2015–18.
11.
The fiscal stance is expected to remain consistent with the fiscal anchor, which
continues to be appropriate to tame inflation expectations. In 2014, revenues are projected to
return to the pre-2013 trend, despite lingering concerns about the VAT performance and reach
13.9 percent of GDP, while public spending is expected to increase marginally to 19.6 percent.
Domestically-financed capital spending would decrease from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to
3

The recent counter-performance appears to be linked to increased VAT credits. Multiple accounting changes
related to the VAT refund account have also complicated calculation of the net VAT. A detailed analysis of the VAT
performance is being undertaken.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

1.9 percent, resulting in a projected increase in the domestic fiscal surplus to 0.5 percent of GDP in
2014, with domestic financing needs expected to be virtually nil. Over the medium term, fiscal policy
is expected to remain supportive of macroeconomic stability.
12.
The external current account deficit is projected to decline gradually over the medium
term and help maintain the overall position in surplus. As a result, reserves coverage would
improve from 7.7 weeks in 2013 to 8.3 weeks on average during 2014–16. Nevertheless, this level
would fall short of the 10 weeks objective that the authorities had set earlier for 2012 and far below
the optimal level (Appendix I, paragraph 12). The trade balance is projected to improve, spurred by
rising exports of goods. This performance should more than offset the deterioration in the income
balance and contributes to lowering the current account deficit to 9.3 and 8.8 percent of GDP in
2014 and 2015, respectively.
13.
The outlook is subject to a number of downside risks (Table 6). The DRC’s dependency
on mineral resources, lack of progress in reforming the BCC into an efficient, independent and well
capitalized central bank and an escalation of the armed conflict are the main risks.
14.
Heavy dependence on the natural resource sector: As indicated in Table 6, a sustained
decline in commodity prices (in particular copper prices) would result in lower fiscal revenues and
export earnings, which in turn could lead to lower spending in priority sectors and investments
further slowing poverty reduction. Staff simulated a commodity price shock with copper prices
40 and 15 percent lower than the baseline levels in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The results are:
(i) a 4 percentage point drop in real GDP growth in 2014 and a 0.1 point drop in 2015;
(ii) a cumulative decline in fiscal revenue 3.7 percentage points of GDP over 2014–15; (iii) a widening
of the current account deficit in 2014 by 7 percentage points of GDP; and (iv) a significant
depreciation of the exchange rate, which in turn leads to inflation jumping to 40 percent. An
escalation of the armed conflict could have similar consequences as mines close, fiscal revenue
declines and security expenditures increase.
15.
Another risk relates to a continued inaction on the reforms of the BCC. Protracted
delays in recapitalizing and reforming the BCC could eventually trigger a chain of negative reactions:
loss of its credibility, higher inflation, a depreciation of the currency, loss of international reserves, a
run on deposits in the banking sector as the BCC would not be able to act as a lender of last resort
for dollar deposits (Appendix III).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Promoting sustained and inclusive growth while consolidating
macroeconomic stability
16.
Staff supported the authorities’ fiscal policy stance, but stressed the need to create
more fiscal space. Balancing the budget has essentially relied on expenditure adjustments which
could be avoided by increasing revenues and improving the quality of spending (Appendix II). The
volatility and unpredictability of external financing and of revenues from natural resources, coupled
with a lack of control over revenues from the non-resource sector has put the burden of adjustment
to achieve a balance budget on expenditures. Given the country’s enormous needs for infrastructure
and social spending (e.g., education and health), this situation has created an unwanted tradeoff
between current macroeconomic stability and future growth. Such a trade-off could be avoided by
increasing revenues and improving the quality of spending (Appendix II). Based on the DRC’s tax
potential (Box II.1.), staff estimates that the revenue-to-GDP ratio could be increased by more than
7 percentage points of GDP over the medium term. The least volatile and most predictable revenues
(non-natural resource and non-grant revenues) represent less than 10 percent of non-natural
resource GDP, or substantially below DRC’s peers. Staff recommended accelerating PFM reforms
aimed at improving the quality of spending and broadening the tax base through (i) strengthening
government control over the VAT, (ii) streamlining the many procedures at customs and securing
borders, and (iii) interconnecting computer systems of the Customs and Tax departments.
17.
There is also the need to build policy space and strike the right balance between
various macroeconomic objectives. Staff recommends targeting inflation at around 4 to 6 percent,
which would create additional space for reserve accumulation. Depending on the assumed
opportunity cost of holding reserves, the optimal coverage level for the DRC is between 5.7 and
14.1 months, an objective that can only be feasible over the long run (Figure I.10.). For the medium
term, staff recommends aiming for reserve coverage of at least three months of imports, coupled
with a flexible exchange rate to be able to deal with exogenous shocks. This objective should be
achievable while maintaining broad macroeconomic stability.
18.
A reformed and efficient BCC could partly shift the burden of macroeconomic stability
towards the central bank. The BCC’s independence and analytical capacity needs strengthening to
enhance its credibility as a precondition for a successful de-dollarization and more effective
monetary policy. The slow progress, or reform reversal, of structural reforms at the BCC is a source
of concern. Staff recommends that the authorities recapitalize the BCC and make it an independent
and accountable entity with the capacity to carry out its mandate of maintaining price stability and
financial sector stability. Staff also recommends BCC’s divestment of the hospital center and the
mint, which are not consistent with its mandate. The budget constraints on the BCC and its
inadequate foreign exchange reserve levels limit its ability to control inflation by making it difficult
to absorb excess liquidity through the sale of foreign exchange or the issuance of central bank bills.
The de-dollarization strategy that the authorities are implementing requires a stable macroeconomic

environment, a credible, efficient and independent central bank, effective banking supervision, and
sufficiently well-developed financial infrastructure.
19.
Promoting inclusive growth is imperative given the persistently high poverty rate.
International experience suggests that sustained high growth and adequate social spending is vital
for reducing poverty. Furthermore, sectors intensive in labor and family businesses like the
agriculture and service sectors have a relatively stronger impact on poverty reduction than the
industrial mining sector4—a sector poorly integrated with the rest of the economy. Staff thus
recommended to the authorities to increase social spending and investment in labor intensive
sectors such as agriculture, and improve the business environment, including through infrastructure
development to promote private sector participation in employment creation.
20.
Medium-term growth can be further accelerated if key obstacles are addressed. The
growth take-off envisioned by the authorities could materialize once the electricity deficit
constraining mining companies’ expansion plans is overcome, feeder roads are developed, and the
business climate is significantly improved. Staff has developed an alternative scenario consistent
with its policy recommendations that shows an acceleration of growth to double digits by 2016
(mainly in agriculture and other non-mineral resource sectors), a moderately higher inflation, a
depreciation of the exchange rate, and faster reserve accumulation (Table 5 and Text Table 2).

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s analysis and policy
recommendations, but found staff’s medium-term growth projections too conservative. They
indicated that their own projections were higher (9.5 percent in 2014 and 10.7 percent on average
over 2015–17) predicated on continued strong expansion in mining production and agriculture,
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

which is receiving increased investments. They stressed that sustained growth over the medium to
long term is needed to address pervasive poverty and indicated their strong commitment to
implement the right policies. However, while sympathetic of staff’s advice on the policy mix to
maintain macroeconomic stability, they stressed that given the DRC’s history of hyperinflation and
dramatic devaluations, very low inflation and exchange rate stability are paramount macroeconomic
objectives. Nonetheless, the authorities would endeavor to accumulate international reserves market
conditions permitting.
22.
The authorities fully shared staff’s emphasis on revenue mobilization, but pointed to
administrative constraints that are being addressed. They noted in particular, weak capacity and
lack of infrastructure, including deficient communications, poor working conditions, governance
issues, and dealing with highly sophisticated international taxpayers. They concurred with staff on
the need to closely monitor and track on monthly basis VAT reimbursements and also shared staff’s
assessment that the disappointing VAT performance reflected wider difficulties that will need to be
addressed through a tighter control of the tax base. They stressed that improvements in this area
was consistent with their objective to raise revenues. They also underlined the potential of the
mining sector for significant additional tax revenues and welcomed the Fund’s continued technical
assistance (TA) in modeling tax revenues from the mining sector and advice on new mining code.
23.
The authorities also concurred with the need to reform the BCC to make it a more
effective and accountable institution. They indicated that under the new BCC’s management, the
pace of reforms has picked up with renewed efforts to disengage from non-core activities and
rationalize the BCC’s operations. They felt strongly that the recapitalization of the BCC should be
linked to significant improvement in its operating results.

B. Improving transparency and good governance in natural resource
management
24.
Improving transparency and governance in the natural resource sector remains a
major challenge. The DRC was suspended in April 2013 from the EITI for a year, but expects to
become compliant by May 2014 upon completion of certain reporting requirements. Transparency
should also extend to the infrastructure loans under the Sicomines agreement (DSA, paragraphs 9
and 13). Structural reforms aimed at improving the governance of SOEs in the mining sector have
been introduced, but progress remains slow. Moreover, Gécamines, beneficiary of mining royalties
that would otherwise accrue to the Treasury, continues to divest assets without competitive biddings
in disregard of a government’s decree. The SOEs claim that a recent change in their status to
commercial enterprises enables them to make independent business decisions. Consistent with
World Bank’s advice, staff urged the authorities to closely monitor the sale of assets by SOEs and
improve their management by strengthening the capacity and accountability of government
representatives on their boards of directors. Lastly, the authorities could benefit from drawing on
international best practices when revising the mining and petroleum codes (the former being
discussed with stakeholders and the latter tabled before parliament) and from strengthening the
anti-money laundering framework to address the illegal exploitation of natural resources.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Authorities’ view
25.
The authorities concurred that governance and transparency of the sector remain a
challenge, including the corporate governance of the SOEs operating in the sector. They
pointed to the NCMRM organized in January 2013 to promote best practices5 and the subsequent
governance matrix (GM) agreed with the World Bank aimed at enhancing transparency across the
board in the management of natural resources. They indicated that 136 mining contracts have been
published and annual productions and exports for 2003–12 have been made available.

C. Promoting Financial Stability and Development
26.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in 2013 for the first time
proved timely. It concluded that the financial system remains underdeveloped and subject to major
weaknesses (Appendix III). Stress tests conducted by staff revealed that the banking sector is
particularly vulnerable to liquidity shocks, owing to the absence of risk-based supervision,
inadequate regulation, and lax implementation of the regulations governing the financial system.
Consequently, staff recommended that the authorities (i) strengthen the BCC’s capacities for data
collection to enhance monitoring and analysis (in particular with regard to nonperforming loans)
and introduce risk-based supervision; (ii) adopt a law on the statutes of the central bank and the
banking law that provide the central bank with the necessary powers to enforce prudential norms
and to establish a legal and operational crisis management framework in the coming years; and
(iii) promote financial inclusion by adopting a new leasing legislation, strengthening supervision of
microfinance institutions, and restructuring the defunct Savings Bank of Congo (CADECO).
27.
A credible de-dollarization strategy requires a series of pre-conditions.6 Drawing on
international experience staff urged the authorities to focus on building the necessary
pre-conditions, which are: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability and increasing international
reserve coverage to enhance the credibility of the currency; (ii) clarifying the BCC’s mandate to
pursue price stability as its primary objective; (iii) recapitalizing the BCC and restoring its operational
independence and accountability, (iv) adopting the banking law, clearly defining the legal and
regulatory framework; and (v) enhancing the current financial infrastructure (including supervisory
framework, payments systems, and safety net tools). Staff welcomed the government’s recent efforts
on de-dollarization, including the payment of taxes by extractive companies and the Treasury’s
operating expenses in local currency.

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities welcomed the candid analysis and agreed with the main
recommendations of the FSAP. They adopted a comprehensive 3-year time-bound action plan to
implement them. They already reorganized the banking supervision department to improve its
accountability and performance and started the recruitment process of 15 additional staff. This
5

The Conference made about 100 recommendations, some of which have been included in the GM. A follow-up
conference was organized in March 2014.
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

action plan includes the reinforcement of technical capacities and the adoption of a supervisory
risk-based framework. They also concurred with the need to pace the process of de-dollarization
and step up efforts to strengthen the sector and financial infrastructures. The timeline for the
recapitalization of the BCC and the approval of the BCC law, however, remain controversial even
within the government agencies.

OTHER ISSUES
29.
The DRC’s debt sustainability rating improved from high to moderate risk of debt
distress. The improvement stems essentially from an increase in the discount rate from 4 to
5 percent and the large upward revision of GDP (see DSA). The improved macroeconomic
fundamentals over the past few years also contributed. Despite this improved rating, the DRC will
need to continue to borrow mainly on concessional terms, and improve its debt management
capacity.
30.
Exchange system. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) level is deemed to be broadly in
line with the DRC’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The DRC has not introduced any new measures
related to the exchange system, but maintains one exchange restriction and one multiple currency
practice as described in the Informational Annex.
31.
Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there is room for
improvement. The FSAP found that data quality and a non-unified treatment in the collection of
data and computation of key financial indicators remain a challenge affecting the reliability of the
analyses and conclusions. Compilation of national account and balance of payments data is also
weak with only few primary source data available. Staff urged the authorities to increase capacities
in statistical analysis and to allocate sufficient resources to data production, including at the INS and
to expand surveys to key sectors, such as trade, commerce and agriculture production as well as
surveys on the informal sector. Demographic, labor and social data are particularly weak which
represent a challenge when well targeted poverty reduction policies need to be designed.

Authorities’ views
32.
Overall, the authorities agreed with staff’s assessments on the debt and the external
sustainability. The authorities concur with staff that reforms need to be implemented to improve
the DRC’s competitiveness by improving the business environment. They acknowledged that the
management of public debt needed improvement and welcomed Fund TA recently received in this
area. They also acknowledged difficulties in compiling debt data, especially from public entities that
are not part of the public administration but underlined recent progress. They stressed their
intention to continue to borrow on highly concessional terms whenever possible and to carefully
scrutinize investment projects for their efficiency. They also concur with the need to accumulate
more international reserves, an objective which they need to weigh also against its possible negative
effects on the exchange rate and financial sector stability.
33.
The authorities recognized challenges in data collection and analysis but underlined
recent progress in this area. For example, they recently made resources available to the INS for the
collection of CPI data. Furthermore, while demographic data are currently extrapolated from the last

12

national census from 1985 and adjusted based on a 2006 household survey, a new survey was
conducted in 2013 for which results will be published soon. A national census is also planned for
2014/15. The authorities also welcomed the TA they have been receiving for the transition of the
national accounts to SNA93.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The DRC achieved over the past few years macroeconomic stability against difficult
odds. Staff commends the authorities for their resolute pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies
despite spending pressures to address the security challenges, particularly in the eastern part of the
country and the absence of budget support from donors. The steady inflows of FDIs in the natural
resources sector has been the main driver of the high growth rates and the authorities are
encouraged to put in place policies that will promote labor intensive production activities and help
reduce poverty.
35.
Consolidation of peace in the eastern part of the country and a more stable political
environment would help in the implementation of economic reforms. The defeat of the M23
rebel group and the on-going implementation of the Addis Ababa peace agreement represent a
unique opportunity to consolidate peace and accelerate the economic reforms needed to sustain
the current macroeconomic stability and equitably share its benefits countrywide. To sustain the
peace process, the relevant institutional reforms should be accelerated. Also, removing the political
uncertainty would help reenergize the implementation of key structural reforms.
36.
There is a need for a more ambitious reserve accumulation. The current historic low level
of inflation provides the policy space to embark in a faster reserve accumulation without disrupting
the foreign exchange market. This could however entail a more flexible exchange rate and the
authorities are encouraged to communicate more on the issue to lessen fears of a return to
hyperinflation.
37.
The authorities are encouraged to build on the hard gained macroeconomic stability
and vigorously mobilize domestic revenues to boost social and infrastructure spending. Such
an increase in spending is required to turn the current stability into sustainable improvement in
social indicators and poverty reduction. While revenues from the mining sector need to be further
increased in line with its potential, the authorities also need to tap the large potential of less volatile
and more predictable revenues from the non-resource sector. These more predictable resources will
better protect key spending against revenue shocks. The Fund stands ready to support the
authorities in this endeavor through TA.
38.
The limited resources also speak to the importance of improving PFM. Sustained
progress in strengthening the budget process, medium-term fiscal planning and quality of spending
must be achieved supported by political forces and improved inter-government cooperation.
39.
Reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and good governance in the mineral
resource sector need to be pursued vigorously. The authorities should (i) accelerate the
implementation of the GM and the main recommendations of the NCMRM, and (ii) monitor closely

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

the operations of the SOEs and strengthen their oversight over SOEs. Staff also encourages the
authorities to review the Gécamines unusual role as a beneficiary of royalties on licensed permits and
to reform Gécamines into a company focused on mining production.
40.
Inclusive growth and sustained poverty reduction will largely depend on growth in
labor intensive sectors like agriculture, artisanal mining and services. While this requires
stepped up social and infrastructure spending, the development of labor intensive businesses will
also depend on critical improvements in the business environment. The authorities are encouraged
to better align its budget with the PRSP priorities to accelerate progress towards the MDGs.
41.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ determination in implementing the FSAP
recommendations, but urges them to expedite the recapitalization and other reforms of the
BCC. Steadfast implementation of the FSAP recommendations is essential for better comprehending
emerging risks and in taking timely corrective measures. The recapitalization of the BCC together
with other structural reforms aimed at transforming the BCC into an autonomous and efficient
central bank is a precondition for de-dollarizing the economy and for monetary policy to play an
increasing role for macroeconomic and financial stability.
42.
Staff remains concerned about the lack of resources, both in human and financial
capital for the production of key statistical data, including the national accounts. A
substantially reinforced INS is required to leverage the currently deficient data production and to
enable policy makers to take efficient decisions based on real-time data.
43.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with the DRC be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Reflects revised calculation of HIPC Initiative assistance on the basis of the 2010 Debt Sustainability Analysis (EBS/10/121,16/06/2010).
Exceptional expenditure includes spending for the Demobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR) program, and cost of the elections.
The domestic fiscal balance is defined as revenue (excluding the signing bonus from the SCCA) minus total expenditure (excluding interest
on foreign debt, foreign-financed capital, and exceptional expenditure).
For 2011 onward, all banking system financing reflects the use of government deposits, including IMF HIPC relief, and program adjustors.

Two reclassifications were introduced in 2013. First, repatriation of profits by international companies operating in the natural resources sector passed from the financial
account (other private non-banking sector) to the current account (expenditure under the income balance). Second, a larger part of official grants were registered under the
current account (current transfers) for aid covering recurrent expenditures that was previously registered under the capital account (official).

Excluding principal repayments to the IMF.
Including unrecorded transactions. The latter may be substantial given weaknesses in statistics.

Starting in 2012 CPI numbers are calculated by INS using a revised methodology. The CPI for 2012 according to the previous methodolgy amounted to 5.7 percent (eop) and 9.3 (average).
The projections for 2011 and beyond account for mining companies profit outflows.
Projections are based on calculations under the 2010 HIPC Debt Sustainability Analysis (EBS/10/121, 06/16/2010). Includes assistance beyond the terms of the enhanced HIPC
Initiative granted by some Paris Club creditors. Exports are a trailing three-year moving average.

Source of Risks

Relative Likelihood

Expected Impact on
Economy

Staff Advice on Policy
Responses

External Risks
Significant slowdown in
growth in China in 2014.

Low

Deterioration of the current
account deficit as export
earnings decline, lower direct
investment in the natural
resource sector, as well as
lower accumulation of
international reserves.

Increase international
reserves with a flexible
exchange rate to provide
more robust buffers against
external shocks. Increase
fiscal space to become less
reliable from fiscal revenues
from the mining sector.

Heightened geopolitical risks
in the Middle East (sharp rise
in oil prices).

Low

As an exporter of crude oil,
DRC would benefit, but
import bill of refined
products would increase and
in the absence of price
adjustments at the pump,
revenue would decline.

Adjust domestic petroleum
prices to stem decline in
fiscal revenues or eliminate
petroleum subsidies.

Sustained decline in the
commodity prices.

Medium

Sustained lower fiscal
revenues and exports
earnings leading to lower
spending in priority sectors
and investment and slower
poverty reduction.

Increase domestic nonnatural resources
mobilization to lessen
dependence on fiscal
revenues from the mining
sector (paragraph 16).

Domestic Risks
Escalation of armed conflict.

Medium

Collapse in economic
activities in war affected
areas and severe strain on
public finance (similar effect
as in commodity price shock
(paragraph 14).

Increase international
reserves with a flexible
exchange rate to provide
more robust buffers against
external shocks. Increase
fiscal space to become less
reliable from fiscal revenues
from the mining sector.

Lack of progress in structural
reforms at the BCC.

High

Loss of credibility to defend
low inflation and further
increase in dollarization.

Accelerate key structural
reforms, in particular the
recapitalization of the BCC
and financial independence
for the conduct of monetary
policy (paragraph 16).

Lack of progress in the
management and
transparency of mineral
resources.

Medium

Significant forgone fiscal
revenues, further decline in
foreign aid, deterioration in
the business environment,
and lack of progress in
poverty reduction and public
investments.

Extended transparency and
good governance in the
mineral resources sector to
SOEs. Implement TAsupported revenue
forecasting methods.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to

materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix I. External Sustainability Assessment
This note assesses external stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and concludes that
developments in the balance of payments position are consistent with external stability. While the DRC
recorded continuously current account (CA) deficits over the past decade, these were financed mainly
by private inflows, especially foreign direct investments (FDI) and the real effective exchange rate
(REER) is broadly in line with the DRC’s macroeconomic fundamentals. 1 However, the level of
international reserves is insufficient to buffer the economy against external shocks and factor’s beyond
the level of the REER play a prominent role. The DRC’s competitiveness suffers from institutional
constraints, lack of infrastructure and electricity, and a weak business environment.

A.

Balance of payments

1.

Over the past decade, the DRC recorded continuous CA deficits financed by both

private and official flows (Table I.1.). Since 2007 CA deficits averaged about 6 percent of GDP and,
in 2013, it represented 10.1 percent of GDP. The CA deficit is expected to start narrowing in 2014 to
9.3 percent of GDP and to an average of 6.2 percent of GDP for the period 2015–33 due to the
strong growth of mining exports in the medium term and to development of the agricultural sector
on the medium-long term.

The REER assessment should be interpreted with much caution given the data limitation and the high dollarization
of the economy, but the REER is deemed to be broadly in line with the fundamentals.

The trade balance has been
positive since 2009 but the DRC
remains a net importer of services
(Figure I.1.). Moreover, the repatriation of
profits by international companies
operating in the natural resources sector
lead to a strongly negative primary
income balance (but an improvement of
the financial account balance). 2

methodology used to evaluate the REER
indicate no major misalignment. The
results for the macroeconomic balance
approach and the external sustainability
approach are summarized in Table I.2., but
should be interpreted cautiously due to data
limitations.3 Both the macroeconomic

approaches calculate the exchange rate

medium term.
6.

The macroeconomic balance approach indicates a slight overvaluation of the REER.

Under this approach the CA norm is estimated through the projected values of medium-term
fundamentals. This norm is estimated to lie between -6.6 and -7.0 percent of GDP based on
coefficients estimated by Vitek4 (2013). Assuming an elasticity of the trade balance with respect to
the real exchange rate of 0.71 as calculated by Tokarick5 (2010) for the DRC, the difference between
the underlying CA and the CA norm indicates an REER misalignment between 0.7 and 0.0 percent of
GDP. A use of the CGER elasticity of the CA would imply an REER misalignment between 1.8 and
0.1 percent of GDP.
7.

The external balance approach also suggests a slight overvaluation of the real

exchange rate. Under this approach, the CA norm is defined as the balance that would stabilize net
foreign assets (NFA). The exchange rate misalignment is then equal to the adjustment necessary to
bring the underlying CA to a level stabilizing the NFA. The CA balance necessary to stabilize the
DRC’s NFA-to-GDP ratio at its 2017 level (-62 percent) is estimated to be -6.9 percent compared

3

For instance, the result for the REER methodology is not displayed due to the lack of data on the DRC’s productivity,
one of the main explicative variables in the model. More generally the quality of DRC data on external sector is very
poor.

with an underlying CA of -7.1 percent. Using Tokarick’s trade balance elasticity of 0.71 implies an
overvaluation of 0.3 percent (0.7 percent with the CGER’s elasticity).

C. Structural competitiveness
8.

While the real exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, it is not the

main determinant of the DRC competitiveness considering the high level of dollarization of the
economy. In 2013, mining and oil exports accounted for 97 percent of the total value of good
exports and are denominated in dollars.
9.

The DRC’s competitiveness depends actually critically on improving the business

environment. The country continues to rank near the bottom of the ease of doing business
according to the 2014 edition of the World Bank report “Doing Business” because of administrative
complexities, inefficient and distorted tax policy and a low access to credit (Figures I.5. and I.6.).6 The
absence of credit information and a weak judiciary limit the capacity of the banking system to
extend credit to the economy.

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care

should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and
a small number of informants, which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

The lack of reliable electricity supply, transportation networks, social services and a

low level of human capital are also significant impediments to the development of the export
sector (Figures I.7. and I.8.).

D. Reserve adequacy
11.

The level international reserves held by the DRC appear to be insufficient to cushion

the effect of external shocks. As a large natural resources exporter,7 the DRC should hold aboveaverage levels of international reserves as demonstrated by the April 2012 Regional Economic
Outlook for sub-Saharan Africa (IMF). The study suggests that the adverse domestic impact of
external shocks is larger in resources exporters than elsewhere, and confirms the effectiveness of
reserves in mitigating the domestic effect of external shocks. But reserve holding comes at a cost in
terms of foregoing the higher rates of return that could be obtained via alternative investments.
12.

Using the Fund’s reserve adequacy template for resource-exporting low income

countries, staff estimates that the DRC should hold gross reserves equivalent to at least
5.7 months of imports for a cost of holding reserves of 6 percent8 (11.1 months for 3 percent),
against an actual 1.8 months (Figures I.9. and I.10.). This estimate is based on 2013 data and
applying an unconditional probability of shock. The methodology balances the risk-reducing effects
7

In the DRC, ninety-six percent of exports come from the extractive industries, mainly copper, cobalt, diamonds, gold
and oil.

The reserve coverage should represent up to 10.2 months of next year imports for a cost of holding reserves of

of reserves against their carrying costs. It estimates both the likelihood and the scale of a drop in
domestic demand in a country and compares the benefits of holding additional reserves (which
helps containing demand declines) with the costs of holding additional reserves (revenues foregone
by investing in liquid and thus lower yielding foreign assets).

Appendix II. Creating Fiscal Space to Sustain Macroeconomic
Stability and Promote Inclusive Growth
1.

A tight fiscal policy stance has been the anchor of the DRC’s disinflation strategy and

instrumental in achieving macroeconomic stability. The government’s policy has essentially
consisted in adjusting expenditure to available revenues. However, the variability and
unpredictability of external financing and of revenue linked to natural resources (Figure II.1.),
coupled with a lack of control over revenues from the non-resource sector have put the burden of
adjustment to achieve a balance budget on expenditures (Figure II.2.). Given the country’s large
needs for infrastructure and social spending (e.g., education and health), this situation has created
an unwanted tradeoff between current macroeconomic stability and future growth that could be
addressed by mobilizing more revenues and by improving the efficiency of spending through
vigorous reforms in public financial management (PFM).

There is a vast potential to broaden the tax base. With non-resource, non-aid revenues at

less than 10 percent of non-resource GDP, the DRC is clearly constrained in its ability to finance the
needed investments in education, health, and basic infrastructure necessary to reduce poverty and
diversify its economy. This ratio also ranks the DRC among the weakest performers compared to
other sub-Saharan African countries (Figure II.3.). Based on a study of the DRC’s tax potential, staff
estimates that the DRC could increase its overall revenue-to-GDP ratio by more than 7 percentage
points of GDP in the medium term (Box II.1.). The econometric results help prioritizing reforms. First,
better understanding and fixing the recent VAT counter-performance should be given immediate

33

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

priority, in order to secure past successes. Second, improving customs efficiency and control of
borders can potentially bring significant benefits. Third, improving control of natural resources
revenue (i.e., non-tax revenue) should be a priority.

Mobilizing revenue of such magnitude, while realistic, will require a high-level

commitment from the authorities. Drastically streamlining the vast array of small taxes and fees
(parafiscalité) that plague the business environment, simplifying the tax system and reducing tax
exemptions have already started but remain long and challenging undertakings. Equally difficult will
be the numerous improvements to revenue administration, which will require a well coordinated
and resolute implementation:


Reorganizing revenue collection agencies, possibly merging the Direction générale des Impôts
(DGI) with the Direction générale des recettes administratives, judiciaires, domaniales et des
participations (DGRAD);



Pursuing taxpayers segmentation;



Computerizing the DGI and linking its IT systems to those of Customs to facilitate audits;



Strengthening VAT administration;



Streamlining and formalizing customs processes and improving border controls;



Reallocating personnel to productive tasks;



Improving audit capacity, notably in the area of natural resources; and



Supporting the extension of the tax net to all potential taxpayers.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

4.

Specific measures to mobilize mining revenues would be important. With 29 percent of

non-aid revenue (3.7 percent of GDP), the natural resource sector (including oil) is by far the largest
contributor to the national budget. Yet, the authorities’ limited understanding of the sector’s
economic, financial and accounting modus operandi and the fact that some large mining operators
generate less revenue than expected has triggered an effort to review mining taxation (e.g., higher
royalty and introduction of a resource rent tax), and improve surveillance and audit capacity of the
mining industry. Although these efforts represent important steps forward, the authorities will need
to tread carefully to preserve recent growth, and lay the ground for more investments. This will
include at least the following steps:


Finalizing the ongoing negotiations of the mining code as quickly as possible, notably by fully
leveraging new modeling capacity and establishing a common model with industry to support
discussions;



Preserving some stability for projects that have already started to produce, or whose
investments plans are locked in, especially in the presence of a license-based regime;



Improving transparency further (mining contracts are already public) by renewing the
authorities’ EITI commitment by addressing previously identified shortcomings and improving
data transmission from mining operators; and



Reinforcing the role of the Ministry of Mines in the governance of the sector and clarifying the
role of the state-owned enterprise Gécamines as a mining operator.

5.

The impact of government spending on inclusive growth and poverty reduction could

be increased by resolutely improving PFM. The necessary decrees pertaining to the 2012 PFM law
(Loi sur les finances publiques) needs to be adopted to accelerate its implementation. Other areas,
including the medium-term budget framework, public investment management, decentralization
(and related provincial PFM), budget tracking and execution, as well as management and planning
of foreign-financed investments all require significant improvements (despite some noticeable
successes). All these reforms require significant coordination and data sharing between numerous
bodies (including foreign donors) and their slow progress is more a reflection of the organizational
inefficiency of the DRC government rather than a lack of competence in any of the concerned
agencies or ministries. Beyond technical issues, progress in the PFM thus hinges on the necessary
political and administrative will.
6.

Delays in PFM reforms can also have a detrimental effect on revenue mobilization

effort. Low or delayed execution, notably for provincial transfers, is a strong incentive for recipient
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

organizations to try meeting their spending needs by mobilizing their own revenue through various
and possibly detrimental means, hence proliferating non-tax measures. Furthermore, difficulties
implementing the revenue sharing formula for provinces (40 percent to the provinces) threatens the
very cohesion of the country by increasing tensions between provinces and between Kinshasa and
the provinces.
Box II.1. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Tax Potential – Some Preliminary Results
An international comparison can provide strong indications on the magnitude of the gap between existing
and potential revenue collection. The literature points to a series of factors that are related to the share of
government revenue in GDP. Income level, openness to international trade, public spending and debt, the
presence of natural resources and access to oceans or sea should have a positive impact on revenue levels,
whereas the importance of agriculture and international aid, should have a negative impact.
Staff performed preliminary regression analyses based on a panel dataset of sub-Saharan non-oil African
countries over the period 1984–2009, in which six measures of revenue (total non aid, of which non-tax and
tax revenue, and in the latter, income tax, sales tax, and international trade taxes) were alternatively
regressed on income per capita, various variables expressed as a share of GDP (agricultural sector, imports,
international aid, public investment, external debt), and dummy variables for the access to sea and the
presence of natural resources. The difference between the predicted values and actual DRC values
represented the revenue gap. Econometric results were overwhelmingly significant and the direction of the
impact matched expectations.
A few key results detailed in Table II.1 are: (i) potential revenue and actual revenue for the DRC significantly
increased over 1984–2013; (ii) the gap between potential and actual revenue narrowed after 2004; (iii) all
types of revenue are below potential, except sales taxes; and (iv) proportionally larger gaps are noted for
international trade taxes and non-tax revenue.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Appendix III. Promoting Financial Stability and Development
1.

The Congolese banking sector remains embryonic and relying on traditional banking

functions. The total financial system assets account for us$3.8 billion, of which total bank assets are
estimated at US$3.6 billion (some 13 of GDP). Banking sector deposits are estimated at
US$2.6 billion (some 9 of GDP), also about 95 percent of the total financial system. The financial
sector includes 246 institutions of which 18 are commercial banks and 143 are in the microfinance
sector, 5 specialized institutions, and state-owned insurance company (SONAS) and the National
Social Security Institute (INSS). The bancarization of the civil servants pay, launched at end-2011 and
estimated at 70 percent of its potential by end-2013, increased the number of deposit accounts in
banks and it is contributing, alongside with the reinforcement of the microfinance sector, to
strengthen the much needed financial inclusion. Funding is mostly dominated by deposits of which
about 90 percent are in sight accounts and USD-denominated. On the asset side, banks keep
loans—most of which are also short term (so-called overdrafts to finance operating expenses) and in
USD—and correspondent accounts abroad. Intermediation activities are almost non-existent.
2.

The financial soundness indicators (FSI) of DRC’s banking system mask substantial

fragilities. Although the FSIs suggest a well capitalized banking system (Table 8) at levels above
comparator economies these ratios mask important weaknesses. First, buffers (e.g., provisions,
capital levels, and reserve requirements) are constituted in local currency (CGF) although banks’
balance sheets are predominantly denominated in US dollar. Second, provisions are not calculated
on the basis of risk profiles, but rather on the basis of recorded unpaid balances and only cover the
unpaid amounts. Third, non-performing loans (on which provisions are calculated) are substantially
underestimated due to the large segment of overdraft loans which do not have maturities (a
phenomenon called “evergreening”) and which are subjected to no or very low provisioning rates.
Furthermore, banks’ profitability levels and earnings are low due to high operational and foreign
exchange transaction costs.
3.

There is a need to strengthen buffers to minimize the vulnerabilities of the financial

sector. The buildup of buffers not only in domestic currency but also in USD is needed as part of the
strategy to de-dollarize the economy while preserving financial stability. In addition to the
shortcomings of measured financial soundness, of supervision data and enforcement, staff’s stress
tests conducted under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) revealed considerable
vulnerabilities to the 2009 crisis-type of shocks (a commodity price plunge and the deterioration of
fiscal revenues), and especially to liquidity shocks. Vulnerabilities also extend to the non-banking
sector. The new increase of the minimum capital requirement for micro-finance institutions that staff

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

commended should help consolidate the rapidly growing sector and strengthen its financial
soundness and governance weaknesses.
4.

There is significant scope for improvements on the supervisory approach, process, and

practices. Banks monitoring requires the adoption of a forward-looking analysis of their risk profile,
based on a methodology that looks at understanding banks’ characteristics, businesses and
vulnerabilities associated. The current supervisory approach of the Central Bank is largely relying on
a series of checks on compliance with laws and regulations rather than a risk assessment approach.
Furthermore, the implementation of the current regulatory framework needs to be applied on a
more systematic and rigorous fashion to prove effective and the coordination between on-site and
off-site supervision as well as licensing functions need to be further reinforced. Staff urges the BCC
to reinforce existing supervisory capacity as the current technical expertise is insufficient.
5.

The framework for crisis management, recovery, and resolution needs to be clarified

and reinforced. The toolkit for crisis management and bank resolution requires regulatory and
operational arrangements that facilitate official financial support to banks (emergency liquidity
assistance and solvency support), prompt corrective actions for banks in non-compliance with
prudential norms, a mechanism for orderly liquidation of failed banks, and, once potential moral
hazard risks are minimized, a well-designed deposit guarantee scheme protecting small local
currency-denominated deposits.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the Congo franc.
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, although the Fund classifies the
Congo franc as an “other managed arrangement”. At end-April 2014, the rate was
US$1=CF 926.99.
Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement; however,
the DRC maintains measures that give rise to one exchange rate restriction and one
multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval. The exchange restriction
involves an outstanding net debt position against other contracting members
under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community
of the Great Lakes Countries. The multiple currency practice relates to a fixed
exchange rate set quarterly applying to transactions through a bilateral payments
agreement with Zimbabwe.
Last Article IV Consultation:
Consultations with the DRC are held in accordance with the provisions of the 2010
Decision on consultation cycles approved in September 2010. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 24, 2012.
Safeguards Assessment:
An updated safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC)
completed in April 2010 found that while most of the 2008 recommendations had
been implemented, significant risks remained. The BCC continued to lack autonomy
from the government and was in need of recapitalization, and the absence of an
independently defined financial reporting framework continued to impair

transparency. The Ministry of Finance completed the first phase of the
recapitalization in March 2011 by bringing the BCC's net worth to zero. The
transition process to a new financial reporting framework has been significantly
protracted; the BCC now aims to issue their 2015 financial statements in accordance
with IFRS.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate (category B as per SM/13/155) for
surveillance and program monitoring purposes, but upgrades to the national accounts, balance of
payments, and government finance statistics would be helpful. In spite of difficulties, the authorities
have continued to produce an array of economic and financial statistics, most of which are published
in the annual report of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) or its monthly statistical bulletin.
National accounts: Annual national accounts (ANA) are compiled in constant and current prices by
National Institute of Statistics (INS) under the Ministry of Plan with the technical assistance (TA) from
IMF/AFC. The compilation methodology has then changed since 2006 with the use of ERETES software
and the compilation of definitive ANA for 2005 and 2006 in compliance with the System of National
Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) (implying an upward revision of GDP by about 60 percent). The insufficient
human resources pushes the authorities of INS to temporary suspend the use of the ERETES software.
The INS compiles then ANA for 2007 to 2009 on a light system with Microsoft Excel. The use of
ERETES software is resumed in 2013 for the compilation of 2010 definitive ANA which are ongoing.
Once the 2010 definitive ANA are achieved a provisional ANA system is supposed to be based on that
2010 ANA to compile 2011, 2012, 2013 etc. accounts.
Price statistics: Consumer price indices (CPI) are calculated for Kinshasa by the INS, the BCC, the
Institute of Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics Section of the U.S. Embassy in
Kinshasa. In 2011, the INS started to compile CPI data Country wide using weights calculated on the
basis of the 2005 household survey. Prices are collected in the 11 provinces (the BCC in 2013 began
the compilation of a similar CPI using a slightly different basket and different weights and based on
prices in 5 provinces).
Government finance statistics: The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis
based on its own accounting for the government cash operations. The treasury produces two sets of
monthly statistics based on its own records: one relates to the transactions executed through the BCC,
the other set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts and off-budget
operations. These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public accounting system and
do not provide sufficient details about the nature of expenditures owing to problems in the
expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce quarterly expenditure data reports
by ministry and institution.
The current work on tax administration and expenditure control is expected to improve the quality
and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In parallel with technical assistance on public expenditure
management, a STA multisector statistics advisor has been advising on government finance statistics,
producing improvements in the quality of the statistics. Furthermore, adoption of a simplified doubleentry bookkeeping system should significantly improve the availability of data on government
financial operations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

In 2003 the DRC reported annual data up to 2002 for the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 but has not reported
subsequently. However, work is underway to resume submission of data to the GFSY, beginning with
data for 2010.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are compiled and reported to the Fund
by the BCC Directorate of Statistics. These statistics are now generally reliable but institutional
coverage, source data, and timeliness issues remain to be addressed.
The BCC has improved data compilation with the adoption in 2007 and 2011 of new charts of
accounts for the central bank and commercial banks, respectively. The sectorization of institutional
units and the classification of financial assets used in these new charts of accounts are broadly in line
with the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual’s methodology. In September 2013, the BCC
completed migration to the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for the submission of its MFS to the
Fund. Since then, SRF-based monetary statistics have been reported to STA for publication in IFS.
Despite this progress, MFS data are still in need of improvements in terms of financial institution
coverage, source data reliability, and the timeliness for reporting the data to the Fund. The depository
corporation survey does not include data from non-bank deposit taking institutions, a growing sector
in the country. In addition, source data from commercial banks are not fully reliable as respondents
do not completely master the new sectoral chart of accounts yet. Similarly, the data is reported with
delays of up to five months in a package that include several months. Only when STA send reminders,
does the BCC submit the data.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled with information on the
exports and imports of large public and semipublic enterprises, BCC payment records, and a survey of
the foreign operations of residents. The estimates also take account of information on the informal
sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local UN Development Program
office, which collects the data from the European Union, embassies, and nongovernmental
organizations. In effect balance of payments statistics are compiled using data from different sources,
supplemented by estimates. In February 2012, the authorities created an interministerial committee,
lead by the central bank and also including representatives from customs, and the National Statistics
Institute and key sectors, to improve the collection and the validation of balance of payment data and
ensure its regular publication.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Fund and the International Development Association.1

Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Improved macroeconomics fundamentals, an increase in the discount rate and the
migration to the 1993 System of National Accounts with an upward revision of the GDP
series advocate in favor of a reclassification of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
debt sustainability rating from high risk to moderate risk of debt distress. However, the
country is still vulnerable to shocks that could lead to a deterioration of some debt
indicators. To maintain this rating the DRC will need to sustain fiscal discipline, create
more fiscal space, including through a better mobilization of domestic revenues (both the
natural resource and non-natural resource sectors), continue to borrow mainly on
concessional terms, and improve its debt management capacity.

This DSA was prepared by International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff with input from the World Bank, using the
standard debt sustainability framework for low-income countries (LIC-DSA); see “Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries.”

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

BACKGROUND
1.
The DRC’s external debt decreased sharply since the country benefited from a substantial
debt relief in 2010. The DRC reached the completion point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative and benefited from assistance under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
in July 2010. The ratio of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt (PPGE) to GDP was reduced from
75 percent at end 2009 to 22 percent in 2010 and represented 18 percent of GDP in 2013. Simultaneously
the private external debt of the country increased from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 4.8 percent in 2013
but its exposure remained relatively limited.
2.
The bulk of outstanding public external debt is owed to official creditors. In 2013, 60 percent
of the debt was owed to multilateral creditors and only 4.5 percent to the bilateral official creditors.
However the share of the debt owed to commercial creditors has marginally increased from 33.0 percent of
the total public debt in 2010 to 35.5 percent at end-2013 (Text Table 1).

3.
Terms of the most recently renegotiated mining investment for the Sino-Congolese (SCCA)
joint venture (known as Sicomines) project do not change the external debt profile. In April 2008, the
DRC signed a cooperation agreement with a consortium of Chinese enterprises involving a US$3.2 billion
mining project and a set of public infrastructure projects totaling US$6 billion to be implemented in two
phases. The Agreement was amended in October 2009 to exclude the second phase public infrastructure
projects, leaving just a single phase totaling US$3 billion to be implemented over the period 2009–14. The
amended agreement also limited the government’s guarantee solely to the financing of the infrastructure
projects. The 2012 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted based on the October 2009
agreement. Implementation of the public investment component stalled in 2012 as legislation envisaged
under the Sicomines agreement was not acted upon by Parliament. In 2013, the Sicomines agreement was
further amended and staff received in early 2014 information about the changes introduced. Based on the
available information, the original financial terms of the agreement have been maintained and the public
guarantee continues to be limited to the infrastructure projects totaling $3 billion. Recent passage of the
legislation paved the way for the resumption of public investment program. The renegotiated agreement

envisages mining production to start in 2015, somewhat earlier than projected in 2009, but with a lower
initial production capacity. However, over the project period, the total size of both the mining and the
public investment projects remained unchanged.
4.
One of the main change since the 2012 DSA is the revision of the GDP series following the
migration to the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA93). With technical assistance from the IMF,
the national accounts were rebased to 2005 from 1987 together with a migration to the SNA93, resulting in
an upward revision of nominal GDP of about 60 percent. The SNA better takes account of the informal
economy and in this context the GDP reevaluation was widely attributed to the private sector, on the
consumption and investment posts. Export and imports data have not been revised upward since estimates
of parallel trade were already included in BOP data. As a result, the revision of the GDP series has a strong
impact on the debt-to-GDP ratios, but not on the other debt ratios (Text Table 2).

5.
As in the 2012 DSA, strong growth over the medium term is supported by large investments
in mining and public infrastructure projects. Projections for mining production have been revised
upward substantially over the short term based on updated information from major mining companies and
the investment profile for the SCCA revised in line with the renegotiated agreement leading to a quicker
accumulation of debt over the next few year. The strong growth in mining production should lead to
stronger fiscal revenues in 2014 after lower than projected fiscal revenues in 2013. The export growth has
been weaker than expected in the previous DSA for 2013 and is projected to increase smoothly over the
medium term (Text Table 3 and Box 1).
6.
Higher discount rate improves some indicators. Compared to the previous DSA the discount
rate in the DSA used to calculate the present value (PV) of external debt has been adjusted upward from
4.0 percent to 5.0 percent, which decreases the present value of the debt.

Box 1. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2014–33
For the medium term (2014–18), projections are consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the
2014 Article IV Consultation, which assumes a strong growth driven by mining production and investments
in infrastructures.
Long-term (2019–33) projections assume macroeconomic stability and a moderate growth on account of a
slowdown in mining production partially offset by sustained increase in investments and a dynamic tertiary
sector.
Real GDP growth is expected to increase from 8.5 percent in 2013 to 8.7 percent in 2014 and average about
7.5 percent during 2015–18. It should decline in the long run to 4.5 percent on average for the period
2019–33.
Average Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator in dollars) is 0.6 percent in 2013 and is expected to
increase to 2.1 percent on average over the medium-long run.
The overall fiscal balance displayed a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and is expected to slightly
increase in the medium-long run to 3.1 percent on average due to a reduction of grants as percent of GDP.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to decrease from 10.0 percent of GDP in 2013 to
6.6 percent in 2018. In the long term it should keep narrowing to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2033, due to the
slowdown of FDIs (which have high import content) and the development of the agricultural sector.
Financing: The authorities are expected to rely increasingly on private financial flows (especially FDIs)
to finance the current account deficit and the public investments. FDIs are expected to decrease in
percent of GDP from 7.4 percent in 2013 to 3.2 percent on average in the medium-long run, but should
remain the main financing source of the current account deficit. Aid flows represented 5.6 percent of GDP in
2013 out of which 1.2 percent were concessional loans. Over the medium term, this ratio would decline
marginally to 5.3 percent by 2017 and further to 1.3 percent by 2033.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS
7.
The most extreme shock leads to a significant breach of the debt to exports ratio and a
slighter breach of the debt to GDP and to revenue ratios, while the other indicators are expected to
remain below their thresholds. With the shock in exports the PV of debt-to-export ratio would increase
significantly from 34 percent in 2013 to 178 percent in 2015 and remain well above the threshold of
100 percent for the main part of the projection period (Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2).
8.
The debt ratios are consistently lower in the historical scenario than the baseline. This is
because the non-interest current account deficit has been lower on average from 2005 to 2012 than
projected for the period 2014–33 in the baseline scenario, and the net inflows of FDI higher. Thus applying
the historical numbers leads to lower gross financing needs and a lower present value of external public
debt. And since the net inflow of FDIs has been higher than the non-interest current account deficit from
2003 to 2012, at an average of 6.9 percent of GDP compared to 2.9 percent, the PV of the external debt
declines to low single digit in the historic scenario during the projected period. Indeed, assuming sustained
larger FDIs than the current account deficit—as is the assumption under the historical scenario—gross
financing needs decline and nominal value of foreign public debt becomes negligible.
9.
Overall, compared with the previous DSA, the current results suggest that the DRC’s risk of
debt distress has decreased from high to moderate. This is largely on account of improved
macroeconomic fundamentals, the significant upward revision of the GDP series and the increase of the
discount rate to 5 percent.

PUBLIC DSA RESULTS
10.
The DRC’s (estimated) domestic debt is primarily domestic arrears. These include arrears
owed to domestic creditors, “social debts” (e.g., wages owed to past government employees), arrears owed
to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), arrears owed to suppliers and contractors, and unpaid judgments and
awards stemming from judicial decisions. Not all of the arrears identified in the last audit of domestic
arrears have been certified and many claims on the government may be at least partly offset by liabilities
owed to the government. Based on the last audit conducted, the debt management unit estimates that
approximately US$1400 million (4.5 percent of 2013 GDP) would be valid after further assessment. Out of
this amount authorities plan to obtain a discount from creditors of at least 50 percent, leaving an amount
of US$700 million to clear; this is the estimate used in this DSA. The baseline includes the expected
clearance of all arrears by 2024. Consequently, while the PV of total public debt-to-GDP ratio is 2.6 percent
of GDP higher in 2013 than that of the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio in the baseline scenario, the
difference declines over time and disappears after 2019 (Figure 2).
11.
Although the fixed primary balance scenario outcome is quite similar to the baseline, the
historical scenario leads to a substantial fall in debt levels similar to historic scenario under the
external debt analysis. The debt ratio in the historical scenario is lower than the baseline partly as a result
of the higher primary fiscal balance (average of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2005–12) used in the historical
scenario projections when compared to the average projected primary deficit in the baseline scenario

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

(average -3.1 percent of GDP over 2014–33, Table 3 and 4). Thus, if on average, real GDP grows as fast as it
did over the last decade and the government pursues a fiscal policy that generates smaller primary deficits
than those forecast under the baseline, it could generate sufficient savings such that the country’s net debt
(debt minus assets) becomes negative after 2023.
12.
Public debt remains sustainable even under the shock scenarios. The most extreme shock is a
shock on GDP growth.2 This implies a raise of the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio from 14.7 percent to a
maximum of 23.0 percent in 2021 that remains below the benchmark of the public debt ratio of 38 percent.
The impact is also significant on the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, which rises to 131.8 percent of GDP
over the long run (64 percentage points of GDP higher than under the baseline).

CONCLUSION
13.
On account of the better macroeconomic fundamentals, an upward revision of the GDP
series, and a higher discount rate the DRC’s debt sustainability rating is upgraded from a high risk
to a moderate risk of debt distress. However, a significant portion of the debt stock and repayment
profile in the DRC is attributable to the publicly-guaranteed Sicomines infrastructure loans and the
Sicomines mining investments which should be carefully monitored. Under the current framework, not only
is the country still vulnerable to a drop in commodity prices that would reduce growth and drive the PV of
debt ratios above their thresholds, but a sizable enough price shock could undermine the economics of the
mining project that is supposed to pay off the infrastructure loans. This would shift the repayment burden
for much or the entire loan outstanding on the government. It is urgent that the DRC improves its
compilation of debt data, including Sicomines data, and strengthens its debt risk analysis capabilities.
Meanwhile, the DRC should continue to take a cautious approach to external borrowing.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Congolese authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Democratic
Republic of the Congo
On June 9, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has continued to post strong economic growth in the
recent years (7 percent on average for 2010–12) despite the difficult domestic security situation.
Mineral production and related investments have become the main drivers of the robust growth,
although economic activity is strengthening in other areas such as the agricultural sector
resulting into a real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8.5 percent in 2013. Fiscal
restraint and the absence of major external price shocks helped to further reduce inflation to a
record low of 1 percent at end-2013. Higher mining exports and sustained inward foreign
investment contributed to an overall balance of payments surplus. However, gross international
reserves increase in 2013 was only sufficient to keep the reserve coverage at 7.7 weeks of non
aid related imports of goods and services, which remains low although the exchange rate
remained remarkably stable since 2010.
Notwithstanding the strong economic growth, poverty remains pervasive and the economy
vulnerable. Limited fiscal space and shocks to revenues often offset by expenditure adjustments
have not supported pro-poor and critical investment spending necessary for inclusive growth,
giving rise to mounting social demands to share in the benefits of the accelerating growth.
Progress in structural reforms was mixed. The government implemented important reforms
aimed at de-dollarizing the economy, deepening financial markets and improving public finance
management (PFM). The Central Bank of Congo (BCC) successfully initiated the introduction of
new denominations of the Congolese Franc and the government expanded public salary

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

payments through banks for most civil servants. Reforms in PFM also progressed with
improvements in the expenditure chain and a reduction of the expenditure float. In contrast,
structural reforms to further the independence of the BCC, including through its recapitalization,
and to improve transparency and governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the mining
sector largely stalled.
Medium-term economic growth prospects remain favorable. The economy is projected to grow
at 8.7 percent in 2014 and on average 7.5 percent during 2015–18. The mining sector is expected
to remain the main driver of growth, including with the investment phase of the Sino-Congolese
joint venture (Sicomines) accelerating. Inflation is projected at 4 percent in 2014, which appears
achievable in light of current low inflation, the BCC sterilizing any excessive liquidity and in the
absence of foreign price shocks. A drop in the international prices of the DRC’s main mineral
exports export represent the main risk to the DRC’s economic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the face of a
challenging external and domestic environment, but noted that notwithstanding the recent strong
economic growth, poverty remains widespread and the attainment of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) is at risk. Directors welcomed the recent positive developments on
the security front and encouraged the authorities to use this window of opportunity to consolidate
recent macroeconomic gains and step up the pace of structural reforms needed to promote
diversified, sustainable and more inclusive growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of creating fiscal space to increase priority social spending
and support public investments for meeting the MDGs, through improvements in public financial
management, better alignment of the budget with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and
strengthened domestic—including non-resource—revenue mobilization. In this regard, they
called for improved tax administration, including by addressing known VAT shortcomings,
tighter control of the tax base, and greater efforts to raise the contribution of the mining sector to
the budget.
Against this backdrop, Directors called for improved governance and transparency and
strengthened oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the mining sector. Corrective
actions in this area could help pave the way for discussion of a possible successor arrangement.
Directors underscored the need to accelerate reforms, including the adoption of a mining code
and petroleum law aligned with international best practices, and encouraged full compliance with

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the adoption of an improved antimoney laundering framework. In this regard, they recommended more effective management of
tax mining assets to avoid SOE revenue losses in the natural resource sector.
Directors called for critical reforms at the Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC) to bolster its
operational independence and accountability, strengthen its capacity to conduct monetary policy,
sustain price and financial sector stability, and instill market confidence. In this context, they
welcomed the authorities’ adoption of a three-year action plan incorporating the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations. They advised swift implementation of key
policy measures—including, recapitalizing the BCC, adoption of the draft law of the statutes of
the BCC and the Banking Law, and divestment of noncore activities. The analytical, regulatory
and supervisory capacity of the BCC should also be strengthened.
Directors called for enhanced exchange rate flexibility in order to set the stage for a more
ambitious accumulation of international reserves, designed to help enhance the economy’s
resilience to exogenous shocks and further strengthen market confidence, especially given the
authorities’de-dollarization strategy.

STATEMENT BY KOSSI ASSIMAIDOU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

JUNE 9, 2014
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) authorities would like to thank Executive
Directors, Management, and staff for their continued support, constructive dialogue, and
valuable advice on macroeconomic policies. My authorities highly appreciate the informative
and candid exchange of views with the mission during the 2014 Article IV consultation, and
thank staff for their advice and policy recommendations. They remain committed to prudent
macroeconomic policies that would preserve macroeconomic stability and to keep advancing
towards higher and sustainable growth.
Following years of macroeconomic instability mainly characterized by hyper- and high
inflation, the DRC has registered in recent years strong macroeconomic performance both
under International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported program (2009–12) and during the post
program period. In particular, growth has accelerated in recent years to reach 8.5 percent in
2013 and is projected at 8.7 percent for this year by staff –although the authorities consider
this projection somewhat conservative and expect growth of 9.5 percent this year and above
10 percent over 2015–17 on account of continued strong expansion in mining production and
agriculture. Inflation has fallen to single digits since 2012 thanks to prudent fiscal and
monetary policies which have translated into domestic fiscal surpluses and successfully
contained excess liquidity. Despite a mixed revenue performance in 2013 mainly due to
challenges in the implementation of the new value-added tax (VAT) (increased VAT credits,
accounting changes related to the VAT refund account), fiscal balance objectives were met
owing to skillful spending adjustments guided by the zero central bank financing anchor.
Building on this encouraging performance and supported by favorable medium-term growth
prospects, my DRC authorities remain committed to diversifying and transforming the
economy through important investments in non-mining sectors notably agriculture, transport,
and communication. They aim to strengthen government revenues against shocks from
commodity prices, expand the fiscal space that is highly needed to meet social needs, and
forcefully tackle the persistent poverty through stronger, job-creating growth notably in
labor-intensive agriculture. In so doing, my authorities are cognizant of the importance of
preserving the hard-won macroeconomic stability; they will continue to take steps to improve
transparency and governance in the natural resource sector which they agree should
contribute more to the budget; and advance financial stability and development. My
authorities broadly share staff’s key policy recommendations.

2
I. POLICY CHALLENGES AND RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
As noted above, the DRC’s growth performance in 2013 was robust, benefitting from a
benign external environment and driven by a growing mining sector and strong performance
from the construction and commercial sectors. Inflation has fallen to low levels and the
exchange rate has remained stable. While reserve coverage has stabilized at about 8 weeks of
imports of goods and services, reserves in nominal terms have continued to accumulate
thanks to a proactive policy on the part of the central bank.
On the fiscal policy front, the authorities have managed to increase domestically-financed
capital spending by an equivalent of 1 percent of GDP to respond to continued investment
needs, despite downward spending adjustment necessitated by the weaker-than-expected
revenue performance, lower budget support and reduced project grants from donors.
On the external sector, the increased current account deficit in 2013 resulted mainly from
higher mining equipment imports as well as higher profits repatriation. The deficit continues
to be financed by increased foreign direct investment (FDI).
My DRC authorities are mindful of the risks that heavy dependence of the economy on the
natural resource sector or renewed armed conflict poses to the macroeconomic stability and
the positive outlook. They fully share the risk assessment conducted by staff and welcome
the policy advice to respond to these risks, notably efforts to boost domestic non-natural
resources mobilization, increase the international reserve buffers to hedge against adverse
external shocks. Building on progress in regional peace-making under the Framework for
Peace signed in February 2013 in Addis Ababa, the DRC authorities continue to work
towards preventing resumption of armed conflicts.
II. TOWARDS SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE GROWTH AMID CONTINUED MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY
A. Macroeconomic Policies and Reforms
My authorities will continue to maintain their fiscal anchor to consolidate fiscal sustainability
and macroeconomic stability, notably low inflation and stable exchange rate. They place
emphasis on revenue mobilization, notably through closely monitoring VAT
reimbursements, tighter control of the tax base, and efforts to raise the contribution of the
mining sector to the budget towards its fair share of the economy. In particular, the tax
revenue growth potential highlighted by staff (Appendix II) confirms the authorities’ vision
in this area. Faced with administrative and infrastructure capacity constraints, the authorities
welcome the IMF’s advice on a new mining code and its technical assistance in designing tax
revenues from the mining sector. They agree that sustaining fiscal discipline, along with a
sound debt strategy—based on concessional borrowing—and stronger debt management
capacity, will help maintain the country’s debt sustainability rating which recently improved
to “moderate risk of debt distress”.

3
Monetary policy continues to aim at containing inflation under a flexible exchange rate
regime. The authorities concur with staff’s view that consolidating macroeconomic stability
will also entail reforming the central bank, Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC), to make it a
more effective and accountable institution. The pace of reforms at the central bank has
picked up. The aim is to disengage from non-core activities, and focus on monetary policy
and strengthening the financial sector regulation and supervision frameworks. The central
bank recapitalization process remains a central piece of the authorities’ reform agenda and
will be pursued along with improvement in the BCC’s operations.
B. Sustained and Inclusive Growth
The authorities share the view on the need to implement policies aimed at sustaining growth
and promoting its inclusiveness. They are cognizant of the critical need to tackle the
electricity gap, develop roads, notably between productive rural areas and consumption
cities; and enhance the business climate. In this regard, they are putting emphasis on the
development of agriculture, which is labor-intensive, and in which important investments are
being negotiated with external partners. Small scale agricultural projects are also being
promoted. My authorities welcome technical assistance in the area of public financial
management, which should help to improve the quality of spending and budget execution.
III. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The DRC has made significant progress in transparency in the natural resource sector. The
authorities will continue the publication of mining contracts as well as annual productions
and exports. Under the leadership of the highest authority, national conferences on mining
resources management (NCMRM) now take place on an annual basis to promote best
practices for transparency and governance in the sector. The recommendations feed into the
governance matrix agreed with the World Bank to enhance transparency in natural resource
management. Finally, the authorities concur with staff advice on the corporate governance of
the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating in the sector, including the need to improve
management and the close monitoring by the government—as the sole or main shareholder—
of the sale of assets by SOEs.
IV. FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DEEPENING
The authorities appreciate the results of the first Financial Sector Assessment Program,
noting the need to develop the financial system, introduce a risk-based supervision to enable
the banking sector to better weather liquidity shocks, and enhance the regulatory framework
and its implementation. The FSAP recommendations are already being implemented through
an exhaustive action plan.
The authorities have taken good note of the pre-requisites presented by the IMF staff to a
credible de-dollarization strategy, notably (i) macroeconomic stability and increased reserve
coverage to enhance the credibility of the national currency; (ii) credible mandate of the

4
central bank to pursue price stability as its primary objective; (iii) effectiveness,
independence and accountability of the central bank; (iv) clear legal and regulatory

V. CONCLUSION
The DRC has registered significant macroeconomic performance in recent years. Mindful of
the long way to put the economy on a sustained and inclusive growth path, my authorities are
committed to sound policies and transformative reforms. Donor support remains critical to
the DRC ongoing efforts to strengthen the economy, address capacity constraints, develop its
resources and reduce poverty. In this regard, they welcome the IMF’s continued support to
the DRC and look forward to greater IMF engagement under an Extended Credit Facility
program, which would help to catalyze this assistance and enable the DRC to achieve its
development goals.
