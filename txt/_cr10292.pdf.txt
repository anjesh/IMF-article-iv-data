Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Guyana
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dhaneshwar Ghura

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Background. Guyana has sustained a solid economic performance in recent years,
supported by a strengthened policy framework. New GDP series recently released reveal
that the debt overhang is lower than previously estimated, while the fiscal and current
account deficits are also smaller. In 2009, output growth was robust despite the global
crisis, and the outlook for 2010 remains positive. However, with public debt still at high
levels, and continued real, fiscal, and financial vulnerabilities, there is a case for staying
the course of prudent policies, given the downside risks to the outlook.



Key policy recommendations and authorities’ views. While there was broad agreement
on the need to preserve a prudent policy framework to further entrench fiscal and debt
sustainability, the stronger-than-envisaged fiscal consolidation achieved in 2009 allows
for a somewhat more gradual pace for fiscal tightening in 2010–11. This will help
accommodate priority infrastructure spending, and support growth. In the short term,
inflation risks are expected to remain contained by the presence of a negative (albeit
narrowing) output gap and a cautious monetary policy stance. Recent efforts to
strengthen banking supervision should be accompanied by a careful monitoring of asset
quality, and enhanced prudential measures. Ongoing structural reforms to modernize the
sugar sector and diversify Guyana’s productive base are critical to sustaining long-term
growth and alleviating poverty. Data quality and dissemination efforts could be enhanced
further, including through subscribing to GDDS.



Exchange rate system. Guyana’s de jure exchange rate regime is a managed float and the
Fund has classified the de facto regime as a stabilized arrangement. There have been no
changes in the exchange system and the related legal framework since the last Article IV
Consultation.



Mission. The team that visited Georgetown during January 6–16, 2010 comprised
María González (Head), Magda Kandil, Carla Macario (all WHD), and Felix Eschenbach
(SPR). Leslie-Ann DesVignes, (OED, Senior Advisor) and Maurizio Bussolo (World
Bank) also participated in the discussions. The team met with Minister of Finance
Ashni Singh, Central Bank Governor Lawrence Williams, representatives of the private
sector, labor, and the donor community, and members of the political opposition.

I. CONTEXT
1.
In recent years, Guyana has sustained a solid macroeconomic performance,
supported by a strengthened policy framework. Newly released GDP series (based on
2006 prices) suggest that Guyana’s economic growth exceeded 4 percent a year on average
during 2007-09—compared with 3½ percent in the previous GDP series (based on 1988
prices), while nominal GDP at market value is some 65 percent higher than before. This
reflects, in part, the incorporation of new economic sectors, and of the previously large
informal activity that moved into the formal sector since Guyana changed course in the late
1980s (Box 1). Inflation has declined steadily since the imported price shock of 2008, to
around 3½ percent at end-2009. This performance owes much to the implementation of
prudent policies, which have helped reign in public debt, while supporting growth and
external stability.
2.
While Guyana has been
adversely affected by the global crisis,
it has weathered it significantly better
than its Caribbean peers—and policy
indicators have strengthened relative
to regional standards. Guyana’s real
GDP growth was generally below the
regional average in the first half of the
decade, but the pace of economic activity
has picked up since 2006, and showed
much higher resilience to the 2009
global crisis than the rest of the region
(Figure 1). Inflation has been contained
at lower levels than in other Caribbean
commodity exporters, and the fiscal
deficit has narrowed steadily in recent
years. Concurrently, debt ratios have
improved—also supported by debt
relief—bringing external debt within the
regional range, while domestic debt is
low relative to the Caribbean average.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic activity strengthened in 2009, and inflation declined. Real growth was
about 3¼ percent in 2009, up from 2 percent in 2008 (Figure 2).1 Economic activity was
affected during the first half of the year by difficulties with the start-up of the new large
public sugar plant at Skeldon, and the impact of the global and weather shocks on the sugar
and bauxite industries. In the second half, economic growth benefited from robust activity in

the non-tradable sectors and a recovery in agriculture and gold production (see Attachment I:
“The Impact of the Global Crisis through the Real Channel”). End-year inflation fell to
3½ percent from 6½ percent in 2008, reflecting the decline in world commodity prices.
4.
In 2009, the external current account deficit narrowed, while the international
reserve position strengthened significantly. The current account deficit fell by some
5 percent of GDP, to 8½ percent, driven by a

allocation, led to a large increase in gross
reserves, to US$623 million at year-end.2
5.
Monetary policy tightened, supporting the decline in inflation. Growth of broad
money—the monetary policy anchor—fell to 9.7 percent in December (y/y), compared to
12.7 percent a year earlier. T-Bill rates rose in real terms—turning from being negative in
2008 to positive in 2009 as inflation declined, leading commercial banks to increase their
holdings of government securities, in the context of a slow demand for credit. The nominal
currency has remained broadly stable against the U.S. dollar.
6.
The pace of fiscal consolidation
strengthened in 2009, helping contain public
debt. The NFPS deficit (after grants) is estimated to
have declined to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2009 from
4.7 percent in 2008, on the back of strong fuel
excise collections that offset a modest underperformance by public enterprises and a shortfall in
official grants. This outturn was equivalent to a
deficit of 5.3 percent of (old) GDP—below the
budget target of 6½ percent of (old) GDP. Owing to
this retrenchment, public debt (net of savings of
PetroCaribe-related disbursements) declined by
about 1 percent of GDP to 56¾ percent of (new) GDP.

Box 1. The Rebased GDP Figures
GDP data have been rebased from 1988 to 2006. As a result of these changes, 2009 GDP at market
prices is higher than previously estimated by 64 percent. Preliminary estimates suggest that the new
GDP per capita reached US$2,630 as of end-2008, up from US$1,504 in the old series. The rebasing
project benefited from technical assistance from the U.S. Census Bureau (under an IDB project) and
CARTAC. The establishment of the new base year aimed at capturing changes in relative industrial
costs and price structures, the large informal sector that has gradually formalized itself since the late
1980s, and the emergence of new economic activities. The project has improved the national accounts
compilation system.1
The change in sectoral composition reflects better
accounting of activity in key sectors. The rebased
GDP includes higher weights for several sectors. For
example, the government services sector now captures
statutory bodies. Health and education
services─formerly classified under the government
sector─are now separated and expanded to include
private sector activities. The distribution sector has an
expanded coverage of commodity flows (using data on
imports and domestic production), and an improved
estimation of trade margins. The mining and quarrying
sector now reflects a larger share of gold and diamond
production, and a lower share of bauxite. The new
benchmark for manufacturing reflects the use of an
expanded index of 47 products; and the “other services”
sector captures new categories, including hotels and
restaurants, and professional services.
The transportation and communications sector saw
several important coverage enhancements—for instance,
the scope of communications was broadened to include cell
phone activities, and internet service providers and TV
broadcasting. The operations of mini buses, taxis, lorries,
domestic air services and coastal speedboats, and the
services provided by air/sea ports and bridges are now in the
transportation sector.
The importance of the sugar sector in total output
declined. As an industry, sugar's calculations are robust,
since they draw on data from the public company. However,
the old series used an arbitrary split in the value added
between agriculture and manufacturing, while the new
series draw on actual employment costs, while sugar
manufacturing was reclassified into manufacturing.

There were no major changes in the coverage of
financial services, as commercial banks’ activities are generally well measured. However, the
new series introduce enhanced estimation techniques. Going forward, there is scope for improving
measurements of the insurance sector.

Growth in real terms (y/y, percent)

7.
The impact of the global crisis on the financial sector has been limited so far, but
private sector credit has slowed. In early 2009, banks tightened their lending standards and
private sector credit growth slowed to about 6 percent by December (y/y), down from nearly
22 percent in 2008. Banks remain liquid and well capitalized. Although NPLs for the banking
sector have declined significantly over the last

The authorities have undertaken reforms to address fiscal and financial risks:



Fiscal Sector. To enhance the accounting and transparency of public investment, a
modern chart of accounts for capital expenditure has been introduced into the
integrated financial management system (IFMAS); in addition, the authorities are
piloting an exercise with IDB support to integrate donor projects into the IFMAS.
Efforts to improve the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) also continue, including by
consolidating the new functional organization, completing the rolling out the
integrated tax information system (TRIPS), and the improvements in filing, refund,
arrears collection and audit functions. The zero-rated VAT list has not been
expanded, and the authorities are adhering to the existing system of rules-based tax
exemptions, which has remained broadly unchanged in the last year.

3

The commercial bank absorbed these losses directly.

7


Financial Sector. To deepen financial sector surveillance, the authorities have legally
consolidated insurance and bank supervision at the central bank, incorporated riskbased supervision, and issued new guidelines on risk management. The authorities are
also publishing regularly key financial soundness indicators for licensed deposittaking institutions. In addition, the AML/CFT Act and the Money Transfer Agencies
Act were enacted in 2009, while the bill for authorizing the operation of Credit
Bureaus was tabled in Parliament.

9.
The agenda has also focused on achieving sustainable long-term growth and
alleviating poverty:


Sugar sector. Reforms continued to focus on modernizing the sugar sector through
ensuring that the new plant at Skeldon becomes fully operational, and by raising
overall efficiency.



Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). Recent progress includes a model
agreement signed with Norway, which would provide US$250 million in 2010–15 in
exchange for the preservation of Guyana’s rainforests. These resources would
support, inter alia, the development of non-traditional economic sectors and the
reconversion of Guyana’s fuel-dependent energy sectors.



Infrastructure. The government is spearheading key projects as Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs) to help close the infrastructure gap. These include the
construction of a hydropower plant at Amalia Falls (with private sector financing for
some 23 percent of GDP from China and the IDB), and a 450 km. road, connecting
Guyana’s interior to Brazil (11–16 percent of GDP). Public investment plans include
an access road to Amalia Falls, and improving electricity generation and distribution.



Business climate The authorities computerized business registration and incorporated
the records into the Deeds Registry in 2009. In addition, the authorities provided
support to small enterprises through the creation of facilitation programs providing
advisory services (including with IDB support) and the improvement of community
market infrastructure.

The development of a monitoring and evaluation system (with support of the UNDP
and the IDB) will enhance the effectiveness of public spending.

Box 2. Key Policy Recommendations of the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Staff’s advice centered on the need to:


Continue implementing a sound policy framework. A more gradual deficit reduction than
previously envisaged was appropriate, given the global slowdown. A faster convergence than
planned to the previous fiscal framework was recommended over the medium term. While the
exchange rate was broadly in line with fundamentals, some additional flexibility was desirable.



Enhancing financial system surveillance. While there were no signs of financial distress, staff
recommended intensified monitoring of the sector, the development of a crisis response plan, and
enhancing the reporting of standard prudential indicators.



Implementing structural reform. Given the importance of the sugar modernization plan, it was
imperative to address business and labor relations, and prepare contingency measures. Continuing
to address the high cost and unreliability of energy generation was also considered important. In
addition, it was recommended to avoid a further expansion of the zero-rated VAT list, adhering to
a system of rules-based exemptions and continue improving the revenue administration.



Pressing ahead with the poverty reduction agenda, through ensuring consistency between the
medium-term framework and the PRSP, while establishing an effective system for its monitoring
and evaluation.

Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment and welcomed the policy
advice. They expressed their readiness to implement measures to contain the deficit and achieve the
inflation target as needed. They planned to enhance financial sector supervision and implement the
structural reform agenda. They noted that they would continue to favor exchange rate stability, since
greater flexibility could lead to excessive volatility, which could be disruptive in their view.

III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The baseline macroeconomic outlook remains positive for 2010 and the medium
term. Guyana would benefit from the global recovery, the coming on stream of the Skeldon
sugar plant, and the start-up of public investment projects, which would spur average growth
to 4-5 percent in the medium term. Growth is projected to gradually converge to its potential
rate of 3¼ percent over the long term. 4 While fully financed, the external current account
4

As agreed with the authorities, long-term potential output growth is now estimated to be somewhat higher than
in the 2008 Article IV Consultation (at 3¼ percent of GDP in the baseline scenario, compared to 3 percent a
year ago). This accounts for the improved performance of the Guyanese economy in recent years, the impact of
planned public investment in 2010–14, and the effect of the revised GDP accounting, vis-à-vis the remaining
risks and vulnerabilities. The large PPP projects have not been included into the baseline projections of this
report, since they are still under evaluation.

9
deficit would widen somewhat in 2010—led by rising world oil prices, the elimination of
sugar price preferences by the EU, and the up tick in domestic demand—before narrowing in
subsequent years.

Risks appear tilted to the downside in the near term, but are balanced over the
longer term. Key downside risks include those linked to a weaker or delayed global
recovery, higher-than-envisaged oil prices, and further delays in completing the
modernization of the public sugar company—which is critical to the baseline growth
projection. The recent elimination of preferential sugar prices by the EU, which will
increasingly expose Guyana to the volatility of world market prices for its sugar exports,
could also complicate the outlook, notwithstanding the recent firming of sugar prices in the
world market. Upside potential hinges on the sound completion of key large investment
projects through PPPs, the eventual exploitation of Guyana’s oil reserves (expected to begin
in 2014), and on the potential benefits from the global carbon credit markets on account of
the country’s rainforests in the context of the LCDS.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions took place against the backdrop of strengthened economic prospects,
despite remaining vulnerabilities and risks to the outlook. Thus, the focus was on
establishing:


A Macroeconomic Policy Framework to Support Growth and Protect Sustainability.
The newly rebased GDP series, coupled with a stronger-than-envisaged fiscal
consolidation in 2009, have revealed a larger space for fiscal policies to accommodate
key investment spending and remain supportive of growth. It will be important to strike a
balance between allowing for a more gradual fiscal consolidation while staying the

10
course of prudent policies to consolidate fiscal and debt sustainability. In this context,
monetary policy should remain cautious to ensure price stability.


An Agenda to Further Reduce Vulnerabilities, Entrench Growth, and Alleviate
Poverty. Reducing vulnerabilities would require measures to restrain fiscal risks linked
to public investment and PPPs, and further strengthening the financial sector. Reforms to
modernize the sugar industry, diversify the productive base, and enhance the business
climate are critical to sustaining long-term growth and speeding up poverty reduction.

A. A Macroeconomic Policy Framework to Support Growth and Protect Sustainability
Fiscal Policies
13.
The authorities plan to maintain prudent fiscal policies in the near and medium
term to protect sustainability. Following an important upfront consolidation effort in 2009,
the 2010 budget and medium term plans envisage a somewhat slower fiscal tightening. The
path would maintain the NFPS deficit at
19

around 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010–11,

and gradually converge to a deficit of 2.2

public investment.
14.
Staff agreed that the fiscal stance was appropriate, but noted that risks call for
heightened caution. While the rebased GDP data has revealed a lower debt overhang than
considered earlier, Guyana still faces a risk of moderate debt distress.5 Moreover, the revised
consolidation path could entail a somewhat pro-cyclical fiscal stance in the medium term.
These and other downside risks (including those related to the sugar sector and world fuel
prices) require exercising fiscal prudence, including through contingency planning. The
authorities stressed that the fiscal effort of 2009 had aligned the outturn with the
consolidation path agreed at the time of the 2008 Article IV consultation earlier than
envisaged. In addition, the fiscal impulse would shield growth against downside risks, while
upside risks to potential output from productive infrastructure spending also lessened the
urgency for faster consolidation. They expressed their readiness to implement expenditure
measures, if needed, to meet the fiscal targets and protect debt sustainability. They also
5

on debt service (see Guyana—Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis).

11
concurred with staff that a balanced package of structural measures to further strengthen the
revenue administration and to secure the long-term viability of the National Insurance
System—including through parametric reform—along with a phased reduction of nonpriority spending would be critical to maintain a low fiscal deficit. This, along with the
continued savings of a large share of the PetroCaribe disbursements would help gradually
bring the PV of public debt closer to the DSA benchmark of 40 percent of GDP. 6

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
The monetary stance appears appropriate to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Staff noted that while inflation is currently low, it will be important to prevent the rekindling
of inflationary pressures through an early monetary policy easing. The authorities noted that
they would continue conducting monetary policy through open market operations,7 and
agreed that the high liquidity available in the system should provide a buffer to satisfy a pick
up in the demand for private sector credit, as global conditions recover further. The
authorities stressed their readiness to tighten monetary policy—should inflationary pressures
develop—to ensure compliance with their inflation objective of 4 percent.
16.
Staff observed that a move toward greater exchange rate flexibility would
provide a useful buffer against external shocks, but noted that there was space to
implement this gradually. The still high volatility in prices for Guyana’s commodity
exports provides some rationale for following a gradual approach to prevent disruptive
exchange rate fluctuations from temporary shocks given the still volatile global conditions—
particularly as international reserves remain comfortable. At the same time, greater flexibility
would contain fiscal costs linked to sterilization and enhance the effectiveness of monetary
6

Net public debt excludes PetroCaribe disbursements that are saved in an escrow account. In the baseline
scenario, these deposits are assumed to rise hand-in-hand with larger PetroCaribe disbursements, as world fuel
prices increase over the medium term—following past practice by the Guyanese authorities.

12
policy. As in the past, the authorities expressed a preference for exchange rate stability—
noting that, in their view, volatility could be disruptive, including because of the still
relatively thin market and Guyana’s exposure to commodity price shocks. Guyana’s real
effective exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in equilibrium (Box 3).
B. An Agenda to Lower Fiscal Risks, Entrench Growth, and Alleviate Poverty
17.
There was agreement that implementing a sound investment framework would
be critical to minimizing fiscal risks and protecting sustainability.


Public investment should be of high quality. Projects should ensure a high value-formoney, and help enhance Guyana’s growth and debt-repayment capacity. In the sugar
sector, there was agreement on the urgency of ensuring the full operation of the
Skeldon plant, increasing mechanization and planning against weather shocks, and
establishing a stable framework to address labor conflicts. The authorities are
enhancing the fiscal accounting and transparency of investment projects with the
IDB, and undertaking detailed cost-benefit analysis of all of the large donor projects,
to ensure their feasibility. Staff recommended gradually expanding these initiatives to
all public investment. There was agreement that continued access to high
concessional terms remains critical to protect sustainability. There was also
agreement that the LCDS may play a pivotal role in catalyzing green funds for the
development of new sectors.



Minimizing fiscal risks from PPPs will require close attention to international best
practice. While PPPs can facilitate private participation, they can also pose
sustainability risks, particularly in the presence of sovereign guarantees. Staff urged
the authorities to ensure that PPP contracts provide a fair balance of risks between the
private and public sectors, limit fiscal contingencies, and prevent renegotiation risks,
observing that these features could eventually be entrenched into a comprehensive
legal framework for PPPs. The authorities agreed to reflect any firm or contingent
liabilities from upcoming PPP contracts in the public debt statistics. They also noted
that the hydropower plant at Amalia Falls should go a long way in limiting exposure
to world oil prices and improving reliability, while clarifying that the IDB is still
assessing the economic and environmental viability for the project under the new
global conditions. Likewise, the Brazilian authorities continue to evaluate the BrazilGuyana road project, also with IDB technical support. Prospects for starting oil
extraction in 2014 remain positive.



Other contingent liabilities should be limited. In this context, the fiscal costs related
to the resolution of CLICO should be minimized.

13

Box 3: Surveillance Decision: External Sustainability Assessment
Guyana’s real effective exchange rate has been depreciating since its peak in January
2008. The real depreciation of 10 percent between end-January 2009 and November 2009 has
reversed the sharp real effective appreciation of
130
210
Exchange Rates
the Guyanese dollar of 11 percent that took place
205
in the second half of 2008, and largely reflects
120
G$/US$
(right)
the volatility of the U.S. dollar (which the
200
110
Guyanese dollar follows closely) vis-à-vis the
195
Euro and other major currencies.1
CGER-type of analysis suggests that the
Guyanese dollar is broadly in equilibrium.
The assessment relies on the external
sustainability (ES) and macroeconomic balance
(MB) approaches.2 In a baseline scenario, the
results indicate that the real effective exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Under
both methodologies, results show an estimated
misalignment in both directions of less than
5 percent in each case.
Sensitivity analysis confirms these results. Given
the well-known uncertainties linked to the CGERanalysis, a number of sensitivity tests were
conducted, based on changes to key parameters, for
both the ES and MB approaches. The results
indicate, in all cases, that the deviation of the
REER from equilibrium is moderate (of less than
10 percent) in both directions in the stress tests.

An assessment based on the financial account
suggests that sustainability risks are balanced. Staff projects a gradual decline in external
financing needs after a temporary widening of the current account deficit in 2010. Private and
official capital inflows are expected to be sufficient, as FDI and remittances have not been
drastically affected by the global crisis, while large IFI and bilateral disbursements are being
secured to finance key infrastructure projects in the next few years. Sustainability has been
buffed up through the SDR allocation. Higher oil prices, while raising current account
pressures, would be mirrored by financial inflows from PetroCaribe; Guyana could become a
net oil exporter in 2014.

18.
The authorities plan on a prompt publication of the PRSP. With the soon-to-bepublished PRSP based on 2006 data, they are working towards including an updated
macroeconomic framework and an MDG costing exercise in subsequent PRSPs.
C. An Agenda to Address Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
19.
Staff stressed the need to continue monitoring commercial banks closely. Recent
data suggest that the banking system as a whole would withstand a series of shocks before
becoming vulnerable, although resilience varies across individual banks (see Attachment IV:
Guyana—The Financial Sector). While the authorities stressed their ongoing efforts to
enhance financial supervision, staff urged them to require banks to increase provisions, and
tighten the legislation on the exposure to large borrowers and related-party lending. It would
also be important to ensure that all banks prepare crisis management plans of sufficient
quality. The authorities noted that existing legislation embeds a reliable framework to
provide liquidity support and deal with troubled licensed financial institutions; staff noted the
importance of ensuring that these provisions—including, for instance, the eligibility
requirements for liquidity support—remained consistent with the evolving structure of the
financial system. A program that extends tax and reserve requirement exemptions on small
mortgages also requires monitoring, to avoid excessive exposures from developing in
households’ balance sheets.
20.
While welcoming efforts to deepen the financial system, staff noted that strict
regulatory standards are critical for non-bank financial institutions. As most licensed
non-bank financial institutions are now under central bank supervision, staff encouraged the
authorities to bring credit unions and cooperatives within the same regulatory perimeter.
Staff also recommended that draft legislation to bring the mortgage institution NBS under
direct central bank supervision be tabled in Parliament. There was agreement that ongoing
efforts to reduce the large interest rate spreads, including though the development of new
financial instruments (with IDB technical support) would help deepen financial sector
intermediation.
D. Data Provision
21.
The authorities have made important efforts to improve data quality in the past
year, but the timely availability of data is still an issue. Staff noted the very significant
progress entailed in the finalization of the rebased GDP. New CPI series, also prepared with
CARTAC assistance, are being compiled in line with a new basket. Staff urged the
authorities to complement these efforts by expanding and accelerating data provision, and to
subscribe to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The authorities agreed to
review the GDDS requirements, and are considering an eventual subscription to the system.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
With a fresh perspective on its economic stance at hand, Guyana is at a crossroad. New GDP series suggest that economic performance in recent years has been stronger
than previously considered, while inflation has declined to low levels since the 2008 food
price shock. Guyana has weathered the global crisis well, in part owing to the

15
implementation of prudent policies. Going forward, it will be important to strike an
appropriate balance between using the fiscal space to entrench the economic recovery, and
protecting sustainability, given persistent vulnerabilities and risks to the outlook.
23.
Modernizing the sugar sector and diversifying Guyana’s productive base are
critical to sustaining growth. Staff welcomes the innovative plans under the Low Carbon
Development Strategy, and those to finalize the modernization of the sugar sector. Given its
key role in the Guyanese economy, it will be critical for the public sugar company to
implement its recovery measures, and ensure the rapid operation of the plant.
24.
In the period ahead, the authorities’ commitment to prudent policies should be
underpinned by a heightened fiscal caution, given the risks to the outlook. Staff
welcomes the consolidation effort exerted in 2009, which provides a buffer to debt
sustainability, while opening space for medium-term fiscal policies to remain supportive to
growth, including by accommodating key infrastructure spending. While the authorities’
overall fiscal stance in the near and medium term is broadly appropriate, it will be critical to
prevent debt and inflation risks that could emerge from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. In this
context, staff commends the authorities’ readiness to take expenditures measures, if needed,
to meet their fiscal targets, support price stability, and protect debt sustainability. Pressing
ahead with the implementation of ongoing or planned structural reforms in the revenue
administration and the National Insurance System should serve this objective well.
25.
Minimizing fiscal risks from public investment and public-private-partnerships
will be critical to ensuring debt sustainability. Public projects should ensure a high valuefor-money, and help enhance Guyana’s growth and debt-repayment capacity. Staff welcomes
efforts to enhance the economic assessment, fiscal accounting, and transparency of
investment projects from donors, which could gradually be expanded to all public
investment. Staff commends the authorities’ commitment to seeking access to high
concessional terms to protect debt sustainability. Minimizing fiscal risks from PPPs will
require close attention to international best practices, particularly to limit risks linked to
sovereign guarantees. It will also be critical to reflect any firm or contingent liabilities from
PPPs in the public debt statistics. The authorities’ decision to minimize the fiscal cost from
the resolution of CLICO is welcome.
26.
It will be important to prevent an emergence of inflationary pressures as the
recovery ensues. In this context, the authorities’ decision to maintain a tight monetary policy
stance is adequate, especially since the high liquidity level in the system provides a buffer to
satisfy a pick up in the demand for private sector credit. While moving toward greater
exchange rate flexibility would provide a buffer against shocks, a gradual approach would
help prevent disruptive exchange rate fluctuations stemming from temporary terms of trade
shocks and Guyana’s still thin foreign exchange market—particularly as international
reserves remain comfortable.
27.
The balance of risks calls for a careful monitoring of the domestic financial
system. So far, the banking system has remained broadly resilient to the global crisis.
However, the level of NPLs, provisioning, borrower concentration and related-party credit
raise concerns. In this context, staff welcomes the forthcoming reporting and monitoring

16
guidelines for financial institutions, and urges the authorities to require banks to step up their
provisioning levels, and to tighten the legislation on the exposure to large borrowers and
related-party lending. While the recent initiatives to deepen financial intermediation (such as
the forthcoming law on Credit Bureaus) are commendable, the program that extends tax
exemptions and reserve requirements on mortgage loans should be monitored closely, to
avoid developing exposures in households’ balance sheets. Staff welcomes the recent
amendment to bring insurance supervision under the purview of the central bank; and
recommends to gradually bring credit unions and cooperatives under the same regulatory
perimeter of other nonbank financial institutions, and to bring the mortgage institution NBS
under direct central bank supervision.
28.
The authorities’ long-standing commitment to poverty reduction calls for a
prompt publication of the PRSP. Given the importance of including an updated
macroeconomic framework and an MDG costing exercise in subsequent PRSPs, staff
welcomes ongoing work with donor support to cost the achievement of the MDGs.
29.
The important improvements in data quality achieved in the recent year should
be accompanied by a further strengthening in data availability. Staff commends the very
significant progress entailed in the finalization of the rebased GDP and CPI series. Staff also
welcomes the authorities’ decision to review the requirements of the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) with a view of considering a future subscription.
30.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ATTACHMENT I. THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS THROUGH THE REAL CHANNEL8
31.
Guyana has been affected by the
global crisis mainly through the real sector
channel. Initially shielded by its limited
exposure to the direct financial shock, it has
suffered mostly as its main sources of foreign
income—including remittances and FDI
inflows—declined, led by the contraction of
growth and employment in developed
economies. In addition, the reduction in
prices and global demand also hit the
country’s commodity exports.
32.
The steep decline in global
economic activity has reduced demand for
Guyanese exports. Lower export prices had
adverse effects on exports and growth. The
largest declines were recorded in the prices of
bauxite and rice. While rice output grew by
9 percent, bauxite output declined by
31 percent in 2009. In contrast, an increase in
gold production of 21 percent followed the
firming up in the gold price (12½ percent).

foreign exchange inflows. Remittances grew
at an average rate of nearly 55 percent a year
in 2004–08—to about 17 percent of (new) GDP, the largest level in the region. However,
these flows declined by 9 percent in 2009.

34.
A recent private sector study9 suggests that the global crisis has affected not only
the export sectors, but also their related services. Based on information collected through
focus groups and surveys, the study suggests that the decline in production ranged from 5–30
percent across different sectors. For instance, manufacturing production and sales declined
by approximately 15 percent overall in the first half of 2009, relative to the same period in
2008, reflecting lower consumer demand. The services sector also posted a decline, with
distribution activity falling by some 15 percent, and tourism by around 20 percent.
Participants noted that firms resorted to hoarding employment, while pursuing other cost
cutting strategies to weather the shock.

31
ATTACHMENT II. GUYANA: ELIMINATION OF THE EU SUGAR PREFERENCES10
35.
Guyana’s sugar sector has strongly benefited from preferential agreements with
the EU since the 1970s. Preferential access was gained mainly under the terms of the Sugar
Protocol, which guaranteed sugar purchases by the EU from Guyana for some
160,000 metric tons a year at a fixed price. In 2008, the average guaranteed price was set at
US$715 per ton (€485 per ton). In contrast, the price offered in the US market was US$470
per ton, while the average world market price was US$275 per ton in the same year.
36.
Although the EU eliminated most of
these advantages in October 2009, transitional
arrangements are in place. Since October,
Guyana benefits from a minimum guaranteed
price of €301.5 a ton until September 2012.
Guyana may sell at world market prices, if these
prices are higher—which has been the case since
late 2009. In addition, the CARIFORUM-EU
Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)
concluded in October 2008 ensures that sugar is
duty and quota free since October 2009. However,
a transitional safeguard mechanism would apply
for the next 6 years, limiting exports in the event
of a risk of serious damage to the EU sugar
industry.

Agreements with other trading partners entail more modest benefits:


United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues sugar quotas under
the Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) system on a country-by-country basis. Under this system,
sugar enters the U.S. duty free. The quota allocated to Guyana in the fiscal year 2009
amounts to 12,636 metric tons of raw sugar. Recent U.S. import data suggest that the
quota is unlikely to be filled, in part because of the lower prices prevailing in the U.S.
market.



CARICOM. The CARICOM Common Market establishes a Common External Tariff
(CET) to protect certain regional products. A 40 percent duty applies to brown (raw) cane
sugar from outside the region. This agreement has allowed Guyana to import sugar from
CARICOM for domestic consumption in order to benefit from EU prices when
production capacity was low.

37.
The removal of EU preferences will have an important adverse impact on
Guyana. The EU is the main export destination for Guyanese sugar—accounting for at least
10

See the companion Selected Issues Paper “Guyana: The Impact of the Elimination of Preferential Sugar
Prices”.

32
90 percent of total. Further, the EU preferential agreements have allowed Guyana to generate
windfall revenue exceeding the market sugar price amounting to nearly 55 percent of total
sugar revenue in recent years.
38.
Guyana has been modernizing its sugar sector to mitigate this effect but the
modernization program is subject to severe challenges. Supported by a transitory financial
package from the EU, a sugar modernization plan was launched in 2000 to raise output and
reduce production costs, including by the construction of a large sugar factory at Skeldon,
recently completed. Technical problems with the operations of the new factory, labor
disputes, and managerial weaknesses all have surfaced in 2009, further complicated by
weather shocks. Resolving these issues will require a significant strengthening of the
management and improving labor and business practices.

33
ATTACHMENT III. ASSESSING GUYANA’S FISCAL STRUCTURAL POLICIES11
39.
Guyana’s fiscal balance is highly exposed to exogenous shocks. In particular, it has
large exposures to sugar revenues and grants,12 and is vulnerable to external shocks
transmitted through commodity exports and fuel imports, remittances, and other channels of
regional contagion. As a result, the overall fiscal balance does not represent the best measure
of the discretionary fiscal effort exerted by the authorities, although it is a key determinant to
the debt dynamics
15

40.
The fiscal impulse is the most
appropriate measure to assess the stance of
discretionary policies in Guyana. This is
measured by the change in the “cyclically
adjusted” domestic primary balance, which
excludes external revenues from sugar and
grants, as well as the impact of the domestic
business cycle on tax revenues.13 It allows for a
better assessment of the magnitude and impact
of discretionary fiscal policy measures. It also
constitutes a useful indicator for guiding the
medium-term fiscal framework, to gradually
allow for the implementation of neutral or
countercyclical policies, made consistent with a
continued reduction in the public debt-to-GDP
ratio to sustainable levels.14
41.
Staff estimates suggest that Guyana’s
fiscal impulse was broadly countercyclical
for most of the past decade. In 2005, the steep
decline in real GDP following severe floods
was partly offset by a strong expansionary
fiscal impulse. Conversely, in 2007, a fiscal
policy tightening accompanied the closing
output gap. In 2008, fiscal measures to contain

The structural fiscal balance plays a key role in the medium-term fiscal framework of several commodityexporting countries that have significantly improved their fiscal position and reduced their debt (including Chile
and Norway).

34
the pass-through of commodity prices into the economy countered the widening of the
negative output gap driven by the surge of commodity prices and output shortfalls in the
sugar sector. Nonetheless, a fiscal retrenchment in 2009 supported the debt sustainability
goal.
42.
Policies in 2010 would remain supportive to growth, given the presence of a
negative (albeit closing) output gap. The authorities’ efforts to reduce the infrastructure gap
in 2011–12 would also entail a positive fiscal impulse. While this would appear somewhat
pro-cyclical in light of the narrowing output gap, uncertainties on its size and pace of change
nuance the risks of this stance. In particular, infrastructure spending could lead to a higherthan-envisaged potential output, widening the gap. Moreover, downside risks to the outlook
could also slow output growth, preventing the gap to close as fast as projected.

35
ATTACHMENT IV. GUYANA: THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
43.
Guyana’s banking system has so far been resilient to the direct impact of the
global crisis.15 As of end-September 2009, all banks had CARs well above the regulatory
minimum of 8 percent, and liquidity was comfortable.

NPLs to Total Loans
The banking system’s risk-weighted CAR rose from

be stable. The collapse of CLICO, the largest

insurance company, resulted in a fall of domestic
life insurance policies of about 70 percent,
which reduced the nonbank sector by about 8 percent. The New Building Society, the main
nonbank financial institution—with some 80 percent of nonbank deposits—has remained as
an important mortgage lender, although with slowing credit growth to the private sector and
relatively large exposures to key borrowers.

The authorities informed staff that, so far, the CLICO crisis has not had a significant impact on banks.

16

In nonbanks, NPLs remain high, at slightly below 25 percent in September 2009.

APPENDIX I. SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Fund Relations
The 2008 Article IV consultation with Guyana concluded on February 27, 2009 (SM/09/41). On
December 18, 2003, the Executive Board determined that Guyana had reached the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. MDRI was granted in January 2006. A FSAP was
carried out in November 2005 and the FSSA was discussed in August 2006 (SM/06/292). FAD,
STA, LEG, and CARTAC have provided technical assistance since 2005. On December 31,
2009, Guyana’s outstanding purchases and loans amounted to SDR 37.06 million.
Exchange Arrangements
Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII—Section 2, 3, and 4—and maintains
an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
international transactions, with the only exception of certain exchange restrictions for the
preservation of national and international security. Guyana’s de jure exchange rate regime
is a managed float. The Fund classifies Guyana’s de facto exchange rate regime as a
stabilized arrangement.
Statistical Issues
Data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although timeliness,
reliability, and coverage of the data hamper assessment of the economic situation on a continuing
basis. Most data are only available during missions and by telephone/email contacts by the
staff, except for monetary statistics, exchange rates, interest rates, and financial prudential
indicators, which are available with a lag from the website of the Bank of Guyana (BOG).
Considerable work has been completed to strengthen the national accounts, as the GDP has
been rebased with 2006 prices, reflecting more than a sixty percent increase compared to the
old GDP, based on 1988 prices; the authorities are also compiling a rebased CPI basket to be
released through 2010. The authorities are considering subscribing to the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS).
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of December 31, 2009, IDA’s portfolio consisted of two projects totaling US$21.3 million;
HIV/AIDS (US$10 million) and Water Sector Consolidation (US$11.3 million), in addition to a
Trust Fund portfolio of US$18.9 million. A new CAS (2009–2012), discussed by the Board of
Executive directors on May 26, 2008, included two new lending projects: (i) the Forestry,
Climate Change, and Community Project (US$3 million); and (ii) the Education Quality Project
(US$3 million). It also included three analytical activities: On-demand economic monitoring and
just-in-time analysis; Agriculture Risk Insurance, and Safety Nets.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
As of December 31, 2009, Guyana’s outstanding debt to the IDB was US$259.4 million
(excluding undisbursed HIPC debt relief, but after MDRI) while the undisbursed portfolio totals
US$195.1 million. The IDB cancelled US$356.5 million (principal) of Guyana’s outstanding
debt effective January 2007. A further US$35 million was cancelled from some loans in
execution, which were undisbursed. A new formula for the allocation of resources to FSOeligible countries was adopted as part of the MDRI program. Lending to Guyana has continued to
be concessional (but with a lower grant element than before), consisting of a 50–50 blend of
resources from the IDB’s Fund for Special Operations and Ordinary Capital.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GUYANA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Gilbert Terrier and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Sudarshan Gooptu and Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)
March 1, 2010

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Guyana’s risk of debt distress remains
moderate. In addition, the recent rebasing of GDP statistics has improved Guyana’s debt-toGDP ratios significantly. The risk of debt distress hinges from an eventual departure from
the agreed fiscal consolidation path—particularly if foreign external financing were to be
higher or at less concessional terms than currently envisaged. In addition, further delays in
completing the modernization of the public sugar company—which remains important to the
baseline growth projection—, a weaker or slower global recovery, and higher-than-projected
world oil prices could also add to sustainability concerns. The authorities’ continued
commitment to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to entrench long-term growth
would help reduce these risks over time.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Debt relief from the international community helped reduce Guyana’s external
debt burden significantly in recent years. In 2006–07, the Fund, the World Bank, and the
IDB provided debt relief amounting to US$611 million under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). In November 2006, Japan finalized its bilateral debt cancellation
agreement and wrote off its claims as part of the 2004 Paris Club.1 In July 2007, China
granted a write-off of US$15 million of outstanding debt. In 2008, Venezuela cancelled a
US$12.5 million debt stock, while Russia cancelled about US$0.25 million of outstanding
debt. Ongoing negotiations with Kuwait and Libya on debt relief worth US$61.9 and
US$38.8 million, respectively, have not yet been concluded.

1

HIPC debt relief was granted by all multilaterals but one, Paris Club bilateral creditors, and four non-Paris
Club creditors (China, India, Venezuela, and Cuba). Debt owed to Brazil and North Korea was paid off without
relief. The other creditors have yet to provide HIPC debt relief.

2
2.
Total gross public debt has increased
slightly since 2007, driven by foreign
borrowing. Total gross public debt stood at
60 percent of GDP in 2007—rising to around
61½ percent of GDP in 2008–09. This was
driven largely by an increase in gross external
debt (from official and bilateral sources), which,
after having declined from 71¾ percent of GDP
at end-2006 to 41½ percent of GDP at end-2007
on account of HIPC debt relief, rose to about
46 percent of GDP by 2009. The central
government’s short-term domestic debt, defined
on a gross basis, has fallen sharply, from
21¼ percent of GDP in 2006 to 15¼ percent in
2009, helping contain total public debt.

II. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCING FRAMEWORK
A. Background
3.
Guyana has sustained a solid macroeconomic performance in recent years,
supported by prudent policies. Newly released GDP series (based on 2006 prices) suggest
that Guyana’s economic growth exceeded 4 percent a year on average during 2007–09—
compared with 3½ percent in the previous GDP series (based on 1988 prices), while nominal
GDP at market value is some 65 percent higher than before. This reflects improved pricing
estimates, as well as the incorporation of new sectors of economic activity, and of the
previously large informal activity that moved into the formal sector since Guyana changed
course in the late 1980s (Box 1). Inflation has declined steadily since the imported price
shock of 2008, to around 3½ percent at end-2009, supported by a cautious monetary policy
stance and the softening in world commodity prices. In addition, the non-financial public
sector (NFPS) deficit declined steadily from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to 3.3 percent of
GDP in 2009. This benefited from a strong fiscal consolidation effort in the last year, when
the deficit was ¾ percent narrower than the budget target, largely on account of stronger-than
envisaged tax revenues.

External sustainability indicators have strengthened, including through reserve
accumulation. In 2009, the current account narrowed significantly—by some 5 percent of
GDP—to 8½ percent of GDP, largely on account

B. Baseline Scenario: Projections and Assumptions
5.
The baseline macroeconomic framework underpinning the DSA projects that
the economy will continue to perform well (Table 1). In particular, it reflects the recent
information on macroeconomic performance observed as of end-2009, as well as the changes
implied by the GDP rebasing exercise, and the updated assumptions on the prospects for the
global economy.

Real GDP growth is projected to remain strong:


Following output growth of 3¼ percent in 2009, real GDP is expected to rise
over the medium term at an annual average rate of 4¼ percent through 2014,
which is broadly equal to the average rate observed in 2006–09. Drivers of
growth would include key public infrastructure investment projects (including
in energy and roads), the yields from the implementation of the sugar
modernization plan (expected to deliver an annual average growth of nearly
11 percent in raw sugar production in 2010–14), and growth in other
commodity export sectors, including gold and bauxite. Real GDP growth
would stabilize at its potential level of around 3¼ percent over the long term.



The growth path is somewhat conservative, projecting a slightly lower real
GDP growth in 2010–14 than at the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation

The SDR allocation is assumed to bolster up reserve accumulation, as indicated by the authorities.

The authorities have saved, on average, nearly 70 percent of PetroCaribe disbursements in 2007–09, and plan
to save almost 94 percent in 2010. They are committed to use savings prudently, as an insurance against shocks
and to support key investment projects if funding were not available. The stock has risen steadily, in the
presence of sufficient financing for the public sector investment program, and despite the global shock of 2009.

(which envisaged real growth at 4.6 percent on average in the same period).
The revised projection takes into account the weaker-than-envisaged
performance of the sugar sector in 2009, and the still muted prospects for
global recovery. At the same time, key investments completed over the
medium term would support long-term growth of over 3¼ percent in 2010–30
in the revised baseline framework, which is slightly higher than the potential
growth of 3 percent assumed in the 2008 DSA.

Box 1. The Rebased GDP Figures
GDP data have been rebased from 1988 to 2006. As a result of
these changes, 2009 GDP at market prices is higher than
previously estimated by 64 percent. Preliminary estimates suggest
that the new GDP per capita reached US$2,630 as of end-2008, up
from US$1,504 in the old series. The rebasing project benefited
from technical assistance from the U.S. Census Bureau (under an
IDB project) and CARTAC. The establishment of the new base
year aimed at capturing changes in relative industrial costs and
price structures, the large informal sector that has gradually
formalized itself since the late 1980s, and the emergence of new
economic activities. The project has improved the national
accounts compilation system.
The change in sectoral composition reflects better
accounting of activity in key sectors. For example, the
government services sector now captures statutory bodies.
Health and education services (formerly classified under the
government sector) are now separated and expanded to
include private sector activities. The distribution sector has an
expanded coverage of commodity flows and an improved
estimation of trade margins. The mining and quarrying sector
now reflects a larger share of gold and diamond production,
and a lower share of bauxite. The new benchmark for
manufacturing reflects the use of an expanded index of
47 products; and the “other services” sector captures new
categories, including hotels and restaurants, and professional
services. The transportation and communications sector saw
important coverage enhancements—for instance, to include cell
phone activities internet and TV broadcasting. There were no
major changes in the coverage of financial services.

The importance of the sugar sector in total output declined. As
an industry, sugar's calculations are robust. However, the old
series used an arbitrary split in the value added between
agriculture and manufacturing, while the new series draw on



The external current account would widen slightly as the economy recovers in
2010, narrowing gradually over the medium term. The current account deficit is
projected to increase to 10 percent of GDP in 2010 and to subsequently decline
gradually to 6½ percent of GDP by 2014, and further to about 3½ percent by 2030.
This adjustment would be supported by higher commodity exports, and a moderate
recovery in imports. This is explained by the modest upturn in FDI (which would
limit private capital import growth), and relatively stable oil imports.4 The envisaged
fiscal consolidation plan should also help contain the growth in imports, including as
nearly all of the bilateral disbursements by PetroCaribe are projected to be saved, in
line with the authorities’ commitment to use these resources very sparsely and the
availability of alternative funding for the public investment program under the
baseline scenario.



Prudent fiscal policies would underpin debt sustainability during the projection
period. The fiscal consolidation effort in 2009 resulted in a stronger fiscal balance
than agreed at the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation. Moreover, the rebased
GDP figures revealed a significantly smaller fiscal deficit than previously
considered.5 In this light, the revised fiscal path would maintain the NFPS deficit at
around 3¼ percent of GDP in 2010–11, and gradually converge to a deficit of
2¼ percent of GDP by 2014.6 This strategy would support growth, while allowing for
a reduction in the net public debt-to-GDP ratio (excluding savings of disbursements
by PetroCaribe). Gross public debt, while increasing somewhat over the medium term
before converging to over 45 percent of GDP by 2030, would be rising more
moderately than projected at the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation, mainly on
account of the smaller NFPS deficits (as a share of GDP) in the 2009 baseline.

WEO projections assume an increase in oil prices in 2010 that moderates somewhat over the medium term.

5

The NFPS deficit of 3.3 percent of (new) GDP in 2009 is equivalent to a deficit of 5.3 percent of (old) GDP.

6

The consolidation effort would rely on the gradual moderation of the public investment program as well on
structural reform, including the modernization of the public sugar company, measures to further enhance the
revenue administration and reforms to ensure the long-term viability of the National Insurance System.

6



High and stable inflows of foreign capital are projected over the medium term. So
far Guyana has weathered the global crisis well by regional and global standards,
notwithstanding a modest decline in its external financing resources (including
remittances and FDI). The moderate decline in capital inflows observed in 2009 is
projected to be followed by a gradual and sustained recovery over the medium term.
This would be further supported by higher external disbursements available for the
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP), including from PetroCaribe. The current
account deficit is therefore expected to remain fully financed.7 In 2010–14, FDI is
projected to reach some 7 percent of GDP per year on average, while concessional
loans and grant gross disbursements together would average some 10 percent of GDP
annually. In the long run, FDI would decline to about 4½ percent of GDP.
Concessional loans and grants would also fall gradually to some 3½ percent of GDP,8
particularly as concessional financing from Venezuela under the PetroCaribe
initiative—projected to hover at 2–4 percent of GDP—is assumed to be discontinued
by end-2014.9 10

6.

Risks to the outlook are balanced over the medium and long term:



Downside risks include those related to a protracted global recovery, which could
impinge on FDI, remittances and exports and, eventually, on growth. Higher-thanenvisaged oil prices could also cause a further widening of the current account given
Guyana’s significant exposure to fuel imports—including for electricity generation.
Further delays in completing the modernization of the public sugar company would
add to these concerns, particularly given the recent elimination of the preferential
sugar prices by the EU, which will increasingly expose Guyana to the volatility of
world sugar prices. Buffers to these risks include the increasingly comfortable reserve
levels, and the funds saved in the escrow account for PetroCaribe.



Upside potential includes the successful completion of the potential key infrastructure
projects still not included in the baseline scenario, but which are envisaged for
execution sometime in 2010–14—including the hydropower plant at Amalia Falls,
which could drastically reduce Guyana’s exposure to oil prices.11 Likewise, the

7

The current account deficit would remain fully financed even if the share of PetroCaribe loans that are
expected to be saved abroad is excluded.
8

This assumption is broadly consistent with that used in the DSAs completed during the 2007 and 2008 Article
IV Consultations.
9

Projections for PetroCaribe disbursements provided by the authorities are based on the end-2009 WEO oil
price baseline.

10

Given the relatively high grant element of PetroCaribe disbursements, the assumption that these will be
discontinued in 2014 reduces the average grant element for all lending in that same year. This assumption is
consistent with that applied in the DSAs completed as part of the Article IV Consultations in 2007 and 2008.

11

The hydropower plant and other large infrastructure projects are still being assessed for financial and
economic viability, with IDB. They are expected to be completed as public-private partnerships, and only the
firm and contingent liabilities arising from them will eventually be reflected in the public debt statistics.

7
positive prospects for eventual oil extraction and export (currently expected for 2014)
could further support a boost to growth. Finally, Guyana could also benefit
significantly from the further development of the global carbon credit markets, on
account of the country’s rainforest, in the context of the Low Carbon Development
Strategy (LCDS).
III. ASSESSMENT OF THE BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS DEBT12
A. Results of the External Debt Sustainability Analysis
7.
The analysis of Guyana’s gross external debt sustainability suggests that the
country faces a moderate risk of debt distress. This assessment, which is unchanged from
the 2008 Article IV Consultation, is supported by a gradual decline in gross external
borrowing that is projected over the long-term, in line with the envisaged path for fiscal
tightening. Debt sustainability concerns could emerge if there were a significant deviation
from the fiscal adjustment path outlined in the baseline macroeconomic policy framework, or
in the presence of strong exogenous shocks.
8.
The assessment of the baseline scenario suggest sustainability for all indicators,
with one minor exception. Under the baseline scenario, all sustainability indicators remain
well below their respective thresholds, with the exception of a temporary and minor breach
by the PV of the gross external debt-to-GDP ratio (Figure 1). This breach is driven by the
relatively high upfront gross borrowing projected in the PSIP (including from PetroCaribe).
Nonetheless, this indicator is also affected by the reduction in the discount rate used in the
DSA exercise, which is one percentage point lower than last year.13 External debt burden
indicators are projected to improve significantly over the long term. For instance, the PV of
external debt-to-revenue ratio and external debt-to-exports ratios remain well below the debt
burden thresholds (Table 2, Figure 1).14 Moreover, debt-service ratios are projected to remain
low (at about 4 percent of exports and 10 percent of revenue in the long term), indicating that
the government would have the ability to meet its debt service payments comfortably.
9.
The inclusion of remittances into the analysis support the aforementioned
assessment of a moderate risk of debt distress. In particular, the inclusion of remittances
still implies that the trajectories for all sustainability indicators in the baseline scenario
remain well within their respective thresholds, with, again, the very minor exception of the
PV of debt to GDP-and-remittances ratio (Figure 2). As before, the debt-service ratios (to
12

Gross debt includes the total value of disbursements by Venezuela’s PetroCaribe as debt, although the
authorities have saved most of these disbursements in an escrow account. Debt net of such savings is
significantly lower, and nuances further most of this assessment of risks, as presented in the alternative
scenarios in this document.

13

Using the same discount rate as in the 2008 Article IV Consultation in the 2009 DSA, the breach disappears
completely—with the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio peaking at 37½ percent of GDP in 2014.

14

Based on the World Bank classification, the external debt burden thresholds relevant for Guyana are (i) PV of
debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (ii) PV of debt-to-revenue of 250 percent; (iii) PV of debt-to-GDP of
40 percent; and (iv) debt service-to-exports and revenue ratios of 20 and 30 percent, respectively.

8
exports and revenues) also continue to indicate a comfortable capacity to repay the debt
incurred.
10.
The sensitivity analysis shows that Guyana’s resilience to shocks is broadly
unchanged relative to the 2008 DSA, also confirming the assessment of a moderate risk
of debt distress (Table 3, Figure 1):


PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio. The use of the rebased GDP series does not
prevent the PV in all stress tests for the debt-to-GDP indicator from breaching the
threshold of 40 percent—with the highest long-term risks associated to a shock on a
combined shock of real GDP, export value growth, US dollar GDP deflator and net
non-debt generating flows at a standard deviation of their historical average (B4), and
to a 30 percent nominal depreciation of the currency (B6).



PV of the external debt-to-revenue. This indicator breaches its threshold only under
two of eight tests (as in the 2008 DSA).15 First, under the A1 scenario, which uses key
variables (real GDP growth, non-interest current account, growth of GDP deflator,
non-debt creating flows) at their historical averages in 2010–30, the PV of external
debt-to-revenue ratio breaches the threshold in 2023 and remains above it until the
end of the projection period. Second, under the B5 test, which assumes that net nondebt creating flows, real GDP, exports and the GDP deflator in US dollars grow at
their respective historical averages minus one standard deviation in 2009/10. In this
extreme case, the PV of the external debt-to-revenue ratio would increase to
284 percent in 2012 and decline below the threshold starting in 2022. 16



PV of external debt-to exports. A minor temporary breach of the threshold takes
place under the extreme combination of shocks (B5) in 2012, when the PV of external
debt peaks at 153 percent of exports, above the threshold of 150 percent of exports.
B. Results of the Public Debt Sustainability Analysis

11.
Driven largely the external debt dynamics, the sustainability assessment of
Guyana’s total gross public debt also confirms the presence of a moderate risk of debt
distress. Most critically, Guyana’s public debt is considered manageable as long as the
authorities adhere to their fiscal consolidation strategy and continue to ensure that financing
is at sufficiently high concessional terms. In light of the sufficient availability of external
financing, the macroeconomic scenario assumes no recourse to domestic financing of the
fiscal deficit in the medium term and allows for a gradual redemption of domestic securities.
15

Importantly, the breach to these stress tests would be reduced significantly if the (higher) discount rates
relevant at the time of the 2008 Article IV had been used instead. In particular, only the B5 test for the externaldebt-revenue ratio would have been exceeded marginally, and for a short period of four years, while there
would have been no breach by the external-debt to export ration under the B5 test, nor any breach under the A1
Test for any indicator.

16

If net non-debt creating flows were to grow at the historical average minus one standard deviation in 2009-10
(B4), the PV of external debt-to-revenue ratio would reach exactly the threshold in 2016 but not exceed it.

9
As external financing falls beyond 2012, domestic financing needs would remain broadly
constant until 2020, and decline beyond that point. Thus, the PV of total public debt-torevenue ratio would rise over the medium term from 168 percent in 2010 to about
184 percent in 2014, reflecting large external disbursements, and gradually decline thereafter
to 157 percent by 2030. Given the authorities’ assurances of their commitment to implement
the agreed fiscal framework, the projected primary fiscal balances are consistent with debt
sustainability (Table 4, Figure 4). 17
12.
Under alternative scenarios and stress tests, total public debt vulnerabilities
highlight the importance of adhering to sound policies (Table 5):18 19


PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio in the test with
GDP growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2011–12 (B1)
almost reaches 100 percent by 2030.



PV of public debt-to-revenue. If GDP growth were at its historical average minus one
standard deviation in 2011–12, adversely affecting the revenue collection, the PV of
public debt would reach 390 percent of revenue by 2030 (B1). Likewise, if real GDP
growth and primary balances were at historical averages (A1), if there were
permanently lower GDP growth (A3), or if GDP and the primary balance were both
at their historical average using one half standard deviation shocks in 2011–12 (B3),
the PV of public debt to revenue would also exceed the threshold of 300 percent.



The results of the sensitivity analysis underscore the importance of pursuing sound
macroeconomic policies to achieve high GDP growth and maintain low fiscal deficits.
In particular, severe shocks to these variables would push public debt—and the debt
service obligations—up relative to fiscal revenue, potentially posing debt repayment
risks.
IV. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
A. External Debt Net of PetroCaribe Savings

13.
External debt sustainability risks are further nuanced by the projected saving of
a large share of the disbursements under the PetroCaribe initiative. As in recent years,
the upfront borrowing from PetroCaribe is projected to be saved in an escrow account, in line
with the authorities’ commitment to use these resources sparsely. With the public investment
program well financed over the medium-term, PetroCaribe savings are expected to continue
17

The real domestic interest rate is expected to be positive throughout the projection period, supported by
prudent monetary policies and low inflation.

18

The assumptions for marginal lending in the case of shocks under the public DSA is unchanged with respect
to the 2008 DSA, with 70 percent external and 30 percent domestic borrowing and concessionality slightly
below the baseline.

19

While the magnitude of the breach of these tests would be somewhat more muted if the discount rate of the
2008 DSA had been used instead, the same concerns outlined here would remain.

10
accumulating until 2014, after which they would be gradually unwound, helping maintain net
debt indicators on a downward path (Figures 1 and 3, Table 6).20
14.
While debt indicators improve substantially when only the spent part of
PetroCaribe financing is considered, the baseline scenario conclusions remain valid.
Given the magnitude of the estimated savings accumulated from PetroCaribe financing
through 2014, the net debt indicators are significantly lower than in the gross-basis baseline
scenario (Table 6 and Figure 3). The PV of the external debt-to-revenue ratio would reach
126 percent in 2014 (some 34 percentage points lower than in the baseline scenario), and
would converge to values similar to those obtained in the baseline scenario in the long-term,
as the savings are used up. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP would rise by
about three percentage points in both 2010 and 2011 in the gross DSA (Table 2), compared
to an increase of 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, in the net-debt DSA (Table 6).
B. A “High Investment, Low Growth” Scenario
15.
The emergence of a “high investment, low growth” scenario in Guyana does not
appear to be a high probability event when contrasted with the baseline scenario
underlying this DSA. Guyana's economic structure and sources of growth have strengthened
significantly in the last decade, particularly because of the gradual decline in importance of
traditional commodity export sectors (which tend to be more vulnerable to external shocks)
than the non-tradable and service sectors that have picked up over time. In particular, the
early part of the last decade witnessed a weak economic growth, which averaged only
0.6 percent in 2000–04. In contrast, average growth in 2005–09 rose to 3.1 percent, even
when accounting for the devastating flood of 2005 (which generated a contraction of
2 percent). Indeed, the average growth rate is much higher for 2006–09 (at 4.4 percent). This
suggests that the average projection of 3.5 percent in 2010–30 is not overly-optimistic, and
could be reasonably supported by the planned public investment program and projected
global conditions.
16.
Stress tests suggest, however, that there would be risks attached to unproductive
public investment, underscoring the need to implement high-quality projects. This is
illustrated by the test A1 for gross external debt, which assumes that key macroeconomic
variables (including growth) remain at their 10-year historical averages in 2010–30, despite
the continued presence of disbursements underlying the authorities’ public investment
program. In this case, gross external debt would rise rapidly over the medium term, with the
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the 40 percent of GDP threshold as soon as in 2012,
reaching nearly 70 percent of GDP by 2030. While the PV of the debt-to exports ratio would
remain within the sustainable range, the PV of debt-to revenue ratio would also exceed its
threshold of 250 percent by the end of the projection period. All debt service ratios, however,
would be well within their thresholds, helping nuance any potential concerns on the country’s
ability to repay.

20

The expected increase to the discount rate over the medium term should also provide a more nuanced view.

11
C. The Impact of Reduced Concessional Financing for Guyana
17.
The importance of continued access to concessional resources is illustrated
through a scenario that assumes a temporary greater reliance on commercial financing.
In particular, the exercise assumes that an average of about 32 percent of total disbursements
(currently concessional, at terms comparable to those offered by the IDB) would gradually be
converted into commercial terms in the period 2010–14.21 The assumptions on the degree of
concessionality for the remaining period (2014–30) remain as in the baseline scenario.
18.
External debt indicators would significantly worsen if future disbursements for
Guyana were in less concessional terms (Figure 5). The relevant tests suggest that the
breach of the threshold of the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would be longer and more
pronounced that under the concessional terms currently granted to Guyana (Figure 1). In
addition, the path of debt would be significantly more vulnerable to external shocks, with the
PV of external debt to exports exceeding the threshold under the most extreme shock (when
it did not in the scenario with full concessionality), and a more pronounced and prolonged
breach of the threshold for the PV of external debt to revenue.
V. CONCLUSION
19.
Guyana remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. Most of the relevant external
debt indicators are well below their thresholds in the baseline scenario, with the PV of debtto-GDP ratio showing only a minor and temporary breach which does not alter the
assessment of moderate risk. Sustainability indicators for public sector debt show broadly the
same level of vulnerability than those for external debt, given its large share on the total—
including that related to currency risk. The presence of some risk of debt distress underscores
the importance of further entrenching fiscal consolidation, and maintaining a prudent
macroeconomic framework that is supportive to growth and external stability. Going
forward, broadening the sources of growth, and maintaining prudent fiscal and debt
strategies—including through focusing on concessional lending—would be critical to
preserve and further strengthen the gains to sustainability achieved to date.

21

The package of loans shocked in this exercise represents nearly 40 percent of total annual disbursements in
2010-12, 30 percent of total disbursements in 2013, and 13¼ percent of total disbursements in 2014. For
instance, 100 percent of the package of loans subject to the stress test would be disbursed under concessional
terms in 2010. The share of concessional lending would reduce to 75 percent in 2011, to 50 percent in 2012, and
to 25 in 2013, becoming fully commercial in 2014. For the period 2014 onwards, the previous assumptions on
the concessionality terms have not been affected relative to the baseline.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes PetroCaribe savings, exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Previous Decisions and Article IV Consultation Cycle
a. On December 18, 2003, the Executive Board determined that Guyana had reached
the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (EBS/03/158).
b. On February 27, 2009, the Executive Board concluded the 2008 Article IV
consultation (SM/09/41). Guyana is on a 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations.

X.

Safeguards Assessments
An updated safeguards assessment of the Bank of Guyana (BoG), related to the then
expected PRGF arrangement, was completed in May 2007. The assessment found that the
BoG has taken steps to improve its safeguards since the previous assessment in 2003. In
particular, compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the
annual financial statements have improved, although certain disclosures still do not meet
requirements, and a new internal audit charter and associated practices have been
adopted. The assessment recommended involvement of an audit firm with experience in
International Standards on Auditing and IFRS in future BoG external audits to address
professional capacity constraints in Guyana, and reconstitution of the Board of Directors
to address governance shortcomings. The latter action was completed in May 2007.

XI.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII––Section 2, 3, and 4—and maintains
an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers

2

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4
for international transactions, with the only exception of certain exchange restrictions for
the preservation of national and international security. Guyana’s de jure exchange rate
regime is a managed float. Guyana’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a
stabilized arrangement. The BoG conducts transactions on the basis of the weighted
average quotations of the three largest dealers in the exchange market. The currency of
Guyana is the Guyana dollar. The exchange rate was G$203.3 per U.S. dollar on
December 31, 2009.

ROSC, FSAP and EPA Participation
a. A fiscal ROSC was undertaken in July 2002.
b. A WB/IMF FSAP took place in November 2005 and concluded in September 2006
(SM/06/292).
c. Ex-Post Assessment findings were discussed with the authorities in June 2006 and
concluded on October 23, 2006 (SM/06/338).

APPENDIX II. GUYANA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 31, 2009)
The Guyana portfolio of IDA-financed projects is comprised of two projects totaling
US$21.3 million; HIV/AIDS (US$10 million) and Water Sector Consolidation (US$11.3
million). In addition, a Trust Fund portfolio totaling US$18.9 million, includes: (i) the
Education for All/Fast Track Initiative (EFA–FTI) program supported by the FTI Catalytic
Fund (US$12.2 million); (ii) the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant for the
Conservancy Adaptation Project (US$3.8 million): (iii) the Bagasse Cogeneration project
(US$2.6 million) funded by the Community Development Carbon Fund managed by the
World Bank, and a (iv) Trust Fund for National Statistics Strategy and Statistical
Development TA project (US$285,000).
Ongoing analytical work includes a regional energy study (Alternative Energy Supply),
which is in line with the Government’s objective of diversifying power supply sources, and
limiting Guyana’s exposure to hydrocarbon price fluctuations. Additionally, in 2009, an
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment was completed and delivered to the Government.
A new CAS (2009-2012), discussed by the Board of Executive directors on May 26, 2008,
included two new lending projects: (i) the Forestry, Climate Change, and Community Project
(US$3 million); and (ii) the Education Quality Project (US$3 million). It also includes three
analytical activities: On-demand economic monitoring and just-in-time analysis; Agriculture
Risk Insurance, and Safety Nets.
World Bank Support to the Climate Change Agenda
Adaptation
The Bank supports the adaptation to climate change through two projects: first, the GEF
financed “Mainstreaming Adaptability to Climate Change” (US$5million) for CARICOM
member states that has served as a platform to promote mainstreaming of climate change
considerations and strengthen climate modeling capacity; second, the Conservancy
Adaptation Project (US$3.5million), which began operating in January 2008, to help reduce
the vulnerability to catastrophic flooding from a rise in sea level.
Mitigation
The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) is an important attempt to reduce
emissions through the conservation of existing carbon sinks in return for large-scale financial
transfers.4 Guyana was one of the first countries to join the FCPF in July 2008, and the very
first country to submit a full-fledged Readiness Plan to the FCPF in February 2009.

4

The Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) does not include Forest Conservation and Avoiding Deforestation.

7
A grant is being processed for the Readiness Plan, and another grant will be available for its
implementation. Guyana is an important pilot for the FCPF, which will help put in place the
structures and accountability mechanisms.
More generally, the Country Assistance Strategy identifies four areas of support to Guyana’s
forests:
i)

The FCPF;

ii)

An IDA forest project complementing the FCPF grant and piloting innovative
community management approaches;

iii)

A JSDF grant to support community-based enterprises in the hinterland; and

iv)

A possible GEF grant.

The Bank also supports Guyana’s climate mitigation efforts through the Skeldon Bagasse
Cogeneration Project: This project is not operational at this time because the Emission
Reductions (ER) have not yet begun. ER will start when a power-purchasing agreement is
signed with the Guyana Power and Light for export of bagasse-generated power to the grid.

APPENDIX III. GUYANA: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2009)
The IDB is Guyana’s major source of multilateral concessional financing with projects
spanning most sectors. Since 1977, the Bank has approved loans amounting to
US$1,187.4 million. Outstanding debt stands at US$259.4 million (excluding undisbursed
HIPC debt relief, but after MDRI) while the undisbursed portfolio totals US$195.1 million.
The IDB cancelled US$356.5 million (principal) of Guyana’s outstanding debt effective
January 2007. A further US$35 million was cancelled from some loans in execution, which
were undisbursed. A new formula for the allocation of resources to FSO-eligible countries
was adopted as part of the MDRI program. Lending to Guyana has continued to be
concessional (but with a lower grant element than before), consisting of a 50–50 blend of
resources from the IDB’s Fund for Special Operations and Ordinary Capital. New allocations
will be determined based on the outcomes of recapitalization discussion at the next IDB
Board of Governors Meeting in 2010.
The Board of Directors approved the IDB Country Strategy with Guyana 2008–2012 in
January 2009. According to the new Strategy, the IDB and the GoG will make strategic
interventions, while maximizing future financial allocations that increase the productivity of
human inputs for all, promote entrepreneurship, strengthen the private sector, buffer the
negative impacts of the economic transformation on the marginalized sectors of society, and
create opportunities for key infrastructure improvements in partnership with the national and
international private sector. The baseline scenario in the strategy envisages total lending of
US$113 million according to the following pillars: (i) strategic infrastructure investment,
(ii) enhanced competitiveness, and (iii) social development for growth.
The large existing IDB portfolio, aligned with the above pillars and future allocations, is a
principal foundation of this new strategy. Consequently, future initiatives will augment the
positive, IDB-financed work already underway in Guyana. Beginning in 2009, the IDB has
moved actively toward the use of country systems while ensuring a timely and efficient
delivery of the important stock of projects in execution. The first set of steps focuses on
improving financial management and institutional capacity of line ministries to execute
projects directly. Country capacity will dictate the pace of this transition in addition to the
measures needed to improve the execution and disbursement of the portfolio and the
achievement of the development objectives, both at the strategic and project level.
In 2009, the IDB approved three projects totaling US$34.8 million projects: Transport Sector
Improvement & Rehabilitation Program (US$24.8 million), the second phase of the Financial
Sector Reform (US$5 million), and the Expansion of the Basic Nutrition Program
(US$5 million). The 2010 pipeline consists of four operations: The Financial Sector Reform
Program III (US$5 million), Transport Umbrella Program II (US$20 million), Water and
Sanitation Program (US$9.5 million), and Supplementary Financing for the Georgetown
Solid Waste Program (US$2 million).

APPENDIX IV. GUYANA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 9, 2010)
Data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although timeliness,
reliability, and coverage of the data hamper assessment of the economic situation on a
continuing basis. Most data are only available during missions and by telephone/email
contacts by the staff, except for monetary statistics, exchange rates, interest rates, and
financial prudential indicators, which are available with a lag from the website of the Bank of
Guyana (BOG). Despite receiving substantial technical assistance, including from the Fund,
to strengthen statistics, weaknesses in compiling and dissemination of data remain. Guyana is
considering subscribing to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Real sector
Considerable work has been completed to strengthen the national accounts. Building on
significant structural changes in the economy since the launch of market-oriented reforms,
GDP has been rebased with 2006 prices, reflecting more than sixty percent increase
compared to the old GDP, based on 1988 prices. Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center (CARTAC) missions visited Georgetown in 2003, 2006, and 2007 and have since
provided technical assistance on national accounts, which helped facilitate this exercise for
the production side. Further work could entail reassessing the rebased GDP on the
expenditure side. To this end, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) could complete its register of
enterprises and secure higher response rates for business surveys
Since January 1994, the BOS has been producing a consumer price index, based on weights
derived from a household income and expenditure survey (HIES) for the year comprising the
second quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1993. The CPI index reflects movements
in prices in the Georgetown area. A new HIES was recently completed and new CPI series,
reflecting more items in the basket and revised weights, will be published starting 2010.
Fiscal sector
A government finance statistics (GFS) mission, which visited Georgetown in May 2005,
assisted the authorities in determining the sources of the discrepancy between the fiscal data
and monetary and financial data. The mission recommended improvements in the
compilation of GFS (such as expanding the coverage of central government operations to
include important statutory bodies with their own revenue and accounts) and improving data
on the details of domestic financing. The authorities have made progress in implementing
these recommendations, including the compilation of quarterly data for the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS), and five nonfinancial public enterprises. Progress on the mediumterm objective of adopting the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 2001) is proceeding very slowly.
Monetary and financial sectors
Monetary and financial statistics missions visited Georgetown in 2002, 2003, and 2005. The
BOG has made significant progress in improving the quality of monetary statistics, especially

11
as regards the institutional coverage. The monetary statistics currently include the BOG,
other depositary corporations (commercial banks, the New Building Society, and trust
companies), and other financial corporations (finance companies, life insurance companies,
non-life insurance companies, pension funds, and asset management companies). The BOG’s
monetary statistics provide data for publication in the IFS Supplement, based on standardized
report forms. The BOG publishes financial prudential indicators in its quarterly report and on
its website on a regular basis.
External sector
In 2003, a mission from CARTAC noted several weaknesses in the compilation of balance of
payments statistics, including that external debt arrears were not recorded in line with the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, and important financial account
transactions were not identified. It recommended that the BOG continue the development of
the new reporting form for direct investment, revise the methodology for recording arrears,
and seek new data sources for improving the coverage of services. At present, estimates for
other services are derived from surveys and an annual survey of major enterprises is used to
collect data on inward direct investment. Despite some improvements, deficiencies with
customs trade data have not been fully resolved, and the BOS maintains its own in-house
capacity for processing customs data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Guyana
On March 17, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Guyana.1
Background
Guyana has weathered the impact of the global crisis well by regional and global standards.
Newly released GDP series (re-based to 2006 prices) suggest that economic activity
expanded by 3.3 percent in 2009, compared to 2 percent in 2008, largely on the back of a
recovery in agriculture in the second half of the year along with continued strong gold
production and robust activity in the non-tradable sector. This mitigated the adverse impact of
global and weather shocks on output in early 2009. End-year inflation fell to 3.6 percent from
6.4 percent as of end-2008, reflecting the softening in world commodity prices.
In 2009, the external current account deficit narrowed, and the international reserve position
strengthened significantly. The current account deficit declined by 5 percent of GDP (to
8.5 percent of GDP), largely led by a reduction in imports, particularly of fuel. This, together
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
with strong official inflows (including concessional loans and grants, and the Fund’s Special
Drawing Rights allocation) and steady short-term capital inflows by commercial banks—
attracted to higher domestic interest rates—helped offset a decline in Foreign Direct
Investment and raised Guyana’s gross international reserves to US$623 million by end-year
(over 5 months of imports). The nominal exchange rate remained stable, and the real effective
exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in equilibrium. The impact of the crisis on the financial
sector has been limited so far, although expansion in private sector credit has moderated to
about 6 percent in 2009 (down from nearly 22 percent in 2008), reflecting both a deceleration
in private sector credit demand, as well as tighter lending standards by the banking sector.
Macroeconomic policies have remained prudent. Monetary policy tightened somewhat in 2009,
supporting the decline in inflation and external stability. The fiscal deficit for the non-financial
public sector declined to 3.3 percent of GDP (equivalent to 5.3 percent of old GDP) from 4.7
percent of GDP in 2008, on the back of higher-than expected revenues that supported the full
execution of priority spending, including on infrastructure. Guyana’s public debt has fallen from
93.1 percent of GDP as of end-2006 to 56.8 percent of GDP in 2009, assisted by debt relief
operations and fiscal consolidation efforts.
Structural reform has continued to focus on further reducing vulnerabilities and entrenching
long term growth. On the financial sector, the authorities have consolidated insurance and
bank supervision at the central bank, incorporated risk-based supervision, issued new
guidelines on risk management and enacted the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism legislation and the Money Transfer Agencies Act. In the fiscal area, a
modern chart of accounts for capital expenditure has been introduced into the integrated
financial management system, enhancing the accounting and transparency of public
investment. Efforts to further strengthen the Guyana Revenue Authority also continued,
including consolidating the new functional organization, completing the rolling out of the
integrated tax information system, and improvements in the filing, refund, arrears collection
and audit functions. Reforms to support growth centered on modernizing the sugar sector, and
on implementing the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS), which could help Guyana
benefit from external resources in exchange for the preservation of its rainforests in the world’s
carbon credit markets—including through a model agreement signed with Norway, whose
resources will allow, among others, the development of non-traditional economic sectors and
the conversion of Guyana’s energy sector.
Guyana’s outlook remains positive in the near and medium term, although some important
challenges remain. Growth is expected to benefit from the global recovery, the modernization
of the sugar sector and the start up of investment projects, which could spur average growth to
4-5 percent in the medium term. The current account would widen somewhat in 2010 with the
uptick in domestic demand and the increase in fuel prices, but would narrow gradually over
time. Nonetheless, challenges remain, particularly if the upturn in world economic activity were
slower than envisaged; or if oil prices were to rise more sharply than projected. Slower
progress than expected with the modernization of the sugar sector could also complicate this
outlook, particularly in light of the recent phasing out of the preferential sugar prices by the EU,
which will increasingly expose Guyana to world-price volatility. Upside potential is related to

3
the full implementation of the LCDS, the eventual exploitation of Guyana’s oil reserves and the
sound completion of key large public-private investment projects over the next few years.
.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Guyana has weathered the global crisis well, sustaining a solid
macroeconomic performance supported by prudent policies. Directors commended the
authorities’ commitment to further entrench macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability,
while promoting long-term growth and development to improve the country’s standard of living
and reduce poverty.
Directors observed that the strong fiscal consolidation in 2009 provides space for a more
gradual tightening over the near term to support infrastructure investment and growth. A
cautious fiscal stance remains nevertheless warranted given remaining vulnerabilities.
Directors therefore supported the authorities’ commitment to maintain prudent expenditure
policies and to continue implementing structural reforms aimed at safeguarding fiscal
sustainability.
Directors commended the authorities’ intention to continue seeking highly concessional terms
when contracting debt and to minimize fiscal risks from public investment and public-privatepartnerships (PPPs), paying close attention to international best practices. They welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to continue to enhance the quality of the assessment and fiscal accounting
of public investment. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to reflect any firm or
contingent liabilities related to PPPs in the public debt statistics.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to achieve sustainable long-term growth, including
under the Low Carbon Development Strategy. Continued modernization of the sugar sector
and diversification of Guyana’s productive base are key to sustaining growth. In this context,
Directors stressed the importance for the public sugar company to implement its recovery
measures and ensure that the new plant at Skeldon becomes fully operational in the near
term.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent monetary policy aimed at maintaining low
inflation. They noted that the exchange rate appears broadly aligned with fundamentals, and
that the current exchange rate policy has served the country well. Looking forward, some
Directors supported a gradual approach toward greater exchange rate flexibility, while others
considered that a more detailed assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of greater
exchange rate flexibility in Guyana is needed.
Directors noted that the financial system has not been directly affected by the global crisis.
They welcomed ongoing efforts to further strengthen supervision and enhance the banking
system’s resilience. Directors encouraged the authorities to require banks to increase
provisioning, monitor asset quality, and further tighten the legislation on the exposure to large
borrowers and related-party lending. They commended the recent amendment to bring

4
insurance supervision under the purview of the central bank, and recommended gradually
bringing all non-bank financial institutions under a similar regulatory perimeter.
Directors commended the continued upgrading of Guyana’s statistical capacity. They
welcomed the completion of the national accounts rebasing exercise, which resulted in a
significant upward revision of GDP data. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to
review the requirements of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Directors supported the forthcoming publication of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper to
underpin the authorities’ long-standing commitment to poverty reduction and reaching the
Millennium Development Goals.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana will be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Guyana
and Ms. Des Vignes, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 17, 2010

1. On behalf of the Guyanese authorities, we thank Ms. Gonzalez and her team for the
high quality dialogue during the Article IV Consultation Mission and for their candid
and well-written report. The authorities also thank CARTAC for the technical
assistance provided to improve the quality of the national statistics and, particularly,
in the recent rebasing of the national accounts and the consumer price index. The
support received from CARTAC in this exercise, underlined by the Center’s resultsoriented focus to technical assistance delivery, reflects its excellent track record in
responding to the needs of the region. With the rebasing completed, Guyana’s
economic performance is now more accurately measured; real GDP is on a higher
growth path and the country’s economic size was in fact considerably larger than
previously calculated. Consequently, the public debt, the fiscal deficit and the
external current account relative to GDP are now much lower. The achievements of
Guyana in 2009 were remarkable, although challenges remain. There is urgent need
to improve the physical and social infrastructure, further reduce poverty and entrench
good economic performance while ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability in the
medium term.
Recent Economic Developments
2. Against the backdrop of the global financial and economic crisis, the Guyanese
economy performed well in 2009. Staff in their Selected Issues Paper have accurately
described the severe impact of the crisis on Guyana. In spite of this, the country’s
economic performance stands out in the region with real GDP growth estimated at 3.3
percent in 2009, though this was somewhat below the 2006-2008 average of 4.7 per
cent. Inflation has decelerated to an average of 2.9 percent mainly on account of the
reduction of international commodity prices. With the downward trend in inflation
the authorities took the opportunity to consolidate the fiscal position by withdrawing
measures implemented in 2008 to dampen the impact of inflationary pressures on the
population. The current account deficit contracted as the value of imports declined
more rapidly than that of exports. The improved current account, together with
higher net capital inflows and the SDR allocation, helped pushed reserves to record
levels. The financial sector also fared well in the midst of the turmoil in international
financial markets and the exchange rate was relatively stable.

2
3. Economic growth in 2009 was driven by increased economic activity in the sugar
and non-sugar sectors which expanded by 3.3 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
A number of facilitative government initiatives in the agricultural sector
contributed to boosting the production of rice and other crops and livestock. Gold
production soared, reaching its highest production level to date, but this was more
than offset by the decline in bauxite and diamond production. Further,
distribution and financial services realized significant growth while tourism
reached a record high as visitor arrivals peaked in 2009, even when other
destinations in the region were experiencing notable declines. In fact, the rate of
growth in visitor arrivals in Guyana was the highest in the Caribbean.
4. Despite the decline in export earnings and remittances, the balance of payments
returned a substantial surplus in 2009. The value of exports decreased on account
of lower commodity prices on the international market and reduced global
demand for bauxite. The price of sugar fell as the European Union price cuts took
effect on 1 October 2009. The price of rice also declined. However, offsetting
these declines was the higher price received on gold exports. The fall in
merchandise imports was even sharper and reflected largely the decline in the
value of imported fuel and lubricants as the international price of oil trended
downward. Meanwhile, the capital account recorded a surplus due to the SDR
allocation and increased in net private investment.
5. Prudent macroeconomic management enabled Guyana to perform well despite the
international crisis, for which the authorities are to be commended. Fiscal policy
focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability, while achieving fiscal
consolidation. The authorities have been successful in reducing the fiscal deficit
over the past few years. The deficit has narrowed to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2009
from 4.7 percent in 2008 and 7.2 percent in 2006. The improved fiscal position
resulted in part from higher revenue collections from both tax and non-tax
sources, while expenditure increased at a slower pace. The bulk of increased
expenditure was related to investment spending in agriculture, construction and
housing which helped to stimulate growth and at the same time enhanced the
infrastructure of Guyana. The removal of the measures put in place in 2008 to
limit the effects of inflation helped to reduce the fiscal deficit. In 2008, excise
taxes on gasoline and diesel were lowered. However, as the international price of
oil fell, this measure was reversed. Also removed in 2009 was the subsidy to the
electricity company that had been introduced in 2008 to help offset the rising
costs associated with the high fuel prices.

6. Guyana’s public debt to GDP ratio fell to 61.4 in 2009 percent from over 90 percent
in 2006. The authorities are committed to ensuring debt sustainability in the medium
term and are working towards reducing or eliminating the stock of outstanding debt
with the bilateral non-Paris Club creditors. Going forward they will seek to borrow
only at concessional rates in an effort to contain the cost of borrowing.
7. With respect to monetary policy, the authorities’ stance was appropriate and focused
on maintaining price and exchange rate stability on one hand, while promoting
growth in credit to the private sector on the other.
8. Meanwhile, the financial system has not been directly affected by the global financial
crisis and remains adequately capitalized, highly liquid and profitable. Asset quality
is improving as seen by the declining trend in nonperforming loans to total loans
which have fallen from 17.8 percent in 2004 to 8.3 percent in 2009. Following the
CLICO debacle, CLICO Guyana has been placed under judicial management and the
government stands ready to give financial support upon liquidation. The authorities
have since stepped up surveillance and have taken steps to strengthen the regulation
and supervision of the financial system. A supervision guideline on risk management
was issued to licensed financial institutions and the new Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Act and the Money
Transfer Agencies (Licensing) Act were enacted in 2009.
Outlook
9. Looking ahead the authorities aim to build on the achievements of 2009 and the
policy objectives for the medium term are rightly focused on maintaining
macroeconomic stability, promoting long term growth and development, improving
the standard of living of the Guyanese people while transforming the economy and
achieving fiscal and debt sustainability. The 2010 Budget passed in Parliament on
February 8, 2010 conveys the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence. However,
fiscal consolidation will proceed at a more gradual pace than in 2009 to facilitate the
much needed infrastructural development and to sustain economic growth. The
deficit is projected to narrow to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010 and going forward will
remain at this level before declining further to under 3 percent in 2012. In 2010,
revenues are expected to receive a boost from the higher VAT collections and in
particular from the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between Norway and Guyana which is expected to result in the receipt of US$30
million in 2010 and a total of US$250 million by 2015. This MOU is related to the
authorities’ Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) launched in June 2009. It
outlines an overarching vision for Guyana, whereby the country exports

4
environmental services to the rest of the world and the foreign exchange inflows
are used to assist in transforming the economy along a low carbon development
path.
10. In 2010 inflation is projected to increase to 4 percent in expectation of higher oil
prices. The authorities are committed to keeping inflation in check; monetary
policy will focus on maintaining price and exchange rate stability.
11. Despite the risks to growth, the outlook for Guyana remains positive for 2010 and
beyond with the global economy poised to improve, the start up of the Skeldon
sugar factory, the implementation of the LCDS, and the government’s investment
program geared to modernizing and transforming the economy. A number of
initiatives are in train to modernize the traditional sectors, such as sugar, rice and
mining and quarrying, and to diversify the economy into new areas of agriculture,
tourism, oil and alternative sources of energy.
12. Further a number of projects were completed in 2009 which will augur well for
the economy going forward. In particular, the commissioning of the new Takutu
bridge which links Guyana and Brazil will assist in strengthening the trade and
economic ties between these countries. In addition, the authorities are seeking to
promote investment in other alternative energy sources as a means of reducing
dependence on the importation of costly fuel. For instance, several preinvestment studies in bio fuel production are expected to be conducted in
conjunction with private firms by the end of 2010. The construction of a
hydropower generation plant is also in the pipeline.
13. The authorities will continue their reform agenda to strengthen supervision of the
financial system in 2010 as a number of laws are drafted or enacted. These
include the drafting of legislation to bring the New Building Society Ltd. under
the supervision of the Bank of Guyana and completing regulations and guidelines
pursuant to the AML and CFT Act. Initiatives for improving the business
environment will persist under the leadership of the National Competitiveness
Council, as well as reforms to modernize the Guyana Revenue Authority along
functional lines.
