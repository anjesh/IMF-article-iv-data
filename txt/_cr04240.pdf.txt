EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Outlook: Between 1993 and 2000 Denmark enjoyed a period of rapid
economic growth supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals and structural reform. In
2001, a slowdown began. Initially, fiscal measures aimed at cooling an overheating economy
led to an easing in private consumption expenditure while net exports and investment
supported growth. The downturn in the global economy eventually spilled over into net
exports in 2002 with the resulting impact on business confidence leading to a decline in
investment in 2003. Currently, conditions appear to be in place for a return to healthy growth.
In the medium term, Denmark is relatively well prepared to deal with the fiscal pressures that
will arise as the population ages.
Policy discussions focused on the following key issues:
•

The macroeconomic fundamentals underlying the expected rebound; and

•

the additional efforts that will be required to achieve the medium-term employment
and public expenditure targets underlying the authorities’ strategy for ensuring fiscal
sustainability given the pressure from an aging population and the objective of
maintaining the welfare state without increasing taxes.

Authorities and staff agreed that:
•

The conditions appear to be in place for a return to growth close to the economy’s
potential rate. Domestic balance sheets are healthy. Monetary and fiscal policy are
supportive. The world recovery is strengthening and leading indicators suggest that
the pickup in the domestic economy witnessed late last year continues to gain
momentum.

•

Inflation pressures will remain subdued. Although the impact of the reduction in
indirect taxes and euro appreciation are temporary, capacity constraints are unlikely to
be reached until the end of 2005.

•

Although Denmark is well placed to deal with the fiscal pressures of an aging
population, additional measures will be required to achieve the structural employment
targets underlying the medium-term sustainability strategy.

The staff recommended that:
•

Constraints on public consumption expenditure be strengthened by expressing the
expenditure targets in nominal terms and introducing user fees in healthcare.

•

To achieve the structural employment targets priority should be given to reform of
early retirement schemes, continued progress in product market reforms and further
improvements in the tax system to increase incentives to work.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Denmark’s stability-oriented economic reforms took hold in the early 1990s and
the country enjoyed a period of rapid economic growth over 1993–2000 (Figure 1).
Initially, accommodative fiscal policy and a consumption boom stimulated by lower interest
rates and mortgage market reforms provided the impetus. In the subsequent period of robust
economic activity, labor market reforms led to a significant and sustained labor supply
response, reinforcing the pickup in growth and ensuring its sustainability. Fiscal reforms, the
introduction of a formalized medium-term fiscal framework, and the growing economy
transformed fiscal deficits into sizable surpluses. Government debt fell from a peak of almost
80 percent of GDP in 1993 to 45 percent by the end of the decade. Consistent with the
improvement in domestic saving, Denmark registered current account surpluses through most
of the 1990s and its foreign debt position also improved markedly.

among the highest in the
OECD (Figure 2). At least
part of this may be credited to Denmark’s flexible recruitment and dismissal rules, strict
requirements regarding participation in active labor market programs such as education and
training, and clear availability-for-work criteria to qualify for benefits.

3.
As in much of Europe, growth slowed starting in 2001 (Table 1, Figures 3–5).
Consumption spending weakened in response to domestic fiscal initiatives aimed at cooling
an overheating economy, while investment and net exports supported growth. More recently,
net exports slowed as the appreciating euro and the global economic slowdown reduced
external demand. Investment, which had remained strong as storm related construction and
major infrastructure investment projects where completed, eventually weakened as well in
2003 as tepid external demand undermined business confidence. Toward the end of 2003
domestic demand picked up resulting in annual growth of 0.4 percent. With output now
estimated to be roughly 1 percent below potential, the unemployment rate has risen steadily
from its trough of 5 percent in 2002 to 6½ percent.

Once the slowdown started to affect unemployment, a sound underlying fiscal
position provided space to let automatic stabilizers work (Figure 6). Consistent with
medium-term sustainability objectives and reflecting overruns in 2002, constraints on public
consumption expenditure in 2003 led to a small tightening of the structural fiscal position.
However, this was more than offset by the cyclically-driven increase in social transfers and
unemployment benefits together with slower tax collections (also partly due to a tax freeze).
The fiscal surplus fell to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2003 from 1.6 percent the preceding year.

5.
Inflation remains well under control, helped by the longstanding fixed exchange
rate of the krone.1 Headline HICP inflation is down below 1 percent, partly due to
reductions in taxes on alcohol and tobacco (Figure 7). As of April, the krone has appreciated
by nearly 30 percent against the dollar since the low point in 2000 and by roughly 10 percent
in real effective terms putting downward pressure on import prices. Wages continued to grow
in 2003 at the trend rate of roughly 4 percent, above that in most partner countries, but
supported by labor productivity growth. While equity prices have recovered along with the
upturn in major international markets, the long but gradual upward trend in real housing
prices appears to be tapering off (Figure 8). Policy interest rates in Denmark have been
adjusted simultaneously with those in the euro area, and a spread of about only 10 basis
points on short-term interest rates reflects the credibility of the peg (Figures 9 and 10).
6.
Economic activity remained weak in early 2004. Given the increasing slack in the
labor market and uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, the government, using its
fiscal margin of maneuver, introduced a small package of fiscal measures on March 16 (see
below) to help stimulate growth. Subsequently, leading indicators have evolved positively
(Figure 11).
1

Denmark has for some time been the sole participant in ERM II within a band of
+/- 2.25 percent. In practice, the krone/euro rate has remained within about +/- 0.25 percent
of the central parity.

7.
Denmark’s policies continue to be broadly in line with the Fund’s
recommendations in earlier consultations. The authorities felt that Fund advice had helped
to influence their thinking. In particular, Fund discussions focused on economic fundamentals
with an international view, while the domestic debate is often more politically motivated. It
was noted that Fund advice about overheating in the late 1990s proved to be both correct and
helpful. Further, the Fund’s emphasis on spending discipline and structural reform had helped
generate domestic focus and build public support for the medium-term sustainability strategy.
II. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The discussions focused on the near-term prospects for a return to more rapid
growth and making further progress in the longer-term challenge of accommodating
the fiscal pressures arising from an aging population. Growth in Denmark has been on a
slowing trend for the last three years and discussions focused on the macroeconomic
fundamentals underlying the expected rebound: the stance of monetary and fiscal policy; the
state of household, firm and public sector balance sheets; and Denmark’s external
competitiveness. Adherence to its coherent medium-term strategy, designed to ensure longterm fiscal sustainability while maintaining the welfare state without resorting to tax
increases, has placed Denmark on a path with a strong fiscal position that should ensure
resources will be available to fund the costs of an aging population (Figure 12). However,
additional efforts will be required to achieve the medium-term employment and public
expenditure targets. In this regard the discussions reviewed: the need to control public
consumption expenditures; additional labor market reforms required to achieve the structural
employment targets given Denmark’s already high participation rates; and product market
reforms required to improve overall Danish competitiveness.
A. The Near-Term Outlook and the Policy Stance
The discussions were conducted against the backdrop of the authorities’ recent
announcement of a stimulus package to spur growth (Box 1). The authorities explained
that the package was focused on increasing households’ disposable income and consumption
spending while limiting the fiscal impact. They estimated that the package could increase
GDP growth in 2004 by between 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points, depending on the propensity
to consume out of higher disposable income.
9.

10.
The authorities noted that the expected pickup in world growth, accommodative
monetary policy, and the stimulus from recent fiscal initiatives laid the groundwork for
a return to healthy growth. Interest rates at historical lows and the impact of the recent
fiscal package were expected to support a recovery in consumption. In turn, strengthening
domestic and external demand were set to sustain the emerging rebound in business
confidence, stimulating investment demand. The authorities projected growth of 2.2 percent
for 2004 rising to 2½ percent in 2005.

Box 1. The Fiscal Measures Announced on March 16
To support the economic upturn and increase employment, the government introduced a stimulus package with
the following elements.
•

Moving forward to 2004: (a) cuts in labor income tax rates originally planned to be phased in from 2004 to
2007; (b) social and healthcare spending; and (c) public housing construction and investment.

•

A temporary suspension (in 2004 and 2005) of obligatory contributions to the Special Pension scheme (one
percent of income).

In addition to these measures, the government set aside funds to strengthen efforts to educate and better qualify
people for work.
The fiscal costs of the package are small since the suspension of the tax deductible obligatory pension
contributions increases taxable income, offsetting the additional costs of moving forward the income tax
reductions.

11.
The staff saw a slightly slower rebound in 2004. The staff forecast growth to be
1.8 percent in 2004 rising to 2½ percent in 2005, with employment uncertainty and high
household debt inducing households to save a larger portion of the increase in their
disposable income. Further, the signals of recovery in Europe remained weak, oil prices
remained high, and a resumption of euro appreciation could undermine competitiveness at a
vulnerable moment. The authorities recognized the downside potential, but felt that risks
were evenly balanced given the upside possibility that the fiscal stimulus, together with a
more robust recovery in external and domestic demand, could engender a return to labor
supply constraints within 2 years.
12.
In the staff’s view, the March fiscal package would provide a counter-cyclical
impetus to growth. While the impact would be small—perhaps at the lower end of the
authorities’ estimate—Denmark was in a strong position to support the upturn. The package
was well-designed, bringing forward needed reductions in labor income taxes and increasing
incentives to work, while minimizing the short and medium-term fiscal impact. Further,
relative to the pre-package stance, the measures will only have a temporary impact with the
stimulus effect being largely complete by the time activity is expected to reach potential.
Importantly, there was agreement that discretionary counter-cyclical fiscal interventions

- 20 -

should be kept as an exceptional response to avoid undermining the credibility of the
medium-term targets. Staff noted that Denmark has been well-served by focusing fiscal
policy on medium-term objectives, and relying on automatic stabilizers during cyclical
swings.
13.
There was agreement that price inflation is likely to remain below 2 percent over
the near term. Excess capacity, reductions in indirect taxes,2 and the impact on import prices
of an appreciating currency have all contributed to the easing in inflationary pressures.
Although the effects of the tax reductions and currency appreciation are temporary, there was
agreement that capacity utilization constraints are unlikely to be reached before 2006,
suggesting inflationary pressure should remain subdued. The authorities noted that the impact
of labor market slack is beginning to show in wage setting as the recent central framework for
wage growth sets a benchmark of 3 to 3½ percent for annual growth in labor cost over the
next three years, roughly a full percentage point below the average rate of growth over the
previous four years. However, most wage agreements are still to be negotiated at the local
level. The authorities were aware of the risks to competitiveness should labor costs outstrip
improvements in productivity. At the same time, they pointed to the sustained current account
surpluses as evidence of Denmark’s currently favorable external competitiveness (Box 2).
14.
On the fiscal front, the authorities and the staff project the surplus to remain
broadly unchanged in 2004. The impact of the expected pick-up in economic activity on tax
revenues and current transfers will help maintain the surplus at around 1.2 percent of GDP in
2004. The expected strengthening of the recovery next year will further support public
finances and the surplus is, consequently, projected to increase to around 1.4 percent of GDP
in 2005 (Tables 3 and 4), below the authorities’ most recent forecast of 1.7 percent of GDP.
15.
Although interest rates were judged to be appropriate given the Danish business
cycle, monetary conditions have tightened due to euro appreciation. With interest rates at
historical lows, the authorities did not feel that further easing by the ECB would have much
impact on domestic demand, particularly with the large baby-boom cohort focused on saving
for retirement. The level of the real effective exchange rate was not viewed to be prohibitive
as it was near historical averages, however, there was concern that further appreciation of the
euro would undermine competitiveness.

The reduction in alcohol and tobacco taxes that occurred October 1, 2003 contributes
roughly 0.4 percentage points to the decline in year-over-year consumer price inflation.

Box 2. Denmark’s External Competitiveness
Over the last five years, the growth in Danish labor costs has consistently outpaced that in the euro area. More
recently, euro appreciation has been increasing the price of Danish goods outside of the euro area. However,
trade and current account balances suggest that Denmark’s external competitiveness remains strong. It appears
that Denmark’s productivity performance relative to that of its major trading partners has helped to maintain
Danish competitiveness.
Over the most recent five-year period, the growth in Danish total value added per hour has exceeded that in the
three large euro area countries1 and exhibited comparable performance to the three Nordic countries2 and the
UK. Denmark’s advantage in comparison to the euro area is more pronounced in the tradable sector.3 Tradable
productivity growth in the three Nordic countries has been almost a full percentage point higher than in
Denmark, but wage growth in these countries also exceeds that in Denmark.

B. The Medium-Term Strategy
16.
Considerable progress has been made in pursuing medium-term economic
objectives: high and stable employment, fiscal policy sustainability, and favorable
conditions for growth. Price and exchange rate stability continue to be based on a credible
commitment to a fixed exchange rate. Denmark’s fiscal framework is intended to ensure that
government savings over the medium term are sufficient to maintain long-term sustainability
of public finances in light of population aging without having to resort to tax increases while
maintaining the main elements of the welfare state (Box 3). Staff viewed the strategy as

- 22 -

having been appropriately designed to achieve Denmark’s medium-term sustainability
objectives.3 The strategy calls for fiscal surpluses through 2010 that reduce public debt and
free resources to accommodate the increase in spending associated with an aging population.
Efforts are under way to reduce taxes, contain the growth of public expenditures, and increase
growth through labor and product market reforms. Denmark has made considerable progress
toward meeting its objectives: substantial fiscal surpluses continue to be realized; labor
market participation rates are amongst the highest in the OECD; and structural employment
has increased.

Box 3. Denmark’s Medium-term Fiscal Framework
Denmark began formalizing its medium-term fiscal framework in the early 1990s, with the initial impetus
coming from the EU’s deficit targets, debt ceilings and convergence programs. Significant further steps were
taken in 1997, when the government published a more ambitious medium-term consolidation plan,
Denmark 2005. This plan introduced objectives for debt and real public consumption growth. Later versions of
the framework targeted a general government budget surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP.
In 2001 the planning horizon was extended and the government presented the current medium-term framework
in Denmark 2010. The framework is intended to ensure that government savings over the medium term are
sufficient to maintain long-term sustainability of public finances. Specifically:
•

An average general government budget surplus of 1½–2½ percent of GDP over the medium term is targeted
while making room for a reduction in the tax burden. The aim is to halve the government’s debt-to-GDP
ratio to 27½ percent by 2010.

•

The framework targets real public consumption growth to 0.7 percent in 2004 and 0.5 percent thereafter.

•

A tax freeze was introduced in 2002 applying to both tax rates and taxes expressed in nominal terms.

•

Reductions in labor income taxes and structural reforms have been implemented, with further reforms
envisaged, to achieve a 2 percent increase in structural employment by 2010.

For further information see IMF Country Report No. 02/102.

17.
There was recognition that two key elements of the strategy will be particularly
challenging. First, in the medium term, the real growth in public spending is to be held to
3

A broad range of factors contribute to the determination of the path for the fiscal balance
consistent with sustainability objectives. Some of the major ones are: the initial level of
government debt; the impact of aging on expenditure; the prospects for the evolution of the
tax base; and the authorities’ objectives for the future paths of tax rates and public services.
For a detailed analysis of fiscal sustainability in Denmark see IMF Country Report
No. 02/102.

- 23 -

0.5 percent, below the rate of GDP growth, and significantly less than the 1.6 percent average
growth over the last five years. Second, the targets incorporate an increase in structural
employment of 1.6 percent of the working age population, based on increasing participation
rates and reducing the NAIRU to 4½ percent by 2010 from its currently estimated level of
roughly 5½ percent.
Constraining public consumption expenditure
18.
The authorities pointed to progress in containing the growth in public
consumption expenditure, an area where slippages have occurred in the past. To contain
spending overruns, they had introduced a tax freeze and imposed legally binding rules on
counties to comply with budgeted targets to have their first full-year effect in 2003.
Preliminary results for 2003 pointed to progress in containing expenditure, with real public
consumption growing by 0.5 percent compared to around 2 percent the previous year.
Although this implied average real growth over 2002–03 in excess of the 1 percent target,
staff welcomed the resulting overall strengthening of spending control.
19.
Staff cautioned that additional measures to control spending may be required.
While commending the useful check on the size of government provided by the constraints
on public spending growth, the staff noted that demand for additional spending in such areas
as heath care will likely put pressure on the targets. Going forward, the staff recommended
expressing the expenditure target in nominal rather than real terms. The staff argued that this
could enhance transparency and enforceability and more directly link the target to the
ultimate objective, the nominal fiscal surpluses necessary to reduce the debt ratio and secure
long-term fiscal sustainability. It might also improve incentives to provide public services
more cost effectively. The authorities noted that annual budgets negotiated with local
authorities were set in nominal terms based on expected price developments and thereby in a
sense were nominal targets. Moreover, they pointed out that it was important politically to
demonstrate to the public that there would be real increases in the standards of public
services.
20.
The staff recommended that user fees be considered as a means to better align
demand for services with need, thereby more efficiently allocating scarce resources.
Revenue from user fees could provide room for further reductions in labor income taxes that
would help achieve medium-term employment targets while maintaining the laudable
objectives of the tax freeze. The authorities pointed out that the current specification of the
tax freeze prevented them from implementing user fees.
21.
A reorganization of local governments is under consideration, aimed at
improving delivery of public services and harnessing economies of scale. Key questions
under consideration are the size of municipalities and the division of tasks. A decision is
expected before the next local elections in January 2006. The authorities noted that realized
economies of scale might generate some cost savings, but they expected the largest impact
would be in improved delivery of public services. An underlying tension is evident in the

- 24 -

process as the central government seeks to retain control over local expenditure (a large share
of total spending), while local authorities feel they need more control because they are held
responsible for service delivery. The authorities, cognizant of the potential spending
pressures during the reform period, have imposed constraints to prevent excess capital
expenditures prior to reorganization.
Structural reform in labor and product markets
22.
The authorities outlined that to achieve the structural increase in employment,
policy has focused on groups with relatively low participation rates: the young, older
workers, and immigrants. Attention has focused on speeding students’ passage through the
education system, reducing incentives for early retirement, and increasing the incentives and
opportunities for recent immigrants to enter the workforce. In addition to increasing labor
supply, the employment targets also embody a decline in the NAIRU to 4½ percent by 2010.
A broad range of initiatives has been implemented over the last five years (Box 4) to increase
structural employment and, although the authorities noted that it was still too early to judge
the effectiveness of many of the initiatives, they indicated that a comprehensive monitoring
program was in place.

Box 4. Labor Market Initiatives Aimed at Increasing Structural Employment
To achieve the medium-term objective of a 2 percent increase in structural employment by 2010, the
government has focused on increasing the participation rates of particular groups and lowering the NAIRU. The
following initiatives have been introduced:
•

The number of years of tertiary education that the state fully funds has been reduced to the minimum
normally required to complete the program of study.

•

Incentives to postpone early retirement have been increased (1999).

•

The disability pension system has been reformed to ensure that any ability to work is fully utilized.

•

Long-term sickness benefit programs have been changed so that reintegration into work can occur gradually
and thereby sooner to avoid marginalization. Further, financial incentives have been increased for local
governments to ensure that reintegration occurs as quickly as possible.

•

Social benefits have been reduced for couples that are both receiving benefits and the marginal incentives to
take a job for those on social benefits have been increased by slowing the rate at which some benefits are
withdrawn once employed (More People in Work, October 2002).

•

Labor market activation programs have been refocused to ensure that employment and not simply
participation is the goal (More People in Work, October 2002).

•

For the first seven years of residence, social assistance benefits to new immigrants and repatriated Danes
have been reduced to 50 to 70 percent of the level that long-term residents receive. A wage subsidy program
has also been introduced for recent immigrants (The Integration Package for Immigrants, March 2003).

- 25 -

23.
The authorities recognized that achieving the targeted increases in labor supply
will require further reforms. Staff noted that measures to increase direct financial
incentives were likely to be most effective. In particular, a reduction in the incentives for
early retirement would be an important, if politically very sensitive step. The recently formed
Welfare Commission is to outline the reform options and stimulate public debate.4 The first
report from the Commission, to be published in late May, was expected to clarify the key
issues. The final report with policy options is planned for late 2005, after the elections.
24.
The staff suggested that there was further scope to consider changes in tax and
labor compensation structures to increase incentives to supply labor or invest in human
capital. Denmark has one of the highest top marginal labor income tax rates amongst the
OECD and it applies to almost 40 percent of employees. Further, wage compression has long
been a feature in the Danish labor market. Discussions revealed various undesirable effects
stemming from tax and wage structures, such as workers’ preferences for increased holidays
over increased wages, some worrying trends in tertiary educational attainment in Denmark
relative to other industrial countries (Figure 13), and some of the employment difficulties
faced by low-skilled workers. The staff, while commending the recent progress in reducing
labor income taxes, argued that efforts to reduce the top marginal rate should be pursued and
that consideration should be given to allowing for greater wage dispersion. Removing the
nominal tax freeze that has been imposed on some components of property taxes could
provide the space to lower the top marginal tax rate, shifting the tax burden from mobile to
immobile factors. While not disagreeing in principle, the authorities argued that full state
funding of tertiary education and the quick pace of advancement for the highly educated
helped to maintain sufficient incentives to invest in human capital. Further, the authorities
indicated that the egalitarian principles underlying wage compression and the partial freezing
of property taxes were very popular and would be politically difficult to change.
25.
Staff offered that increasing competition in goods markets was a necessary
complement to the authorities’ efforts to increase labor supply. With the passage of
legislation in 2002 increasing penalties for anti-competitive behavior, the authorities noted
that Denmark’s legal framework for competition policy meets the northern European
standard. However, strict enforcement will be required to attain the average in practical
terms. The authorities pointed to liberalization in the energy market as an indicator that
progress was being made. However, it was agreed that considerable improvements were still
possible particularly in construction, transportation, rental housing, and retail. Staff research
using a multi-country optimizing model (the Fund’s new Global Economic Model) illustrates
that increasing the competitiveness in product markets would increase labor demand and help
achieve the structural employment targets (Box 5 and Selected Issues (SM/04/218)).

The Welfare Commission is to outline reform options for the welfare system in the face of
the challenges from aging.

Box 5. Estimated Impact of Regulatory Reform in Denmark and the Euro Area
The European Council’s Lisbon agenda sets out an ambitious schedule for regulatory reform in labor and goods
markets so that European countries can exploit all the opportunities of globalization and the information
technology revolution to achieve their full potential in terms of employment and productivity growth. In goods
markets, excessive regulation can reduce employment and slow productivity growth if it constrains competition
and allows firms to keep output too low thereby keeping prices too high. Among others, regulations such as
import licensing, quotas, product standards, public and private monopolies, administrative burdens and access to
capital all help to determine the extent to which firms can constrain output and keep prices too high. In labor
markets, the regulatory environment can lower employment and output if it allows workers to constrain the
supply of labor available to firms, thereby keeping real wages artificially high. The amount of power that
workers have to reduce the labor supply and artificially drive up the real wage depends on factors such as
minimum wage legislation, the generosity of unemployment insurance and welfare benefits, legislation that
influences unionization and the wage bargaining process, and immigration policy.
The IMF’s new Global Economic Model (GEM) has been used to estimate the benefits of regulatory reform that
increases competition in goods and labor markets. The analysis suggests that if the levels of goods and labor
market efficiencies in Denmark and the euro area increased to match the levels estimated to be the best among
industrial countries, then real GDP will increase in the long-run by roughly 7 percent in Denmark and 12 percent
in the euro area. Although the empirical estimates suggest that Denmark needs to undertake less reform than the
euro area on average, the benefits in Denmark are still quite large because of positive spillovers from the reform
undertaken in the euro area, Denmark’s major trading partner. The increase in real GDP resulting from more
efficient labor and product markets comes from an increase in the capital stock and an increase in hours worked.
The results, although dependent on model calibration, are consistent with that Danish government’s mediumterm target of an increase in structural employment of 2 percent. However, the results suggest that both labor
and product market reforms will be required. For further details see Denmark: Selected Issues (SM/04/218).

C. Exchange Rate and Financial Sector
26.
The authorities viewed Denmark’s fixed exchange rate in ERM II as a central
pillar of their framework for macroeconomic stability and noted that it had served the
country well. The commitment to the fixed exchange rate has been the central element
underlying the evolution of macroeconomic policy for the last two decades and the staff

- 28 -

agreed with the authorities’ positive assessment of its role. Inflation has been low and stable,
and fiscal policy has been focused on ensuring that fundamental savings and investment
balances in Denmark are consistent with the peg. The authorities noted that the success of the
fixed exchange rate was partly due to Denmark’s historical experience, and as such not
necessarily replicable elsewhere. The poor macroeconomic outcomes in the 1970s and early
1980s served to build public support for the policies that were required over the subsequent
decades to sustain the peg. In particular, the historical experience helped build support for
prudent fiscal policy focused on medium-term objectives, reforms to make the economy more
flexible, and unhesitating use of interest rates to defend the peg when necessary. Eventual
euro adoption continues to be the authorities’ favored exit strategy, but this has not received
the necessary support from a population concerned about loss of sovereignty. A referendum
on joining the euro was rejected by a small margin in 2000 and another is unlikely to take
place at least until after the next elections.
27.
Despite the three-year slowdown, the quality of banks’ assets remain high and
loan losses have been minimal (Table A3). Some debtors, notably in the agricultural sector,
have come under some stress, but the share of such loans is small and authorities saw no
systemic concerns. The authorities conduct periodic stress tests and these suggested that
while there was some dispersion among banks, there were sufficient buffers to absorb
significant risks in the banking system. Denmark has requested an FSAP that is now planned
to take place in late 2005 in the context of next Article IV consultation cycle.
28.
Insurance companies and pension funds benefited from the favorable
performance of equity markets in 2003. Solvency ratios remained healthy, and the
authorities considered that the potential for systemic problems was extremely limited. The
risks related to liabilities linked to interest guarantees have to a high degree been hedged
through various financial instruments.
29.
There was agreement that the risks from rising house prices and household debt
levels appear contained. The increase over recent years in household indebtedness,
particularly mortgage debt, and the wider use of adjustable-rate mortgages have increased
households’ exposure to changes in short-term interest rates. While household debt is high by
international standards, the authorities noted that debt-servicing costs remain quite low
because of low interest rates. Furthermore, net debt is lower in Denmark as household assets
are substantial, partly a reflection of high home values. While housing prices have been on a
ten-year rising trend, the increase remains well below that in some other countries (Box 6).
30.
The authorities recognized that further euro area integration of the financial
sector presents challenges for supervision. They were fully cognizant of the importance of
regulatory harmonization in the context of increasing conglomeration and cross-border
mergers. One large Danish bank is merging its subsidiaries across the Nordic region into a
single bank chartered in Sweden, and will operate in Denmark as a systemically-important
branch. Cross-border cooperation will be enhanced by the adoption of the EU’s financial
services directive and Basel II accord. However, the authorities noted that the new regulations

- 29 -

would effectively imply a loosening of provisioning and capital adequacy requirements for
Danish banks. The authorities were encouraging domestic banks to move gradually to the
new lower levels of capital adequacy, although they were aware of the competitive pressures.

Box 6. House Prices and Household Debt
•

Denmark has experienced three episodes of strong
house price gains since the mid-1970s. The last
episode since 1993 has been the longest expansion,
with real house prices rising by over 5½ percent a
year. The steady rise reflects in part an increase in
the demand for houses associated with a reduction in
mortgage interest rates and greater access to credit.

income gearing—the ratio of interest payments to

standards, reflecting low interest rate levels, but household exposure to changes in short-term interest rates
has increased.

•

Compared to other countries, the household debt, as a ratio of gross disposable income, appears high, but
debt as a ratio of owner occupied housing prices has remained fairly stable. Among the debtors, limited
micro data showed that the mostly liquidity constrained amounted to roughly 30–40 percent of total
households.

D. Statistical and Other Issues
31.
Denmark has consistently supported trade liberalization within the context of
EU membership. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to press for resuming
negotiations under the Doha round. The authorities also reiterated their support for CAP
reform and the EU’s flexibility on the “Singapore issues” (investment, competition,
government procurement, and trade facilitation).
32.
Denmark subscribes to the SDDS and its economic data coverage is
comprehensive. The gap between exports based on trade data (Danmarks Statistiks) and
exports based on balance of payments data (Danmarks Nationalbank) has widened in recent
years and ongoing discussions between to the two organizations have not as yet led to a
reconciliation of the two series.
33.
Denmark maintains its leadership in development assistance and the staff
encouraged the continuation of this policy in the future. Although aid as a share of gross
national income has fallen slightly in recent years, the staff commended the policy of
maintaining development assistance at a level representing at least 0.7 percent of gross
national income—still among the highest of any country.
34.
Denmark has adopted the OECD’s anti-bribery convention and has satisfied the
40 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations in the area of money
laundering. Denmark has completed the questionnaire on anti-money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. Based on their response and discussions held during the Article IV
consultation, the AML/CLFT regime appears to have a solid foundation.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
A decade of successful structural reform and prudent fiscal management put
Denmark in a strong position to weather the recent world-wide economic slowdown.
Labor market reforms commencing in the mid 1990s resulted in a significant increase in
structural employment that helped fuel a sustained period of robust economic growth leaving
households and firms with balance sheets capable of withstanding the recent slowdown in
growth. Over the same period, prudent fiscal management, formalized in a medium-term
framework for achieving sustainability in public finances, resulted in fiscal surpluses and a
significant reduction in government debt as a share of GDP. However, key challenges remain
in Denmark’s quest to maintain the key elements of the welfare state and ensure long-term
fiscal sustainability without increasing taxes.
36.
Conditions for a return to healthy growth appear to be in place. Accommodative
fiscal and monetary policy, healthy balance sheets, favorable external competitiveness and
several leading indicators point to a resumption of growth that is close to the economy’s
potential. Household sector employment concerns and possible weakness in trading partner

- 31 -

demand appear to be the key downside risks, while the risk of a sharp retrenchment in house
prices undermining the recovery appears low.
37.
The package of fiscal measures introduced by the government in March is
expected to provide a helpful impetus to the current recovery without undermining
medium-term objectives. However, to maintain the momentum to address the remaining
medium-term issues, it is important to avoid generating the expectation that fiscal fine tuning
will become a regular tool for short-run stabilization.
38.
Denmark has already made considerable progress in preparing for the fiscal
pressures from aging and medium-term sustainability continues to be the appropriate
policy focus. Although recent developments suggest some progress has been made in
reducing public consumption growth, containing it remains a cornerstone of the medium-term
strategy. Consideration should be given to specifying spending targets in nominal terms.
Increasing healthcare costs, above and beyond the volume effects from an aging population,
represent a key risk to the containment of public consumption expenditures. Introducing user
fees should be considered to more efficiently allocate scarce healthcare resources and contain
demand pressures. Further, revenues from user fees could provide the fiscal room to achieve
other labor market objectives while respecting, in aggregate, the tax freeze.
39.
Given Denmark’s high overall participation rate, achieving the targeted
increases in structural employment may require politically difficult measures. The
authorities are appropriately focusing on the sectors of the labor market where participation
rates are low, including both the older and younger age groups and first- and secondgeneration immigrants.
40.
Achieving substantial increases in medium-term employment will likely require
changes to early retirement schemes. The time profile for participation among the elderly
indicates that early retirement schemes have been the key reason for the decline in
participation of this group. While changes to the system of early retirement incentives will
not be easy politically, they could have a more rapid impact on employment than other areas
where improvements are likely to be more gradual.
41.
Further reductions in labor income taxes should be considered. Demographics are
shrinking the relative size of the working age population, and policy should be focused on
reducing the extent to which the structure of the tax system constrains labor supply. Labor
income taxes in Denmark continue to be amongst the highest in the OECD and there are
some worrying signals that this may be undermining incentives to invest in human capital.
42.
Denmark’s fixed exchange rate system remains a cornerstone of the economic
strategy. It has served the country well as an anchor for expectations, and an effective
discipline on fiscal and other economic policies. The low spreads in interest rates vis-à-vis
the euro attest to the credibility of the peg.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the 24-month
cycle.

APPENDIX III

Denmark: Statistical Appendix
Denmark has a full range of statistical publications, many of which are on the Internet. The
quality and timeliness of the economic database are very good and generally adequate for
surveillance purposes. Denmark subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). Metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
The gap between exports based on trade data (collected by Danmarks Statistiks) and exports
based on balance of payments statistics (collected by the Nationalbank Danmark) has
widened in recent years. The discrepancy reflects different sources of information and
methodologies used by the two organizations. Ongoing discussions between the two
organizations, however, have not yet led to a satisfying reconciliation of the two data series.
The authorities have introduced new data on monetary financial institutions that conform to
the ESA95 and expand the set of financial institutions covered in the Nationalbank’s
statistical bulletin. This permits an examination of some categories of financial institutions
not covered before (e.g. money market funds, small banks, and cooperative banks) allowing a
more thorough look at the financial sector. Some of the financial account data come from this
enhanced source. Data for the central bank and other depository corporations are reported to
STA on a timely and regular basis.
Denmark subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS). Metadata
are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

APPENDIX IV

Denmark: Sustainability Analysis
1.
Fiscal and external debt sustainability assessments were conducted over the medium
term applying standardized sensitivity tests to the staff’s baseline projections.
A. Fiscal Sustainability
2.
The staff’s baseline scenario predicts a decline in the public debt to GDP ratio from
43.3 in 2003 to 32.7 in 2008, and the different sensitivity tests suggest medium-term debt
sustainability is not at risk (Table A1) if the authorities pursue a course of fiscal
consolidation. Thus, the alternative scenarios or the bound tests suggest little risk of
sustainability problems. The worst outcome in the bound tests (test B2) only predict that the
debt ratio at the end of the period will increase by around 5 percentage points from current
levels. In all other tests the debt ratio falls over the projection horizon.
B. External Sustainability
3.
External debt sustainability does not appear to be an issue in Denmark. Denmark has
registered current account surpluses through most of the 1990s and its net investment
position improved markedly from about negative 30 percent of GDP in early 1990s to
negative 15 percent of GDP in 2003 (Table A2). Gross external debt increased from 115 to
130 percent of GDP during 1999–2003 but this was accompanied by a substantial increase in
gross external assets; the net external debt declined from 34 percent of GDP to about
28 percent (Table A3). With sustained current account surplus projected over the mediumterm, Denmark’s net investment position is projected to strengthen further. Table A3
provides a summary set of external and financial vulnerability indicators as well.

1/ General government gross debt
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of Euro).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in Euro value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 2, 2004
This note updates key developments in Denmark since the drafting of the staff report for the
Article IV consultation. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Denmark’s GDP growth in the first quarter of 2004 was somewhat faster than
expected. The expansion of consumption spending continued in the first quarter and external
demand was also above expectation; 12-month growth registered 1.4 percent. Leading
indicators in Denmark have strengthened recently, particularly consumer confidence. With
activity in the euro area in the first quarter also picking up, staff considers that GDP growth
in Denmark for 2004 is likely to be just above 2 percent, up from the 1.8 percent contained in
the staff report.
2.
Recent fiscal data continue to show a strong underlying position, but suggest
that alignment with public consumption targets remains a challenge. The general
government fiscal outcome for 2003 was in line with staff estimates with a surplus of
1.2 percent of GDP, although both expenditures (for public consumption) and revenues were
higher than expected. Data for the first quarter of 2004 showed an improvement in the
surplus compared to last year driven by slowing expenditure growth and a pick-up in revenue
collections.
3.
The Welfare Commission released its first report on the sustainability of the
Danish welfare system. It concludes that, under current policies, Danes will draw more in
benefits from the welfare state over their lifetimes than they contribute to finance them. In
comparison with government projections, the Welfare Commission does not make
assumptions about further public expenditure compression or labor market reforms, and
projects longer life expectancy. Before year end, the commission will offer some specific
policy options, with a final report expected in late 2005.
4.
Political agreement has been reached on a model for reorganizing local
governments. The agreement specifies the division of tasks across the three levels of
government, the enlargement of the average size of municipalities and the replacement of the
current 14 counties with 5 regions. The reform, aimed at improving delivery of public
services and harnessing economies of scale, is planned to take effect in January 2007.

Statement by Benny Andersen, Alternate Executive Director for Denmark
August 2, 2004

1.
The Danish authorities wish to thank staff for fruitful and thought-provoking policy
discussions in Copenhagen and a well-balanced staff report. They will carefully consider the
recommendations made by staff.
Economic prospects
2.
My authorities concur with staff’s assessment that conditions appear to be in place for
a return to healthy growth. The global economy is recovering, interest rates are low, fiscal
policy is supportive, and the financial situation of corporates and households is generally
sound. The Danish Finance Ministry sees above-trend GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2004
and 2.5 percent in 2005, i.e. broadly in line with staff’s updated assessment in their
Buff/04/144. The unemployment rate is expected to decline from its current 6½ percent to
around 5¼ percent in 2005, a level roughly corresponding to the estimated structural level.
Downside risks from high oil prices, geopolitical unrest, and high fiscal deficits in most of
the major economies seem to be balanced by upside domestic potential from pent-up
consumer demand, easy financing terms, and credible tax reductions.
3.
The Danish authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the recent stimulus package is
well-designed and provides a counter-cyclical impetus to growth. The tax reductions have
been decided with a view to strengthening labor supply, but the frontloading in 2004 reflects
short-term employment considerations. There is some slack in the economy and, based on the
above forecast, capacity constraints are not likely to be felt before late 2005 or in 2006. By
design, the package has little impact on the fiscal balance or on long-term fiscal
sustainability, for reasons explained in the staff report. Also by design, the temporary
demand stimulus tapers off in 2006, when capacity constraints more likely could be binding.
4.
Inflation is very low, partly for transitory reasons, and the current account as well as
public finances show considerable surpluses. As staff note, wage increases have outpaced the
average of Denmark’s trading partners, but so has productivity. At the current euro-dollar
exchange rate, the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with long-term averages.
Medium-term policy framework
5.
My authorities welcome staff’s support for the medium-term fiscal framework and
exchange rate anchor, which form the basis of stability-oriented policies in Denmark.
6.
The key fiscal policy objective is that current and planned policies toward 2010 fulfill
the objective of long-term fiscal sustainability. This entails that the present welfare
provisions can be sustained in the face of future ageing-related spending pressures without
raising taxes. The strategy requires fiscal surpluses of 1½-2½ percent of GDP on average
toward 2010 and additional structural initiatives in order to increase employment.

-2-

7.
With tax reductions enacted and the tax freeze technically assumed to remain in force
to 2010, key policy requirements consist of the containment of real public consumption
growth to ½ percent per year in 2005 to 2010 and reform initiatives to raise structural
employment by some 2 percent. The outstanding requirements in terms of fiscal and
structural adjustments to ensure sustainability are estimated to be a good deal less in
Denmark than in most other OECD countries.
8.
The Danish authorities are pleased with staff’s view that the Danish fixed exchange
rate policy, pursued within the ERM II framework, has served Denmark well as an anchor for
expectations, and an effective discipline on fiscal and other economic policies. A fixed
exchange rate policy has been a cornerstone in the Danish economic policy for more than
two decades. The policy constitutes a strong foundation for price stability in Denmark and
the conditions for maintaining it are well understood by wage negotiators and fiscal
authorities. The Danish krone rate has remained close to the central parity for many years,
and the credibility of the peg is further underscored by low and relatively stable interest rates
vis-à-vis the euro area.
Fiscal policy issues
9.
In the report, staff cautions that additional fiscal measures may be required to control
spending. In this connection, they recommend that expenditure targets be expressed in
nominal rather than in real terms and that user fees be considered, including in health care, to
better align demand for services with need. In the medium-term fiscal framework, spending
paths are projected both in real and nominal terms. What matters for medium and long-term
fiscal objectives is how nominal expenditures develop in relation to the nominal tax base, and
there are pros and cons of both real and nominal targets. Real spending targets have been
emphasized for ex ante planning and prioritization of scarce resources. The monitoring of
real targets is hampered by the uncertainties associated with the national accounts deflator for
public consumption and hence with the estimated real spending growth. For ex post
evaluation, it is crucial to include nominal developments.
10.
Spending discipline has improved since the current government took office. For the
average of 2002 and 2003, nominal public consumption grew by 4 percent a year. According
to preliminary figures, real spending grew by 1½ percent per year on average but clearly
decelerated both in nominal and real terms from 2002 to 2003. As a consequence of the
previous spending overruns, agreed targets for 2004 imply real consumption growth of less
than ½ percent in 2004, as compared with the original target of 0.7 percent growth. User
payments are already substantial in large parts of the health sector, including for prescription
and non-prescription medicine, private hospitals, dental care, eye care and more. The
government is committed to the general principle of equal and free access to public hospital
treatment. Moreover, performance-enhancing mechanisms will be strengthened. This
includes tying budget allocations to hospitals more closely to their activity performance and
facilitating the public’s free choice of hospital.

-3-

11.
With relatively tight spending targets in place, the government is taking steps to get
better value for money in the provision of public services. The government favors
outsourcing and plans to extend citizens’ “free choice” between private and public providers
of services, including in the fields of child care, elderly care and more. The division of tasks
between local, regional and central governments is being reformed, and larger local and
regional units created. Larger units will offer better market opportunities for private firms to
compete in the provision of public services and is expected to strengthen the quality of
services provided.
Structural reforms
12.
The medium-term policy framework requires structural reforms, in addition to those
already implemented, that can raise structural employment by almost 2 percent by 2010. As
staff note, efforts at increasing labor supply are focused on groups with relatively low
participation rates: the young, older workers, and immigrants. Further steps will be taken in
these areas. Staff points out that a reduction in the incentives for early retirement would be an
important, if politically very sensitive step. The government has established the Welfare
Commission in order to promote a wide-ranging public debate of policy challenges and
options, and to propose concrete initiatives to increase labor supply. The strategies for
employment and productivity are consistent with the Lisbon strategy and with the EU Broad
Economic Policy Guideline recommendations to ensure an adequate labor supply in view of
ageing. Denmark already fulfills the Lisbon employment objectives.
13.
Staff suggests there be further scope to consider changes in tax and labor
compensation structures to increase incentives to supply labor or invest in human capital.
Efforts to reduce the top marginal tax rate should be pursued, and removing the nominal tax
freeze on some components of property taxes could provide the space to do so. Increasing
competition in goods markets is seen as a necessary complement to the efforts to increase
labor supply.
14.
The Danish authorities stress that the tax freeze in its current form is simple, widely
understood, and credible. The freeze is a strong commitment device, which is key in arresting
and reversing the longstanding upward trend in the tax burden in Denmark.
15.
The recent reduction of income taxes has been introduced to stimulate labor supply.
The focus on lower marginal tax rates in the middle-income range and the introduction of an
earned income tax credit reflect concerns for income distribution and the desire for greater
labor participation for individuals with low or moderate earnings potential.
16.
The wage distribution is more equal in Denmark than in most other countries, but
employment outcomes suggest that this reflects a more equal skill distribution rather than
market imperfections. There is no legislated minimum wage in Denmark and under normal
conditions the government plays no direct role in wage setting, except in its role as public
employer. Relatively high social benefits can set a floor to reservation wages, but
unemployment benefits are conditional on strict availability-for-work requirements and, after

-4-

6 or 12 months of unemployment, mandatory participation in active labor market programs.
Unemployment is not particularly concentrated among low-skilled workers, compared to
other countries. Moreover, the relative employment opportunities for low-skilled workers
have not deteriorated over recent decades, in contrast to several other EU countries. This
reflects increasing average educational attainment and labor market reforms that have made it
impossible to receive passive benefits for extended periods. The government is conscious of
the need to further strengthen education and training achievements, in particular in
engineering and science majors. Funds are being set aside to strengthen science teaching
already in primary schools.
17.
Product market reforms are an essential complement to labor market reforms, as
highlighted also by staff’s competent selected issues paper. Efforts will be continued in the
areas noted in the staff report and within the framework of the government’s growth strategy.
Financial sector issues
18.
Danish banks have continued to present sound earnings with substantial profits. The
overall assessment is that resilience remains unchanged for the Nordic banking groups, while
large capital gains and robust income performance have strengthened the resilience of the
Danish banking institutions significantly compared to 2002. The pressure on the pension
companies has subsided as a result of the development in asset prices. Furthermore, the risks
related to liabilities linked to interest guarantees have to a high degree been hedged through
various financial instruments. The households' debt as a ratio to disposable income is still
increasing, but the ability to meet payments has improved owing to the low level of interest
rates. Households in Denmark have a higher level of debt in relation to disposable income
than in the other Nordic countries, but on the other hand housing wealth as a ratio of income
is higher in Denmark. While the share of adjustable rate mortgages have increased
significantly, almost 60 percent of mortgage loans are still fixed-rate, and the introduction of
loans free of repayment for up to 10 years (which may be rolled over) provide households
with increased financial flexibility in the face of temporary income shocks, e.g.
unemployment spells. The Danish authorities look forward to the FSAP planned to take place
in the context of the next Article IV consultation cycle.
Other issues
19.
In the context of EU membership, Denmark supports further trade liberalization in the
Doha round and market-oriented reform of the EU’s common agricultural policy.
20.
Since 1978, Denmark has consistently provided development assistance of more than
0.7 percent of gross national income, among the highest of any country as noted by staff.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Denmark
On August 2, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Denmark.1
Background
Denmark enjoyed a period of rapid economic growth over most of the 1990s. The fixed
exchange rate regime provided an anchor for inflation expectations and underpinned an
economic policy directed toward ensuring sound macroeconomic fundamentals. Labor market
reforms led to a sustained increase in structural employment, while careful fiscal policy in the
context of a clear medium-term sustainability strategy delivered budget surpluses and a steady
decline in government debt as a share of GDP. In addition, overall national savings contributed
to persistent current account surpluses and a decline in net foreign liabilities.
In 2001, growth started to slow, reflecting domestic initiatives to cool overheating and the
downturn in the global economy. By end 2003, output was about one percent below potential,
and unemployment had risen somewhat to 6½ percent. In early 2004, conditions appear to be in
place for a return to healthy growth: supportive monetary and fiscal policy; healthy domestic
balance sheets; strengthening and broadening in the global recovery; and leading indicators
suggesting that the pickup in the domestic economy witnessed in late 2003 continues to gain

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2momentum. IMF staff forecast growth to be close to 2 percent in 2004, increasing to 2½ percent
in 2005.
Denmark’s fixed exchange rate regime continues to serve the country well. Inflation has been
low and stable and spreads against euro area interest rates are negligible. Currently, inflation in
Denmark is below that in the euro area and is projected to remain subdued. Although the impact
of the reduction in indirect taxes and euro appreciation are temporary, capacity constraints are
unlikely to be reached until the end of 2005.
Fiscal policy in Denmark is based on a medium-term strategy to accommodate the pressures
from an aging population while maintaining the welfare state without increasing taxes.
The strategy calls for fiscal surpluses between 1½ and 2½ percent of GDP, annual growth in
public consumption being constrained to 0.5 percent, and a 2 percent increase in structural
employment by 2010. Denmark is relatively better prepared to deal with the costs of aging than
many other countries--members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD)--but the authorities recognize that additional resolve will be needed to
assure the realization of the employment and expenditure targets
Labor market policy is currently focused on increasing the participation rates of both the young
and the elderly, and first- and second-generation immigrants. Additionally, the authorities
continue to peruse structural reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness in goods markets.
To constrain public consumption expenditure, a tax freeze has been implemented with legally
binding rules for compliance and the authorities stand ready to implement additional measures if
expenditure slippages emerge.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Danish authorities for their record of sustained structural
reform and strong fiscal policy, grounded in a medium-term framework, that has led to fiscal
surpluses and a significant reduction in public debt. As a result, the Danish economy has
weathered the recent global slowdown and is now well placed to benefit from the global
recovery. Several Directors underscored that the Danish experience in many areas offers useful
lessons for other countries and represents a good example that it is possible to combine a
strong welfare state with high employment and growth. While acknowledging that Denmark has
already made considerable progress in preparing for the medium-term challenges of population
aging, Directors encouraged further efforts at containing public expenditure and increasing
employment toward this goal.
Directors welcomed the indications that economic activity is rebounding. With external
conditions improving, and appropriately supportive monetary and fiscal policies in place,
Directors saw good prospects for economic recovery in 2004 and for it to gather strength in
2005. The main risks to this outlook stem from the possibility that the recovery in key trading
partners might turn out slower than expected, or that growth in private consumption may flag if
the pickup in employment is delayed. Some Directors also pointed to the potential impact on

-3demand of future interest rate increases. Risks to the outlook from a sharp correction in housing
prices, which have risen gradually over a long period, appear to be well contained.
Directors generally agreed that Denmark’s recent fiscal stimulus package was well designed to
provide support for the upturn, without undermining medium-term fiscal objectives, while also
addressing some longer term structural issues. They cautioned, however, that further fiscal
stimulus should be kept as an exceptional response, to avoid jeopardizing the credibility of the
medium-term targets.
Directors agreed that Denmark’s fixed exchange rate has been a central pillar of the
macroeconomic stability strategy, noting that the low spreads in interest rates vis-à-vis the euro
area attest to the credibility of the peg. It has served the country well by both anchoring
expectations, and ensuring that fiscal policy is focused on medium-term objectives.
Directors judged the overall competitiveness of the Danish economy to be healthy.
However, the risks to competitiveness could increase should labor costs outstrip productivity
growth, in a context of further euro appreciation, and accordingly Directors considered that
efforts to further improve the flexibility of labor markets would be helpful. Even though inflation is
likely to remain subdued, Directors stressed that wage moderation will remain key to forestall
pressures for the real exchange rate to appreciate.
Directors commended Denmark’s sustained implementation of a strong medium-term strategy
to deal with the fiscal costs of an aging population. They agreed that efforts to control public
expenditure growth and increase employment will remain key pillars of the strategy going
forward. While acknowledging the helpful role being played by the 2002 tax freeze and the
legally binding rules on counties to comply with budget targets, Directors considered that further
action to control public consumption growth may very well be required. Many Directors saw
scope for a wider application of user fees to allocate public services more efficiently and contain
demand pressures. Some Directors also encouraged the authorities to consider specifying
spending targets in nominal terms.
Directors commended the strong performance of the Danish labor market—with employment
and labor market participation rates that are high by international standards, notwithstanding the
maintenance of a generous welfare system. To alleviate labor supply constraints and lower the
structural unemployment rate further, they encouraged the authorities to prepare additional
reforms, in particular to reduce incentives for early retirement. In this context, they welcomed
the launch of the Welfare Commission to consider the sustainability of the Danish welfare state
and outline possible reform options.
Directors welcomed the recent reduction in labor income tax rates. With Denmark’s marginal
labor income tax rates among the highest in OECD countries, they encouraged the authorities
to consider further changes in tax and labor compensation structures that would increase
incentives to work. The importance of greater wage dispersion, and better integration of
immigrant labor was also highlighted in this context. Directors concurred on the complementary
role of product market reforms with labor market reforms. They emphasized that the benefits of
labor and product market reform would be greater if accompanied by wider EU reforms.

-4Directors noted that the Danish financial system has remained resilient despite the three-year
slowdown. Directors commended the authorities’ sound supervisory framework, and their
continued efforts to strengthen it further, particularly in the area of insurance companies and
pension funds. They welcomed steps to strengthen cross-border cooperation, in view of
increasing cross-border conglomeration and mergers. Directors also welcomed the authorities’
planned participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and their efforts to further
strengthen the framework for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism.
Directors commended Denmark’s outstanding record in extending official development
assistance to developing countries, and looked forward to continued exemplary performance in
this area. They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to trade liberalization.
