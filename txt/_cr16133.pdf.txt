IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Grenada and Fourth Review
Under the Extend Credit Facility with Grenada and Approves US$2.8 Million
Disbursement
On May 18, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Grenada and the fourth review of Grenada’s performance under a
program supported by a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The
completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 2 million (about
US$2.8 million), bringing total resources made available to Grenada under the ECF arrangement
to the equivalent of SDR 10.04 million (about US$14.1 million).
The Grenadian authorities continue to deliver a strong track record of program implementation
and results. All performance criteria for end-December 2015 were met and most structural
benchmarks for the fourth review were met on time or with minor delays, with timely corrective
actions taken for two unmet benchmarks.
Growth prospects and fiscal sustainability are improving as the authorities’ home grown
adjustment program enters its third year. Real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 4.6 percent
in 2015, with strong growth in agriculture and tourism, as well as a rebound in construction.
Growth is projected to moderate to 3 percent in 2016. The fiscal performance turned Grenada’s
primary balance from deficit to surplus for the first time in a decade and together with debt
restructuring agreements reached with both external and domestic creditors, Grenada is making
progress on fiscal and debt sustainability. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 107 percent in
2013 to 94 percent in 2015 and is projected to continue its downward path going forward.
The 2016 budget aims to complete the programmed fiscal adjustment in support of meeting
medium term debt targets, while focusing on structural reforms to promote economic growth and
lower unemployment.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
Since the onset of the program, there has been progress with structural fiscal reforms, including
strengthened tax administration, improved public finance management, an overhaul of the tax
incentives regime, and a new rules-based fiscal policy framework, which now need to be made
fully effective. The authorities are working to reform management of the public sector wage bill
to ensure sustainable personnel expenditure. In addition, reforms to improve the investment and
business climate and modernize the labor market are also proposed to unlock growth potential
and lower unemployment.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Grenada, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Grenada’s performance under its Fund-supported home-grown program remains satisfactory.
The government is on track to complete the programmed fiscal adjustment and its structural
reform agenda. The initial dividends from the program are emerging, as economic activity has
picked up and the external position strengthened. The government’s economic strategy going
forward should focus on promoting broad-based growth and lowering unemployment while
maintaining fiscal discipline in the context of its strengthened fiscal policy framework.
“Grenada has made significant progress toward restoring debt sustainability, supported by budget
discipline and steps toward a comprehensive debt restructuring. As wage and spending pressures
are rising, the program is at an important juncture and continued policy resolve is essential to
secure lasting success and to safeguard the credibility of the new rules-based policy framework.
“The Grenadian authorities have pushed through important legislative reforms aimed at locking
in fiscal discipline over the long term. Grenada has made significant progress improving public
finance management, strengthening the fiscal policy framework, and overhauling the tax
incentive regime. The next step is to implement the new legislations, with high priority on
reforms to strengthen management of the public wage bill, tax administration, and public debt
management.
“To improve Grenada’s competitiveness and growth potential, priorities should focus on
removing impediments to private sector activity and strengthening labor market skills and
mobility. To protect the most vulnerable, the government has safeguarded total social spending,
but needs to follow through on its stated goals of improving the targeting and effectiveness of
this spending.
“Financial stability has improved, but continued efforts to strengthen the banking system are
critical to enabling it to contribute more effectively to private sector growth. A proactive
approach should be taken to address remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector.”

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic recovery and the significant improvements
in fiscal and external balances and debt reduction. Directors commended the authorities for
steadfast implementation of their home-grown program, notably the successful fiscal
consolidation. They stressed, however, that remaining challenges call for continued policy
resolve in order to achieve the objectives of restoring debt sustainability, boosting medium-term
growth prospects, and strengthening financial stability.
Directors noted that downside risks to the outlook persist, and called for prioritizing structural
reforms to promote growth and job creation. In particular, they encouraged the authorities to
implement reforms to remove impediments to private sector activity, and improve labor market
skills, matching and mobility. They supported a proactive approach to focus training on skills
needed by the market, and at the same time improve productivity and reduce structural
unemployment.
Directors commended the authorities for the fiscal adjustment achieved thus far. In particular,
they welcomed the primary surplus achieved in 2015 through important progress on tax policy
and administration reforms and expenditure rationalization. Directors encouraged the authorities
to safeguard this progress with strict budget execution and adherence to the new rules-based
fiscal framework, while maintaining growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ steadfast implementation of their ambitious legislative
reform agenda. They welcomed the impressive progress to overhaul the fiscal framework, reform
the tax incentive regime, strengthen tax administration, and improve the monitoring and
accountability of parastatal entities. Going forward, priority should be given to implementation
of these reforms. Directors stressed that additional efforts are needed to strengthen public debt
management and management of the public sector wage bill, as well to improve tax
administration.
Directors welcomed the progress made to implement the country’s new growth and poverty
reduction strategy. They underscored that close integration with the budget is needed to
maximize the impact on competitiveness and growth. Directors urged the authorities to take steps
to improve the targeting of the social safety net, as anticipated under the program, to protect the
most vulnerable during fiscal adjustment and to ensure a lasting success of the program.
Implementation of the Support for Education, Employment and Development (SEED) was
encouraged.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen financial stability. They
encouraged measures to address remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system while
minimizing fiscal costs. Directors shared the view that a stronger banking system would
contribute more effectively to private sector investment and growth. They called for continued
efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector, as well as to
enhance the AML/CFT framework.
Directors acknowledged the progress made to restore debt sustainability under the
ECF-supported program and underscored the need to complete the comprehensive debt
restructuring. They stressed the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline over the medium
term with the aim of meeting long-term debt reduction goals.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION, FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF
NON-OBSERVANCE OF A PERFORMANCE CRITERION,
REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF A PERFORMANCE
CRITERION, AND FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Extended Credit Facility Arrangement. The arrangement was approved on June 26,
2014 and the third review completed on November 25, 2015. Disbursements equivalent
to SDR 8.04 million (about US$11.5 million) have been made to Grenada so far under the
arrangement and the equivalent of SDR 2 million (about US$2.9 million) will be made
available upon Executive Board completion of the fourth review.
Debt Restructuring. Grenada’s comprehensive public debt restructuring is nearing
completion. The debt exchange with Grenada’s largest private creditor group was
implemented and an agreement reached with Paris Club creditors. The authorities have
also made important progress restructuring domestic debt.
Program Performance. Overall program implementation remains satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria for the fourth review were met. Most structural
benchmarks for the Fourth Review were met on time or with minor delays, with actions
being taken already to correct the two unmet benchmarks. The authorities advanced
reforms to strengthen tax administration, improve public finance management, and
overhaul the tax incentives regime.
Fourth Review. Discussions focused on completing the programmed fiscal consolidation,
finalizing reforms to Grenada’s fiscal policy framework, and improving competitiveness
and growth prospects. Staff proposes to refine the structural benchmark on public sector
modernization to focus specifically on public wage bill management, and to rephase the
benchmark to allow the authorities adequate time to consider recommendations from
upcoming technical assistance.
Article IV Consultation. Discussions focused on updating the medium term policy
framework around the following priorities: (i) adherence to the new fiscal framework and
medium term debt anchor, (ii) policies to deliver broader based growth, including
through financial sector strengthening, and (iii) ways to lower structural unemployment.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
The strong economic growth experienced in 2015 is expected to moderate. Real
GDP is estimated to have expanded by 4.6 percent (market prices) in 2015 due to continued
expansion in agricultural, tourism, and tourism-related construction. Growth is expected to
moderate to 3 percent in 2016 as agriculture output approaches capacity and tourist arrivals
decelerate. Construction activity is projected to remain vigorous as several large tourism projects
get underway.

Unemployment remains elevated. The unemployment rate has fluctuated around 30
percent since 2013, with unemployment particularly high among the youth and first time job
seekers, suggesting potential skills mismatch and other rigidities that prevent adjustment. Recent
growth has helped reduce long term unemployment, but has not been particularly job-rich
because of spare capacity in the tourism sector and, to some degree, the entry of informal
agriculture producers into the formal sector. Persistently high unemployment has led to large
income gaps, with inequality in Grenada above the Caribbean average (Figure 1).
3.
Deflation persisted for the third
consecutive year, though core inflation
turned positive. Owing to low international
oil prices, headline CPI declined by 1.3
percent (y/y) in 2015 and is expected to fall
by 0.9 percent in 2016. Core CPI (excluding
fuel and food), however, turned positive (0.3
percent) in 2015 as domestic demand
recovered.

2013.1 Over the medium term, the current account deficit is forecast to remain around 15 percent
of GDP. The deficit has remained adequately financed by tourism-related FDI and other private
capital inflows, which more than offset banking sector outflows. As a result, foreign reserves rose
to 5.7 months of imports in 2015.

Concerns about external competitiveness remain on the radar, but signs are mixed.
Tourism growth has been strong, with stay-over tourists rising by 5.6 percent in 2015. Grenada’s
market share is gradually recovering to pre-2005 hurricane levels, although it still lags behind
ECCU peers. Grenada’s terms of trade have improved notably due to recent falls in oil prices
given the country’s high dependence on imported commodities. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) has appreciated by 3.6 percent since mid-2014 owing to the strengthening U.S. dollar,
which was partly offset by deflation in Grenada. Measured against tourism-markets only, the
REER has appreciated by 5.8 percent over the same period. In addition, Grenada dropped from
130th to 135th in 2016 in the World Bank Doing Business index.

The loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 69 percent to 61 percent and banks’ liquidity rose
further.
7.
In contrast, Grenada’s credit unions expanded credit at a rapid pace. Credit unions
saw a steady increase in their deposit base and assets. Faced by increasing interest expenses,
credit unions expanded their lending portfolios as total loans grew by 18 percent in 2015
following a 9 percent expansion in 2014. As a result, aggregate lending to the private sector
increased slightly in 2015, for the first time

vulnerabilities remain. Profitability improved in 2015 as the lower deposit rate significantly
reduced banks’ interest expense, but remains weak with a return on assets of 1.5 percent in 2015.
The NPLs-to-loans ratio declined to the lowest level since 2011 at end-2015, but remains
elevated at 10 percent. The reported capital adequacy ratio declined from 13 percent in 2014 to
12.2 percent in 2015, still well above the regulatory requirement of 8 percent.
9.
External debt remains in distress but prospects for a restoration of ‘sustainability’
are much improved. Grenada’s debt restructuring is nearing completion (See DSA).
Restructuring agreements have been reached with creditors representing about 64 percent of
total debt under restructuring negotiations and valued at 34 percent of GDP. Since November,
most of Grenada’s domestic debt to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) was restructured,

end-2017 and to below 60 percent by 2020.

The baseline outlook sees growth converging at potential and inflation stabilizing.
Robust growth over 2013-15 has helped close the output gap, which had widened significantly
during the global crisis. Going forward, growth is expected to gradually converge toward
potential, estimated at about 2.7 percent.3 This has risen slightly (from 2.5 percent) because the
production capacity of the economy is expected to increase as Grenada gradually attracts new
investment, including related to the CBI program, confidence rises, and as the labor force
expands further. Consistent with the recovery, CPI inflation is expected to rise gradually to about
2 percent over the medium term, in line with imported inflation.
11.
Risks to the outlook remain balanced (Annex I). Upside risks to the outlook are posed
by the potential for a larger demand response to the oil price decline, stronger than anticipated
tourism inflows, and higher than expected proceeds from the CBI program. Downside risks arise
from a stronger impact from fiscal consolidation on growth, reputational and fiscal risks
stemming from a dispute between the government and a major hotel property, natural disasters,
a possible Zika virus outbreak, and externally, a weaker global recovery, the appreciation of the

The potential growth rate is estimated with a Cobb-Douglas production function and suggests that productivity
growth has been negative (estimated at -0.6 percent per year on average) in Grenada during the past decade, in
line with the findings from WP/12/235, despite recent improvements during the recovery. Staff has assumed zero
productivity growth over the medium term.

Authorities’ Views. The authorities share staff’s views on the outlook and risks, but are
more optimistic about growth prospects for 2016 based on the potential impact of several
tourism-related construction projects. They agreed on the importance of finalizing the debt
restructuring and indicated that all negotiations are expected to conclude in 2016.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
Program performance remains satisfactory. The government met all quantitative performance
criteria for the fourth review and made progress on the structural reform agenda.

A. Quantitative Performance Criteria
13.
The fiscal position continues to
improve. For the first time in a decade, Grenada
achieved a primary surplus in 2015 (2.2 percent
of GDP), a significant turnaround from the deficit
of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2013. The primary
balance exceeded the adjusted Quantitative
Performance Criterion (QPC) by a significant
margin (0.7 percent of GDP) due to continued
expenditure restraint and higher-than-projected
revenues. Stronger growth and a bigger yield
from tax measures helped boost revenues. All
end-2015 and continuous QPCs were met. This
over performance was achieved even as the
authorities utilized some of the fiscal space
provided by the strong revenue growth to raise
capital spending (allowed under the program) to
support growth. Grenada entered the final year
of its program with over 80 percent of the total
programmed consolidation completed.
14.
All budget expenditure arrears were
cleared by end-2015. This was an important
condition under the program and should help
restore liquidity and confidence in the economy.
Debt restructuring agreements have regularized
about 78 percent of external debt arrears

were accumulated, in line with the QPC. Remaining external arrears are primarily to non-Paris

While budget expenditure arrears at end-2015 were cleared, the ceiling for endJune 2015 was not observed. During restructuring negotiations with the NIS in late 2015, the
government became aware of previously unrecorded contribution arrears amounting to EC$14.5

The majority of creditors have not come forward; the excess allowance of new debt issued for these holdouts
will be cancelled before the first coupon payment (May 2016) on the U.S. dollar 2030 bond. The authorities are
also exploring the option of cancelling the entire allowance and pursuing a cash settlement with these creditors.

million, or 0.6 percent of GDP. These arrears were folded into the restructuring, enabling the
government to meet the December 2015 QPC.5 However, given the higher stock of budget
expenditure arrears that would have existed in June had the additional contribution arrears to the
NIS been known, the program ceiling on budget expenditure arrears for end-June 2015 would
not have been observed by a small margin (EC$10.5 million, or 0.4 percent of 2015 GDP). Staff
recommends granting a waiver for this deviation because it was minor and because the
government accomplished the program objective of clearing all arrears by end-2015. The
assessment of performance under other previous test dates was unaffected because central
government expenditure arrears remained below the program ceilings, despite the higher stock.

Spending under the ‘Support for Education, Employment and Development’ (SEED)
program was below the indicative target (floor) for end-2015. Staff had understood that the
new beneficiary information system developed under Grenada’s World Bank-supported program
would be fully operational in late 2015, but the transition has taken longer than expected due to
technical and administrative capacity constraints. Consequently, the approval of new
beneficiaries has been constrained, and spending under the target fell short by EC$1.6 million, or
0.06 percent of GDP. The SEED program is now closed to new entrants until the transition is
complete, expected in the first half of 2016. The goal of SEED reform under the World Bank

B. Structural Reforms
18.

Structural reforms are advancing:



Tax administration: The new Tax Administration Act was approved by Parliament in
February 2016 (November 2015 structural benchmark) and the restructuring of the Inland
Revenue Department (IRD) is now complete, with the Large and Medium (LMTU) and Small
Taxpayers Service Units operational by mid-January 2016 (end-2015 structural benchmark).
To maximize the revenue yield from these efforts, the Act should be brought into force
expeditiously and IRD provided with sufficient resources to fulfill its mandate.



Tax incentive regime: The reform of the tax incentive regime to make it rule-based,
predictable and transparent should be finalized in early May 2016. Relative to the initial
legislative reforms approved in 2015, additional amendments were made to the individual
acts primarily to codify incentives for qualifying investments in priority sectors, which are
currently provided through Cabinet discretion. With approval from CARICOM partners,
amendments to the list of conditional duty exemptions to remove discretion were also
finalized. Regulations under the Investment Act of 2014 were also completed. With the new
regime in place, bringing it into full force is a prior action for completion of the fourth
review. While the transition to the new regime is expected to be broadly revenue neutral, the
authorities have committed to taking immediate action should there be revenue losses (¶30,
MEFP ¶10).



Public finance management (PFM): The authorities undertook to prepare the 2016 budget
under the new Chart of Accounts (CoA) classification (end-2015 structural benchmark).
However, several recurrent spending items and some wage spending related to capital
projects were still recorded incorrectly under the capital budget. Consequently, the end-2015
structural benchmark was not met. However, all monthly budget accounting and reporting in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GRENADA

2016 has been converted to the new CoA and, consequently, staff does not propose to
rephase the structural benchmark. To support the proper classification of spending under the
new CoA, further progress is needed to correctly record recurrent components of capital
projects into their proper classification under the new CoA (MEFP¶10). To that end, CARTAC
has agreed to provide focused TA in this area this year.

20.
While projected to meet the nominal QPC, the primary surplus could fall below the
3.5 percent of GDP target set out in Grenada’s FRA. This target is required until public debt is
reduced to 55 percent of GDP. The deviation is driven by expenditures related to the
restructuring of two SOEs, which are accommodated under the ECF-supported program by an
adjustor on the floor of the primary surplus for this purpose ((TMU¶5). While projected to meet
the 2016 nominal QPC on the primary surplus (after adjustors), staff assess that these
expenditures could put at risk the government’s primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP
under the FRA. Staff forecast the primary surplus to meet the FRA target of 3.5 percent of GDP in
2017 but urged the government to make additional efforts as needed in 2016 to deliver a surplus
that complies with the FRA target, to safeguard the credibility of the rules-based fiscal policy
framework.
21.
The main downside fiscal risk for 2016 could be overly-ambitious capital spending,
but safeguards have been put in place. The budget assumes a significant scaling up of CBI
program funds and a commensurate increase in grant inflows from the National Transformation
6

The nominal program target for the primary surplus, after program adjustors are applied, is equivalent to 3.1
percent of GDP (see ¶ 21).

Fund (NTF) to finance above-program capital spending (3 percent of GDP) on infrastructure and
social projects. Some of the planned capital spending is on recurrent projects and could not be
easily scaled back in the event of a shortfall in grant financing. As a result, staff concluded that
the December structural benchmark for “approval of a budget consistent with program
commitments” was not met. However, the authorities have put in place corrective measures to
align the budget with program commitments (MEFP¶4), including by revising capital budget
allocations (TMU¶20), and are closely monitoring execution. They also reduced their capital
budget allocation to reflect lower- than-expected grants from the Petrocaribe arrangement,
which are projected to decline to 0.1 percent of GDP from 0.4 percent in 2014.7

22.
Rising wage pressures also present a downside risk. The budget made additional
provisions for wage expenditures to address staff shortages in health care and strengthen
revenue administration. While relatively small (0.2 percent of GDP), these provisions would push
the wage bill slightly over the ECF monitoring target, although they would still be
accommodated within the QPC on primary spending and also be under the ceiling on wage
expenditure under the government’s FRA (9 percent of GDP). At the same time, public wage
negotiations have commenced and unions are demanding payment of automatic grade
increments for the 2014-16 period (MEFP ¶7). Staff projections for wages include cautious
assumptions regarding the risk of payment of increments. While this raises the staff projection
further above the monitoring target, total primary spending is still projected under the QPC
ceiling. To ensure sustainability of the public sector wage bill over the medium-term, the
authorities have committed (structural benchmark) to implement measures to strengthen
management of the public sector wage bill (¶25, MEFP¶11).
23.
Authorities’ views: The authorities reasserted their commitment to the contingent fiscal
measures outlined in the MEFPs from 2014 (see MEFP¶8). They concurred with staff about the
importance of complying with the parameters of the FRA, and noted that under their own

Under Grenada’s Petrocaribe arrangement, a portion of the fuel import bill is converted into a concessional loan
for social projects (Country report No. 14/196, Annex VI). This share depends on international oil prices; the
concessional financing portion has fallen from 60 percent to 30 percent since 2014.

projections, they continue to target a 2016 primary surplus of 3.5 percent. They indicated that
they would monitor budget outcomes closely. The government is committed to executing the
capital budget in line with program commitments. With respect to wages, the government had
committed in 2014 not to pay any wage increase or increments during the program, but
discovered subsequently they had a contractual obligation to some public sector employees to
pay increments. On this issue, they agreed with staff on the need to overhaul civil service
compensation practices to address rigidities and deficiencies (¶25).

B. Structural Reforms to Support Fiscal Sustainability and Growth
24.
The top priority in 2016 is to strengthen management of the public sector wage
bill. During the first phase of the program, direct controls on nominal wages and attrition
successfully contained the wage bill, but now must be replaced with more sustainable measures.8
Moreover, public sector wages have important impact on private sector wages in small states. In
response, the authorities have committed to develop a rational mechanism to manage the wage
bill, including pay and grading reform, compensation guidelines, and systematic indicators to
inform regular wage negotiations (MEFP¶7, 11). The authorities will receive TA from IMF Fiscal
Affairs Department to conduct a review of existing policies, which is tentatively scheduled for
May 2016. Approval of a “focused strategy to manage the public sector wage bill”, informed by
the TA recommendations, is proposed as a revised and rephased structural benchmark for endSeptember 2016. As a complement, the government has begun consultations on public sector
pension reform as part of addressing the overall cost of the civil service and of ensuring the
sustainability of the NIS.9
25.
Finalizing and implementing Grenada’s new fiscal policy framework remains a
priority for 2016. The exhaustive legislative reforms to strengthen the framework are nearing
completion (Table 11), but signing into force the tax incentive regime (prior action) and the tax
administration act remain outstanding. The regulations for the public debt management act need
to be finalized and the act and regulations brought into force―important given weaknesses
noted in debt management.
26.
Labor laws and investment promotion are important elements of pro-growth
reforms this year. In this respect, the authorities have drafted a new Act for the Grenada
Investment Development Corporation (GIDC) and revised Labor Code. The new acts will come
into effect following parliamentary approval, which are currently on track to meet the structural
benchmarks for end-June 2016 (MEFP¶15) and end-August 2016 (MEFP¶17), respectively. These
reforms should strengthen investment processes and prospects, improve labor relations, and
motivate job search, key ingredients for raising potential growth and lowering unemployment.

C. Program Design and Financing
27.
No changes are proposed to the QPCs (MEFP Table 1). The authorities agreed to
lower the monitoring target ceiling on public employment for both end-June and end-December
2016―more ambitious than agreed earlier―to maintain employment at or below the end-2015
level. As noted, staff proposes to revise the structural benchmark on public sector modernization
to focus it specifically on the management of the public sector wage bill, and to rephase it to
provide the authorities adequate time to consider recommendations from the FAD TA (MEFP
Table 2). Consultations with TA experts will inform the government’s position in ongoing
negotiations with unions in 2016.
28.
Modifications to the definition of the continuous QPC ceiling on the contracting of
non-concessional external debt by central government are proposed. Previously, all
borrowing from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the World Bank (WB) was excluded
from the zero ceiling. However, to comply with the Fund’s new policy on Public Debt Limits,
modifications are proposed to the QPC in the TMU (¶10) to include borrowing from the CDB and
WB in the definition but with associated adjustors for CDB and WB borrowing for set amounts
and purposes. The ceiling and adjustors state the specific nature of the development loans
expected to be contracted and set a cap on the borrowing permitted under the adjustor for the
QPC ceiling.10 The projected borrowing from these institutions (US$30 million for the CDB and
WB, respectively) is expected to occur primarily under their respective Development Policy Loans
(DPL), regional partnership strategies, and project loans. These programs/projects aim to support
Grenada’s national development strategy with a focus on strengthening growth, competitiveness
and resilience, including improving the investment climate, strengthening tourism and linkages
to agribusiness, building resilience to natural disasters with regulatory and physical planning
reforms, and improving the targeting of social programs (see Informational Annex). The latter has
been synchronized with conditionality under the ECF arrangement, where a feature of the Bank’s
policy loan is related to the identification and registration of eligible recipients for social
assistance to ensure that social spending is allocated to those most in need. As previously
agreed, debt instruments issued as part of the restructuring continue to be excluded from the
QPC ceiling as, consistent with the Public Debt Limits policy, these borrowings are for debt
management operations to improve the overall profile of public debt.
29.
Financing assurances are in place for the fourth review. The completion of several
debt restructuring agreements (¶9), along with the continued improvement in the
macroeconomic outlook, have narrowed financing needs in the baseline scenario. The remaining
financing gaps are expected to close over the program period with exceptional financing
expected from International Financial Institutions (Tables 3 and 6). The authorities remain in
arrears to three official bilateral creditors (Algeria, Libya, and Trinidad and Tobago) pending
agreement on debt restructuring with these creditors. Staff is of the view that, given the relative

financial contribution of these bilateral creditors to the ECF-supported program, the agreement
reached with Grenada’s Paris Club creditors in November 2015 is not adequately representative
under the Fund’s policy on the non-toleration of arrears to official bilateral creditors.11 Grenada
continues to engage in good faith discussions with its remaining official bilateral creditors to
whom it remains in arrears and these creditors have indicated that they consent to the
completion of the review. 12

ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
Since the last Article IV consultation in June 2014, Grenada has made major strides toward
restoring fiscal and external sustainability. Economic activity has picked up, debt has been reduced,
and the external position has strengthened. The government has also pushed through important
legislative reforms to build a fiscal framework that will lock-in fiscal discipline over the long term.

A. Supporting Fiscal Sustainability over the Medium-Term
30.
Grenada is on the road to fiscal and debt sustainability, but has a ways to go. While
the fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring have contributed to a significant reduction in public
debt since 2013, debt remains elevated and well above the regional average. The policy resolve
and commitment demonstrated so far will need to continue to entrench lasting fiscal and debt
sustainability. Tax policy changes have supported an increase in revenues by over 3 percent of
GDP since 2013. However, revenues as a share of output remain lower than in peer countries
(figure) and there is scope to broaden the tax base further.
31.
The new fiscal policy framework has established the foundation needed to promote
fiscal discipline over the medium-term. Grenada is the first independent ECCU country and
second CARICOM country to put in place fiscal rules. The debt ceiling of 55 percent of GDP is
more ambitious than the ECCU target of 60 percent by 2030 and the framework has broad
coverage over general government which will help reduce fiscal risks emanating from state
enterprises. The challenge will be to follow through―full implementation of the fiscal policy
framework to ensure its effectiveness as the anchor for policy-making.
32.
Revenue measures have supported fiscal adjustment, but more could be done to
broaden the tax base and support growth. The government lowered the income threshold for
the personal income tax (PIT) and reduced exemptions under the VAT and customs duties. To
further widen the tax base and promote equity, the PIT income threshold remains relatively high
and could be lowered further, and the tax base broadened to include investment income.
Completion of the tax incentive reform also remains critical to ensuring the integrity of the tax

Box 1. Implementation of the 2014 Article IV Consultation Recommendations
Recommendations:
1. Strengthen medium term growth and competitiveness by improving the investment environment, lowering
energy costs, liberalizing agriculture markets, and containing wage growth.
2. Restore stability and debt sustainability with ambitious fiscal adjustment and comprehensive debt
restructuring. Key elements comprise lowering controlling the wage bill, broadening the tax base.
3. Overhaul the fiscal policy framework to ensure sustainability, including with a fiscal responsibility law, tax
reform, stronger public finance management, and reform of state owned enterprises.
4. Safeguard social protection for the most vulnerable during fiscal adjustment, and improve the targeting of
social spending toward those most in need.
5. Strengthen the banking system with improved regulation and supervision, including with an asset quality
review of Grenada’s banks; improve regulation and oversight of non bank financial sector.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Outcome:
In the areas of growth, fiscal adjustment, debt restructuring, re-design of the fiscal policy framework, tax reform,
and financial sector reform, over the past two years the government has implemented or is implementing Fund
recommendations. The areas where progress is underway but not complete include improving tax administration
and debt management, and finalizing regulatory reform in the energy sector. While greater social spending has
occurred, the government has not fully implemented an improved system to target social assistance to the most
vulnerable. While the public wage bill has been contained with a wage freeze and attrition, there has been little or
no progress to reform the public sector. The government has committed to a more focused approach in 2016 to
correct this shortcoming.

base. The government introduced an alternative minimum tax regime for small businesses and,
once the tax incentive reform is brought into force, will accelerate investment allowances and
introduce a deduction on business training costs to encourage investment. The corporate income
tax base could be broadened by restricting deductions and taxing foreign-source interest, rents,
royalties, and fees. When fiscal space is available, the corporate income tax rate could be
lowered. Finally, the list of priority sectors under the tax incentive regime is too comprehensive
and could be streamlined to focus on key growth sectors.
33.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration will support improved fiscal
outcomes over the medium-term. With a strengthened legislative framework for tax
administration and the restructuring of the IRD complete, the authorities are focusing on
taxpayer compliance.13 In line with Fund TA advice, they are developing a Compliance Strategy
and working to strengthen compliance risk management within both IRD and Customs. To
support further improvements, IRD needs to update urgently its SIGTAS technology system and
both Customs and IRD need to make full use of the modern ASYCUDA World system. Both will
also need adequate resources and leadership to fulfill their mandates.
34.
Public finance management continues to improve (MEFP¶10). The preparation of the
2016 Budget was vastly improved relative to prior years―a direct consequence of the 2015 PFM
Act. The Budget was accompanied by a medium-term fiscal framework and an assessment of
performance for the previous fiscal year, included information summarizing the financial
condition of each SOE, and was consistent with the FRA. Moreover, assessments are now being
prepared on the impact of all policy proposals on fiscal and debt sustainability. The results of the
2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment noted the contribution
that strengthened PFM practices have made to improving fiscal outcomes and achieving
targets.14 Going forward, strengthening cash forecasting and commitment control remain
priorities.
35.
Grenada is leading the region on management and accountability of SOEs. CARTAC
experts report that Grenada’s strategy to strengthen the accountability and performance of SOEs
and their new oversight framework is the strongest in the region (Box 2). While the budget
included important financial information, there is room to improve the monitoring of SOE
financials and their compliance with the new reporting requirements.15 Importantly, resources
available within the Ministry of Finance should be allocated to the SOE monitoring unit and
outreach is needed to boost compliance on reporting, the dividend policy, and salary guidance.
36.
Debt management needs to be strengthened to support fiscal sustainability and
facilitate compliance with the FRA. The challenges observed in the accurate reporting of
central government budget expenditure arrears (¶15) are symptomatic of broader challenges in

debt management. The authorities’ efforts to strengthen the legislative environment for debt
management are welcome, but need to be complemented with more fundamental reform of
debt management in Grenada. The Debt Management Unit (DMU) is focused on back office
operations including debt recording, reporting and payments monitoring rather than on fulfilling
its analytical, strategic, and resourcing responsibilities mandated by the 2015 PDM Act. The DMU
should be comprehensively restructured along functional areas (front, middle and back office) in
line with TA advice based on international best practice, with its operations refocused on
implementing the government’s medium-term debt strategy to achieve its debt management
objectives in support of fiscal sustainability. Additional resources will also need to be allocated
to the DMU in support of these objectives and the draft medium-term debt strategy should be
finalized as an urgent priority as the debt restructuring is now nearing completion.
37.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities’ reiterated their confidence in and commitment to
the FRA framework. In light of the significant tax policy changes implemented over the past two
years, they did not see scope for further reforms at this time and indicated that they are focusing
on strengthening tax administration, where there is considerable scope for raising yields. They
noted the significant progress made to strengthen PFM and agreed with staff’s assessment of the
priority areas for reform. With respect to SOEs, they agreed to steadfastly improve compliance
and oversight and stressed the continuous efforts made so far despite staffing constraints.

Box 2. Update on the Reform of State-Owned Enterprises and Statutory Bodies 1/
System-wide reform. The government put in place a Performance Monitoring Framework, developed with
CARTAC assistance, which, together with the new PFM legislation, provides a legal basis to the oversight of
SOEs/SBs and to directives on both salary levels and dividend requirements. A Letter of Expectations was sent to
the SOE/SB Boards in 2015 which sets out their obligations going forward. The strategy is supported by the new
PFM legislation and regulations which provide incentives to promote improved financial reporting and
performance. So far, reporting has improved significantly: the 2016 Budget for the first time included a summary
of financial indicators for each SOE/SB and as of March 2016, more than half of the SOEs/SBs had met the new
reporting requirements. However, fewer had submitted their strategic business plans—needed for the Policy Unit
to advise on capital expenditure needs/financing and dividend levels, and recently an SOE announced plans to
award a wage settlement conflicting with the directives.
Oversight responsibility. This resides in the Policy Unit; with only one staff currently assigned, the Unit needs
more resources to fulfill its monitoring function.

(GCEPC) has focused on cost reductions and is now
generating cash profits from operations. Within the Housing Authority, the accounts have been reorganized
according to profit centers with accountability on each operating unit to generate profits. Targets have been
established for sales that will allow the Authority to break even or generate a small profit.

In terms of the Phase I (2015-17) institution-level restructuring, efforts are focused on improving the financial
position of those facing the most difficulty. Cabinet approved a reform agenda in 2014 broadly consistent with
CARTAC recommendations which, if implemented, provides a sound basis for addressing performance issues. To
date, however, implementation has focused on the restructuring of the Postal and GCEPC Corporations.



Grenada Postal Corporation: The private sector has been involved in the restructuring process. Staff
redundancy was resolved in February 2016, whereby 150 workers were retrenched and received severance
packages based on years of service, which paved the way for private participation in the operation of the
postal service. The total severance cost is estimated at EC$7.5m, or 0.3 percent of GDP. Greater transparency
about the plans for this new entity and/or and the timing of conclusion of the deal would be desirable.



GCEPC (Gravel and Concrete): Private partnerships are planned as a way to raise funds given the capital
intensive nature of this business. The government is still in negotiations with parties on final terms of the
restructuring, which is expected to take place during the course of 2016. Total severance cost for resolving
staff redundancy is currently estimated at EC$5.6m, or about 0.2 percent of GDP.

Next steps. While the strengthened framework serves as a strong foundation on which to build best practices,
only enforcement will make it effective. The Ministry of Finance will need to review progress and consider what
might be needed to strengthen compliance. With respect to enterprise restructuring, progress could be
accelerated. While incentives and management performance has improved, SOE/SBs could examine the possibility
of tariff increases and broader private sector participation in service delivery, as CARTAC has recommended.

Box 3. Grenada―EBA Assessment and BoP Data Revision
Based on existing balance of payments (BoP) data, the external sector assessment finds the real equilibrium
exchange rate (RER) to be near balance or overvalued by up to 43 percent, depending on the methodology
(Annex II). However, the ECCB in January 2016 released provisional revised BoP and IIP statistics for ECCU
members based on improved and updated methodologies.17 While the new data will not be finalized until
late-2016, they show a large improvement in the current account balance in most ECCU countries (and by
over 10 percent of GDP in Grenada) arising from higher travel services, matched by lower FDI inflows,
portfolio outflows, and errors & omissions. A rough estimation under the EBA approach with these new data
produces external sector assessments that are significantly different: whereas estimates of the RER based on
existing data range from -2.7 (undervalued) to 43 percent (overvalued), preliminary estimates with new data
suggest no misalignment or possibly undervaluation.
Staff expect that the new BoP statistics would better reflect underlying BoP flows and provide a more
accurate picture of Grenada’s external position. Staff will continue working with CARTAC and the ECCB and
will reassess Grenada’s external position when the new data are finalized.

Growth Enhancing Policies

39.
Measures to improve long term growth prospects should focus on improving
productivity and building resilience. Grenada has started to attract new investment as investor
confidence has rebounded and the recovery solidified. Caution is needed to avoid overheating
from a possible sudden surge of investment flows related to the CBI program or mega tourism

projects which could potentially cause “Dutch disease” and harm competitiveness. Staff analysis
finds that economic growth since the 2000s has been mostly attributed to factor accumulation,
while productivity growth has been absent. This should be addressed with supply side policies to
increase competition and efficiency in product markets and improve labor market flexibility.
Finally, the authorities have made efforts in building resilience to natural disasters and
cushioning their detrimental impact on output and public finances (Box 4).
Box 4: Grenada: Natural Disasters, Macroeconomic Performance, and Policy Framework
As a small island economy, Grenada is highly vulnerable to natural disasters (NDs). During 1980-2014,
average annual damages from NDs are estimated at 6.9 percent of GDP. Two major hurricanes in 2004 and
2005 (Ivan and Emily), with damages estimated at 148 and 31 percent of GDP, respectively, account for the
majority of the average annual storm damages over this period. Staff’s baseline projection includes the
detrimental impact of NDs on potential growth.
A recent regional study (Acevedo 2014) finds that growth declines in the year the ND occurs, with a
persistent negative effect the year after. Staff includes a ND shock scenario in the DSA (See DSA), where an
average ND is simulated with its impact on growth calibrated to be consistent with the findings from the
regional study, and its impact on public finance based on historical ND events. The shock results in a debt
path that is about 8 percent of GDP higher than in the baseline by 2020.
Grenada is taking steps proactively to build resilience to NDs. Grenada successfully negotiated the inclusion
of ND clauses in recent debt restructuring agreements that allow for a delay in debt service following a
qualifying natural disaster―a global precedent. These clauses will provide important cash flow relief in the
event of a ND. The new instrument issued under the debt restructuring with external commercial creditors
includes a clause which will be triggered by a qualifying natural disaster (covered by Grenada’s CCRIF Policy)
if the calculated loss to Grenada from an event is greater than US$15 million. If such an event occurs,
Grenada may elect to defer debt service payments (either one or two payments depending on the severity
of the loss suffered); however, the deferred payment amount will continue to be repayable and to accrue
interest. Grenada’s agreement with its Paris Club creditors also includes a clause that would allow the
creditors to consider further relief in the event of a ND, but it does not specify the terms of the relief or the
criteria of the disaster. Finally, the FRA of 2015 requires that 40 percent of proceeds from the CBI program
into the NTF are saved to make contingency financing available in the event of a ND. Grenada is the first
Caribbean country with a CBI program to mandate such a requirement.

40.
Improvement in the business
climate will help attract investment and
promote employment. Based on findings
from the World Bank’s Doing Business Index,
resolving insolvency, property registration,
trading across borders, protecting minority
investors, and dealing with construction
permits are areas where Grenada lags behind.
Underlying problems are related to high port
charges, inefficiencies in the judicial system,
and absence of legal liability and insurance

regimes to cover structural building flaws, among others. Targeted reforms should include
streamlining property registration, reinforcing corporate governance, simplifying customs
procedures and reducing port charges, strengthening building quality control and supervision,
and collaborating more with regional partners on joint solutions, such as a regional credit
registry (see Selected Issues Paper (SIP), Chapter I).
41.
Implementation of the GPRS is progressing (Box 5).18 With a new public investment
management system (PIMS) coming on stream, this is a major step toward improving the
efficiency of the PSIP and to achieving GPRS objectives―both closely intertwined with that of the
ECF-supported program. The reform encompasses stronger monitoring and evaluation of
projects through suitable IT platforms, clarification of roles and responsibilities, improved
institutional arrangements, and new reporting requirements. The new PSIP―to be rolled out by
the 2017 budget, would put Grenada’s capital budgeting systems ahead of the region.
Box 5. Implementation of Grenada’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS)
Central to the GPRS, the authorities are developing an effective framework to implement the PSIP. In
accordance with the requirements of the PFM Act 2015 and its regulations, the re-activated Economic &
Technical Co-operation Unit (ETCU) is reforming its PSIP system. In that regard, a UNDP-funded consultancy
was recently undertaken to provide technical leadership/recommendations on the development of a well
functioning PIMS. This included recommendations for IT upgrades, outline of PSIP flow processes, and the
roles of various agencies. Once completed, the PIMS is expected to provide a secure, interactive, web-based
PSIP database (project bank) for effective preparation, monitoring and evaluation of projects. The PIMS will
facilitate queries for analytical purposes to help strengthen the link between strategic/national planning and
multi-year PSIP budgeting. The consultancy also provided: (i) a proposed project cycle manual, (ii) PIMS
training for local planning officers, and (iii) a proposal for training in project development and management.
The PIMS, along with institutionalized arrangements for inter-agency coordination and institutional
strengthening, is expected to ensure that the capital budgeting process is guided by the priorities of GPRS
themes and the corporate plans of line ministries. This will be done within the parameters of the medium
term fiscal framework (MTFF, MTDS). As a governance element of the GPRS, criteria will be applied for the
prioritization of projects, with input from social partners. The government plans to set up a committee to
monitor, evaluate, and report on the PSIP for the 2017 budget presentation by June 2016, to comply with
the PFM regulations.
Beyond the PSIP, staff recommends putting in place an institutional framework for overall co-ordination,
monitoring and evaluation of the GPRS with clear reporting lines and guidelines. Annual reports would help
measure overall progress towards the attainment of the GPRS objectives while signaling necessary
adjustments to policy priorities to support medium term goals. In the interest of transparency, this report
should be published and could benefit from more specific, relevant and time-bound deliverables. Additional
staff in the ETCU with the requisite technical skills/experience and training for capacity building in line
ministries could yield important gains towards effective implementation of the GPRS.

18

An review of GPRS implementation will be conducted during the fifth review of the ECF-supported program.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

42.
Active labor market policies are needed to lower unemployment and promote skill
development. The annual labor force surveys started in 2013 provide an unprecedented
opportunity to understand the Grenada’s labor market. Staff research points to skills mismatch,
particularly at higher skill levels following sectoral shifts in the structure of the economy toward
service-oriented sectors demanding higher skills. Skills mismatch, combined with other structural
rigidities of the labor market, has impeded the growth of youth employment. The authorities
have organized some sector specific training programs through the National Training Agency
and private partners, and an internet platform for job center and vacancy posting. However,
more is needed: with more than 40 percent of young Grenadians out of work, the education
curriculum needs to be reviewed and aligned with the needs of the labor market, and additional
training opportunities should be provided in collaboration with the private sector to improve
career readiness (see SIP, Chapter II).
43.
Reforms to the energy sector will help lower production costs (MEFP ¶18). Energy
prices remain high in Grenada compared to the region, even abstracting from the impact of
recent petrol tax increases. Reforming the regulatory environment for the sector remains
important for the government. Amendments to the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission Act
and the new Electricity Supply Act, drafted with assistance from the World Bank, to establish an
independent regulatory authority could encourage competition in the sector and guide
Grenada’s transition to renewable energy. However, care should be taken to minimize fiscal risks
to the government related to the transition from the status quo and to assess risks and returns
related to economies of scale.
44.
Efforts to expand agricultural output and strengthen climate resilience should
improve growth prospects (MEFP¶19). Infrastructure (road access) investments and
commercialization of government farms are expected to create jobs, improve efficiencies, and
promote private investment. The draft National Agriculture Strategy outlines a targeted approach
for environmentally sustainable development of the sector. This draft strategy also identifies
strategic crops to capitalize on potential export markets and focuses on integrating the sector
into the tourism supply chain.
C.

Financial Sector Issues

45.
Financial stability is slowly improving. Banks’ balance sheets strengthened in 2015
(heat map), with lower leverage, improved asset quality, healthy deposit growth, and a
turnaround in profitability, all of which reduced the financial sector’s exposure to credit and
liquidity risks (spidergram). In this respect, the authorities are meeting a key objective in their
program of strengthening financial stability. Despite these improvements, caution is still needed
because the loan delinquency ratio remains high and significant credit risks still remain, while
profitability is still weak. Since financial cycles appear to have a larger amplitude and duration
than business cycles in Grenada (chart), sluggish credit growth is expected to persist and remain
an impediment to growth in the near term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

GRENADA

46.
A strong banking sector is critical for sustained growth. With the new regional
legislative framework for bank regulation, supervision and resolution in place, the authorities will
shift focus to addressing the results of the regional bank diagnostics once they become available
(MEFP¶21). To safeguard fiscal sustainability, staff and the authorities concurred that private
sector solutions should be considered as a first best option. Continued efforts to strengthen the
banking system are needed to enable it to contribute more effectively to private sector
investment and growth. As of today, Grenada has not been directly affected by the withdrawal of
correspondent banking relationships, but “de-risking” remains an important concern given its

Strengthened regulation and supervision remain the focus for the non-bank
financial sector. Following recommendations from CARTAC, the authorities are increasing staff
at Grenada Authority for the Regulation of Financial Institutions’ (GARFIN) to strengthen its
oversight responsibilities (MEFP ¶23-25). In the credit union sector, the recent rapid increase in

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

lending (¶7) calls for a strengthened legislative and oversight framework for the sector and for a
credit quality review and stress testing. In the insurance sector, the single regulatory framework
should be put in place while continuing the off-site supervision by GARFIN. With respect to
pension funds, off-site supervision has continued, with interim reporting expected shortly and
on-site supervision planned next year. Finally, the authorities are working with CARTAC to
develop a national crisis management plan.
48.
The 2016 safeguards assessment update found that the ECCB continues to maintain
a governance framework that provides for independent oversight. Transparency in financial
reporting has been maintained and the external audit mechanism is sound. However, the internal
audit function only partially conforms to international standards and steps are underway to
address this weakness.
49.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities agreed that improving productivity and
strengthening resilience against natural disasters are critical to boosting growth and
sustainability. They applauded staff’s analysis on Grenada’s business environment and concurred
that inefficiency in property registration and high port charges are among the most important
impediments. They are working with regional partners on a strategic plan to prioritize the
reforms that are most imperative and those that could be addressed through regional
collaboration. The authorities noted that energy sector reform is near completion and would
promote competition and renewable energy alternatives. They agreed with staff’s diagnostics of
the labor market and that review of the education curriculum and more training opportunities
are needed to improve skill matching. Finally, they agreed to proactively address banking sector
issues and to strengthen supervision of the non-bank financial sector.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2014, Grenada has made further progress
toward restoring fiscal and external sustainability. The government had already achieved 80
percent of the planned fiscal consolidation under the ECF-supported program before the last
year of the program, debt has been reduced, and the balance of payments position has
strengthened. The authorities have also pushed through important legislative reforms to build a
fiscal framework that should lock in fiscal discipline over the long term.
51.
Performance under the program has been satisfactory. All quantitative performance
criteria and most of the structural benchmarks for the Fourth Review were met. Corrective actions
have been taken to address the two unmet benchmarks. The government exceeded the fiscal
targets in 2015 and cleared all budget arrears while still finding space to raise capital spending in
support of growth. Successful restructuring of domestic and external debt has led to a reduction
in public debt from a peak of 107 percent of GDP in 2013 to 94 percent at end-2015.
52.
The recovery is continuing, but all of the economy’s pistons are not yet firing.
Agriculture, tourism and construction are expected to continue fueling growth in 2016, projected

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

GRENADA

at 3 percent in 2016. The external position has strengthened despite some real exchange rate
appreciation. The health of the financial system is gradually improving, but credit growth is weak
and not yet supportive of growth. Unemployment remains high and some targeted attention will
be needed to address underlying problems in the labor market.
53.
The program is at an important juncture and continued policy resolve will be
essential to secure lasting success. After much effort, the benefits of reforms are just starting to
spread more broadly to all sectors and the job market, while wage and spending pressures are
rising. Moreover, while the budget outlook for 2016, with corrective steps, is in line with the
program, there is little room for maneuver. After an intensive reform sprint, the authorities will
need to guard against fatigue and be wary of risks posed by the external environment.
54.
The authorities need to persevere with program implementation. While the program
is on track and the authorities’ commitment strong, problems related to some indicative and
monitoring targets reflect capacity limitations that should receive focused attention. In particular,
failure to fully launch the SEED targeting program reflects technical capacity constraints, while
the discovery of older NIS contribution arrears reflects shortcomings in debt management. Staff
urges the government to redouble efforts to launch the SEED beneficiary system to strengthen
the effectiveness of social spending, and to move decisively to implement the regulations for the
debt management act, finalize the medium-term debt strategy, and restructure the debt
management unit.
55.
Near term fiscal priorities should be guided by program goals under the medium
term debt anchor. In particular, the government must focus on execution of the budget in line
with program commitments and staff urges the government to ensure that budget outcomes are
in line with FRA targets to safeguard the credibility of the new rules-based policy framework. The
authorities’ strong record of budget discipline will need to continue in the face of mounting
wage and spending pressures.
56.
The legislative agenda has been impressive, though the last steps need follow
through. Over the past two years the authorities have pushed through an exhaustive legislative
agenda to overhaul the fiscal policy framework, improve tax policies and strengthen public
finance management. These reforms comprised no less than 21 new laws, not including new laws
on the investment code, insolvency and banking (24 total). This is particularly noteworthy given
the size of the country. Implementing the remaining elements of the new fiscal policy
framework―the tax incentive regime, the tax administration act, and the regulations for the
public debt management act― remains a priority for 2016.
57.
Staff place high priority in 2016 on reforms to strengthen management of the
public sector wage bill. Staff urges the authorities to draw on TA from the Fiscal Affairs
Department to inform their discussions with labor in 2016 and to formulate a strategy as soon as
possible to put in place a rational mechanism to manage the wage bill. The system should
include pay and grading reform, compensation guidelines, and systematic indicators to inform
regular wage negotiations. More broadly, public sector reform has failed to materialize as

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

committed under the program and remains critical to reducing inefficiencies and right-sizing the
public sector. Failure to address these issues risks undermining the hard work so far at fiscal
adjustment and structural reform.
58.
Renewed energy is needed to push through priority structural reforms. In addition
to putting into force remaining fiscal legislation and wage bill management, the key pro-growth
reforms for 2016 comprise a revised Labor Code, new GIDC Act, and steps to remove
impediments to private sector activity. On the latter, staff’s findings on impediments to doing
business point to the need to streamline property registration, simplify customs procedures and
reduce port charges, and strengthen building quality control, among other things. To lower
unemployment, research on labor market developments suggest that greater focus is needed on
modernizing education systems to align skills with the needs of the labor market, and on training
opportunities in collaboration with the private sector to improve skills and job readiness.
59.
Continued efforts to strengthen the banking system are needed to enable it to
contribute more effectively to private sector investment and growth. Steps to address
potential weaknesses in the banking sector will need to safeguard fiscal sustainability. Staff
welcome the measures taken so far and plans to continue strengthening regulation and
supervision of the non-bank financial sector.
60.
Data is adequate for surveillance (see Informational Annex). The authorities are
encouraged to build on the progress achieved under the ECF-supported program on
government finance statistics, including in the implementation of the new Chart of Accounts, to
improve reporting on capital expenditure and on the broader public sector, and to consider
providing the Fund with fiscal data for the GFSM. In addition, staff would urge the government to
take advantage of the data provision under the program to work toward updating the metadata
under the GDDS, which has not been updated since 2001.
61.
Staff supports the completion of the fourth review under the ECF-arrangement, the
waiver for the nonobservance of a performance criterion, the request for modification of a
performance criterion, and the financing assurances review. Staff also recommends that the next
Article IV consultation be held on the 24 month consultation cycle in accordance with the
provisions of Decision No. 14747, as amended.

Expected Impact
High. Slower growth in advanced
economies could directly dampen
Grenada’s growth through lower
tourism arrivals, remittances, and
FDI. The fiscal position could also
worsen with weaker revenues.

High. Grenada’s growth could be
directly affected through lower
tourism arrivals, remittances and
FDI. Financial spillover channels
could include a cutback in lending
from Canadian and Trinidadian
banks, resulting in lower growth
and negative feedback loops, as
well as tightened liquidity in
regional financial markets,
increasing rollover risks for
sovereign debt.
High. If spread to Grenada, the
virus could significantly
discourage tourist arrivals, widen
current account deficit and
dampen growth.
Medium. A surge in the U.S.
dollar, to which the EC dollar is
pegged, could lead to further
appreciation of Grenada’s real
exchange rate, while making
Grenada a more expensive
destination for tourists from
Europe and Canada.
Medium/low. Shock to
remittance flows could have a
short-run impact on BOP net
inflows and reduced consumption
spending. Disrupted banking
services could also hinder financial
transactions in the tourism
industry.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex II. Grenada―External Sector and Competitiveness Assessment
Despite signs of improvement, Grenada’s external competitiveness needs to be monitored
closely. Earlier fiscal and external imbalances caused by damages from natural disasters and
countercyclical policy responses to the global financial crisis took a toll on Grenada’s
competitiveness. Under the authorities’ home grown program, however, fiscal and debt
sustainability are improving. In addition, lower international oil price and a recovery in tourism have
helped to narrow external imbalances. That said, broader competitiveness signs, including exchange
rates, labor costs and tourism market share, show a mixed picture. On balance, the analysis points to
the need for ongoing efforts to increase productivity and lower domestic costs. With pending and
significant revisions to balance of payments statistics, staff will monitor developments closely and
revisit the assessment when the data are finalized.
1. Nominal and real effective exchange rates
Recent appreciation of the EC dollar is expected to continue, but the impact is likely to be
mitigated by relatively lower domestic price inflation in the near term. Measured against its
main trading partners (INS weights), Grenada’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has
appreciated by 10.7 percent since mid 2014, largely owing to the strengthening U.S. dollar, to which
the regional currency is pegged. The nominal appreciation has been partially offset by deflation in
Grenada, with the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciating by 2.8 percent during the same
period. With domestic deflation, the real effective exchange rate in Grenada is much lower than its
Caribbean peers, which has helped lower the current account deficit. Going forward, nominal
appreciation is expected to continue as relatively stronger growth in the U.S. and higher interest
rates cause the dollar to remain strong. Inflation in Grenada is projected to remain muted for most
of 2016 due to lower energy prices, which should provide counter nominal appreciation pressures.

2. Equilibrium real exchange rate estimates and new balance of payments data
Empirical analysis with current BoP data points to overvaluation of the real exchange rate
(RER). Based on current BoP statistics, the standard EBA-lite estimates suggest the misalignment of
Grenada’s real effective exchange rate (REER) ranges from -8.0 percent (- under-valuation) to 43.2
percent (+ overvaluation), based on different methodologies. These are broadly consistent with the
staff assessment during the last Article IV consultation.


The current account regression approach finds that Grenada’s current account balance of
-15.5 percent of GDP in 2014 was weaker than the estimated “norm” of -6.9 percent of GDP.
Based on an estimated elasticity of -0.2, a 43.2 percent REER adjustment (depreciation) would be
needed to close the current account gap. (Past analysis has found that EBA models have a poor
fit for micro economies, partly due to natural disaster shocks.)



The external sustainability approach suggests that a current account balance of 12.9 percent of
GDP would be needed to stabilize Grenada’s net foreign liabilities, and a 13.1 percent RER
adjustment would be needed toward the medium term.



Finally, the REER-based regression approach indicates that Grenada’s REER is broadly in line with
its estimated norm.

However, in January 2016, the ECCB released new provisional balance of payments (BoP) data
for 2014 which shows a significant improvement in Grenada’s external position. The new BoP
estimates are based on BPM6 for the first time and were compiled using improved methodologies,

until late-2016.
The provisional BoP data suggest that external imbalances may be considerably lower than
estimated under the existing BoP statistics. The current account deficit is estimated at 7.8 percent
of GDP, an improvement of over 10 percent of GDP. The difference is primarily caused by an
improved recording of travel expenditure, which resulted in a significant increase in travel service
exports matched by downward revisions in FDI inflows, portfolio outflows and Errors & Omissions.

Under these new strengthened BoP data, the EBA assessment suggests a smaller
misalignment in Grenada’s RER. An illustrative estimate under the EBA-lite assessment using the
provisional data finds no misalignment of Grenada’s RER based on the current account regression
approach, and a 13.8 percent undervaluation of the exchange rate based on the external
sustainability approach. As noted above, irrespective of the data revision, past analysis has found
EBA models to have a poor fit for small and micro economies. Along with measurement errors and
other data shortcomings, the estimates should be considered with caution and assessed in
conjunction with other indicators of external sustainability. Staff will work with the authorities to
continue improving the external statistics and the exchange rate assessment.

Improvement in Grenada’s external position
has led to further reserve accumulation.
Imputed reserves stood at US$188.5 million at
end-2015, covered 5.7 months of imports or 24
percent of broad money, and appeared to be
adequate for cushioning external shocks and
preventing disorderly market conditions. The
imputed reserve position is also stronger than
the 3.1 month of imports optimal level
suggested by a risk-based model tailored to
low-income economies.1,2

4. Labor costs and productivity

Labor market rigidities and skills mismatch have led to a large number of workers being displaced

and persistent high unemployment in Grenada, which repressed productivity. Measured by real
output per worker, labor productivity in Grenada fell sharply from 2006-2013. Real
wages have not adjusted fully to lower productivity, which has resulted in rising unit labor costs.

(see SIP, Chapter III).
5. Tourism: arrivals, market share, and price
Grenada’s tourism market share has recovered but is yet to fully reach its pre-2005-hurricane
level. After the devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, Grenada suffered a 30 percent drop in its
share of total stay-over visitors in the ECCU. The tourism industry was hit hard again during the
global financial crisis in 2008-09, which ended a short-lived post-disaster recovery. Grenada started
to regain its market share in 2014 after intensified marketing, the establishment of a new Grenada
Tourism Authority, and the opening of a large brand-name luxury resort. Stay-over arrivals,
particularly from the U.S. and Canada, have recovered, but Grenada’s share of total visitors in the
Caribbean is still behind the level enjoyed prior to 2005. More recently, the surge in arrivals from
Canada has slowed, likely due to the depreciation in the Canadian dollar which makes Grenada a
more expensive destination. (See Selected Issues papers, Chapter II.)

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
May 2, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Madame Lagarde,
We are now in the final year of implementation of our Homegrown Programme, supported by our
regional and international partners, and have continued to make significant progress in boosting
economic growth, restoring fiscal and debt sustainability and strengthening the financial sector. We
have met all continuous and end-December 2015 quantitative performance criteria and strong
progress was made on the structural reform agenda.
As committed, we achieved the first primary surplus in a decade in 2015, outperforming the
programme target by a significant margin. We have also substantially completed a comprehensive
debt restructuring that has resulted in a major reduction in our debt burden. The substantial
legislative reforms that we have undertaken to overhaul our fiscal policy framework, together with
our ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts, have set the foundation for fiscal and debt sustainability
and longer-term economic growth. Accordingly, we have remained firmly on track to successfully
implement the remainder of our programme and have already taken the necessary fiscal adjustment
measures to complete the programmed fiscal consolidation.
The Government remains fully committed to the objectives and targets of its programme, as set out
in the November 2015 Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The attached
supplement to the MEFP (Attachment I), together with the updated Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (Attachment II) present performance under the programme thus far and update the
specific policies toward meeting the objectives of the home-grown economic programme. Our key
focus going forward will be on safeguarding the results thus far, while advancing reforms to ensure
sustainable public sector wage management, and to boost productivity, employment and growth.
On the basis of our performance under the programme and commitment to continued
implementation, our Government requests that the Executive Board of the IMF complete the fourth
review of the arrangement under the ECF and the financing assurances review, approve the request
for a waiver of a performance criterion, approve the request for modification of a performance
criterion, approve the requested rephasing of structural benchmarks, and approve the fifth
disbursement under the arrangement of the equivalent of SDR 2 million.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

GRENADA

We are confident that the policies described in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve our
programme’s objectives. However, if necessary, our Government stands ready to take any additional
measures that may be required. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of such measures
and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation. Our Government will also provide the Fund staff with all the relevant
information required to complete programme reviews and monitor performance on a timely basis.
We consent to the publication of this letter, and its attachments as well as the related staff report.

Yours truly,

1.
Grenada continues to make important progress to restore fiscal and debt
sustainability. On November 25th, 2015, the IMF’s Executive Board completed the Third Review of
the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in support of Grenada’s homegrown economic reform programme. Overall programme implementation remained strong in 2015.
All quantitative targets were met for the fourth review and progress was made on the structural
reform agenda, most notably by strengthening tax administration with a new Tax Administration Act
and the restructuring of our Inland Revenue Department by making operational the Large/Medium
and Small Taxpayer Units.
2.
The Government remains fully committed to the reform strategy and programme
objectives. The policies outlined in the June 2014 MEFP and the December 2014, June 2015, and
November 2015 Supplements remain valid in full, unless modified below. The quantitative targets
that serve as performance criteria and indicative targets under the programme are presented in
Table 1. The structural conditionality under the programme, incorporating modifications and
additions as discussed below, is presented in Table 2.

of GDP (including 0.5 percent of GDP in budgetary revenue from the Citizen-By-Investment (CBI)
programme), the primary surplus outperformed the programme target by a significant margin.
Strong revenue growth drove the overperformance, underpinned by a strong economic recovery,
improvements in tax administration, and a larger-than anticipated revenue yield of tax policy
measures introduced in 2015. To lend further support to the economic recovery, the Government
utilized some of the fiscal space provided by strong revenue growth to undertake additional capital
spending to help boost potential output, while preserving its efforts to restrict recurrent spending.
As part of our efforts to restrict recurrent spending, public employment and the wage bill were
maintained below their monitored targets. With the progress achieved in 2015, the Government has
undertaken a total fiscal adjustment of 6.1 percent of GDP since embarking on our home-grown
adjustment programme, marking a significant turnaround in the fiscal position.
4.
We will complete the fiscal consolidation required to restore fiscal and debt
sustainability in 2016. In support of this objective, the 2016 Budget targets a primary surplus of 3.5
percent of GDP, (excluding one-off severance payments – see ¶6 below) as also required under the
newly enacted Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) until we have completed our efforts to reduce central
government and central government guaranteed debt below the FRA target of 55 percent of GDP.
To accomplish this objective, an additional consolidation of 1.3 percent of GDP is required in 2016.
As outlined in our December 2015 MEFP, we have already taken steps to put in place the measures
required to achieve this consolidation, including the VAT on fee-based banking services, which was
legislated in 2015 (meeting the end-December 2015 structural benchmark). We expect to begin

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

GRENADA

receiving revenues under this VAT in April 2016 as we have now completed discussions with banks
on the applicability of the VAT to their various fee-based services. To further support our efforts, we
will maintain public sector employment below its end-2015 level and propose to lower the
associated monitoring target to reflect this commitment. No further adjustment measures are
required to achieve the programmed fiscal consolidation for 2016.
5.
We remain committed to prudent management of receipts from our CBI programme
to ensure that our fiscal consolidation efforts remain unaffected by the uncertain nature of
these potential inflows. The 2016 Budget assumes the receipt of EC$82 million of grant financing
from the National Transformation Fund (NTF), with a portion of these receipts budgeted to finance
recurrent expenditure mandates, including on social programmes and ongoing infrastructure
spending. We are committed to ensuring that these recurrent mandates are restricted to the fiscal
envelope available in the absence of CBI inflows and that available NTF grant financing will be used
to finance only one-off, transformational infrastructure spending that we would otherwise not be
able to undertake, as required under the NTF regulations (see below). To achieve this, we have:


Reallocated the recurrent mandates from NTF-financed to non-grant-financed spending and
reduced expenditure allocations for non-grant-financed spending to programmed levels. We
have also specified quarterly capital budget allocations for non-grant-financed spending
(TMU¶20) consistent with achieving our quantitative programme targets, and will ensure that
our quarterly capital budget allocations to Ministries/Departments are consistent with these
allocations. These allocations are also consistent with the expected reduced availability of
Petrocaribe financing relative to the time of the preparation of the 2016 Budget, given the
continued decline in international oil prices.



Prioritized the non-recurrent infrastructure projects that will be financed with NTF resources if
these become available. As previously committed (June 2015 MEFP), the execution of these
projects will start only when sufficient resources have been accumulated in the NTF to finance
the project to its completion and through its maintenance over the medium-term.

We will also ensure that spending under the NTF is limited to non-recurrent and productive
infrastructure spending, as required under the NTF regulations. In support of this objective, we will
continue our efforts to ensure proper accounting of capital spending under the new Chart of
Accounts (CoA) (¶10).
6.
To support achievement of our fiscal targets mandated by the FRA, we will ensure that
budgeted transfers to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and statutory bodies (SBs) include
provisions for the payment of severance related to their restructuring (¶13). In 2016, we expect
to pay approximately US$4.9 million in severance to workers at Grenada Postal Corporation and
Grenada Concrete and Emulsion Production Corporation (GCEPC) as part of the restructuring of
these organizations. A provision for this spending was not included in the 2016 Budget approved in
2015 because of the uncertainty at that time about the magnitude of the required severance. While
the exact cost of severance payments for GECPC is uncertain at this time, should spending in 2016
for both entities amount to more than the US$4 million allowed under the ECF programme adjustor

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

(TMU ¶7), we will take corrective measures to safeguard compliance with programme targets. For
2016, the one-off severance payments could result in a temporary deviation of the primary balance
from its FRA-mandated target. Based on current severance estimates, we anticipate achieving a
primary balance of at least 3.1 percent of GDP. Going forward, we are committed to providing for
all spending related to the ongoing restructuring of SOEs and SBs (¶13), including for the payment
of severance in the budget estimates, and to adhering to the fiscal rules as set out in the FRA.
7.
We will work with the public service to address any outstanding salary obligations
within the expenditure ceiling under our ECF-supported programme. We previously committed
(IMF Country Report No. 14/196, MEFP ¶18) not to award salary increments (automatic pay grade
increases) for the 2014-16 period while improving the public service performance appraisal system.
However, the Government subsequently discovered it may have a contractual liability to award some
increments for this period. We commit to engaging key stakeholders with a view to arriving at a
systematic approach for the settlement of outstanding wage obligations consistent with the ECF
targets and the FRA. Moreover, we aim to implement, with guidance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs
Department (FAD), a new system to manage the wage bill that will install a rational, rules-based
mechanism of wage bill management and regular performance-based assessments (see ¶11).
8.
To ensure that fiscal consolidation remains on track in the face of an uncertain
outlook, the Government has identified a number of contingent fiscal measures. These
measures are outlined in the June 2014 MEFP and its December 2014 Supplement and we remain
committed to enacting them should fiscal risks materialize.
Debt Restructuring and Regularization of Arrears
9.
The Government has executed debt restructuring agreements with its largest external and
domestic creditors:
External Debt:


1

Private Creditors. The debt exchange with the holders of Grenada’s 2025 international bonds
was successfully concluded on November 12, 2015. High creditor participation in the exchange
triggered the collective action clause, ensuring universal participation. Half of the 50 percent
haircut became effective immediately, with the remainder to be effective upon completion of
the sixth review of the current ECF arrangement. The new bonds have an annual coupon rate of
7 percent and a maturity of 15 years. The Government, through the fiscal agent for the bonds,
contacted the outstanding creditors of the original commercial bonds that did not participate in
the 2005 debt exchange and the exchange agreement included a clause to allow these creditors
to participate in the exchange.1 Some holdouts have subsequently come forward and their

In the 2005 debt restructuring, a small portion of bonds (US$5.6 million, or ¾ percent of GDP) was unclaimed and

did not participate in the 2005 debt restructuring agreement.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

GRENADA

claims are expected to be restructured with the same nominal haircut as applied to the holders
of the 2025 international bonds. We expect to conclude this process in by end-June 2016.
Official Creditors. An Agreed Minute was reached with our Paris Club creditors on November
18, 2015 to reschedule outstanding Paris Club debts and arrears.2 We have subsequently
contacted all of our Paris Club creditors to implement the Agreed Minute. We have also
continued to engage all other non-Paris Club bilateral official creditors to request a
comprehensive restructuring of their claims on Grenada.



Domestic Debt:


National Insurance Scheme (NIS). Agreements have been executed to restructure several
Government of Grenada debts held by the NIS. The E.C. dollar 2025 bonds held by the NIS were
restructured into a new long-term instrument with a 25-year term, 10-year grace period and a
3 percent interest rate, with expected NPV savings to the government of 73 percent. A
restructuring agreement with equivalent terms was also executed for NIS holdings of the
Government of Grenada 2014/16 Serial Bond. A privately held Treasury bill was restructured into
a 7-year bond with a 2-year grace period and an interest rate of 3 percent, with expected NPV
savings of 31 percent. Finally, the Government’s contribution arrears to the NIS were
restructured into a 5-year bond with an interest rate of 3 percent, for total expected NPV savings
of 19 percent. The remaining NIS holdings of Government of Grenada debt are concentrated in
365-day Treasury bills, which are expected to be converted into instruments with longer
maturities and lower interest rates, similar to those agreed on the restructured NIS holdings of
Government of Grenada debt, upon their maturity.



Port Authority. In February 2016, agreement was finalized with the Grenada Ports Authority
(GPA) to restructure a privately placed Treasury bill held by the GPA. The Treasury bill will be
restructured into a 15-year Government of Grenada bond with a 3.5 percent interest rate. A 50
percent haircut will be applied to outstanding principal and interest arrears, and is expected to
result in a 0.7 percent of GDP decline in the stock of government debt.



Remaining domestic creditors. Negotiations continue with our remaining domestic creditors
to restructure their outstanding claims on the Government of Grenada. Negotiations with
remaining domestic commercial creditors continue to focus on restructuring the majority of
outstanding debt on terms comparable to those received on Grenada’s external bond, excluding
the sharing of any CBI flows. To reduce rollover risks, we also plan to convert our outstanding
privately placed Treasury bills into new instruments with longer maturities and lower interest
rates.

Government Guaranteed Debt. We have also made progress with our efforts to restructure
government guaranteed debt. Debt restructuring agreements have been reached with the NIS to
restructure domestic debt owed by the Housing Authority of Grenada and the Maurice Bishop
2

International Airport that is guaranteed by central government. While these agreements will not
provide any nominal debt relief, they are expected to improve the ability of these SOEs to service
their government guaranteed debt. The Marketing and National Importing Board (MNIB) has also
reached agreement with its external private creditor to restructure its debt, with the objective of
removing the government guarantee. The agreement is expected to be executed in 2016.
Government Arrears. In line with our programme commitments, the Government cleared all
budget expenditure arrears by end-2015. To support our efforts to remain current on our liabilities,
we continue to focus on strengthening cash management, including cash flow forecasting in
support of budget execution, and on implementing commitment control (¶10). We have also made
important inroads to reduce debt arrears. The debt restructuring agreements implemented with our
external creditors lowered our external debt arrears to 4.9 percent of GDP at end-2015 from a peak
of 10.1 percent in2013. The Agreed Minute reached with our Paris Club creditors includes an agreed
clearance framework for our arrears to Paris Club creditors and, once executed, is expected to
reduce our external debt arrears by a further 1.8 percent of GDP. Similarly, our debt arrears to
domestic creditors fell from their peak of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 percent at end-2015 due
to the execution of restructuring agreements with some domestic creditors, most importantly the
NIS, and will decline by a further 0.7 percent of GDP due to the agreement reached with the Port
Authority in early 2016. We continue our efforts to regularize our remaining debt arrears in the
context of ongoing debt restructuring negotiations with our creditors and to implement our strategy
to pay membership arrears to regional and international organizations. Outside of the ongoing debt
restructuring, the Government has not incurred additional arrears and remains committed to staying
current on all obligations going forward.
Fiscal Structural Reforms
10.
We remain focused on strong implementation of our new fiscal policy framework. To
this end, we will:


Adhere to the regulations for the NTF, put in place in August 2015. As required by the
regulations, forty percent of the monthly inflows into the NTF will be saved for general budget
financing purposes, including contingency spending, natural disasters and debt reduction. All
NTF-financed capital spending will be fully integrated into the Government’s public sector
investment programme (PSIP) and the central government Budget and will be aligned with the
objectives of Grenada’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) 2016-18 and National
Plan 2030. To strengthen oversight of the allocation of NTF resources, we will, as required by
NTF regulations, put in place a Board of Directors for the NTF by end-2016 which will be vested
with primary responsibility for allocating NTF resources. We also remain committed to the
transparent management of CBI receipts and will continue to publish all CBI statistics on the
Ministry of Finance website, as outlined in the TMU (¶20), on a quarterly basis (structural
benchmark).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

GRENADA



Put in place the regulations needed to support implementation of the 2015 Public Debt
Management (PDM) Act and bring the Act into force. We received technical assistance from the
IMF to draft the regulations in 2015 and will ensure that the Act and regulations are entered into
force by end-2016. We are also committed to continuing our efforts to strengthen debt
management and, in support of this objective, will finalize our medium-term debt strategy by
mid-2016 and undertake a restructuring of the Debt Unit within the Ministry of Finance to vest it
with additional resources to fulfill its function. To strengthen control over the contracting of
debt, the Debt Unit will be vested with a formal oversight responsibility of all debt contracted.
The requirement to include the Debt Unit in the negotiation process for all central government
and central government guaranteed debt will be explicitly included in the new PDM regulations.



Strengthen public finance management. Important progress has already been made to
strengthen public finance management with the 2016 Budget prepared according to the
requirements set out in the 2015 PFM Act. As required by the Act, the Budget was accompanied
by an assessment of performance for the previous fiscal year and information summarizing the
financial condition of each SOE and SB. It was also accompanied by a medium-term fiscal
framework, which was used as the foundation of the 2016 Budget estimates. As required by the
Act, the Ministry of Finance has begun to prepare fiscal impact assessments for all proposed
policy decisions to ensure that decisions are made only after considering their impact on fiscal
and debt sustainability. As part of our efforts to strengthen the Government’s PSIP (¶14), we are
also taking steps, including through a new PSIP manual, to ensure that project selection under
the PSIP is consistent with the prioritization and selection criteria outlined in the PFM Act and
that PSIP reporting procedures are consistent with those required in the PFM Act. To further
strengthen public finance management, we remain focused on strengthening our accounting
and auditing framework for public accounts and are receiving technical assistance from the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department to prepare manuals on budget preparation and budget
execution to help guide compliance with the 2015 PFM Act.



Implement the new CoA. We approved the final appropriation for the 2016 budget under the
new Chart of Accounts (CoA) (end-2015 structural benchmark), and subsequently converted
monthly budget accounting and reporting to the new CoA starting in January 2016. However,
the Fund is of the view that the new CoA was not fully implemented for the 2016 Budget
because the reclassification of some recurrent spending items (such as wage spending related to
capital projects) from capital expenditure to current expenditure categories was not completed.
In light of this difference of views, we have agreed to seek support from CARTAC to review the
CoA implementation and provide advice on whether any further changes are necessary.



Cash forecasting and commitment control. A cash forecasting unit has been established within
the Accountant General’s Department of the Ministry of Finance to strengthen cash
management. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the cash forecasting model by
broadening the model to include the Budget Department in monthly reporting and by utilizing
the model as a key input in determining monthly/quarterly expenditure allocations. In particular,
we will closely integrate the cash forecasting system into our expenditure commitment controls

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

by limiting commitments to available cash. We have made progress to strengthen commitment
control by introducing a requirement that all goods must have a SmartStream generated
purchase order which automatically commits expenditure. We will continue our efforts in this
regard by also mandating that all capital and services spending, regardless of its revenue stream,
be initiated through a SmartStream generated purchase order.


Implement the new tax incentive regime. The reform of the tax incentive regime to make it more
rules-based and transparent and to eliminate discretion was completed in early March 2016.
Further to the amendments to the various tax acts completed in 2015, additional amendments
were made to clarify the incentives to be provided to large scale investments in priority sectors.
Moreover, the Income Tax Act was amended to remove the Sixth Schedule and to outline the
requirements for an investment to qualify as a priority investment. These qualifications were
then reissued as the Investment (Priority Sectors) Regulations under the Investment Act of 2014.
Finally, with support from our CARICOM partners given our regional commitments on external
tariffs, the Customs (Duties Exemptions) Order of 2016 was issued to remove discretion from the
granting of customs duty exemptions. With the new regime now in place, we will bring it into
full force as a prior action for completion of the review. We expect the transition to the new tax
incentive regime to be broadly revenue neutral, but will actively monitor revenue performance
and take action, including implementing our identified contingent fiscal measures (¶8), should
the impact be larger than anticipated. If by end-May 2016 revenue (on a cumulative basis) is
below the programme forecast of EC$251 million by more than EC$1 million we will take
corrective action to safeguard compliance with our programme targets.



Strengthen tax and customs administration. Parliament approved the new Tax Administration
Act in February 2016 (end-November 2015 structural benchmark). We will now move to bring
the new Act into force, with the aim of meeting this goal by mid-2016. In addition to
strengthening the legislative environment for tax administration, we continue our efforts to
reform the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) ― with technical assistance from CARTAC and the
IMF―to strengthen tax administration. While there was a small delay relative to the anticipated
end-December 2015 timeline, the Large and Medium Taxpayer Service Unit (LMTU) and the
Small Taxpayers Service Unit are now operational (end-December 2015 structural
benchmark). We are now focused on enhancing the LMTU’s ability to facilitate compliance by
the largest taxpayers and will provide sufficient resources to IRD to do so. For 2016, our
priorities to strengthen tax administration will be to finalize an updated Corporate Strategic
Business Plan and to put in place a detailed Taxpayer Compliance Strategy.

11.
The government places priority in 2016 on reforms to improve management of the
public sector wage bill. We believe this reform is essential to safeguard fiscal progress made so far
and ensure a mechanism and tools to manage the wage bill in a way that is fiscally prudent, fair, and
sustainable. The goal is to build a rational system of wage bill control that would include pay and
grading reform, compensation related to performance and market comparators, and systematic
indicators to guide regular wage negotiations based on established parameters like productivity
growth, inflation and cost of living adjustments. In March 2016 we requested technical assistance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

GRENADA

(TA) from FAD to help us prepare this strategy. We aim to host the TA mission in May 2016, which
will help inform our position in discussions with public sector unions, and will submit to Cabinet by
mid-2016 a focused reform strategy based on recommendations in the TA report. We would request
to rephase this structural benchmark—Cabinet approval of a reform strategy to manage the public
sector wage bill—to take place by September 30, 2016. As noted, this reform will be critical for
guiding wage negotiations, complement the work underway to prepare a revised Public Service Bill,
and improve the quality and effectiveness of public goods and services—key to promoting private
sector growth.
12.
We are continuing our efforts to implement our strategic plan to strengthen the
financial position of SOEs and SBs. Putting in place an effective oversight framework for the sector
to ensure implementation of the strategy remains integral to its success. To this end, we are
committed to strengthening the committee mandated to oversee implementation of the strategy by
appointing new representatives. Moreover, we will allocate additional resources to the Policy Unit
within the Ministry of Finance to strengthen our monitoring of SOE and SB compliance with their
reporting requirements, and to assess the financial position of individual entities and any required
reforms. While some institutions have adhered to the new reporting requirements and have
provided business plans as required, reporting remains uneven across institutions and we recognize
that additional outreach will be needed by the oversight committee and the Policy Unit to
strengthen compliance. We will also continue to monitor compliance with the guidance note issued
to SOEs/SBs on salary negotiations and the dividend policy.
13.
Reform of individual SOEs and SBs are advancing, although progress has been slower
than envisioned. In late 2015, we received US$5 million in financing from the World Bank to
complete the restructuring of the Grenada Postal Corporation (GPC) and Gravel, Concrete and
Emulsion Production Corporation. GPC is expected to be commercialized in the first half of 2016,
while Gravel Concrete and Emulsion Production Corporation is expected to be commercialized
through a joint venture with a private investor. Reforms to other SOEs are expected to advance after
the completion of the restructuring of these SOEs. In addition, we remain committed to resolving
revenue weakness in the National Water and Sewerage Authority and the Solid Waste Management
Authority, and will consider revamping their tariff-setting regimes if required.
Structural Reforms to Support Competitiveness and Growth
14.
The Government’s economic programme remains focused on improving prospects for
growth and job creation, guided by our GPRS 2014-18. GPRS implementation continues to be
centered on the Government’s capital budget, with budgeted capital projects aligned with GPRS
priorities. The Government is in the process of establishing a management information system
infrastructure to align the public sector investment management system with the requirements of
the FR and PFM Acts. The PSIP will be guided by GPRS priorities and the new management system
will enable full integration into the capital budgeting process and ex ante analysis of debt
implications of loan financed investment project proposals. We are also continuing our efforts to
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation framework for the GPRS and expect to finalize the

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

framework by June 2016. The GPRS will be the cornerstone for Grenada’s new long-term
development plan, the National Sustainable Development Plan 2030. A national steering committee
continues to guide development of the plan, which is currently in the planning stage. We expect to
submit the draft plan for public consultation by mid-2016 and to finalize the plan before the next
budget cycle.
15.
The Government has also taken actions to improve the business environment and
enhance Grenada’s investment readiness. Consistent with the GPRS emphasis on strengthening
the business climate, we are committed to unlocking the critical impediments to private sector
investment and activity. In this regard, we have:


Introduced new insolvency legislation. A new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Bill was approved by
Parliament in March 2016 to modernize the legislative framework related to bankruptcy and
insolvency of individuals and companies. The bill provides a comprehensive regime that sets out
procedures available to both creditors and debtors and is expected to enhance Grenada's
standing with respect to the ease of doing business.



Reformed Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC). We have implemented a
strategic realignment and corporate restructuring of GIDC to align the organizational structure
with its business priorities. Investment promotion is now positioned as a key function of GIDC’s
mandate, complemented by the facility management and business development functions. As
the next step, we will revise the GIDC Act, with assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat,
to support the business activities of GIDC and its new organizational structure. We are
committed to obtaining parliamentary approval of the revised act by end-June 2016, on track
with the structural benchmark. We believe that the restructuring of GIDC will play a
fundamental role in reducing the time and cost of obtaining investment approval and
strengthening the overall investment environment in Grenada.

16.
The Government is committed to engaging key stakeholders from the private sector to
develop a plan to strengthen Grenada’s position in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking.
We are collaborating with IMF staff to identify the key impediments to doing business in Grenada
and the main contributors to the decline in Grenada’s ranking in the World Bank index in recent
years. Preliminary findings have pointed to weakness in areas such as high trading (port) costs,
lengthy customs procedures, difficult access to credit, and the lack of fully digitized land registration
system and building quality control regulations. Also, inefficiencies in the judicial system are cited as
an important cause of delay and costs to doing business in Grenada. To resolve these issues, we are
looking at steps to establish accurate information about property records, streamline property
registration processes, simplify customs procedures, strengthen building quality control and
regulation, and to promote a regional solution where possible, for example a region-wide credit
registry.
17.
The Government has elevated the labour market as a key element of our overall
efforts to strengthen growth and competitiveness. In line with our commitment to modernize

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

GRENADA

the public sector and reduce associated costs (¶11), we will also introduce reforms to reduce
unemployment and lower labour costs. We will:


Finalize revisions to the Labour Code. Following an extensive review of the 1999 Labour Code,
we have drafted the new Employment Act, Labour Relations Act, and Occupancy Safety and
Health Act, guided by International Labour Standards and Conventions. These new acts are
aimed at enhancing labour mobility and reducing impediments to hiring while ensuring that the
system provides adequate protection of workers’ rights. We have submitted the draft
Occupation Safety and Health Act to the ILO and are seeking further technical assistance in
finalizing this act and developing accompanying regulations. We anticipate submitting the draft
Employment Act and Labour Relations Act to Parliament in June 2016 for approval, on track to
meet the end-August 2016 structural benchmark.



Strengthen labour market statistics. With technical assistance from the World Bank, we expect to
finalize and publish the 2015 Labour Force Survey (LFS) by the end of the first quarter. The 2015
survey will incorporate for the first time a new section on multidimensional poverty indicators
(including education, health and employment), compiled with assistance from the Oxford
Poverty and Human Development Initiative. Strengthened labour market statistics serve as an
important input to policy decisions in support of our efforts to reduce unemployment, and we
are committed to continuing the survey on an annual basis. We have also finished collecting the
information for the Job Opening and Labour Turnover Study, as part of a regional initiative, and
are currently engaging the World Bank for assistance in processing the data, with results
expected by year-end.



Put in place active labour market policies required to strengthen skills matching, improve
demand and supply links, and promote human capital development. The government, through
the National Training Agency (Grenada), has undertaken a labour market needs assessment and
developed the National Vocational Qualification, which provides important guidelines for
tailored training programmes to meet skill demand. We are also working closely with
international organizations on skill training and development of the youth and are developing a
website for vacancy posting and online job center to improve skills matching. The government is
also seeking active support from foreign investors to include elements of job training and skills
development as part of their investment planning in Grenada. Finally, we are collaborating with
IMF staff to assess the Grenadian labour market and to determine other appropriate policies.

18.
The Government remains committed to reforming the regulatory environment for the
energy sector to regain its price competiveness. Amendments to the Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission Act (PURCA) and a new Electricity Supply Act (ESA) have been drafted by renowned
consultants under the World Bank funded Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Agency (ECERA)
project, and revised with the incorporation of public comments following national consultations
during the course of 2015. The Government has entered the final stage of dialogue with the
electricity company, facilitated by a third party, in an effort to secure maximum acceptability of the
new legislations by the parties and expects to conclude the facilitated discussions and approve the
new legislations by mid-2016. The new legislations will establish an independent national regulatory
66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

authority responsible for tariff-setting, among others, to be supported by the regional advisory
authority (ECERA). The new legislative framework, once established, is expected to introduce
competition in the electricity sector and guide Grenada’s transition to renewable energy. The
Government has also been receiving assistance from international partners to further review the
draft legislation and undertake viability studies of renewable energy alternatives.
19.
The government has continued efforts to expand the productive capacity and output
of the agriculture sector to improve the prospects for sustainable growth and
competitiveness. Various government initiatives geared towards higher agricultural exports include
infrastructure (road access) investments and the facilitation of new private sector investments
through the commercialization of government estates. In addition to the strategic focus of MNIB,
these are expected to boost farmer confidence, create jobs, and increase efficiencies and farmers’
income. These form part of the national agriculture strategy, which is closely aligned with the
objectives of the GPRS and outlines a targeted approach for a more environmentally sustainable
development of the sector to strengthen its resilience to climate change. The strategy, which was
recently submitted to Cabinet for approval, also identifies strategic crops to capitalize on potential
export markets, increasing the scale and range of value added products as well as strengthening the
linkages with the tourism sector.
20.
The Government will work to strengthen social protection under the SEED programme.
Due to technical delays in populating the new Management Information System (MIS),
implementation of the testing tool was delayed. However, beginning in late 2015, to address
pressing social needs, new applicants were accepted into the programme after a screening process
conducted by our field officers. With additional beneficiaries under the programme, monthly
spending increased in the last quarter of 2015. However, due to the earlier delays noted above, the
end December 2015 indicative floor was missed by a small margin (EC$1.6 million). We are now in
the process of entering all beneficiary data into the new MIS, in final preparation for implementing
the phase-out policy approved in August 2015. We anticipate to complete the data entry process by
end-March 2016 and to submit the draft phase-out plan to Cabinet thereafter. We expect to
implement the phase-out plan and start accepting new applicants using the new MIS and testing
tool in 2016.
Financial Sector Reforms
21.
We remain committed to the ECCU regional strategy to strengthen the banking sector.
With the new regional legislative framework for bank regulation, supervision and resolution in place,
we are now, together with our regional partners, focused on addressing the results of the regional
asset quality review (AQR) and viability assessments on indigenous banks as well as the regional
assessment of potential mergers and/or groupings of assets and liabilities that could be attractive
for potential investors. We remain committed to taking immediate action as necessary to strengthen
the financial position of commercial banks operating in Grenada while safeguarding fiscal
sustainability. In this regard, we continue to work with the ECCB to determine an appropriate
strategy, in the context of a sustainable fiscal framework consistent with commitments under the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

GRENADA

IMF-supported programme and resumption of debt sustainability, to address weaknesses identified
in the Grenadian banking sector. Private sector solutions will be considered as a first best option to
address any weaknesses identified in Grenadian banks.
22.
We continue to strengthen regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector.
Following recommendations from CARTAC’s evaluation of the Grenada Authority for the Regulation
of Financial Institutions’ (GARFIN) operations and supervisory practices, we are in the process of
increasing staff to strengthen our oversight responsibilities. We are also working with CARTAC to
develop a national crisis management plan, as part of a regional project, to prepare for any potential
financial crisis that could arise from the failure of national financial institutions and/or cross-border
financial institutions with systemic reach.
23.
GARFIN has taken important steps to enhance supervision in the credit union sector,
including implementing risk-based supervision. Going forward, with technical assistance from
CARTAC, we will start conducting credit quality reviews and stress testing of the credit unions. To
strengthen the legislative framework for regulation and supervision, we have made amendments to
the Cooperative Societies Act, following consultations with industry, to standardize capital adequacy
requirements and provide guidance for investments. We expect to bring the revised Act into force
by the third quarter of 2016. In the interim, we are committed to issuing the uniform ECCU
regulations for the credit union sector which will provide support for the Cooperatives Societies Act.
24.
We continue to support the establishment of the Eastern Caribbean Financial Services
Regulatory Commission as the regional regulator and supervisor of the proposed single
insurance market in the ECCU. Regional public consultations on the regional Insurance Act are
coming to an end, with the draft Act expected to be submitted to the ECCB Monetary Council by
end-2016. We expect the single regulatory framework to be formally put into place in 2018. GARFIN
will continue its off-site supervision of insurers, through regular prudential meetings and review of
prudential returns. On-site examination of insurance companies is continuing and we plan to start
risk-based supervision in the next year.
25.
With regard to pensions, GARFIN has completed registering most of the pension plans
in Grenada. Offsite supervision has been completed for two-thirds of the pension funds through
review of audited financial statements and actuarial reports. We introduced detailed interim
reporting forms for the pension funds in October 2015 and anticipate starting to compile
consolidated statistics on financial performance and membership of the sector. To strengthen
prudential management of the pension funds, we held a second training workshop for trustees in
December 2015. We expect to start on-site supervision of the pension funds covering areas such as
asset/investment quality and corporate governance in the next year.
26.
We continue to place importance on strengthening our framework for anti-money
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). We recognize the potential
for heightened AML/CFT risks from the CBI programme and are committed to continued
strengthening of our due diligence framework for the programme, with appropriate AML/CFT
measures and oversight targeted to applicants and new citizens under the programme. More

GRENADA

generally, critical to a further strengthening of our AML/CFT regime will be the completion of a
national money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment. Given our limited capacity to
conduct the risk assessment, we are continuing our efforts to source technical assistance from our
international partners to complete this assessment.
Programme Monitoring
27.
The programme will be subject to semiannual reviews and semiannual performance criteria,
indicative targets and structural benchmarks, as well as continuous performance criteria. This is set
out in Tables 1-2 and in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). We
anticipate that the fifth and sixth reviews will take place on or after September 30, 2016 and March
31, 2017, respectively, and will require observance of the continuous performance criteria and of the
conditionality for end-June 2016 and end-December 2016, respectively. To facilitate programme
monitoring, we are committed to providing detailed statistical information as specified in the TMU.
Progress in the implementation of the policies under the programme may be monitored on a
quarterly basis through staff visits.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings between
the Grenada authorities and the IMF regarding the definitions of quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets for the programme supported by the arrangement under the ECF. It also
describes the modalities for assessing performance under the programme and the information
requirements for monitoring this performance. In addition, the TMU specifies the requirements
under the continuous structural benchmark with respect to the publication of citizenship-byinvestment statistics.
2.
Definitions. For the purpose of the programme, central government will cover all items
included in the government budget. The definition of debt is set out in the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended. External debt is defined as central government
contracted or guaranteed debt owed to creditors residing outside of Grenada, while domestic debt
covers central government contracted or guaranteed debt owed to residents of Grenada. Debt is
considered contracted when it is signed by the Executive and ratified by Parliament. For ease of
monitoring, all securities issued at the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) and debt
owed to the ECCB will be considered domestic debt.

I. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Cumulative Floor on the Central Government Primary Balance
3.
The central government primary balance will be measured from above the line, as: (a) total
revenue and grants of the central government, less (b) total non-interest expenditure of the central
government:


Total revenues and grants will record (i) project grants only to the extent that they have
been spent; (ii) budgetary grants (grants not earmarked for capital outlays) will be treated as
project grants and recorded when spent on capital outlays; and (iii) transfers from the
National Transformation Fund (NTF) for the settlement of arrears will be recorded as non-tax
revenue and treated similarly to the CBI receipts.



Expenditures will be recorded on an accrual basis, with: (a) budget execution data as
reported by the Ministry of Finance (MOF); supplemented by (b) data on unprocessed claims
to be collected and reported by the MOF.

4.
The central government primary balance will also be monitored from below the line, as the
negative sum of:
i.

72

Net domestic bank financing, which will be measured by the change in the domestic
banking system credit to the central government minus government deposits in the banking
system, as reported in the monetary survey. Domestic banking system credit to the central

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

government is defined as the sum of ECCB and commercial banks’ financing to the central
government.
ii.

Net nonbank financing, which will be measured by the: (a) net changes in holdings of
government securities by nonbanks; and (b) net borrowing from nonbank institutions. Items
(a) and (b) will be reported by the MOF and GARFIN respectively.

iii.

Net government issuance of securities in the Regional Government Securities Market
(RGSM) excluding holdings by the domestic banking and nonbanking system as captured in
point (i) and (ii) above.

iv.

Net external financing of the central government, defined as the sum of: (a) net
disbursements of project and non-project loans, including securitization; (b) net proceeds
from issuance of external debt; and (c) reduction in cash deposits held outside the domestic
financial system. The data will be reported by the MOF on a monthly basis.

v.

The change in the stock of arrears of the central government, measured as the net change in
(a) unpaid checks issued, (b) unprocessed claims, (c) pending invoices, (d) interest payments
past due, and (e) other forms of expenditures recorded above the line but not paid, such as
contributions to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). The data will be reported by Ministry
of Finance on a monthly basis.

vi.

Gross receipts from divestment, defined as proceeds received from any
privatization/divestment and sale of assets; and

vii.

Any exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest).

viii.

Less domestic and external interest payments on a due basis.

ix.

Less grants received but unutilized.

If the difference between the primary balance measured from above the line and from below the
line is larger than EC$6 million in 2015 and EC$3 million in 2016 the MOF will consult with IMF staff.
5.

The floor on the central government primary balance will be adjusted as follows:
i.

Upward by the amount of non-tax revenues in the budget from the citizenship-byinvestment (CBI) programme (CBI fees received by the government and payments from the
CBI Committee to central government) and the amount of transfers from the NTF for the
settlement of arrears.

ii.

In the event that revenues (excluding non-tax revenue from the CBI programme and
transfers from the NTF) exceed those projected under the programme, the primary balance
target for end-June 2016 will be adjusted upward by one half of the excess during JanuaryJune, to allow for additional capital spending while safeguarding compliance with the annual
fiscal targets. The Government will safeguard the over-performance in revenue achieved in
the first half of any year by increasing the capital budget allocations (¶20) for the last two
quarters of the year only up to 2/3 of the over-performance. The following table shows the

failed regional insurance companies BAICO and CLICO, less the grant-financed share of
these payments.

6.
The authorities will consult with IMF staff on corrective measures in the event of shortfalls in
government revenue and financing.

B. Cumulative Ceiling on Central Government Primary Spending
7.
Primary spending of the central government will be calculated as the sum of revenues and
grants that have been utilized minus the primary balance of the central government as measured
above in section A. The performance criterion on primary spending will be adjusted as follows:
i.

74

In the event that revenues (excluding non-tax revenue from the CBI programme and
transfers from the NTF) exceed those projected under the programme (table above), the
end-June 2016 target will be adjusted upward by one half of the excess during January-June,
to allow for additional capital spending and the end-December 2016 target will be adjusted
upward for the full amount of annual revenue over performance;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

ii.

Upward by the full amount of additional capital grants received in excess of programmed
levels (table above) and downward by half of any shortfall in capital grants compared to
programmed levels to safeguard the fiscal targets (table above).

iii.

Upward by half of the amount of budgetary grants, received and spent on capital outlays in
excess of programmed levels (table above).

iv.

Downward for any shortfall in the targeted cash transfers (SEED) from their indicative target.

v.

Upward by the cost of severance payments associated with the restructuring of Grenada
Concrete Emulsion and Production Corporation and the Grenada Postal Corporation (up to a
cumulative maximum of US$4 million);

vi.

Upward by the amount paid by the government to reimburse the policy holders of BAICO
and CLICO.

C. Ceiling on the Stock of Central Government Budget Expenditure Arrears
8.
Budget expenditure arrears are defined as the sum of: (i) any invoice that has been received
by a spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and capital goods delivered and verified,
and for which payment has not been made within the contractually agreed period (taking into
account any applicable contractual grace period),or in the absence of a grace period, within 60 days
after the due date; (ii) wages, pensions, or transfers (including to the Solid Waste Company), for
which payment has been pending for longer than 60 days to domestic or foreign residents; and (iii)
interest and amortization payments on domestic debt for which payment has not been made within
the contractually agreed period (taking into account any applicable contractual grace period).
Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been
agreed or a rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this definition. The data will
be reported by the Accountant General’s office.

D. Non-Accumulation of External Debt Arrears (Continuous)
9.
The central government will not incur new arrears in the payment of their external
obligations (contracted or guaranteed) at any time during the arrangement. Arrears are defined as a
payment of debt which has not been made within the contractually agreed period (taking into
account any applicable contractual grace period). Overdue membership fees to regional and
international organizations as well as arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for
which a clearance framework has been agreed or for which the government or the institution with
government guaranteed debt is actively and in good faith pursuing a debt restructuring are
excluded from this definition. The performance criterion will be applied on a continuous basis under
the programme.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

GRENADA

E. Ceiling on Contracting of Non-Concessional External Debt by the
Central Government (Continuous)
10.
The ceiling on non-concessional borrowing will be applied to the contracting or
guaranteeing by the central government of medium and long-term external debt (maturity greater
than one year). The ceiling includes adjustors for borrowing from the Caribbean Development Bank
and the World Bank (for development and debt management purposes), and for debt instruments
to be issued as part of a debt restructuring to improve the overall public debt profile, limited to the
nominal amount of debt restructured during a given period. The total amount of contracting of
non-concessional external debt from the World Bank under the adjustor will be strictly limited to
US$30 million, and the total amount of contracting of non-concessional external debt from the
Caribbean Development Bank under the adjustor will be strictly limited to US$30 million, both on a
cumulative basis from the beginning of 2016.Borrowing from the World Bank and the Caribbean
Development Bank will be closely monitored in cooperation with these institutions.
11.
The contracting and guaranteeing of non-concessional external debt will be monitored and
reported to the Fund staff by the Debt Management Unit (DMU), after reconciliation with the
Accountant General’s office, on a monthly basis. The government will undertake to consult with IMF
staff on the terms and concessionality of any proposed new debt in advance of contracting such
external debt. The performance criterion will be applied on a continuous basis under the
programme.
12.
A debt is non-concessional if the grant element in net present value (PV) terms relative to
face value is less than 35 percent. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.
13.
For debts carrying a variable interest rate in the form of a benchmark interest rate plus a
fixed spread, the PV of the debt would be calculated using a programme reference rate plus the
fixed spread (in basis points) specified in the debt contract. The programme reference rate for the
six-month USD LIBOR is 3.34 percent and will remain fixed for the duration of the programme. The
spread of six-month Euro LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -250 basis points. The spread of sixmonth JPY LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -300 basis points. The spread of six-month GBP
LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -100 basis points. For interest rates on currencies other than
Euro, JPY, and GDP, the spread over six-month USD LIBOR is -200 basis points.1 Where the variable
rate is linked to a benchmark interest rate other than the six-month USD LIBOR, a spread reflecting
the difference between the benchmark rate and the six-month USD LIBOR (rounded to the nearest
50 bps) will be added.

The programme reference rate and spreads are based on the “average projected rate” for the six-month USD
LIBOR over the following 10 years from the October 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO).

II. INDICATIVE TARGETS
F. Cumulative Ceiling on Net Change in Central Government and Central
Government Guaranteed Debt
14.
The net change in central government and central government guaranteed debt is defined
as the difference in the stock of central government and central government guaranteed debt
between two specified periods. For programme purposes, the stock of central government and
central government guaranteed debt is measured under the disbursement basis.
15.
In cases where the government facilitates the financing of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
projects by concessionaires, the debt of the central government will be increased by the present
value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of
the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the
property.
16.
The ceiling on the net change in central government and central government guaranteed
debt will be adjusted as follows:


Upward by the amount paid by the government to reimburse the policy holders BAICO and
CLICO, less the grant-financed share of these payments.



Upward to a maximum amount of 5 percent of GDP to accommodate PPP related expenditures.



Downward by the amount of nominal debt forgiveness in the case of debt restructuring



Upward for the cost of severance payments associated with the restructuring of Grenada
Concrete Emulsion and Production Corporation and the Grenada Postal Corporation (up to a
cumulative maximum of US$4 million).

17.
The data used to monitor the net change in central government and central government
guaranteed debt will be provided by the DMU, after reconciliation with the Accountant General’s
office, on a monthly basis.

G. Indicative Floor on the Social Spending by the Central Government
18.
The indicative floor on social spending of the central government will apply only to
expenditures incurred by the central government on the SEED programme (Support for Education
Empowerment and Development). Spending under the SEED programme will be reported by the
Ministry of Finance on a quarterly basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank (ECCB) is subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four-year cycle. Previous assessments
were completed in 2003, 2007, and 2012. An update assessment is substantially completed and finds
that the ECCB has maintained generally strong controls over its key operations. External audit and
financial reporting practices remain sound. ECCB financial statements are compliant with
International Financial Reporting Standards and are published on a timely basis. The internal audit
function needs to be reformed to align it with leading international practices and oversight could be
further strengthened by enhancing the financial expertise of the audit committee.
Exchange Arrangement: Grenada is a member for the ECCB, which manages monetary
policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean
dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In
practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing
of its currency and demand liabilities of close to 100 percent. Grenada accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in January 1994. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: Grenada is on a 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 26, 2014 (IMF Country Report No.
14/196).
FSAP Participation: Grenada participated in the regional Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
FSAP conducted in September and October 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment is
IMF Country Report No. 04/293.
Technical Assistance:
Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC)
CARTAC has provided wide-ranging technical assistance (TA) to Grenada, the highest user of
CARTAC TA over the FY15-16 period to date (93.2 weeks or 8.7 percent of total TA delivery).



Public Finance Management. CARTAC TA in PFM has focused on reform of state-owned
enterprises and statutory bodies, cash forecasting and commitment control, development and
transition to a new chart of accounts consistent with GFSM2014, and a PEFA assessment.
Assistance was also provided on strategic budget reform to modernize the budget preparation
process. In the area of SOE/SB reform, CARTAC provided in 2014 TA to develop a strategy to
reform the sector, with recommendations for both the overall sector and individual institutions.
Assistance was also provided to develop a dividend policy for SOEs and an employment directive
for SOEs and SBs, draft regulations for the National Transformation Fund to guide the
transparent receipt and use of citizenship-by-investment funds, and to assess public pension
reform options. TA priorities going forward will be guided by the authorities’ PFM Action Plan

and building further depth in capacity in cash forecasting and commitment control and SOE/SB
oversight.


Tax Administration. TA has been provided to strengthen tax administration at both the Inland
Revenue and Customs Departments. At IRD, support included establishing a Large and Medium
Taxpayer Unit and a Design, Planning and Monitoring Section.



Financial Stability. Supervision and Regulation. Significant TA has been provided to the Grenada
Authority for the Regulation of Financial Institutions (GARFIN) to implement risk-based
supervision for the non-banking sector. CARTAC also conducted a review of GARFIN’s
supervisory framework for non-banks to ensure consistency with international standards. TA was
also provided, as part of the broader ECCU-wide initiative, to conduct dynamic modeling (stress
testing).



Macroeconomic framework and statistics. To support the authorities’ efforts to put in place an
annual medium-term economic framework to guide the annual Budget, CARTAC provided TA to
strengthen medium-term macroeconomic projections. TA was also provided to produce balance
of payments statistics according to BPM6 and to initiate the production of IIP statistics.

Other Technical Assistance (2014–16)
FAD and LEG have provided extensive assistance in tax policy and administration, public financial
management and on public expenditure rationalization. In particular, technical assistance was
provided in the design and drafting of the PFM legislation and the Tax Administration legislation,
reforms of the tax incentives system, and reform of the following Acts: income tax, property, VAT,
excise tax. FAD also provided comprehensive technical assistance to draft the Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 2015. MCM provided TA on formulating a medium-term debt management strategy and
implementing institutional changes to strengthen debt management and, together with LEG,
provided TA to draft the Public Debt Management Act of 2015.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 22, 2016)

World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: On November 13, 2014, the Executive
Board of the World Bank Group endorsed the new OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for
FY15-19. The high-level objective of the new RPS is to contribute to lay the foundations for
sustainable inclusive growth, in line with the OECS governments’ priorities. To achieve this goal, the
program is organized around three main areas of engagement. In the first area, the WBG will support
“competitiveness”. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported both
horizontally—by improving the business environment—and vertically, by focusing on specific sectors
with a high potential to generate inclusive sustainable growth (particularly tourism, agribusiness and
their respective linkages). The second area of engagement is “public sector modernization”, with
particular focus on public financial management (PFM) and institutional capacity, including for
statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better leverage private investment in
infrastructure and service provision. The third area is “resilience”, with the objective to address both
social vulnerabilities (in education, health and social protection) and exposure to natural disasters.
Constrained in general by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will contribute
to the RPS objectives through selective investment support, depending on opportunities. The IFC will
focus on crisis response; job creation and inclusive growth; innovation, competitiveness, and
integration; and climate change. MIGA faces limited opportunities for engagement because of the
small market size of the OECS countries.
The RPS is grounded in a holistic approach to tackling the long-standing issues of low growth
and debt sustainability in the Caribbean, i.e., the Comprehensive Debt Framework, developed
in 2010 by the Bank at the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM countries.
Structured around four pillars, the Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF) is designed to address the
interdependent structural causes of high debt and low growth in small island states by (i) promoting
private-sector led growth, (ii) strengthening fiscal management, (iii) building resilience to natural
disasters, and (iv) improving debt management. Governments of the OECS recognize the
multifaceted nature of the challenges they face and understand that improvements in
competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to ensure macro sustainability,
and enhanced sustainability and resilience to shocks are interrelated aspects that are critical to
resume and sustain inclusive growth. As a result, they have used the CDF to frame their own reform
strategies and activities.
The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS countries is expected to be around US$120
million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country for the period of the RPS (FY1519), subject to country and program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure
management parameters. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica, Grenada,
St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national allocation. The
IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an increase of around
22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 million). With regard to Grenada, its IDA-17
allocation is equal to SDR 14.1 million (roughly USD 19.7 million at today’s exchange rate).

A. Projects
The Second Programmatic Resilience Building Development Policy Credit and Loan (DPL/DPC)
for the proposed amount of the equivalent of US$15 million (SDR7.2 million equivalent to US$10
million and US$5 million) was approved by the World Bank Board on October 28, 2015. This is the
second operation in a programmatic series of three Development Policy Credits/Loans aimed at
supporting the Government’s national development strategy with a focus on policy and institutional
measures to sustain economic growth, restore fiscal sustainability and build resilience against
adverse weather events. This DPC/DPL series is aligned with the Regional Partnership Strategy for
the OECS for the period 2015-19. Specifically, it is aligned with the following identified objectives:
(i) improved investment climate; (ii) increased tourism benefits with stronger linkages to
agribusiness; (iii) improved budget management and transparency; (iv) strengthened capacity to
manage PPPs; (v) improved targeting and reduced fragmentation of the social-protection system;
and (vi) increased capacity to manage natural hazards.
The DPC/DPL series is designed to support Grenada in implementing a program of policy and
institutional reforms to: (i) create conditions for private investment in a sustainable manner;
(ii) support improved public resource management; and (iii) enhance resilience against natural
disasters and key elements of resilience in the banking sector. The program consists of three pillars.
The first pillar seeks to improve the business environment to promote private-sector led growth by
strengthening the regulatory framework for the tourism sector; promoting the modernization of the
agribusiness sector; and mobilizing private investment through a public-private partnership (PPP)
policy framework. The second pillar focuses on enhancing the effectiveness with which the public
sector utilizes its limited resources by strengthening public procurement systems and improving the
targeting of social safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. The third pillar emphasizes on:
(i) building resilience to natural disasters through an improved physical planning regulatory system;
and (ii) improving key elements of banking sector resilience through better regulation and
supervision.
The series is part of a multi-donor engagement which promotes key reforms in Grenada and
complements concurrent operations by the IMF, anchored by a 36-month IMF Extended Credit
Facility, and the Caribbean Development Bank. This DPC/DPL series supports the Government’s
long-term efforts to address systemic vulnerabilities by targeting structural reforms in the areas of
private sector development and fiscal management.
The Caribbean Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) is a broad umbrella
program to include all interested CARIFORUM countries.1 It offers a menu of choices with specific
components to be tailored to each country's priorities. The menu of options are: (a) ICT
Connectivity—to increase access and affordability of broadband communications networks within
CARIFORUM comprises the 15 Caribbean countries of CARICOM (i.e., Antigua and Barbuda,
Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and
Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago), and the Dominican
Republic.

region and countries; (b) E-Government—to contribute to improved Government efficiency and
transparency through the delivery of e-services, including e-government and e-society applications;
and (c) IT Industry—to contribute to the development of the regional and national IT industry. Phase
1 of the Program was approved by the Board on May 22, 2012 with Grenada (US$10 million IDA),
St. Lucia (US$6 million IDA) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6 million IDA) as participating
countries. Additional countries can join since this is a comprehensive program that seeks to increase
access to regional broadband networks and advance the development of an ICT-enabled services
industry in the Caribbean Region. The project is currently going through restructuring.
The Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) Project (Grenada and St. Lucia) was
approved in June 2011. The objective of this project is to establish and operationalize a regional
approach to the development of the electricity sector in the OECS, by supporting the establishment
of a regional regulator. Currently, Grenada and Saint Lucia have used IDA credit (with US$2.8 million
each, for a total of US$5.6 million) for the design and operationalization of ECERA. The design phase
is coordinated by the OECS Secretariat. Component A of this project will facilitate the creation and
launching of the ECERA, including carrying out the legal and consultative process leading to the
formulation and ratification of the ECERA treaty, and defining the options for the ECERA
self-financing mechanism, reviewing tariffs, and examining incentive mechanisms to promote
renewable energy. Component B will facilitate the initial three years of ECERA’s operations, including
the day-to-day operations and execution of core regulatory tasks including: (i) tariff and investment
plan reviews; and (ii) defining a regional licensing framework for electricity market participants with
a particular focus on facilitating the integration of electricity production from renewable sources into
the supply mix. The project is currently going through restructuring.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in June 2011. Grenada will
receive a total of US$26.2 million, including a US$10 million zero-interest credit from IDA repayable
in 35 years with a 10-year grace period; a US$8 million grant from the Caribbean Regional Pilot
Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR); and an US$8.2 million zero-interest loan from PPCR
repayable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. The project aims to create understanding of the
vulnerability of key structures and increase resilience of critical public infrastructure, which will
complement the work and goals of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. Component 1 will
implement a broad spectrum of interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and
infrastructure. Component 2 will support regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to build capacity
to conduct assessment of natural risks and integrate such knowledge into policy- and decisionmaking for development investments, disaster risk mitigation, climate change adaptation, and
disaster response planning across sectors. Component 3 will re-categorize financing or provide
additional financing to cover early recovery and rehabilitation costs following an adverse natural
event, and subject to a Government’s declaration of emergency in accordance with national law and
the submission of a recovery action plan satisfactory to the Association. Component 4 will
strengthen and develop the institutional capacity for project management and implementation.
The Grenada Safety Net Advancement Project was approved in June 2011 for US$5 million. The
project aims to (i) strengthen the basic architecture of the consolidated Conditional Cash Transfer

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

GRENADA

(CCT) Program and the capacity of the Ministry of Social Development to implement it; (ii) improve
coverage of poor households receiving cash transfers; and (iii) improve education outcomes of poor
children and health monitoring of vulnerable households. Component 1 will finance cash transfers to
beneficiaries. Disbursements will be made against meeting performance milestones aimed at the
gradual adoption of an overhauled business model in results areas including institutions; budget
and coverage; beneficiary outreach and targeting; management information systems and making
payments against co-responsibilities; communication; and monitoring and evaluation. Component 2
will provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) for improving its
management, coordination, supervision, monitoring, and evaluation of the newly consolidated
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, including the design of a PMT, a MIS, and an impact
evaluation. The project is currently going through restructuring.
In spring 2015 the WB has conducted a Country Portfolio Performance Review in the OECS
countries. Some of the main findings regarding the portfolio review in Grenada are the following:
(i) country context needs to be better understood and taken into account during project
preparation; (ii) institutional strengthening of national agencies in charge of monitoring projects,
beyond the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), is needed to make sure that projects contribute to
build national capacity; (iii) training initiatives are critical, particularly on fiduciary training; (iv) a
more comprehensive and flexible approach to facilitate procurement in small states is needed;
(v) Government processes are sometimes complex or slow and cause delays; (vi) Collaboration needs
to improve both internally, among line ministries, and at the Bank, to ensure consistency of
messages and clear communication with the client; and (vii) lack of technical staff is an issue and
causes delays in completing activities by the deadline.

B. Non-Lending Activities
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) - The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multi-stakeholder
platform designed to identify, prioritize and implement a set of activities to improve the growth
enabling environment in the Caribbean, while promoting participatory public policy making. It has
so far engaged more than 2,500 representatives from business associations, civil society
organizations, Government, private sector, media, indigenous groups, and international
development agencies on themes such as Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; and, Skills
and Productivity.
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight of the top
twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of crime, and, growing
vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of the global financial crisis, the
high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the growth challenge in the region. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the program

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported and facilitated
by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank,
Compete Caribbean and the European Union.
Key Outcomes
Positive outcomes are tangible: twelve countries formally joined the process by establishing their
national CGF chapter and have completed the first phase of national dialogue. This effort has led to
the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities and draft action plans are now available, with
details on each activity’ implementation plan (e.g., accountabilities, milestones, timeline, funding).
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at three regional forum in The Bahamas in
June 2013, in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, and in St. Lucia in June 2015. This allowed national
stakeholders from government, private sector and civil society to compare notes on each other’s’
priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each identified challenge with technical specialists and
peers. Each government involved in the CGF also committed to follow-up on implementation of the
reform agenda, to report back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months) and to enable
independent monitoring of the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives.
Comprehensive Debt Framework - At the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM, the
Bank put together a Comprehensive Debt Framework that proposes a strategy for addressing the
high debt challenge faced in the OECS in a sustainable way. This Framework proposes a holistic
approach around four interdependent pillars (Supporting private sector led growth, including
private sector development and financial sector stability; enhancing fiscal sustainability; improving
climate change resilience and Disaster Risk Management; and debt resolution). The Framework has
been rolled out in all the OECS, including Grenada. The Governments expressed interest in principle,
in continuing to work with the World Bank and other development partners to develop policy
measures that could help stimulate growth and reduce debt in the country.
In terms of analytical products, the Bank has completed a series of studies related to public
expenditure, fiscal and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public
sector management and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a
key instrument for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including Grenada.
The Bank’s program in Grenada is further supported by a comprehensive series of completed,
ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a New
Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); an OECS Skills Enhancement
Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a regional study on Crime, Violence,
and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007); an OECS Private Sector
Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study (2008); the report titled
“Caribbean – Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and
Poverty Reduction” (2009); a study on the Nurse Labor & Education Markets in the English-Speaking

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 31, 2016)
Over the period 1970-2015, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved US$250.36
million (net) in loans, contingent loans, equity and grants to the Government of Grenada;
representing 6.3% of total approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries. CDB’s lending has
mainly been in the area of social and economic infrastructure, aimed at improving the country’s
growth potential in order to reduce poverty.
CDB is in its second year of implementing its Country Assistance Strategy 2014-18. The Strategy’s
priority sector outcomes are:
(i)

Improved macroeconomic management. Two Policy-Based Loans (PBLs) in the amounts of
US$10 million each were disbursed (in 2014 and 2015) in support of the Government’s
Home-Grown Structural Reform Program. The two PBLs are part of a programmatic series of
three loans totaling US$30 million.

(ii)

Increased access to high quality education and training. Continued support for the
education sector development strategy with components relating to: ongoing restoration of
school infrastructure; a heightened focus on quality and relevance to improve student
outcomes; alignment of education and training with the needs of the economy; policy
development; and strengthening strategic leadership and planning capacity.

(iii)

Improved access by the poor to basic infrastructure and services through communitydriven development. The Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) Seventh and Eighth programs will
be providing community-driven grant resources for education and human resource
development, water and sanitation, and access and drainage.

(iv)

Enhanced social policy/social protection and research. The Bank is assisting with the
development and implementation of a Gender Policy. Additionally, the Bank will assist in the
conduct of a new poverty assessment to help the Government in poverty monitoring and
evidence-based decision-making.

(v)

Improved environmental sustainability and land use management. In light of the
challenges of environmental degradation and the need to build a sustainable solid waste
system, the Bank has identified interventions to assist in the development of a land use
policy; help implement adaptation measures for select communities affected by climate
change; and assist in the development of environmentally sound solid waste options.

(vi)

Enhanced energy efficiency and renewable energy development. CDB will help remove
the binding constraints to the achievement of policy targets with respect to energy efficiency
and the development of renewable energy options.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

(vii)

Improved economic infrastructure. CDB will assist in financing outstanding work that
contributes to the redevelopment of the town of Grenville through improvements in key
urban infrastructure. Three of four sub-components are already complete.

Major projects under implementation include:
1.

Grenville Market Square Development—this project was designed to address issues of
poor quality infrastructure in the market square, unhygienic practices in relation to the
slaughter of animals, and issues of vehicular and pedestrian congestion as a result of a bus
terminal within the environs of the market.

2.

Schools Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project II—the major issues addressed by this
project are the inadequacy of the physical learning environment, the need for curricula
refocusing, and the enhancement of instructional modalities in the school system.

3.

Market Access and Rural Enterprise Development—Jointly funded with the International
Fund for Agricultural Development, this project seeks to enhance the livelihood of rural
communities through the strengthening and establishment of rural businesses/clusters, the
upgrading of technical and business skills, and the provision of affordable credit.

4.

Rehabilitation and Reconstruction - Extreme Rainfall Event—the objective of this project
is to reduce risks associated with landslides and flood hazards in the parishes of
St. Mark and St. John. This objective is being realized through ongoing rehabilitation and
reconstruction of damaged roads including landslip repairs, bridge restoration, and flood
mitigation works.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 31, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: A rebased GDP series (using 2006 as the base year) was released in October
2010 with assistance from CARTAC. The new series improved coverage, data sources, and
methodology. Administrative data from revenue agencies are used to supplement the coverage of
survey-based results for industries such as hotels and restaurants, manufacturing, and wholesale and
retail trade. Education, health and social work are now identified as separate industries, and public
components of these services, formerly included under government, have now been reclassified.
However, some weakness remain; data on GDP broken down by expenditure is not available at
constant prices, while data at current prices is not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross
capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual.
Prices and high frequency statistics: The authorities provide regular data on consumer prices,
retail sales, agricultural production and purchases, motor vehicles registration, total cargo handled,
fish production and export, industrial production, imports of construction material, water and
electricity production. The 2010 revisions of the CPI series assured that the new series met
international standards. A new CPI basket, including several additional items, has been developed
using data from the 2007/08 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), with a strong
recommendation to conduct the HIES on a five-year cycle to ensure more timely future updates
than the current ten-year period. The new series are re-referenced to January 2010 and historical CPI
series back to 2001 have been recalculated based on the new structure. Producer prices, export and
import price indices are not available.
Labor statistics: Labor statistics are improving. The authorities introduced an annual Labor Force
Survey in 2013, which was completed again in 2014 and 2015. The first labor demand survey was
conducted in 2015, the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, but these results have not been
finalized or released, pending processing and verification. A population census was completed in
2011. Regular wage data are not available with the exception of partial data available from the
National Insurance Scheme. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) conducted a Country Poverty
Assessment in 2008, with assistance from the Caribbean Development Bank, and is working with the
International Labor Organization (ILO) to improve the coverage of labor market statistics.
Government finance statistics: The reporting of central government data has improved in recent
years, with monthly data being provided to the ECCB, IMF, and other users in Fund economic
classification format with lags of about 4–6 weeks. However, some challenges remain with the
accuracy and timeliness of the capital expenditure data: (i) the composition of public expenditure
appears to be inaccurate as many current spending items are classified as capital spending; and (ii)
donor-financed capital spending data are often not available until the end of the year, as they are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

GRENADA

not reported to or do not pass through the accounts of the central government. The new Chart of
Accounts introduced in 2016 should help to ameliorate these challenges. The coverage of the rest of
the public sector has improved, but remains limited, and there are no consolidated public sector
accounts. For the first time, financial information on selected public enterprises was included in the
Budget 2016. This is consistent with the requirement in the new Public Finance Management (PFM)
Act of 2015 that the Minister of Finance present a statement of the overall performance of all
enterprises to Parliament alongside the budget proposals. The PFM Act also requires public
enterprises to submit annual financial statements no later than three months from the end of the
fiscal year to the Director of Audit and the Minister of Finance.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis and reported
regularly to the Fund, and is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are being strengthened. The ECCB is preparing
new BOP survey forms, which will include trade in services and provide a better coverage of foreign
direct investment. In the medium term, the improved forms will allow for the presentation of the
BOP in the Extended Balance of Payments Services (EBOPS) and for the preparation of the
International Investment Position (IIP). However, due to delays in updating the software to reflect
changes to the survey form, the new data are incomplete and will not be finalized until late-2016.
Merchandise trade statistics have traditionally been more reliable and are available by SITC
classification on a quarterly basis.
External and domestic debt statistics: The database for central government external debt is
comprehensive, and can be used to provide detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of
disbursements and debt service, including future projections. There is also a detailed database on
domestic government securities maintained by the Regional Governments Securities Market (RGSM)
that provides data on auction results, and outstanding securities of the central government.
Although the stock information on privately placed domestic T-bills, loans, bonds, and overdraft
facilities are available on a monthly basis, there is no reliable data on future projections. Data
availability on government-guaranteed debt and debt of public enterprises is limited, and there is
no data on private external debt.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
While Grenada has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System since March 2001,
most of the metadata have not been updated since late 2002.
III.
Reporting to STA
The International Financial Statistics page includes data on exchange rates, international liquidity,
monetary statistics, prices, balance of payments, national accounts, and population. The authorities
do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The ECCB provides data to the IMF for publication in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook. Grenada has not provided any fiscal data, either on a GFSM
2001 basis, or a cash basis, for presentation in the GFS Yearbook. The ECCB disseminates Grenada’s
quarterly GFS data in its Economic and Financial Review.

While prospects for a restoration of external debt sustainability have improved
significantly, Grenada’s external debt remains in distress absent completion of the broader
debt restructuring and clearance of arrears to all official creditors. The comprehensive
restructuring of Grenada’s public debt is nearing completion. Agreements have been
implemented with creditors representing over two thirds of total debt under negotiation.
Combined, the agreements to date are expected to reduce public debt by about 15 percent
of GDP by 2018 and will also provide cash flow relief. Significant progress has been made
to clear arrears, with all budget expenditure arrears cleared by end-2015 and three
fourths of arrears to external creditors regularized. This marks a critical milestone toward
restoring liquidity to the domestic economy, entrenching the economic recovery underway
and regularizing financial relations with external creditors. Nevertheless, completion of
the debt restructuring and continued fiscal discipline will be needed to keep debt on a
downward path and restore its sustainability.

GRENADA

RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
This annex provides an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) of Grenada’s public debt.
The DSA incorporates all debt restructuring agreements executed with external and domestic creditors as
of 2016Q1 (table) as well as the agreement in principle reached in November 2015 with Paris Club bilateral
creditors to reschedule outstanding Paris Club debts and arrears. 1 2 The baseline scenario does not assume
any additional debt restructuring on other debt (external or domestic) under restructuring negotiations.
Compared to the previous DSA, the short-run economic outlook has improved. Activity remains strong,
driven by tourism and construction and underpinned by stronger than anticipated activity in 2015. Growth
is revised upward compared to the forecast in the Third Review reflecting the expected positive impulse
from the further oil price decline as well as steady growth in key tourism export markets. In the mediumterm, growth is assumed to return to its potential of 2.7 percent, which has been revised upward from
2.5 percent in the previous DSA. Price inflation has stayed slightly negative as energy prices remain low
while unemployment is high at 30 percent. The external position continues to strengthen owing to strong
tourism receipts, lower oil prices and robust private capital inflows.3

Grenada’s debt restructuring is nearing completion. Restructuring agreements have now been
reached with creditors representing about 64 percent of total debt under restructuring negotiations valued
at 34 percent of GDP (text figure). As of end-2015, the agreements executed with Grenada’s external
creditors have lowered the debt-to-GDP ratio by 8 percentage points and, once the agreement with
Grenada’s private bondholders is fully executed, a further 6 percentage point decline is anticipated in
2017.4 Agreements to restructure domestic debt are expected to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio by

With the progress achieved on debt restructuring and fiscal consolidation, Grenada’s public
debt has continued to decline from its 2013 peak. Public debt declined to 94.3 percent of GDP in 2015
from 101.4 in 2014 after peaking at 107.6 percent in 2013. The reduction in public debt in 2015 was less
than anticipated at the third review (4 percent of GDP). This was associated with the authorities’ strategy to
clear more domestic arrears with debt issuance rather than cash, as anticipated by staff. This contributed to
a build up of government deposits. Public debt is now expected to decline to 73 percent of GDP by 2018,
with about 15 percentage points of the

thresholds on the present value of the debtto-GDP, debt service-to-revenue, and debt to-exports ratios are breached (Figure I).7 These breaches to the thresholds in the baseline scenario are
relatively minor and temporary in nature, suggesting that Grenada’s external risk of debt distress is a
borderline high-moderate risk case. To complement the baseline scenario analysis and results, the
probability approach focusing on the evolution of the probability of debt distress over time, rather than on
the evolution of debt burden indicators, was also considered (Figure 2). The results show similar, but
accentuated, breaches to the baseline scenario thresholds, which lends support to a high external risk
rating for Grenada. However, the ongoing debt restructuring and existence of arrears to official creditors
means that Grenada’s external debt remains in distress.
5.
The DSA includes a shock scenario to assess the potential impact of a natural disaster on
debt sustainability. As a small Caribbean island economy, Grenada is highly vulnerable to natural disasters
(i.e. hurricanes). Over 1980-2014 average annual damages from natural disasters in Grenada are estimated
at 6.9 percent of GDP. Two particularly damaging hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 (Hurricanes Ivan and Emily)
with estimated damages of 148 and 31 percent of GDP, respectively, account for the majority of average
annual storm damages over this time period.8 In the shock scenario, a natural disaster is expected to occur
in 2016, with the fiscal response calibrated to be consistent with that of the hurricanes experienced in
2004/2005. The government is assumed to increase its expenditure by a total of 5 percent of GDP in the
two years following the hurricane (2.5 percentage points in each 2017 and 2018) to cover reconstruction
costs following a simulated disaster in 2016. Based on the estimated relationship between growth and
natural disasters in the Caribbean and the ECCU (Acevedo, 2014), growth is expected to decline by 0.7
percentage points in 2016, and 1.3 percentage points in 2017.9 The new lower growth path will have an
impact on revenues which are expected to decline in line with the decrease in nominal growth, resulting in

The Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) ranks Grenada as a medium performer (the average CPIA in
2012–14 is 3.56).

Other storms during this period include Hurricane Lenny (1999), Arthur (1990) and Allen (1980).

unchanged revenue to GDP ratio. This shock results in a debt path that is about 8 percent of GDP higher
than in the baseline by 2020.
6.
Absent completion of all debt restructuring steps and the clearance of arrears to all official
creditors, Grenada’s external debt remains “in distress”. Completion of the debt restructuring with
private creditors holding the U.S. and EC dollar commercial bonds and with the NIS have put public and
external debt on a firm downward trajectory toward sustainability. Execution of the recent Paris Club
agreement will further assist in the restoration of debt sustainability. Nevertheless, completion of the
broader restructuring with remaining external and domestic creditors remains critical to restoring debt
sustainability. Continued efforts to strengthen debt recording and monitoring, including by finalizing the
planned medium-term debt strategy, will be important complements to debt restructuring and fiscal
consolidation to strengthen debt sustainability.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming and offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
