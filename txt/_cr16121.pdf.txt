IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Slovenia

On May 9, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Slovenia and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.2
Slovenia saw reasonable economic growth in 2014–15, buoyed by rising exports and a spike in
public investment. The external position strengthened, reflecting robust exports and strong
tourism but also lackluster domestic demand and falling commodity prices. Financial stability
returned, following the 2013–14 public sector bailout of state-owned banks. Headline inflation
remains negative, but should turn positive as oil prices stabilize.
Going forward, growth is projected to taper this year as EU financing for public investment
declines. Over the medium term, further substantial investment- and productivity-enhancing
reforms will be needed to resume the steady convergence of Slovenia’s per capita income toward
levels enjoyed in the richer parts of the European Union.
Reforms continue as a lot has to be done. Non-performing loans have been reduced, but the
process remains work in progress, especially for small and medium enterprises. The performance
of state-owned enterprises needs to be decisively strengthened and state control over large
swathes of the economy reduced. The budget deficit (ESA definition) fell below 3 percent of
GDP in 2015 and a fiscal rule targeting a zero structural fiscal balance in the medium term was
approved. However, significant consolidation measures are needed to reach this objective.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with the Slovenia, Executive Directors endorsed
the staff’s appraisal as follows:
While growth has returned, Slovenia could grow faster and more sustainably. To sustain the
reasonable growth rates from 2014–15 given the expected drop in public investment, private
investment needs to play a much stronger role than at present. This would buttress capital
formation and productivity, strengthening actual and potential growth over the medium term.
Moreover, important fiscal and financial vulnerabilities need to be addressed.
Swift policy actions are needed to stimulate private investment and reduce vulnerabilities. There
are four key priorities: (i) move NPLs off state-owned banks books and encourage SME balance
sheets repair; (ii) divest state-owned banks and nudge banks to rethink their business models;
(iii) put in place a comprehensive fiscal adjustment package underpinned by structural measures;
and (iv) reform and privatize more SOEs, and address key bottlenecks in the business
environment.
It is time to decisively deal with bank NPLs and SME debt. Lingering non-performing loans and
excess corporate debt, particularly on SME books, impair the credit channel for investment. The
new guidelines for SME NPL resolution are an important step to address NPLs of viable SMEs.
A privately-funded entity (SPV) to bundle and sell non-performing SME loans, established with
the state’s support, would help resolve NPLs even more quickly.
Continued state control of banks creates risks of interference in their lending decisions. Business
decisions in the state-owned banks should continue to be based on commercial principles,
maintaining an arms-length relationship with the state. To improve the chances for successful
bank sales, the authorities should reconsider their plan to limit the stakes of potential investors.
And the planned sale of Abanka only by July 2019 is an unnecessary delay that would miss an
opportunity to restore a fully competitive market for bank services and may negatively affect the
bank’s performance.
BAMC’s operational independence should be respected. This will allow BAMC’s management
to carry out its mandate to maximize the value of its claims, thereby lowering the final cost of the
2013 bank bailout.
Bank business models need considerable adjustment to profitably weather a prolonged period of
low interest rates. Low bank profits pose risks to bank capital and thus financial stability in the
event of an adverse shock. To thrive sustainably, banks need to proactively and substantially
reconsider their cost structures and revenue sources. At the same time, banks should maintain
adequate lending standards to avoid a resurgence of NPLs.

The narrowing of the budget deficit over the last two years is only the first step to putting the
fiscal house in order. The planned adjustment in 2016 is also welcome. But the deficit and debt
will start rising again in 2017 under current policies. Barring large adverse shocks, we
recommend an annual structural adjustment effort of 0.6 percent of GDP in primary terms until
the overall structural balance reaches zero. Afterwards, the structural balance should be held at
zero until debt falls below 60 percent of GDP.
The needed fiscal adjustment should be achieved through a comprehensive package of structural
reforms to strengthen policy credibility. A key element in such a strategy would be a multi-year
agreement with labor unions that keeps the wage bill affordable. In addition,
efficiency-improving reforms can save money in the health and education sectors without
undermining the quality of service. Pension reforms, such as further extending the retirement age
and indexing pensions to consumer price inflation, are also critical in view of the deteriorating
demographics. Growth-friendly revenue measures, such as the introduction of a real estate tax,
would help as well. A revenue-neutral reduction in labor taxes would support employment
creation.
Aggressive SOE reform, coupled with further improvements in the business environment, could
boost potential growth. The number of companies where the state plans to retain control should
be significantly reduced. Performance criteria set for SOE managers should aim at performance
comparable to that of private companies and should encourage disposal of the non-core assets
owned by the SOEs. Moreover, changes to facilitate greater equity financing and reduce the jobskills mismatch would also invigorate employment and investment.

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 22, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Slovenia’s output contracted deeply in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,
which spilled into a bank and sovereign debt crisis in 2012–13. A costly bank
recapitalization, alongside restored sovereign market access, stabilized the financial
system and helped launch an export-led recovery in 2014–15.
Outlook and risks: Despite the recent recovery, significant constraints to growth and
important vulnerabilities need to be decisively addressed. An SME debt overhang and
high public debt are key bottlenecks. While the authorities have made progress in
addressing these weaknesses, significant work remains to be done.
Financial and corporate sector: Financial stability has improved, though the
non-performing loan ratios at large state-owned banks remain elevated. Despite recent
deleveraging, many small and medium companies are over-indebted and unable to
adequately service their liabilities. Further efforts to resolve non-performing loans,
particularly to SMEs, and privatization of major banks will be essential to strengthen the
financial system and revive credit to support investment and growth. The operational
independence of the Bank Asset Management Company is critical for its ability to
successfully unwind its portfolio.
Fiscal policy: Despite the declining general government budget deficit over the past
two years, fiscal adjustment is far from complete. The deep recession, persistent budget
deficits, and the cost of bank recapitalization quadrupled public debt to over
83 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2015. A comprehensive consolidation strategy is
needed to reduce public debt, create room to absorb potential adverse shocks, and
prepare for coming demographic challenges.
Structural reforms: State enterprises are more indebted and less profitable than their
private counterparts. Low productivity growth, low profitability, and insider capture in
these enterprises are drags on the economy and drains on the public purse. The state
asset management strategy should be revised to allow for controlling stakes to be sold
in more state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to strategic investors. Moreover, ambitious
performance targets and accountability for their achievement could improve SOEs’
results. Measures to improve the judicial system, address a job-skills mismatch, and
foster equity financing would also raise potential growth.

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

CONTEXT
1.
Growth has returned, but crisis legacies continue to weigh on Slovenia’s economy. In
the boom years prior to the 2008 global crisis, state banks imprudently engaged in risky lending.
When the crisis hit, banks access to external funding was abruptly cut. Moreover, Slovenia’s highly
leveraged corporations found it difficult to service their debts. Nonperforming loans (NPLs)
accumulated on bank books, credit contracted, investment fell sharply, and bank losses mounted.
These effects led to a second recession and a banking and sovereign debt crisis in 2012–13. The
authorities subsequently recapitalized major state-owned banks and moved some of their NPLs to a
bank asset management company (BAMC). The bank recapitalization, alongside restored sovereign
market access, stabilized the financial system and enabled an economic recovery. However, still
debt-laden company balance sheets, particularly in the SME sector, coupled with extensive state
ownership of inefficient firms, limit growth opportunities. As a result, Slovenia’s GDP and
employment remain below pre-global crisis levels. This performance is in sharp contrast with the
country’s Central European peers, whose economic recoveries have generally been much stronger
(chart).

2.
Significant structural reforms are needed to realize Slovenia’s growth potential, but
political tensions and coalition discussions may affect their pace and ambition. Polls record
declining public support for the governing coalition as tensions over refugees and other
non-economic matters have flared. In addition, coalition partners have yet to formulate a common
approach to important reforms. These developments create uncertainties about the speed and
scope of further action on fiscal and structural priorities (See Annex III for an assessment of
implementation of prior staff reform recommendations).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
3.
Strong demand in trading partners and large European Union structural fund
transfers buoyed growth in 2014–15, but the outlook is less reassuring. Rising exports, a spike
in public investment financed by EU funds (chart), and an employment-driven pick-up in private
consumption propelled annual GDP growth to about 3 percent over the last two years (Figures
1 and 2). Headline inflation is negative so far this year, but should gradually converge to the
currently positive, if low, core inflation rate once the effect of depressed oil prices dissipates. The
high weight of energy prices in Slovenia’s HICP relative to other euro area members has magnified
the effects of the decline in global energy prices on inflation. However, to date, these effects have
been mainly benign, buttressing consumption growth and competitiveness. While exports and
private consumption should continue to be supportive of growth, public investment is likely to fall
significantly this year and remain low going forward as EU structural funds are reduced. As a result,
staff projects GDP growth to decelerate to about 2 percent this year and next. Over the medium
term, private investment, employment, and productivity would likely grow only modestly under
current policies (charts), limiting potential growth to about 1½ percent, a rate insufficient to narrow
the gap in per capita incomes between Slovenia and the richer parts of the EU.

Slovenia’s external position is generally strong, but vulnerabilities remain (Annex I). At
7¼ percent of GDP in 2015, the current account surplus is stronger than can be explained by
fundamentals and desirable policies. As the estimated policy gap is small (see Table A2), factors
outside the Fund’s EBA current account model (e.g. deeper integration in the German supply chain

caused by lackluster demand, rather than a change in
prices. On the negative side, Slovenia’s net international investment position (IIP) was still relatively
weak at -38 percent of GDP at end-2015, with gross IIP liabilities at 143 percent of GDP, including
gross external debt at 116 percent of GDP (mainly because of external public debt and corporate
liabilities).
5.
The short-term outlook is broadly balanced, while medium-term prospects are subject
to downside risks (See Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex II). Externally, a global slowdown would
adversely affect exports, a key engine for growth. On the upside, the favorable momentum created
by robust import demand in trading partners (Germany, Austria) may persist for longer than
anticipated. Internally, failure to complete the cleanup of company balance sheets is a risk to private
investment and thus actual and potential growth in the medium term. Furthermore, it will keep firms
and banks vulnerable to growth shocks, with the attendant risks to bank profitability and capital.
Also, deflation expectations could become entrenched if core inflation turns negative, creating
problems for indebted companies and the budget. Moreover, the high and rising public debt
burden leaves Slovenia vulnerable to funding shocks in the medium term (Annexes V and VI).
6.
Staff’s projections are broadly consistent with those of the authorities’ forecasting
arm (IMAD). IMAD forecasts a slightly lower growth and inflation than staff in 2016 and a stronger
rebound in 2017, largely based on differing assumptions regarding the path of investment. The
authorities agreed that the current account surplus is larger than one would expect for a country like
Slovenia, and that surpluses should begin to decline as consumption and investment strengthen.
The lower inflation in Slovenia than in the euro area on average and the decline in ULCs in recent
years led the authorities to believe that Slovenia would remain competitive and that the real
exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals.
7.
The authorities broadly agreed on the main risks identified by staff. In particular, they
pointed to direct and indirect external risks to growth stemming from potential adverse
developments in emerging markets such as Russia and China. The authorities were relatively
sanguine about risks to Slovenia stemming from global financial volatility in both the short and
medium term, noting the stabilizing role of the ECB policies in this respect.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

Slovenia is growing again, but needs to avoid complacency—with more ambitious
reforms, growth can be faster and more sustainable. Discussions focused on policies to address

A.

The Banking-Corporate Sector Nexus

9.
Repair of bank balance sheets continues, but credit extension remains dormant and
bank profitability is low. Capital ratios of most banks appear adequate following the 2013–14
recapitalizations (table below and Box 1). NPLs are still above the EU average but have fallen
significantly, dropping to 9.7 percent of total loans in January 2016.1 However, the three largest
domestic banks, which are fully state-owned, still face elevated NPL ratios (table).2 Banks are highly
liquid, and the loan to deposit ratio is low at 81 percent (Figure 4), but domestic bank lending to the
corporate sector contracted 10 percent y-o-y in 2015.3 Looking ahead, credit is expected to grow
only gradually, and a large volume of high-yielding debt securities held by banks are set to roll over
at much lower rates. Bank profitability turned positive in 2015, but remains low. With the net interest
margin lower, interest income fell further in 2015. Low lending volumes, coupled with narrow
interest margins, put pressure on bank profitability, posing a risk to bank capital and thus financial
stability should adverse economic shocks materialize.

The continued contraction in bank credit to the corporate sector reflects a mix of
demand and supply side factors. The contraction, despite a significant drop in lending rates,
reflects a combination of still high company debt burdens and sluggish credit demand (Figure 5 and
Selected Issues, Corporate Financial Health and Investment). NPLs to non-financial corporations
(NFCs), especially to SMEs, remain high (€2.1 billion at end-2015, or 5.4 percent of GDP, of which
€1.5 billion is to SMEs). EU state-aid requirements on minimum returns on equity for intervened
banks may also be playing a role in limiting new lending by these banks.4 Moreover, healthier NFCs
in manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade are increasingly relying on retained earnings and
external borrowing, the stock of which comprised 27 percent of total outstanding NFC borrowing at
end-2015, an increase of 7.5 percentage points since end–2008. On the supply side, bank lending
standards did not tighten in 2015 and are being loosened in early 2016 (chart below).

11.
Despite recent deleveraging, SMEs remain over-indebted and unable to adequately
service their liabilities. While recent Master Restructuring Agreements (MRAs) have reduced excess
debt and NPLs of large corporations, staff analysis indicates that in 2014 the bulk of the medium,
small, and micro firms—a sector that accounted for 60 percent of investment in the economy—
remained indebted above the point where debt adversely affects their investment (Selected Issues,
Corporate Financial Health and Investment).
12.
The guidelines for SME NPL resolution prepared by the Bank Association and the Bank
of Slovenia (BoS) provide a welcome framework for restructuring the debt of viable
companies. By extending helpful methodological advice to both banks and borrowers, the
guidelines can significantly speed up the process and raise the frequency of successful
restructurings of NPLs to SMEs. Staff pointed out that to incentivize the banks to resolve NPLs
promptly, firm supervisory oversight on the implementation of the banks' NPL reduction plans
should be maintained. Moreover, existing measures such as time-bound write-off requirements
The required minimum return on equity for new loans is 7–10 percent depending on the bank and the length of
time in state hands after the recapitalization.

(with the attendant provisioning) for uncollectible loans and nonaccrual of interest for loans past a
set delinquency threshold should be strictly enforced. 5
13.
A centralized framework to sell NPLs to other investors would help as well. Staff
pressed for renewed government and BoS support for the previously planned privately-funded
entity (SPV) to bundle and sell non-performing SME loans. This could help resolve NPLs more
quickly, either through their restructuring or through starting insolvency of unviable firms that
would return resources such as pledged collateral to economic circulation. By selling adequately
provisioned loans, the banks would also improve their risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio, creating
scope for new lending.
14.
Proper allocation of credit and adaptation of banks’ business models to the new
environment are critical to preserve the recently established financial stability. Staff
emphasized that credit extension should reflect commercially-driven arms-length transactions
between banks, including state-owned ones, and their clients. A return to pre-crisis lending practices
governed in part by noneconomic factors could easily lead to a resurgence of NPLs in a few years.
Moreover, to sustain adequate profitability in the current environment and prevent erosion of their
capital in case of adverse shocks, banks need to proactively and substantially reconsider their cost
structures and revenue sources. The ongoing bank consolidation and exit might support these
efforts. In particular, two large banks have merged in 2015, two foreign-owned banks are looking to
exit the market, and two small banks are being wound down.
15.
Timely and well-designed bank privatization is important to ensure strong corporate
governance and reduce public debt. The sale of the third-largest bank (NKBM) was completed in
April 2016 and the start of the privatization process for NLB, the largest bank, is welcome. However,
in staff’s view, the chosen privatization model for NLB—an initial public offering on a stock market,
with the state retaining the largest stake—is unlikely to attract strategic investors that would want to
manage and develop the institution based on sound commercial principles. Staff urged the
authorities to consider the benefits of a tender for the controlling stake, to actively market the bank
to strategic investors, and to reconsider plans to prevent any investor from acquiring more than the
state’s designated share stake (25 percent plus 1 share). In addition, the process should ensure that
potential shareholders above the relevant threshold are fit and proper. As for the second-largest
bank, Abanka, staff saw a case for accelerating its privatization relative to the current deadline (July
2019) to move to a fully competitive banking market as soon as possible and recoup more quickly
the government’s investment in Abanka. Staff also advised putting in place a framework to ensure
that state-owned banks are managed on commercial principles until they are sold.

As a member of the Eurosystem the Bank of Slovenia follows the ECB regulations and the main banks are
supervised under the SSM. In addition, NPL reporting is being brought in line with EBA regulations.

2015, the government also dismissed the CEO and
the chairman of the board in October over a controversial pay dispute. Staff expressed concern
about these developments, as they create the perception of government interference with BAMC’s
operational work.

17.
Staff underscored that the operational independence of the BAMC is key for its ability
to successfully dispose of its assets. Recent legal arrangements that call for non-interference of
the state in the BAMC’s case work should be respected and the vacant seat in its supervisory board
should be filled by a competent and independent professional. Progress with asset sales and
corporate restructurings should not be slowed by the recent extension of the BAMC period of
operation to 2022. To facilitate restructuring operations, staff recommended that the BAMC acquire
at a fair price all large bank exposures to debtors on whom it already holds a claim. The BAMC’s
mandate to maximize value from asset sales should ensure that any related increase in public debt is
offset over the medium term.
18.
Bank regulation and supervision is being aligned with EU standards. Slovenia has
established a Financial Stability Board for macroprudential supervision, chaired by the BoS.
Moreover, the BoS introduced two new macro prudential measures––a countercyclical capital buffer
and a capital buffer for systemically important institutions (SIIs). The countercyclical capital buffer
requirement became effective on January 1, 2016, at a rate of zero. With capitalization appearing
adequate and with the recognition that there were very limited risks of banks engaging in excessive
lending, SIIs were granted a transition period until January 1, 2019, to meet their new capital buffer
requirement, which ranges from 0.25–1.00 percent. The size of both capital buffers was determined
according to European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) guidelines.
19.
The authorities assessed the banking system as stable and stated that they would
privatize the three large state-owned banks in accordance with Slovenia’s EU commitments.
They noted the system is well capitalized, liquid, and showing improving, albeit low, profitability.
Nevertheless, the authorities agreed with staff that there are potential risks with respect to the

sustainability of banks’ business models and further pressure on profits. They observed that the NPL
legacy, particularly in the SME segment, is still a drag on the income capacity of banks and that SME
over-indebtedness does depress private investment. The authorities expect implementation of the
recently issued guidelines on SME restructuring (see ¶12) to improve banks’ capacity to reduce NPLs
and resume lending to the SME sector. The authorities noted that the Slovenian Sovereign Holding
(SSH), the entity tasked with bank privatization, is reviewing the best method for privatization of NLB
and will make a recommendation to the government in the coming months.
20.
The authorities also appreciated the benefits of an SPV for reducing NPLs to SMEs and
an independent BAMC. However, they saw political difficulties in supporting the creation of such
an SPV at present, as the government would not want to be associated with the collection practices
of the NPL buyers. Instead, they argued that the technical platform for bundling and packaging
NPLs would be created by the BAMC and situated as a separate company, which sellers and buyers
of NPLs could use on a case by case basis. Staff noted that a centralized SPV would provide better
synergies and economies of scale. In addition, an arrangement involving an entity outside the SPV
may raise transaction costs and thus fail to attract the interest of private investors.

B. Fiscal Policy
21.
Slovenia is in a good position to exit the EC’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) in
2016. The budget deficit reached 2.9 percent of GDP in ESA terms in 2015, below the EDP threshold
of 3 percent of GDP. The budget outturn in cash terms (3.3 percent of GDP) was consistent with a
structural primary adjustment of ½ percent of GDP. Higher-than-budgeted corporate income tax
receipts, reflecting improved firm profitability, boosted tax revenue. On the spending side, belowbudget expenditure on pensions and goods and services helped offset overruns in the public sector
wage bill and subsidies (Figure 6). Expenditure on refugees had a negligible impact on the fiscal
outturn. Nonetheless, public debt increased to over 83 percent of GDP at end-2015, in part because
the Treasury prefinanced some of its 2016 needs.
22.
Policy discussions covered the near-term fiscal stance and fiscal policy requirements
for the medium-to-long term. With risks to this year’s fiscal outcome broadly contained, the
discussions focused on the appropriate pace and composition of medium-term consolidation to
reduce public debt relative to GDP and offset the impact of demographic trends on public finances.
23.
The authorities’ targeted fiscal stance for 2016 is broadly appropriate. The approved
budget envisages a general government deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP (cash terms), which would be
consistent with a reduction of 0.8 percent of GDP in the structural primary deficit, slightly above the
staff-recommended 0.6 percent of GDP. This, combined with drawing down part of the Treasury’s
large cash balance, would reduce the debt ratio to below 81 percent by end-year. With the output
gap expected to close next year, staff viewed such pace of consolidation as broadly appropriate
from a cyclical perspective, and in line with medium-term requirements.
24.
The budget is, however, subject to certain risks. The 2016 budget is anchored by a
one-year public sector wage agreement and measures to improve VAT collection. The wage bill is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

under strong pressure as the temporary wage restraints introduced during the crisis are being
unwound, and the authorities already estimate that the budgeted amount will be exceeded.
Moreover, staff assessed that budget revenue could fall short of the target by some ¼ percent of
GDP as the expected yield from measures to improve tax collections appears optimistic. The
authorities were, however, confident that the budget has sufficient margins to offset small slippages,
and noted that the budgetary framework compels line ministries to offset any wage bill overruns by
cuts in their other spending.
25.
In the medium-to-long term, Slovenia is facing significant fiscal challenges. Expiration
of one-off measures put in place during the crisis and adverse demographic trends will strongly
pressure public finances. The wage bill will start rising relative to GDP in the absence of policies to
put wages and employment on a permanently sustainable basis. In addition, pension spending is
projected to resume its steady upward path once the temporary effect of the 2013 reform on the
retiree inflows lapses and pension indexation based on wage/price growth resumes. Health care and
long-term care spending will also come under pressure. Finally, as EMU interest rates begin to return
toward historic levels, the interest bill will start to rise if public debt does not come under control.
26.
In the absence of further policy measures, staff projects that debt dynamics will
become unsustainable. Under staff’s baseline projections, after a brief lull as the government draws
down its cash buffer, the debt-to-GDP ratio would resume its upward path, exceeding 87 percent by
2021. Over the longer term, demographic trends and the interest bill on the ever-rising debt would
drive fiscal dynamics, as Slovenia faces the most serious aging problem in the EU. Absent reforms to
pensions and other age-sensitive spending, the debt ratio would follow an unsustainable path,
exceeding 240 percent by 2060 (in the unlikely event that financing were to remain available).

To reduce medium-term fiscal risks and boost credibility, staff argued for a
comprehensive medium-term consolidation strategy. The authorities took a step in this direction
in 2015 with the passage of a fiscal rule that sets a medium-term budget target of a zero structural
deficit. With a closed output gap from 2017 on, the next several years are indeed the right time to

Policy action in several areas is needed to support consolidation. The authorities are
aiming for a multi-year wage agreement with public sector unions that would allow wage bill growth
to lag nominal GDP growth by 1.7 percentage points per year. Staff agreed that this would be an
important consolidation step and recommended that the agreement also cover rationalization in
public employment to lend credibility to the agreed targets. Staff pointed out, however, that
additional measures would be needed to achieve the necessary medium-term consolidation. In
particular, staff suggested focusing on structural fiscal reforms in expenditure areas where Slovenia
had been spending more than its peers without achieving better outcomes:


Pensions, by indexing pensions to inflation only, abolishing the pension bonus and
pensioners’ preferential tax treatment, and, once the retirement age reaches 65 as planned,
continuing its increase to 67 and then linking it to life expectancy. Part of the savings should
be directed to support low-income pensioners through



Education spending, by raising pupil-teacher ratios,
shifting resources from areas with declining school
population to those with expanding ones, and better
means-testing financial support for tertiary students;
Health care spending, by increasing reliance on primary
care, introducing service-based copayments, and linking
payments for treatments to their demonstrated clinical
and cost effectiveness. 7



Transfers and subsidies, by more rigorous means testing of household income support
programs and rationalization of subsidies to enterprises which have tended to exceed
budget allocations in recent years.

The composition of such an expenditure-reduction package would substantially mitigate the
contractionary effect of lower spending on economic activity. In particular, health and education
savings derive from efficiency gains, and as such should preserve the level of provided services while
releasing resources for use elsewhere in the economy. As regards pensions, raising the retirement
age could boost current consumption, while lowering retirement income relative to the returns from
working should limit early retirement and boost the labor force. Finally, to the extent that these
expenditure savings create room for front-loading high-multiplier public investment (see ¶29), the
growth impact of the consolidation would be further mitigated.
On the revenue side, staff urged the introduction of a modern, broad-based property tax, in line
with Fund technical assistance recommendations, by January 1, 2017. Given its non-distortionary
nature, and that property in Slovenia is taxed well below that in comparator countries, staff argued
that the aim of the new tax should be to increase substantially property tax revenue in the medium
term. In addition, staff supported the authorities’ intention to shift the burden of taxes away from
labor, as this would appropriately reduce labor costs and support employment growth. The resulting
revenue loss should be offset by raising excise taxes on fuel given the current low energy prices, and
tightening transfer pricing rules to raise corporate income tax receipts.
29.
Fiscal adjustment via structural, rather than one-off, measures is critical to strengthen
credibility. By providing confidence about the ultimate objectives of fiscal policy, a credible
medium-term consolidation plan could give the authorities additional flexibility for discretionary
measures in case economic developments turn out worse than projected. In particular, provided the
overall fiscal consolidation effort is underpinned by credible reforms, the authorities could consider
front-loading capital spending, including through acceleration of EU-funded projects. Front-loading
capital spending would be justified given the currently low level of government borrowing costs
(Figure 7), and the temporary interest savings brought by the ECB’s QE (Selected Issues, ECB
Quantitative Easing: Implications for Fiscal Policy).
30.
The authorities agreed on the need for substantial fiscal consolidation over the
medium term and broadly shared staff’s suggestions on areas ripe for reform. They were
disposed to underpinning medium-term consolidation by structural fiscal reforms, as this would
improve budget implementation and allow them to address unforeseen shocks without damaging
credibility. In this context, they agreed that the expenditure areas suggested by staff needed to be
addressed, particularly pension spending in view of Slovenia’s demographics, but cautioned that
building consensus for specific reform measures would take time. On wages, they noted that the
negotiations would be difficult as civil servants’ labor union expectations are high. On health, the
government has completed a number of expenditure analyses and plans to prepare legislation in
2016 to reform the system.

Extensive state ownership may be impeding growth. Slovenia’s SOEs’ share of

with more than 75 percent of enterprise assets privately held.
However, the strategy calls for the state to retain
Source: EBRD (2015)
direct control over too many large companies, including in sectors where other OECD and EU
countries have not, as a rule, sought to retain state control (e.g., consumer goods and tourism). The
Slovenia Sovereign Holding (SSH) plans to fully privatize only a small fraction (by book value) of the
companies it owns. Moreover, the authorities have now postponed indefinitely the sale of the large
Telekom Slovenije after the unsuccessful attempt to dispose of it in 2015, despite its designation for
speedy privatization by parliament in 2013.
32.
Staff recommended that the current approach to state ownership be revised. The
approach carries the risk of continuing low productivity growth, low profitability, and insider capture
in SOEs and prevents a faster and much-needed reduction of public debt. For the planned revision
of the state asset management strategy this summer, staff recommended:


Faster and more comprehensive privatization accompanied by a stronger regulatory
framework: The number of companies where the state wants to retain control by
designating them as “strategic” or “important” should be significantly reduced. In addition,
the restriction that no private investor may hold a stake larger than the state’s in the
“important” companies should be lifted, as it prevents the entry of strategic investors, which
has negative implications for these firms’ performance and governance. Moreover, staff
strongly urged the restart of the privatization of Telekom Slovenije, for the reasons
mentioned above, and the removal of any remaining legal and financial uncertainties prior
to its sale. At the same time, a review of the regulatory frameworks in infrastructure and
natural monopoly sectors should ensure that they can adequately prevent abuses of market
power by the newly privatized companies.



Improved SOE governance: Staff supported the strategy’s provision for setting profitability
and other performance targets for SOEs. These targets should aim at performance

8

15

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

comparable to that of private companies in the corresponding sectors of the economy, with
due adjustment for the public service role that some SOEs provide. The targets should
encourage disposal of the non-core assets owned by the SOEs, including cross-ownership in
other SOEs. Setting targets should also be accompanied by a robust and credible process of
verification of their achievement and accountability for misses.
33.

foreign investors by the Slovenian public
agency for the promotion of investment (Spirit) found no tangible improvement in business
sentiment in 2015. Respondents identified a lack of qualified personnel, high labor costs, late
payments, and an inefficient judicial system as problem areas.
34.
Structural reforms that further improve the broader business environment would raise
potential growth. Drawing on recent developments and previous work (Figure 8), staff
recommended attention to policy shortfalls in areas where (i) the estimated gain from improvement
is large, and (ii) the distance from EU and world best practices is significant.11 Specifically:


Judicial system: raise the recovery rate in insolvency proceedings and speed up the process;
protect property rights in both in-court and out of court settlements;



Company financing: reduce obstacles to foreign ownership and investment and facilitate
equity financing, including the development of new instruments to support equity and debt
financing for SMEs by the export and development bank (SID) and the Slovenian Enterprise
Fund, utilizing EU funds as appropriate;



Education and R&D: eliminate skills mismatches by tailoring educational fields financially
supported by the state to the needs of the market place;



Governance and corruption: reduce the perception of favoritism to specific companies in
decisions of government officials, strengthen the independence of the Commission for

The authorities held similar views on most structural reforms. They emphasized their
commitment to assessing SOE management performance based on objective criteria and agreed
that the upcoming revision of the state asset management strategy presents an opportunity to
review the list of companies where the state would retain control. The authorities favored fostering
greater reliance on equity funding in the private sector and will continue to explore ways to do so.
They also saw the mismatch between job requirements and worker skills as an impediment to
employment growth and are discussing education reforms to address this issue.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
While growth has returned, Slovenia could grow faster and more sustainably. To
sustain the reasonable growth rates from 2014–15 given the expected drop in public investment,
private investment needs to play a much stronger role than at present. This would buttress capital
formation and productivity, strengthening actual and potential growth over the medium term.
Moreover, important fiscal and financial vulnerabilities need to be addressed.
37.
Swift policy actions are needed to stimulate private investment and reduce
vulnerabilities. There are four key priorities: (i) move NPLs off state-owned banks books and
encourage SME balance sheets repair; (ii) divest state-owned banks and nudge banks to rethink
their business models; (iii) put in place a comprehensive fiscal adjustment package underpinned by
structural measures; and (iv) reform and privatize more SOEs, and address key bottlenecks in the
business environment.
38.
It is time to decisively deal with bank NPLs and SME debt. Lingering non-performing
loans and excess corporate debt, particularly on SME books, impair the credit channel for
investment. The new guidelines for SME NPL resolution are an important step to address NPLs of
viable SMEs. A privately-funded entity (SPV) to bundle and sell non-performing SME loans,
established with the state’s support, would help resolve NPLs even more quickly.
39.
Continued state control of banks creates risks of interference in their lending
decisions. Business decisions in the state-owned banks should continue to be based on commercial
principles, maintaining an arms-length relationship with the state. To improve the chances for
successful bank sales, the authorities should reconsider their plan to limit the stakes of potential
investors. And the planned sale of Abanka only by July 2019 is an unnecessary delay that would miss
an opportunity to restore a fully competitive market for bank services and may negatively affect the
bank’s performance.
40.
BAMC’s operational independence should be respected. This will allow BAMC’s
management to carry out its mandate to maximize the value of its claims, thereby lowering the final
cost of the 2013 bank bailout.

41.
Bank business models need considerable adjustment to profitably weather a
prolonged period of low interest rates. Low bank profits pose risks to bank capital and thus
financial stability in the event of an adverse shock. To thrive sustainably, banks need to proactively
and substantially reconsider their cost structures and revenue sources. At the same time, banks
should maintain adequate lending standards to avoid a resurgence of NPLs.
42.
The narrowing of the budget deficit over the last two years is only the first step to
putting the fiscal house in order. The planned adjustment in 2016 is also welcome. But the deficit
and debt will start rising again in 2017 under current policies. Barring large adverse shocks, we
recommend an annual structural adjustment effort of 0.6 percent of GDP in primary terms until the
overall structural balance reaches zero. Afterwards, the structural balance should be held at zero
until debt falls below 60 percent of GDP.
43.
The needed fiscal adjustment should be achieved through a comprehensive package of
structural reforms to strengthen policy credibility. A key element in such a strategy would be a
multi-year agreement with labor unions that keeps the wage bill affordable. In addition,
efficiency-improving reforms can save money in the health and education sectors without
undermining the quality of service. Pension reforms, such as further extending the retirement age
and indexing pensions to consumer price inflation, are also critical in view of the deteriorating
demographics. Growth-friendly revenue measures, such as the introduction of a real estate tax,
would help as well. A revenue-neutral reduction in labor taxes would support employment creation.
44.
Aggressive SOE reform, coupled with further improvements in the business
environment, could boost potential growth. The number of companies where the state plans to
retain control should be significantly reduced. Performance criteria set for SOE managers should aim
at performance comparable to that of private companies and should encourage disposal of the
non-core assets owned by the SOEs. Moreover, changes to facilitate greater equity financing and
reduce the job-skills mismatch would also invigorate employment and investment.

Box 1. Financial Sector Developments
Slovenia’s financial system has assets of about 150 percent of GDP and is bank centered. Banks
account for about 70 percent of assets with the remaining roughly equally split between insurers,
pension and investment funds, and leasing companies. After the capital injections in 2013–14, bank
ownership is concentrated in the central government, with 63 percent of the total sector’s equity, while
other domestic entities control about 7 percent of the sector, and non-residents about 30 percent.
Market share is concentrated with the largest domestic banks controlling about 57 percent of the
sector’s assets on a consolidated basis, small domestic banks 8 percent, and banks under majority
foreign ownership 35 percent.
Imbalances and vulnerabilities in the system have compounded the effects of the global
financial crisis. The rapid foreign-borrowing financed credit expansion in 2005–07 led to a significant
increase in corporate leverage and heightened bank credit risk besides the maturity mismatches
between funding and lending. The global financial crisis brought a sudden stop of capital inflows, a
sharp economic contraction, and a protracted deleveraging process that reinforced the recession. As a
resulted, NPLs (mainly from corporates) increased sharply, peaking at over 17 percent of total loans in
mid-2013 and impairing the balance sheets of banks and corporates in a protracted process. The
difficulties faced by corporates led to a rapid deterioration in the quality of banks’ portfolios that
reduced banks’ capital and increased solvency risks. In 2013 a comprehensive asset quality review of
eight banks determined that foreign banks had a capital shortfall of 78 percent relative to the capital
levels reported in September 2013 while banks under domestic ownership showed a shortfall of 244
percent. The crisis exposed inadequate bank governance and risk management practices that allowed
endemic connected lending and lax risk controls, especially for state-owned banks. Likewise, significant
weaknesses in corporate management and governance (including through state ownership) were also
exposed.
A number of actions were adopted by the authorities. Bank Recapitalization—the banking crisis
in Slovenia led to bailouts with the recapitalization of six state-owned banks in 2013–14 at a total cost
of about 12 percent of GDP for the state. Transfer of NPLs—the establishment of the Bank Asset
Management Company (BAMC) in late 2012 allowed the transfer of 53 percent of the €9.4 billion in
non-performing claims from five of the recapitalized government banks by end 2014, primarily
involving large domestic corporates. Of the current NPLs with banks, SMEs represent 42 percent.
Corporate Insolvency Framework—the 2013 reform opened more options to help address corporate
debt overhang, including compulsory settlements and voluntary multilateral restructuring agreements
(MRAs). Besides banks, BAMC also implements MRAs. Supervisory Actions—to monitor and support
restructuring of NPLs the BOS established reporting requirements, including 3-year management plan
and restructuring strategy, asset reclassification, release of impairment provisions. Despite all these
actions, most MRAs involve debt re-profiling, but not debt reduction, new financing, nor
recapitalization.
Balance sheets of both banks and corporates remain impaired with the repair process
proceeding slowly. In December 2015, system wide NPLs were at 9.9 percent (€3.5 billion, of which
NFCs represented 60 percent) and overall capital ratios were at 18.8 percent (CAR) and 18.1 percent
(core tier 1). However, credit to the private sector was still contracting by 5.7 percent total and 10.2
percent to NFCs (y-o-y) in December 2015 and the income generation capacity of banks is limited.
Bank profitability was still low, with ROE and ROA at 4.2 and 0.5 percent, respectively, after highly
negative readings since 2010, and net interest margin of 2.1 percent.

Annex I. External Assessment
Overall Assessment
The external position in 2015 was generally strong, while some vulnerabilities remain. The IMF’s
current account (CA) approach suggests that the current account (CA) surplus was substantially
stronger than expected given medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies even though policy
gaps are close to zero. The REER approach suggests the exchange rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals in 2015. However, external liabilities and debt remain high and vulnerabilities arise
from: (i) high external debt of the government and corporations and (ii) Slovenia’s trade openness,
which could amplify the impact of external shocks (e.g. changes in partner country growth, the euro
exchange rate, or capital flows). With debts of banks and corporations declining, a rebound in
consumption and investment is likely to reduce the CA surplus over the medium term.
Foreign Asset and Liability Position and Trajectory
Background: Net external liabilities rose considerably prior to, and after, the global financial crisis
(GFC). From 2007 to 2012, the net international investment position (IIP) fell from -25 to -50 percent
of GDP. Current account (CA) surpluses after 2011 improved the net IIP to -38 percent of GDP
(Figure A1).
From end-2007 to end-2012, Slovenia’s gross external debt rose from 102 to 119 percent of GDP,
before falling to 116 percent of GDP at end-2015. Banks significantly reduced external debt, which
fell from 46 to 14 percent of GDP from end-2007 to end-2015. By contrast, government external
debt rose from 9 to 59 percent of GDP, due to policies to offset the effects of the GFC and to
recapitalize the banks. The external debt of other sectors—mainly corporations—remained at
around 40 percent of GDP.
Over the next 5 years, with CA surpluses projected at 4–7 percent of GDP, the IIP should improve
rapidly, nearing balance in 2021. Firms’ external debt could fall by as much as 20 percent of GDP.
But with government external debt projected to rise further and banks’ external debt near historic
lows, overall external debt is unlikely to fall much below 100 percent of GDP (see External DSA).
Assessment: Projected large external surpluses out to 2021 will result in a substantial reduction in
net external liabilities and accumulation of external assets. The main vulnerabilities arise from high
external government debt and significant trade openness (exports and imports comprise around 80
and 70 percent of GDP, respectively), which could amplify risks arising from changes in real
exchange rates or partner country import demand. Policies to reduce government debt would
mitigate these risks.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Current Account
Background: Before the GFC, Slovenia experienced rapid growth and strong increases in exports and
imports. In 2007, the CA balance stood at -4 percent of GDP.
Following both the GFC (2007-09) and Slovenia’s banking crisis (2011-2013), the CA balance
improved by around 4 percent of GDP. The improvement following the GFC was due to a sharp drop
in private investment, which offset a decline in private savings. The improvement following the
banking crisis stemmed from a rise in private savings as consumption dropped and a moderate drop
in investment.
From 2011 to 2015, Slovenia’s CA balance rose from 0.2 to 7.3percent of GDP. The improvement was
driven by exports of goods and services, which rose by 15.6 percent in euro terms, in line with
import growth in major markets (e.g. Germany and Austria). The increase in Slovenia’s imports of
goods and services in value terms (3.2 percent) was less rapid than the increase in nominal GDP
(4.5 percent), and less rapid than the rise in exports.
Over the next 5 years, staff projects surpluses will continue—albeit at a lower level (Figure A2).
Robust import growth in trading partners should underpin further expansion in exports, while staff
projects continued economic recovery in Slovenia will raise imports faster than exports, reducing the
trade and CA surpluses.
Assessment: The current account approach suggests that Slovenia’s 2015 external balance was
7½ to 9½ percent of GDP stronger than indicated by fundamentals and desirable policies. The
model predicts a country similar to Slovenia would have a CA balance of -1¼ percent of GDP versus
an actual surplus of 7¼ percent of GDP. The model estimates policy gaps at close to zero, with
factors not captured by the model contributing to the remaining difference between the norm and
actual CA. Such factors could include Slovenia’s integration into the European supply chain and
constrained demand due to the recent banking crisis and still high company debt. While the model
takes account of output gaps, it likely underestimates the impact on Slovenia. The estimated
coefficient is based primarily on normal recessions rather than financial crises, and trade is much
more significant for Slovenia’s economy (exports and imports comprise about 80 and 70 percent of
GDP, respectively) than for most countries. Thus, the financing constraints imposed by Slovenia’s
banking crisis would lead to a stronger decline in imports in Slovenia than the typical response in
the sample of countries on which the model is estimated.
Real Exchange Rate
Background: Measured by consumer prices, Slovenia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has
remained relatively stable over the last 15 years, with deviations of less than 5 percent (Figure A2).
Measured by unit labor costs (ULC) from 2001 to 2009, Slovenia’s REER appreciated significantly and
more rapidly than trading partners, rising more than 20 percent. From 2009 to 2015, the ULC REER
depreciated 8 percent, with most of the decline occurring after the 2012–13 banking crisis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Assessment: According to the IMF’s real exchange rate approach, Slovenia’s REER is broadly in line
with fundamentals and desirable policies. The point estimate suggests overvaluation of 4 percent
±5 percent. The estimated REER from the model generally tracks Slovenia’s actual REER, with relative
productivity and increasing trade openness the primary drivers of changes.
Capital and financial accounts: flows and policy measures
Background: From 2001 to 2015, net FDI flows remained small (especially relative to Slovenia’s
neighbors), accounting for less than 5 percent of GDP per year. Prior to the GFC, other investment
inflows (dominated by external borrowing, trade credits, and non-resident deposits) outpaced net
portfolio outflows (dominated by purchases of debt securities).
After the GFC, this pattern reversed, with residents selling external portfolio assets to finance a
reduction in external loan liabilities (particularly by banks). The 2012–13 banking crisis accentuated
this pattern.
Assessment: An open financial account exposes Slovenia to external shocks and changes in investor
sentiment, but the CA surplus and recapitalization of the banks reduces these vulnerabilities. Policies
to strengthen the banking system and encourage corporations to reduce leverage would help
mitigate risks.
Foreign Exchange Intervention & the Level of International Reserves
Background: The euro is a free-floating, global reserve currency.
Assessment: Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the
floating exchange rate reduces this vulnerability.
Potential Policy Responses
IMF assessment methods do not suggest the presence of large policy gaps. Nonetheless, further
fiscal consolidation and stronger privatization efforts are necessary to reduce public and external
debt (83 and 116 percent of GDP, respectively). Moreover, continued efforts to strengthen the
banking system—by completing the process of resolving NPLs generated during the GFC and
Slovenian banking crisis—and reducing corporate debt, which hinders private investment, would
reduce external vulnerabilities and promote more rapid growth.

Annex IV. Potential Output Calculation
1.
Potential output is estimated using a production function methodology. The
approach employs a standard Cobb-Douglas production function and removes cyclical factors
affecting the labor and productivity inputs using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. The model for
the calculation of real potential GDP is:
𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑂𝑇𝑡 = 𝑙𝑛𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑡 + 0.36 ∗ 𝑙𝑛𝐾𝑡 + 0.64 ∗ ln⁡(𝑊𝐴𝑃𝑡 ∗ 𝐿𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑡 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝑅𝑡 ) ∗ 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐻𝑟𝑠𝑊𝑘𝑡 )
POT = Real potential GDP
TFP = Total factor productivity
K = Capital stock (𝐾𝑡 = 𝐾𝑡−1 + 𝐺𝐹𝐶𝐹𝑡 − 𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡 )
WAP = Working-age population (15 – 64)
LFPR = Labor force participation rate (15-64)
UNR = Unemployment rate (LFS harmonized)
AvgHrsWk = Average hours worked
2.
The output gap is projected to close in 2017-18 (Figures 1 and 2). This is in line with
projections in the last Article IV report (IMF Country Report No. 15/42).

Annex V. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The gross external debt ratio is projected to fall gradually from 116 percent of GDP in
2015 to 98 percent of GDP in 2021. Between end-2014 and end-2015, external debt fell by
8 percentage points of GDP. External debt of banks and corporations fell by 4 and 3 percentage
points of GDP, respectively, while public external debt was little changed. Over the medium term,
banks and corporations are expected to further reduce their external liabilities while public
financing needs are projected to be mainly met by external borrowing, bringing public external
debt to some 68 percent of GDP in 2021. Projected large current account surpluses over the
medium term (averaging about 6 percent of GDP) would bring Slovenia’s net international
investment position to balance by 2021. Beyond 2021, further significant improvement in the
external debt-to-GDP ratio will require reductions in the external debt of the government.
External debt dynamics are moderately vulnerable to shocks. With low interest rates over
the last several years, a shock to nominal rates would not be expected to materially affect the
outlook for external debt. A shock to growth or smaller external surpluses (modeled as a
reduction by one-half of a standard deviation relative to the baseline) would push external debt
up by about 10 percentage points to close to 110 percent of GDP in 2021. In a scenario with key
variables at their historical averages, external debt-to-GDP would rise to almost 150 percent in
2021. However, historical data was driven by debt accumulation by (i) financial institutions ahead
of the global financial crisis in 2007 and (ii) the government in the wake of the global crisis and
Slovenia’s 2012 banking crisis. Since then, banks have been recapitalized and banks and
corporations are continuing to deleverage. Thus, a repeat of the historical scenario appears
unlikely.

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Annex VI. Public-Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Slovenia’s public debt is projected to gradually increase over the medium term in the
absence of additional fiscal consolidation. Under staff’s baseline scenario, the structural
primary balance is expected to improve to 1 percent of GDP in 2016, but start deteriorating from
2017 to reach -¼ percent of GDP by 2021. This will bring public debt to about 87 percent of GDP
by 2021, after an expected drop in 2016 driven by the planned drawdown of Treasury’s cash
buffer to repay debt. Debt dynamics in 2013–14 were dominated by the impact of bank
restructuring (which accounts for the large 2013 primary balance forecast error and a 3-year
cyclically adjusted primary balance change at the right tail of the cross-country distribution on
page 35). The medium-term increase in the debt ratio largely reflects the reversal of earlier
adjustment over 2014–16 that is projected to occur without additional measures, with the
remaining primary surplus too low to offset the impact on debt dynamics of the unfavorable
growth-real interest rate differential.
Slovenia’s high and rising public debt ratio is the main area of vulnerability, while debt
service is projected to remain manageable, even under most stress scenarios. Under the
baseline, the debt ratio remains below its high-risk threshold of 85 percent of GDP through 2019,
but above this level in 2020–21. Moreover, it is projected to exceed this threshold under all stress
scenarios, in some cases substantially. In terms of debt structure, the share of short-term debt is
moderate, and while the share of non-resident holders exceeds the relevant threshold, these
holdings are of long maturities, implying manageable limited annual rollover needs. Slovenia’s
spreads have fallen steadily to low levels. Under the baseline, debt service (e.g., gross financing
needs) remains in the 10-13 percent of GDP range during most of the medium term, reflecting
extensive pre-financing and the low interest rate environment in the context of ECB’s QE. Debt
service is projected to remain manageable (i.e., under the high-risk threshold of 20 percent of
GDP) under the standard robustness stress tests and scenarios.
Slovenia’s debt dynamics are highly vulnerable to specific shocks:


Standardized macro shocks: Sensitivity to GDP growth shocks is especially noteworthy—a
negative one-standard deviation growth shock over two years would bring the debt ratio to
over 108 percent by 2021. This illustrates the importance of reforms to put Slovenia on a
high, sustainable growth path.



Country-specific shocks:
 Contingent fiscal liabilities are a potential source of vulnerability. Excluding guarantees
extended to the EFSF and the BAMC (which are part of the general government debt),
state guarantees extended to the nonfinancial sector amount to about 12 percent of
GDP, and the weak financial position of the borrowers concerned raises the probability
that a sizeable portion of these guarantees may be called. To illustrate, calling of half of
the guarantees outstanding, accompanied by a transitory negative confidence impact on
Slovenia’s spread, would bring the debt ratio to over 97 percent by 2021. This highlights
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

the importance of corporate restructuring and reducing the state’s direct and indirect
involvement in the economy.
 A combined macro-fiscal shock (with GDP growth at the level of the adverse growth
scenario, inflation and fiscal revenue at the respective minima of the standardized
scenarios, and fiscal expenditure, exchange rate, and interest rate spread at the
respective maxima of the standardized scenarios) would also result in explosive debt
dynamics, with debt close to 115 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period,
highlighting the importance of a credible medium-term fiscal policy.
An active scenario of fiscal adjustment along the lines of staff’s recommendations can put
debt dynamics on a firmly downward path. Adoption of additional structural fiscal measures
amounting to about 3 percent of GDP over the next few years would bring the debt ratio down
to 75 percent by 2021 and 60 percent by 2026, even as medium-term growth may be somewhat
lower, as a result of the fiscal headwinds. Policies to strengthen private investment and
productivity, as described in the staff report, could more than overcome these headwinds.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, includes equity injections in public enterprises
9/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes BAMC asset recoveries and exchange rate changes during the projection period.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and posts its metadata on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) follows the European
System of Accounts 2010 (ESA10). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and expenditure categories are
compiled in both current and constant prices, and are published within 80 days after the reference quarter.
In September 2005, the SORS changed the base year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the
previous year’s prices and started using the chain–link index methodology.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for monitoring compliance with the
Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural
areas. The weights are based on the three-year average of expenditure data for consumer goods from
continuous Household Budget Surveys for 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI),
which differs from the consumer price index in weights only.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high quality. The ministry of
finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government Finance, which presents monthly data
on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary Central Government), local governments, social security
(Pension and Health funds), and the consolidated general government. The coverage of general
government excludes the operations of extra-budgetary funds and own revenues of general government
agencies (zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported for
publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government operations, including
the operations of the extra-budgetary funds are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and broadly use the analytical
framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986 government finance statistics methodology. The
data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical
framework and classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
The Slovenian authorities adopted the GFSM 2001 methodology, which is used as a building block for the
compilation of the ESA 2010–based data jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the SORS for reporting to
the European Commission. To assist the Ministry of Finance resolve several classification issues and develop
a migration path, a STA technical assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. The introduction in 2008
of a new chart of accounts for all public entities based on accrual principles greatly facilitated the adoption
of the new methodology.
Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high quality. The
data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook since 1993 (with estimates of the
international investment position published since 1994). In 2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised balance of
payments statistics back to 1994; the most significant revisions were related to the income component of
the current account and to the other investment component of the financial account. In June 2014, the
Bank of Slovenia began reporting balance of payments and international investment position data
according to the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). In
September 2014, the Bank of Slovenia started reporting financial accounts according to the European
System of National and Regional Accounts 2010 (ESA2010).
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line with the SDDS in August
2003.
