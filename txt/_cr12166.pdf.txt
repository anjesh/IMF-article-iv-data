STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic activity is recovering gradually from the effects of the global
slowdown and the domestic credit crunch. Inflation has fallen due to moderating
commodity prices and exchange rate appreciation. Reserves have risen and remain
comfortable with large trade deficits financed by official inflows and remittances. The
key policy challenge now is to navigate the uncertain global environment, create policy
space to meet future potential shocks, and build the foundations for faster and more
inclusive growth.
Focus. The consultation focused on the following broad themes:


Spillovers and risks. After gradually recovering in 2010–11 from the global crisis,
thanks in part to a fiscal stimulus funded through concessional loans, growth
should move toward its 1¾ percent trend rate led by private domestic demand. But
the global environment poses a downside risk, particularly potential spillovers of
lower remittance inflows, tourism receipts, and foreign aid.



Enhancing resilience to shocks. The economy is undiversified, remittancedependent and prone to natural disasters. Rebuilding large fiscal, external, and
financial buffers would help cushion adverse shocks and support sustainable
growth. The key near-term policy challenge is to support economic recovery and
control inflation, while moving toward fiscal consolidation and preserving financial
and external stability.



Building faster and more inclusive growth. Implementing the Tongan
development strategy to unleash natural resource endowments in agriculture,
tourism and fisheries could raise potential growth and make it more inclusive.
However, social protection programs will also be needed to support vulnerable
communities in an environment of declining remittances.

TONGA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
Context. The weak global
environment is affecting the economy
through lower remittances and represents a
clear downside risk to the outlook. Tonga also
remains at high risk of external debt distress
and is vulnerable to natural disasters. The
rising debt service burden may squeeze
priority public spending and crowd out
private investment. A recently concluded
economic dialogue with wide stakeholder
participation identified the need to raise the
relatively low rate of potential growth.
2.
Politics. The country was deeply
saddened by the sudden passing away of his
Majesty King George Tupou V in March 2012.
The late king's brother, Crown Prince
Tupouto'a Lavaka, has been formally
proclaimed as King Tupou VI in a recent
ceremony. The coronation is not expected to
affect public administration following the
transfer of most executive powers to the
Parliament in 2006. A new government took
office in early 2011 following the first

parliamentary elections under which a
majority of seats were popularly elected. The
cabinet has been reshuffled a few times since
then and the authorities will undertake a
major restructuring of line ministries in
2012/13 that may disrupt some public
services. It was recently announced that a new
ministry will be created in charge of revenue
services that will be independent of the newly
appointed Minister of Finance and National
Planning.
3.
In concluding the 2011 Article IV
consultation (May 4, 2011), the Executive
Directors noted that Tonga’s economy is
recovering from the recent internal and
external shocks on the back of stronger
tourism activity and fiscal expansion. The
policy challenge now is to reduce the
country’s vulnerabilities and to boost
potential growth. Directors stressed that in
the near term, fiscal consolidation is necessary
to ensure fiscal sustainability and expand
fiscal space to respond to future shocks.

Growth. Growth is estimated by staff
to have recovered to 1½ percent in FY2010/11
from zero percent in FY2008/09.1 Two factors
have contributed to the recovery. First, gross
fixed investment and inventory buildup have
strengthened since late 2010, thanks to the
construction activity funded by the China EXIM
Bank loans. Second, tourism receipts
rebounded from the middle of 2010. On the
other hand, private consumption has remained

Balance of payments. The trade
deficit remained high but the current account
balance improved to a deficit of 1½ percent of
GDP in FY2010/11 (from a deficit of
6¾ percent in FY2009/10) because of the

7.
Public finances. The fiscal deficit was
estimated to have been six percent of GDP in
the year ending in June 2011–broadly
unchanged from a year ago but higher than
anticipated in the last staff report reflecting a
more frontloaded utilization of the China EXIM
Bank loans. An estimated 3¾ percentage
points of GDP increase in capital expenditure
was led by utilization of the China EXIM Bank
loans (amounting to about 7½ percent of
GDP). The overall balance (excluding the China
EXIM Bank loan spending) showed a surplus of
about 1½ percent of GDP due to restraint on
current expenditure. Tax collections remained
weak, however, due mainly to anemic
consumption and customs taxes.

KEY THEMES FOR THE CONSULTATION
A. Spillovers and Risks
Staff’s views
8.
Outlook. Economic activity is
expected to continue its recovery in the
medium term, albeit decelerate slightly to
1.2 percent in FY2012/13 from 1.6 percent in
2011/12 due to the withdrawal of fiscal
stimulus related to the completion of the
constructions funded by the China EXIM Bank
loans (Table 1). Over the medium term,
growth is expected to remain at around
1.8 percent, in line with the historical average.
Underlying this medium-term projection,
private consumption is anticipated to be more

resilient with the bottoming out of the decline
in remittances while both investment and
exports are projected to be stronger, helped
by a gradual easing of financing conditions
and several ongoing programs to boost
exports and tourism. On the other hand,
Tonga has been one of the region’s leading
reformers in reducing the costs of doing
business and undertaking public enterprise
reform according to the Asian Development
Bank (Central African Republic) and World
Bank (WB), and a further continuation of
reforms, if implemented, could raise its

TONGA

potential growth above what is reflected in
the baseline projection.
9.
Spillovers and risks. Risks to the
outlook are tilted toward the downside. On
the domestic front, growth would be lower if
the fiscal authorities are unable to boost
priority spending on productive sectors due
to cash constraints and/or scale-up domestic
borrowing. On the external front, given
Tonga’s interconnectedness to the regional
economy (Figure 1 and Box 1), a severe shock
to global growth would hit Tonga’s economy
hard, feeding through a number of channels:




Remittances. Remittances from the large
number of Tongans who live abroad had
averaged about 32 percent of GDP over
the last decade. During 2010/11,
remittances dropped by 9¼ percentage
points of GDP (from 2007/08) to
21 percent of GDP. Remittances from New
Zealand declined by 30 percent and those
from the US declined by 25 percent, while
remittances from Australia increased by
50 percent, thanks partly to the Pacific
Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme that was
launched in August 2008. Staff analysis
suggests that macroeconomic conditions
in remitting countries (mainly Australia,
New Zealand and the United States) and
exchange rate fluctuations influence
remittances, providing a direct channel of
spillover from lower global growth. On the
expenditure side of GDP, private
consumption (85 percent of GDP) will be
affected the most, especially given the
ongoing domestic credit crunch.
Exports and Tourism. The export-to-GDP
ratio is low (less than 5 percent of GDP)
and mainly destined to Australia, New
Zealand and the United States (28 percent

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

in total), so the impact through the trade
channel is likely to be small. Tourism has
been the second largest source of foreign
exchange (8–10 percent of GDP) after
remittances and a key sector of growth
that is highly susceptible to the global
business cycle as observed in 2009/10
when tourist arrivals declined by
12 percent from the previous year.
Despite signs of bottoming out, both
cruise ship and air arrivals in 2010/11
stayed below pre-crisis levels.


Foreign Aid. Foreign aid (about
5–10 percent of GDP) could be
susceptible to a tail event in Europe as the
European Union has been one of the
largest providers of budget support
grants.2 Lower project and budget
support grants will lead to reduced public
spending given the cash constraints of the
government. However, the important role
played by multilateral donors (Central
African Republic and WB), China, and the
planned medium-term rise in foreign aid
by Australia and New Zealand would help
mitigate those risks.



Commodity prices. A decline in global
food and fuel prices could provide some
relief to household budgets. However, if
fuel prices were to increase due to supply
disruptions or geopolitical events, the
country would suffer from higher inflation
and a wider current account deficit, in
addition to weak growth.

2

Budget support grants from EU are 12.4 million
pa’anga in 2011/12 and are projected to be 4.7
million pa’anga in the coming fiscal year.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Tonga: Growth Spillovers from the Global Economy
Shocks to external growth and terms of trade are found to affect Tonga’s growth. Remittances, tourism and
exports are important transmission channels for such external shocks.
Methodology
The empirical estimation follows a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) approach by Osterholm and
Zettelmeyer (2008).1 This method uses informative priors on steady-state values and thus improves the
efficiency and is particularly appropriate given the short sample period. The sample covers the period of
1996Q1–2011Q2. The external GDP growth rate is an average of the growth rates in Australia, New
Zealand, and the United States, weighted by their relative shares of Tongan exports during the sample
period. The quarterly growth rate in Tonga is estimated as a function of the number of containers that
arrived in the country, as quarterly GDP growth data are not available.
Effects of External Growth and Terms of Trade Shocks on Growth in Tonga
Shocks to external growth are found to have a larger impact than shocks to terms of trade on
growth in Tonga. A 1-percentage point negative shock to external growth of its major trading partners
causes Tongan growth to decline by 1.3 percentage points after four quarters and 1.4 percentage points
after six quarters. On the other hand, a 10-percent increase in global fuel prices causes Tongan growth
to decline by 0.2 percentage points after two quarters.
Remittances are the most important transmission channel of external growth shocks,



followed by tourism and exports. A 1-percentage point negative external growth causes
remittances growth to decline by 12 percentage points after four quarters.
Tourism and exports are more important than remittances to transmit the impact of



shocks to terms of trade. A 10-percent increase in global fuel prices causes tourism growth
(export growth) to decline by 15 (10) percentage points after four quarters.

Authorities’ views
10.
Outlook and risks. The authorities
agreed that the China EXIM Bank loans have
supported the economic recovery (albeit with
a relatively low multiplier effect due to the
high import content of the reconstruction
loan) but that private domestic demand can
replace the fiscal stimulus and help maintain a

growth rate of 1–2 percent over the medium
term. They also shared the staff’s view that the
weak global environment represents a clear
downside risk, in particular through spillovers
on remittances and tourism. The authorities
recognized the importance of boosting public
priority spending and continuing the public
enterprise reform momentum to support
private sector development.

B. Enhancing Resilience to Shocks
Rebuilding fiscal buffers
11.
Background. Staff projects a fiscal
deficit of about 2¾ percent of GDP in
FY2011/12 (an improvement of 3¼ percentage
points of GDP from the 2010/11 level)
primarily due to higher grants, continued
restraint on current spending, and lower
capital expenditure. Increased budget support
grants are expected to help the government
build up cash balances to better plan for
public services.3 Capital expenditure is
expected to be lower by 2 percentage points
of GDP due to the accelerated completion of
the reconstruction of the central business
district and near completion of the road
projects using the China EXIM Bank loans. The
overall balance (excluding the China EXIM
Bank loans) is expected to rise to a surplus of
about 31 3 percent of GDP in 2011/12 (Table 2).
Staff’s views
12.
Debt sustainability. While the
2011/12 budget execution goes some way
toward reducing fiscal vulnerabilities, Tonga
remains at a ”high risk of external debt
distress“ according to the World Bank-IMF
3

The World Bank disbursed the first of two proposed
budget support grants to Tonga in November 2011
focused on improving public financial management.

debt sustainability analysis (DSA). In addition,
free cash balances of the government amount
to less than two months of current spending.
These vulnerabilities call for rebuilding the
fiscal policy buffer that was drawn down
following the acquisition of two loans from the
China EXIM Bank with a face value totaling
around 25 percent of GDP (Figure 2). To create
room to deal effectively with potential shocks,
including frequent natural disasters, and
reduce the net present value (NPV) of public
external debt below 30 percent of GDP
(indicative DSA threshold level), the authorities
should continue to rebuild cash balances in
the short term to at least two months of
current spending and attain an average
primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in
the medium to long term.
13.
2012/13 budget and medium-term
fiscal framework (Table 2). In order to
maintain spending on development priorities,
laid out in the Tonga Strategic Development
Framework (TSDF), and achieve fiscal
consolidation, it will be essential to raise the
tax effort. The 2012/13 budget and mediumterm fiscal framework should aim to raise the
relatively low tax-to-GDP ratio by at least
0.5 percentage point of GDP annually for the
next two years based on the recommendations
of the PFTAC tax review (Box 2).

Tonga faces a number of fiscal challenges in part due
to weak revenue performances. Tonga has implemented
a series of tax reforms over the past few years:
(i) introduction of a value-added tax known as
consumption tax (CT) in 2005, (ii) modernization of income
taxes in 2008, and (iii) reduction in customs tariffs since
2008 as part of its accession to WTO. In the early stages of
the reforms, revenues rose faster than expected. However,
recently collections have been anemic due to the weak
economy, decline in remittances and a shrinking share of
trade taxes (despite increases in excises).

Sources: Country authority; and Fund staff calculations.

A recent PFTAC review of Tonga’s revenue policy highlighted some of the tax reform priorities.1 The
review finds that the tax policy setting in Tonga is reasonable in a comparative context but there is room for
improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection.
The first pillar: Tax policy reforms – remove leakages and reduce distortions
(a) Eliminate discretionary exemptions: The process for approving and monitoring exemptions should be
strengthened including by publishing potential costs of the exemptions.
(b) Introduce a simplified presumptive taxation for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs):
While rates could be low, it would encourage the SMEs to enter the formal sector of the economy.
(c) Penalties and interest rates: The penalties regime should be reviewed to reduce the severity of the
current regime, and to differentiate between interest and penalties for non-compliance versus underreporting.
(d) Taxation of natural resources: Tonga has already allowed exploration for deep sea mining and a
taxation structure should be put in place before any mining agreements are negotiated.
The second pillar: Reforms of tax administration
Success of a country’s tax policy lies with the capacity and capabilities of its tax administration.
Training of staff, simplifying tax return forms, establishing comprehensive audit and collection monitoring
system, and educating taxpayers are essential. Emphasis should be given to arrest the decline in CT
productivity and raise it to the levels comparable to regional peers by: (i) increased scrutiny of taxpayers
who are close to the threshold to improve compliance; and (ii) faster refunds of input tax credits to
encourage businesses to file claims in a timely manner.

Palau

Otherwise, the expenditure envelope available
for 2012/13 and 2013/14 would imply a
harmful cut in the wage bill and/or increased
domestic borrowing to rollover the rising
external debt repayments of the China EXIM
Bank loans.4 The higher revenues and the level
of budget support grants committed to by the
donor community will help raise domesticallyfunded priority spending as the China EXIM
Bank loan stimulus is withdrawn, while
achieving an overall surplus (excluding the
China EXIM Bank loans) of about 1 percent of
GDP in 2012/13 and in the medium term. This
should also be accompanied by strengthening
debt management and avoiding any new
external borrowing at least until 2014/15 when
the NPV of debt-to-GDP should fall below the
indicative DSA threshold level.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

15.
Expenditure reforms. On the
expenditure side, Tonga needs to build on the
recent progress in public financial
management (PFM). The publication of
monthly financial reports have improved fiscal
transparency and clearly identified the need to
limit within-year reallocations to non-priority
programs. Over the short term, continued
efforts should be put on reining in the wage
bill by adhering to the partial recruitment
freeze and containing across-the-board wage
rises instituted in 2011.5 This would avoid a
squeeze on non-wage expenditures, a problem
that has plagued Tonga in the past.

5

In July 2011, the cabinet brought recruitment in all
parts of the public service under centralized control of
the Ministry of Finance and National Planning agreed
there would be no across-the-board or sector-specific
wage rises in FY2011/12 or FY2012/13.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

TONGA

16.
Quality of spending. Over the
medium term, the focus should remain on
improving the quality of spending and
implementing a medium-term budget
framework (MTBF). To ensure a sustainable
reduction in the share of the wage bill to
45 percent of domestic expenditures as
envisaged by the Government, a broader
restructuring of the public services that
efficiently consolidates line ministries and
introduces a performance-management
system will be essential. While the authorities
aim to reduce the share of the wage bill to
45 percent of domestic spending within three
years, the staff projects a more gradual
reduction in the wage bill to about
47¼ percent by 2016/17 given the noredundancy policy and assuming wage rises
broadly in line with inflation. This will allow a
gradual increase in spending on priority
economic and social sectors, including
maintaining the recently constructed roads
financed by the China EXIM Bank (Box 3). In
this context, the implementation of the MTBF
will help better align budgetary allocations
with government priorities. However, the MTBF
alone will not ensure quality spending without
improved monitoring of spending outcomes
and limiting within-year reallocations. A better
quality of spending and improvements to PFM
systems should help garner further budget
support under the common policy matrix.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities are cognizant of the
high debt burden and are committed to a
medium-term fiscal consolidation. They
recognized the need for revenue enhancement
to meet future debt service obligations and
deficit targets while maintaining an adequate
level of public services. The Ministry of Finance
and National Planning intends to submit to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

cabinet legislation relating to the introduction
of a presumptive tax for SMEs and will
consider staff's other tax reform proposals for
the 2012/13 and 2013/14 budgets. The
authorities felt that expenditure prioritization
would be a challenging task but would
continue its efforts on reducing wasteful
expenses and aim to bring down the wage bill
to 45 percent of government funded
expenditure over the next three years from
about 54 percent at present. The Government
recognizes that containing the wage bill
requires limiting across-the-board pay rises
and sees the public sector restructuring as an
opportunity to realign personnel with policy
priorities. With regard to future infrastructure
projects, the authorities wanted to explore
public private partnerships as an option and
committed not to borrow externally until the
risk of external debt distress recedes.

Maintaining external stability
18.
Background. Buoyant official
development assistance has helped further
build up the reserve buffer (Figure 2). The
current account balance is projected to be at a
deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2011/12 and
average around 3¾ percent of GDP in the
medium term as concessional loan funded
imports taper off and the decline in
remittances bottoms out (Table 4). The capital
and financial account is projected to be
around 7 percent of GDP in FY2011/12 and
gradually decline to around 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term as official foreign
borrowing is phased out.

Box 3. Tonga: Improving Expenditure Quality1
Improving the quality of spending is critical to maintain public service delivery while pursuing fiscal
consolidation. In the 2011/12 budget, the authorities emphasized the importance of carefully reprioritizing
public expenditure in order to adequately resource priority areas in the face of tight fiscal constraints. To
achieve this, the authorities need to focus on three
Allocations to Priority and Other Sectors
key principles:

To date, the authorities have been more successful
in prioritizing allocations in the budget (both
between and within sectors), than in maintaining
those priorities during the budget year through
strict budget execution. To address this weakness, a
number of aspects of budget execution need to be
strengthened over the medium term.

 Within ministries, considerable resource transfers are occurring between line items, major expenditure
categories and sub-programs. These transfers tend to reduce the quality of expenditure, by shifting
resources to lower priority areas and lower value expenditure types.
 The authorities have strengthened in-year budget monitoring in 2011/12, which could provide a solid
foundation for improving the dialogue with line ministries on budget execution. The realignment of
budgetary allocations to match the new ministerial structure in 2012/13 should be taken as an
opportunity to redefine line ministry programs, enabling existing transfer rules to be applied with greater
effect. There may also be merit in introducing new rules to limit transfers involving particular line items,
major expenditure categories or sub-programs that are critical to the achievement of key policy objectives
and where significant problems have been experienced to date.

As a result, reserves are expected to decline
somewhat but remain adequate in terms of

comfort zone of three–four months of imports.

Exchange rate flexibility. The
improved balance of payment position,
allowed the NRBT to let the currency
appreciate by 13 percent against the US$ (and
9 percent in real effective terms) from
December 2010 to the peak of August 2011
(before returning to a level of 6 percent
appreciation by end-2011) to help curb
inflation pressures stemming from rising fuel
and food import prices, as in other Pacific
Island countries. The currency is assessed to be
broadly in line with its medium-term
fundamentals (Box 4). The macroeconomic
balance approach and the purchasing power
parity approach indicate a slight overvaluation
that is within the margin of error. In addition,
foreign exchange interventions and tourist
arrivals continue to show no significant loss of
competitiveness. With headline inflation on a
downward trajectory and forecast to be
around 5 percent in the near term, staff
advises against further exchange rate
appreciation. In fact, should downside risks to
global growth materialize and spill over to
Tonga, the exchange rate can absorb most of
the shock while reserves can be used to
smooth some of the impact.

Authorities’ views
20.
Outlook and policy stance. The
authorities shared the staff’s exchange rate
assessment. They agreed that there is no
further need for appreciation given the current
inflation trajectory and noted that the NRBT
would let the reference currency basket remain
broadly at current levels. The authorities
recognized that the recent buildup in reserves
was due mainly to a surge in official grants and
a large one-off private capital inflow, and
projected the reserves to decline as the official
grants taper off. They stand ready to act
preemptively to control inflation risks as well
as maintain reserves above the NRBT comfort
zone of three–four months of imports.

Monetary policy and financial stability
21.
Context. Monetary conditions have
remained accommodative over the past two
years, but with no signs of a pickup in private
credit (Figure 3 and Table 3). The increase in
international reserves and limited sterilization
led to a large accumulation of banks’ excess
reserves. Yet, private sector credit growth has
remained negative (-9.3 percent (y/y) in
December 2011) due to the still nascent
recovery and tighter lending standards. The
banking system is adequately capitalized and
profitable but credit costs related to the rise in
non-performing loans (NPLs) following the
2004–08 credit bubble remain high; and banks
have continued to restrain credit, albeit with
some signs of the credit crunch bottoming out
(Figure 3 and Table 6).

Box 4. Tonga: Exchange Rate Assessment
Tonga’s exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with its medium-term fundamentals based on
standard analytical approaches. Other indicators also do not suggest pressures of a misalignment. There is
considerable uncertainty in these results, mainly because external balances are heavily influenced by a
small number of factors such as tourism and remittances, and these factors (in particular tourism) could
be quite volatile going forward.
Standard exchange rate assessment methods

 The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that the exchange rate is over-valued by
4 percent compared to its equilibrium level, which is determined as a function of fundamentals
relative to Tonga’s trading partners. These fundamentals include the fiscal balance, economic
growth, income, foreign aid, and demographics.
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Estimates
 The purchasing power parity approach
suggests that Tonga’s currency is above its
long-run equilibrium level by around 6 percent
in real effective terms.
Other indicators

 The current account deficit has been
improving due to the rise in official grants.
While a temporary rise in the deficit is expected
in this fiscal year, reflecting higher imports
along with the economic recovery, the deficit is
expected to average around 3¾ percent of
GDP over the medium term.
 Reserves are expected to remain adequate
within the NRBT comfort zone of three–four
months of imports.

Staff’s views
22.
Policy stance. Staff continues to
recommend that the NRBT maintain an
accommodative stance. While interest rate
spreads remain high due to heightened credit
risks and structural issues, albeit in the midrange of PICs; lending rates have fallen and are
expected to decline further. However, in the
event of a severe global shock, the country
would have little room to implement countercyclical monetary policies in view of the limited
effectiveness of the transmission mechanism
and banks’ cautious approach to lending (see
below).

Financial deepening. Encouraging
intermediation will require strengthening
banks’ balance sheets and the institutional
framework for lending. While progress has
been made in provisioning for NPLs and
reforming the Personal Property Securities Act
(the new electronic registry went live in April
2011) to ensure timely registration of
collateral, there is an urgent need to institute a
centralized credit bureau, facilitate land lease
transactions, and enact a bankruptcy

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

protection law to reduce credit risks and
improve collateral recoveries. Such changes,
together with effective supervision of banks to
ensure financial stability and transparency
(especially, in interest rate and fee structure),
could potentially reduce borrowing costs and
improve access to finance. Staff reiterates the
importance of continuing to resist pressure to
administer banks’ interest rates as it may lead
to a further rationing of credit. Given the
dominant role of credit risks in explaining
interest rate spreads in Tonga, mechanisms to
encourage greater risk sharing such as a partial
guarantee fund (capitalized by donors or the
Government through a budgetary allocation)
channeled through the banking sector to
priority economic sectors with clear eligibility
criteria may have a better chance of success.
The expansion of a mandatory retirement
scheme to the formal private sector could
encourage financial savings and provide a
secure source of retirement income to its
members. At the same time, the retirement
fund should be appropriately regulated and
prudent investment guidelines established.
Authorities’ views
24.
Outlook and policy stance. The
authorities agreed that it remains appropriate
to maintain an accommodative stance and
encourage bank lending while banks are
repairing their balance sheets. They noted the
private sector lobbies’ demand to administer
banks’ interest rates but shared staff’s view
that administering banks’ interest rates would
potentially cause a further rationing of credit.

Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(HIES). The slow pace of economic growth is
partly to blame but the recent decline in
remittances has also played a role.

Higher growth (Box 5). An increase in
growth is needed for making a significant dent
in poverty levels. The key sources of growth
Tonga can harness are those where it can
command premium prices to cover the higher
production costs endemic to small and remote
economies – such as from natural resource
rents in agriculture, tourism and fisheries.
Exploration for seabed minerals have
commenced and hold promise but commercial
viability and potential revenues are yet to be
determined. Private investment in these
sectors could be fostered by reforming the
onerous business licensing requirements,
privatizing Tonga’s largest hotel (currently
dilapidated), and lengthening the duration of
land lease titles and facilitating their transfer.
Implementation of the government’s
infrastructure investment plan and public
enterprise reform program will be critical to
further reduce the costs of doing business.
Reducing the high cost of electricity could be
achieved by implementing the Tonga Energy
Road Map (TERM) with assistance of the World
Bank and other development partners. While
renewable energy capacity is being developed,
the installation of a tank farm, consisting of
large diesel storage tanks, could result in
savings but should be undertaken after a costbenefit analysis and preferably with private
sector participation to minimize fiscal risks.
27.
Inclusive policies. In addition to
higher growth, a set of mutually reinforcing
policies will also likely be needed to increase
inclusiveness. While reconstruction using the
China EXIM Bank loans supported GDP growth
and better infrastructure, linkages to the rest
of the economy were limited due to foreign
contracting and labor. Going forward, the

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

challenge would be to foster more laborintensive value-added industries such as
tourism and agro-fisheries as well as utilize the
seasonal work programs in Australia and New
Zealand to absorb a greater proportion of the
labor force as the public sector wage bill is
contained. In an environment of reduced
remittance receipts, recourse to this form of
insurance arrangement is limited. Thus,
consideration should be given to introducing
social protection schemes such as community
public work programs and reforming the
electricity tariff to build a lifeline tariff to
protect the poorest consumers. Currently,
Tonga provides good access to basic
education and health but formal social
protection programs are limited to the public
service contributory pension scheme (Table 7).
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities are ready to act.
They agreed with staff on the urgent need to
boost growth and reduce poverty. The
authorities also concurred on the potential of
agriculture, tourism and fisheries as the
sources of growth. But they noted the
difficulties in expanding the export and
production bases due to the capacity
constraints and geographic distance. The
Government adopted in April 2010 the TERM,
which includes measures to increase efficiency
in electricity supply and use, and develop gridconnected domestic renewable energy
resources. They also committed to
implementing public enterprise and business
licensing reforms to reduce the costs of doing
business to support the private sector led
growth strategy outlined in the TSDF.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Tonga: Raising Potential Growth1
Tonga faces numerous constraints to raise its relatively low rate of potential growth. In addition to its
exposure to natural disasters, geographic remoteness and narrow economic base have put Tonga in a
disadvantage in competing in export markets and attracting foreign investment. To raise potential growth,
the country has to step up its effort on structural reforms to promote private sector development.
Tonga is one of the most isolated countries in
the World, limiting export opportunities to
exploiting its natural resources rents such as in
fisheries, seafloor mining and tourism. However,
key bottlenecks to private investment hinder growth
in such sectors. In particular, business licensing
requirements have been cumbersome and utility
costs are some of the highest in the world.
Moreover, the very low efficiency of state owned
enterprises (SOEs) has been a drag on growth and
crowded out private investment.
A private sector assessment undertaken by the
Central African Republic in 2011 identified the
key bottlenecks to promoting growth.2 In terms of
economic infrastructure development, the
authorities should aim to boost private sector
competitiveness by: (i) regularly updating and
implementing the infrastructure development plan; (ii)
improving access to finance and broadband internet
services; (iii) establishing a sustainable fund for better
road maintenance; and (iv) reducing the high cost of
electricity by implementing the Tonga Energy Road
Map (TERM) adopted in April 2010. In particular, for the
latter, a broad range of regulatory, legislative and institutional reforms are called for. These include
petroleum sector reforms to increase competition, hedge fuel costs, improve safety, and strengthen
energy security; and electricity sector reforms to support changes in the energy mix and increases in
efficiency and appropriate pricing; as well as measures to mobilize increased renewable energy generation.
Business regulatory environment should be improved through the following priorities: (i) shifting
licensing from an “activity” to an “enterprise” basis and providing long-term operating licenses;
(ii) broadening the scope of the Companies Act to include provision for the formation of community
companies and other indigenous forms of business; and (iii) enacting key business law legislation to fill in
the gaps in the commercial legal framework.
Public enterprise reform should help reduce the costs of doing business and “crowd-in” private sector
competitors. In the near-term, SOEs should operate on business principles and the Government should
continue to enhance effective stewardship of the SOEs by removing ministers and public servants from
boards of directors and expanding the pool of skilled directors from the private sector with targeted
training. In the medium term, the Government should consider privatization of SOEs to increase efficiency
and attract private investment.

D. Outreach
29.
The team participated in a regional
workshop organized by the NRBT to discuss
the economic challenges facing Tonga. The
team also met with local officials and the

private sector, and discussed policy priorities
with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet
Economic Development Committee.

E. Other Issues
30.
Exchange restrictions. The authorities
have not introduced any new exchange
measures since the last Article IV consultation.

31.
Data provision. While economic
statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance,
data deficiencies continue to complicate the
monitoring of economic conditions and policy
formulation (Annex 1).

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Outlook and risks. Economic growth
is expected to continue its gradual recovery
led by a pick-up in private sector activity and
remain at around 1.8 percent in the medium
term, in line with its historical average. Nearterm risks to growth stem mainly from
downside risks to global growth particularly
through lower remittances and tourism.
33.
Fiscal developments. The 2011/12
overall fiscal deficit is expected to narrow
primarily due to higher budget support grants,
continued restraint on current spending, and
lower capital expenditure related to the China
EXIM Bank loans that were run down faster
than previously anticipated. However, public
external debt remains at high risk of distress
and cash balances are inadequate to meet the
rising debt service burden and maintain public
services without additional domestic
borrowing.
34.
Fiscal stance. Staff recommends
rebuilding cash balances to at least 2 months’
worth of recurrent expenses and attaining a
primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP on

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

average in the medium to long term. The
emphasis should be on a prudent fiscal
strategy focused on reining in the wage bill,
improving tax policy and administration, and
strengthening public financial management.
The authorities should also strengthen debt
management and avoid any new external
borrowing until the NPV of external debt-toGDP ratio falls below 30 percent.
35.
Tax reform. A package of tax policy
and administrative measures amounting to
about 0.5 percentage point of GDP annually
for the next two years from a range of options
recommended by PFTAC TA should be
implemented. These reforms should begin in
2012/13 to allow a gradual increase in priority
spending on priority and economic sectors to
support the economic recovery as the fiscal
stimulus from the China EXIM Bank loans is
withdrawn.
36.
Monetary policy. The current
monetary stance is appropriate. The NRBT
efforts to maintain adequate liquidity in the
system are appropriately aimed at

TONGA

encouraging banks to reduce lending rates
while maintaining financial stability.
37.
Exchange rate. The currency is
broadly in line with the fundamentals. With
headline inflation on a downward trajectory
and forecast to be below 5 percent in the near
term, the exchange rate is expected to remain
broadly stable against the currency basket
going forward.
38.
Banking system. The banking system
is adequately capitalized and profitable but
provisioning costs related to the rise in
nonperforming loans remain high. In such an
environment encouraging financial
intermediation will require a continued
strengthening of banks’ balance sheets and
the institutional framework for lending such as
facilitating the use of land as collateral and
loan recoveries through a bankruptcy law.
Administering banks’ interest rates should also
be avoided as it may lead to a further rationing
of credit.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

39.
Inclusive growth. Implementing the
private sector led growth strategy to unleash
natural resource rents in agriculture, tourism
and fisheries could raise potential growth and
make it more inclusive. While reconstruction
using the China EXIM Bank loans supported
GDP growth, it was import and foreign labor
dependent. Tourism, utilization of the seasonal
worker program to Australia and New Zealand,
and agro-fisheries could absorb a greater
proportion of the labor force. Staff
recommends reforms to improve the business
climate particularly the onerous business
licensing regime. Investment in renewable
energy, given the sole reliance on diesel
generators, and public enterprise reform will
be critical to reduce the costs of doing
business. Consideration should also be given
to introducing social protection schemes.
40.
It is recommended that Tonga remain
on the 12-month cycle for the Article IV
consultations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Previous Fund Recommendations:
The staff and the authorities have continued to
share comprehensive views in the past about
policy priorities. During the 2011 consultation,
Executive Directors noted that the policy
challenge was to reduce the country’s
vulnerabilities and to boost potential growth.
They stressed the importance of fiscal
consolidation in ensuring fiscal sustainability
and expanding fiscal space to respond to
future shocks. But the authorities have
followed more moderate steps, primarily

TONGA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

owing to capacity constraints and a change in
government. Shortcomings continue to be
mainly in the area of fiscal policy, where staff
recommended reducing current spending,
carefully prioritizing spending, improving tax
administration, and improving transparency.
Staff also recommended setting up a
comprehensive medium-term budget
framework, improving fiscal management, and
strenthening debt management. Progress has
been made in setting up a medium-term
budget framework.
Technical Assistance:
Legal Department (LEG) has provided
assistance on AML/CFT issues for the Pacific
islands countries, including Tonga, with an
emphasis on risk management.
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC) has provided assistance on budgetary
management; tax administration; banking
legislation and supervision; and balance of
payments and national accounts statistics.
Resident Representative: None.

ANNEX II. TONGA: PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC) COUNTRY STRATEGY
2012–141
Background
Tonga has faced a difficult macroeconomic
environment in recent times. Following the
global economic crisis growth stagnated,
remittances fell and fiscal revenues declined
sharply. The financial sector also came under
pressure as a result of high levels of nonperforming loans in the banking sector. High
debt levels constrained fiscal space and the
authorities approached development partners
to provide budget support to enable key
services to continue. Recent donor
conferences have endorsed the authorities’
prudent fiscal strategy and development
partners are currently working on a joint
policy matrix to underpin budget support—
technical assistance (TA) will be critical for
successful implementation.
PFTAC has provided TA to Tonga in all
sectors in recent years, collaborating
closely with other development partners.
This has been particularly so in the public
financial management (PFM) area where
PFTAC has been working with the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) to assist the
authorities design and implement a realistic
reform roadmap. Regular TA has also been
provided in the compilation of National
Accounts and Balance of Payment statistics.
Support has also been provided to the
National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) in
offsite and onsite banking supervision (IMF
HQ has also provided TA for on-site

supervision) and in exchange rate
management.
Strategy 2012–14
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD
regional strategy note and is planned within
the results framework for current PFTAC
funding cycle.2 This strategy was discussed with
the authorities in June 2011.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities
sustain progress on fiscal consolidation
and to improve the macroeconomic
environment. PFTAC will continue to work
closely with the broader development partner
group to ensure coherence and will aim to
support implementation of actions in the
development partners’ budget support reform
matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and
statistics sectors with detailed training and
capacity building in bank supervision and
macroeconomics.

italics in the section, for example cash management is
referred to as (1.6), where 1.6 is the code in the result
framework in the program document.

PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities
sustain progress on fiscal consolidation
and to improve the macroeconomic
environment. PFTAC will continue to work
closely with the broader development partner
group to ensure coherence and will aim to
support implementation of actions in the
development partners’ budget support reform
matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and
statistics sectors with detailed training and
capacity building in bank supervision and
macroeconomics.
In the public financial management area,
the focus will primarily be, together with
AsDB, on refining the PFM roadmap
developed on the basis of the 2010 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) assessment (1.2). PFTAC will contribute
specific technical areas to support the AsDB
project that aims to develop an effective
medium-term budget framework (1.5). These
are likely to be in more accurate
macroeconomic analysis (5.1) and more
rigorous cash/debt management (1.6). In the
medium term, PFTAC would look to assist the
authorities implement a follow-up PEFA
assessment, probably in 2014 (1.1).
In the revenue area, the main focus will be
assisting the authorities implement the
recommendations of the PFTAC strategic
revenue review The review and PFTAC’s
regional benchmarking exercise showed that
Tonga is one of the regional leaders in terms
of implementing modern administrative
practices; Tonga is also expected to continue
to have access to resident TA through AusAID.
PFTAC inputs will be determined by ongoing
discussions with Ministry of Finance and the
revenue administration and are likely to be
reliant on resident advisors. PFTAC’s specific

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

inputs are likely to be focused on policy
enhancements, including natural resource
taxation (2.1), IT development (2.3), and risk
management and compliance strategies (2.5).
In statistics, Tonga is relatively well advanced
against the overall results framework; based
on PFTAC advice, it produces National
Accounts on two independent measures (4.1)
with production of a range of income
indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics
are now being developed according to BPM6
standards (4.8). However, the quality of
statistics and source data need to be
strengthened which is being assisted by an
AusAID funded resident advisor. As a result,
direct PFTAC assistance is expected to reduce.
PFTAC will, however, continue to coordinate
with and be a resource for the resident
advisor and be available to provide focused
technical inputs in particular areas. This may
include assistance with rebasing of the
National Accounts (4.2) using new Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data.
Balance of payments support will be provided
by IMF HQ.
In financial sector supervision, IMF/PFTAC
has assisted the NRBT establish enhanced offsite analysis (3.1 and 3.2) and has provided
support to on-site bank supervision. Intensive
support will be provided in 2012/13 to build
on-site supervision techniques through
training in standard procedures, reports and
analytical techniques (3.5-3.7). PFTAC will also
provide follow-up support on to ensure that
NRBT can regularly prepare off-site analysis
and monitoring reports (3.1-3.3) using base
prudential returns developed by AFSPC. In
2013 this is likely to encompass
implementation of the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) Financial Sector Information
System (FSIS) .

In the macroeconomic area, the PFTAC
macroeconomic advisor will continue to
develop measures of pass-through to inflation
to assist NRBT enhance its macroeconomic
policy making (5.1). PFTAC will coordinate
with macroeconomic input under the ADB
PFM TA project to ensure GDP and fiscal
forecasting becomes more robust (5.3). The
advisor may also support the development of
debt sustainability analysis (5.4).

ANNEX III. TONGA: WORLD BANK–IMF
COLLABORATION1
The IMF team led by Mr. Jay Peiris (Mission
Chief to Tonga) has a close working
relationship with the Bank team led by
Mr. Vivek Suri (Lead Economist, East Asia and
the Pacific Region) and Mr. Robert Jauncey
(Senior Country Officer). The teams have an
ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic
and structural issues.2
The level of cooperation and coordination is
good and includes the following:






1

Article IV Consultation. The World Bank
participated in the 2009–12 Article IV
missions as well as joining several
consultations and providing various
analytical inputs to the 2012 Article IV
Report. This participation facilitated the
discussions, especially in areas of mutual
interest such as fiscal policy and structural
reform. In addition, Bank and Fund staffs
prepare jointly the Debt Sustainability
Analysis appendix to the staff reports.
Economic Updates. Fund staff provided
an “Assessment Letter” on Tonga’s
macroeconomic situation. This public
document was a key input to the Bank’s
decision to provide budget support to
Tonga. IMF analysis continues to provide a
vital framework to the ongoing budget
support program.
Structural Fiscal Reforms. Bank and Fund
staffs have worked successfully to provide
As of April 2012.

technical assistance in public expenditure
management and continue to collaborate
on the ongoing analytical work on public
expenditure, the medium-term macroframework and general structural issues.
Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and
the Fund share a common view about Tonga’s
macroeconomic and structural reform
priorities, which mainly aim at mitigating the
risks to Tonga’s external and fiscal
sustainability and at promoting long-term
growth. These include:


Putting public debt firmly on a
downward path. This will require progress
on multiple fronts over the medium term,
including the effective implementation of
current policy to avoid new borrowing,
stepping up revenue administration and
expenditure control, prioritizing
expenditure, as well as structural reforms.
The government’s fiscal efforts will need to
be supplemented by continued provision
of grants from donors.



Making use of the flexibility afforded by
the current exchange rate arrangement.
This remains critical for safeguarding
external stability.



Promoting private drivers of growth.
Given fundamental constraints of
smallness and isolation, growth prospects
are likely to remain concentrated in areas
where premiums can be generated to
cover higher costs of production. Natural
resource industries, including tourism,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX TONGA

agriculture, fisheries and mining hold the
greatest potential for private sector
development. To facilitate development in
these areas there is a need to (i) improve
efficiency in the energy sector to reduce
costs (ii) strengthen the institutional
framework for lending—including the
enforcement of creditor rights to
collateral—as a means to increase access
to finance and lower the cost of borrowing;
(iii) improve vital tourism infrastructure,
including through privatization of the
Dateline Hotel and commercialization of
Tonga Communication Corporation;
(iii) reduce the administrative burden
placed on the private sector by the existing
system of business licenses; and (iv) lower
barriers to foreign investment.
World Bank Group cooperation with Tonga is
set out in a Country Assistance Strategy
presented to the Board in October 2010. Given
the current depth of policy dialogue and
Tonga’s difficult position, the Bank is
significantly scaling up both analytical and
financial support for Tonga. Total IDA and
Trust Fund commitments to Tonga over the
past three years amount to almost
US$73 million, compared to $30 million
between 1985–when Tonga became a
member–and FY10. All assistance has been
provided on 100 percent grant terms.
A key focus of engagement has been around
energy-sector and general budget support
operations. US$5 million was provided to
energy-sector reforms in FY2011, with a series

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of two development policy operations–
focusing on reforms in public financial
management, fiscal policy and structural
reforms–providing an additional US$14 million
of Woirld Bank financing over FY2012–FY2013
through a World Bank-led multi-donor
process.
Other World Bank investments are focused
around connectivity for sustainable economic
development, and include (i) a broadband
cable, cofinanced with AsDB (US$17.2 million),
(ii) transport sector reform, with PRIF and
AusAID financing (US$14.7 million), and (iii)
aviation sector support (US$27.2 million).
The World Bank provided TA to the Ministry of
Finance and National Planning during FY2012
to strengthen budget execution, monitoring,
reporting and transparency, and, with AusAID
financing support, is providing additional TA
support to the Public Service Commission in
managing the current restructure.
The Bank and Fund teams will continue their
close cooperation going forward, particularly
in supporting the current program of budget
support and to assist the Government in
responding to ongoing economic difficulties.
Appendix I details the specific activities
planned by the two country teams over the
September 2010–September 2012 period. It
was also agreed that further details on
collaboration, as necessary, will be agreed at
the technical level as work progresses.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX TONGA

ANNEX IV. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The goal of the Asian Development Bank’s
(AsDB) Pacific Approach 2010–14 of a
sustained and resilient and improved standard
of living aligns with the vision of Tonga’s
Strategic Development Framework 2009/2010–
2014/2015 (TSDF) to create a society in which
all Tongans enjoy higher living standards and a
better quality of life. Similarly, as the Pacific
Approach aims to achieve its goal through
inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, the TSDF aspires to achieve its vision
through equitable and environmentally
sustainable private sector-led economic
growth. AsDB’s country partnership strategy
(CPS) 2007–12 for Tonga shares the same
focus as the Pacific Approach and the TSDF. 3
AsDB’s support to Tonga will be through
infrastructure development; renewable energy;
effective, prudent macroeconomic and fiscal
management; and private sector development.
The Pacific Approach focuses on the need to
mitigate environmental impact and strengthen
cliamte change resilience through
development of renewable energy options;
enhancing connectivity via multimodal
networks and new technologies; and
supporting urban development. Two key
drivers of change to promote the focus of the
Pacific Approach include improved private
sector environment and public sector
management. The priority outcome objectives
of the TSDF supported by AsDB are: (i) to
support private sector through better
engagement with government, appropriate
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

incentives and streamlining rules and
regulations, (ii) maintain and develop
infrastructure to improve the everyday lives of
people, and (iv) integrate environmental
sustainability and climate change into all
planning and executing of programs. AsDB’s
strategy for Tonga is therefore consistent with
the Pacific Approach and the TSDF.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and 4 grants
totaling $94.86 million from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) to Tonga since it
joined AsDB in 1972. Sixty one technical
assistance (TA) projects with a value of
$17.6 million were also provided to improve
capacity and strengthen institutional
development in various sectors. Past AsDB
investments have focused on finance
development and infrastructure development
in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include two grant-financed
projects and three TA projects in the country
portfolio. The grant-financed program
approved in 2009 helped Tonga mitigate the
impact of the global economic crisis, while
establishing the basis for higher, more
equitable and sustainable growth in the
medium term and creating an economy more
resilient to future shocks. Another grantfinanced project supports enhancing living
standards by improving urban infrastructure.
Of the three ongoing TA projects, one focuses
on economic and strategic management as
well as the development of a public finance
management roadmap and a medium-term
budget framework. Two TA projectss are
supporting the preparation of the proposed

TONGA

Tonga-Fiji submarine cable project and the
second phase of the integrated urban
development project. Tonga also benefits from
a number of regional technical assistance
projects in private sector development,
economic management, energy efficiency, and
public financial management. Assistance to

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

climate change adaptation amd mitigation
activities will be made available, in particular,
the pilot program for climate resilience will
support the mainstreaming of climate change
considerations into infrastructure development
and through broader who-of-government
institutional strengthening.

ANNEX V. TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly
adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies
continue to complicate the monitoring of
economic conditions and policy formulation.
The Statistics Department (SD) and the
Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MOFNP) have received, on a regular basis,
technical assistance in national accounts,
government finance, and balance of payments
(BOP) statistics from Fund’s Statistics
department (STA) as well as the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC);
nevertheless, data provision to the Fund
continues with long delays.
The two main sources of statistical information
are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual
and semi-annual budget reports from the
MOFNP. The country has been participating in
the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/g
ddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON).

Real Sector Statistics
Following PFTAC assistance in 2008 and 2009 a
new series of national accounts was released in
June 2009. The new series retains a 2000/01
base year but has been revised to improve
coverage and estimation techniques. However,
source data remains weak and needs to be
improved to allow a long overdue rebase of
the national accounts. The SD has obtained the
assistance of a statistical advisor from New
Zealand to improve the quality of the national
accounts and balance of payments statistics.
The advisor is helping implement the

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

recommendations of the PFTAC technical
assistance mission and expects improvements
in the classification and valuation of inputs into
the national accounts data.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket
of goods and services from the 2000/01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Technical assistance was provided in 2008 on
the development of an import price index.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment
statistics have not been compiled since 2003;
and average earnings statistics are not
available. Currently the migration data is
insufficient, in particular the data on
emigration to the United States.

Government Finance Statistics
The FY2002/03 Central Government Budget
Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal
data compiled according to the methodology
of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual. However, improvements are still
needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal
data. Proper classification of transactions is
needed to permit reconciliation with monetary
financing data. Lags in updating the
accounting system should be shortened.
Published data are often subject to significant
revisions. Consolidated financial statistics for
the broader public sector and general
government are not published due to lack of
capacity. No data are reported for publication
in the IFS or GFS Yearbook.

TONGA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

External Sector Statistics
Official BOP statistics are compiled annually by
the SD with long lags. Monthly trade figures,
derived from customs data, are available with a
three-month lag. Unofficially, the NRBT
compiles monthly balance of payments
statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions (OET) records of the banking
system with a six-week lag. There are
significant differences between the BOP
estimates compiled by the two agencies.
Moreover, large errors and omissions point to
possible under recording of imports. With
regard to international investment
positions, no information is published due to
lack of capacity.
With PFTAC assistance in March 2009 the SD
developed revised draft BoP statistics and
methodology, and made recommendations for
further improvements in compilation
techniques and source data. A follow-up
mission took place in March 2010. The MOFNP

has put in place a system that provides
detailed information on official sector external
disbursements and debt service.

Monetary and Financial Statistics
NRBT reports data for the central bank, other
depository corporations, and monetary
aggregates using the standardized report
forms (SRFs). These data were published for
the first time in the March 2008 issue of IFS
and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial
Statistics. The NRBT will have to allocate
resources to improve the quality of the
monetary and financial statistics by obtaining
source data suitable for compilation of the
SRFs in line with the recommendations of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Technical assistance in monetary and financial
statistics will be needed to improve the
classification and sectorization of accounts
once the new prudential reporting system has
been introduced.

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Tonga remains at a high risk of debt distress based on the joint IMF-WB low-income
country debt sustainability assessment (LIC DSA). Scheduled repayments on the two loans
(reconstruction and roads) from the China EXIM Bank may pose a fiscal challenge unless
sufficient cash reserves are built up by improving tax collections and reining in current
expenses. Government’s balance sheet also faces a currency risk as about 61 percent of
the outstanding external debt is denominated in Chinese renminbi. Nonetheless, Tonga’s
remittance inflows (projected to average around 20 percent of GDP in the medium term)–
the largest source of foreign exchange earnings–may help mitigate liquidity risks. Taking
into account the cushion provided to the economy by remittances, the projected debt
profile is consistent with manageable–if high risk– debt dynamics. A declining path of
external public debt is critically dependent on the steadfast implementation of the
ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy envisaged by the authorities.
Additional new debt in the short term will further worsen the already high risk of external
debt distress, as well as risks to external sustainability, and significantly constrain the
space available for social and developmental priorities, as outlined in the Tonga Strategic
Development Framework (TSDF). These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of
sound macroeconomic policies to improve Tonga’s growth potential on a sustained basis,
export diversification, and continued efforts on fiscal consolidation.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TONGA

BACKGROUND
1.
As a small open economy, Tonga is
facing the dual challenge of large fluctuations
on the external side and a limited production
base on the domestic side. On the one hand, it
heavily relies on remittances, tourism, and
foreign aid. On the other hand, the production
and export bases are narrow and include mainly
a few agricultural products and fisheries.
2.
The economy is gradually recovering
from the effects of the global slowdown and
the domestic credit crunch. The recovery has
been led by strengthening gross fixed
investment and rebounding tourism. At the same
time, the fiscal overall balance excluding the
spending funded by the China EXIM Bank loans
has improved thanks to a rise in grants and
restraint in current expenditure.
3.
Tonga’s total public sector debt stock
(including publicly guaranteed debt) has risen
since FY2008/09, and is expected to reach
45½ percent of GDP by the end of current
fiscal year. External debt accounts for majority of
the stock, amounting to about 41 percent of
GDP. This rise in debt stock was primarily on
account of two external loans (one for
reconstruction of the capital city and one for
roads) from the China EXIM Bank.1 These loans
account for 61 percent of the outstanding
external debt, while long-term loans by
international financial institutions (IFIs) account
for about 36 percent of external debt. In the
1

These loan commitments were signed in November
2007 (RMB 440 million for reconstruction), and in
February 2010 (RMB 291 million for roads), and bear a
2 percent interest rate on the outstanding renminbi
amount, 5-year grace, and a 20-year maturity. The
arrangement with the contractor performing the work
funded by these loans required an initial
disbursement of 30 percent to cover the down
payment, while outstanding disbursements are paid
quarterly as work is completed and claims are filed.
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

current fiscal year, disbursements by the China
EXIM Bank are projected to be completed for the
reconstruction loan and nearly completed for the
road loan. The loan for reconstruction also
financed two additional projects: an extension of
the Royal Palace and the construction of a new
wharf to attract cruise ships. By the end of this
fiscal year, about 60 percent of the reconstruction
loan will have been used to finance direct
government capital spending while the
remainder will have been on-lent to the private
sector for office, residential, and retail
construction. The terms of the on-lending
include an interest rate of 5 percent on the
outstanding Tongan pa’anga amount and the
government is expected to start receiving
repayments from the private borrowers after the
completion of the projects.2 The entire road loan
will be used to finance direct government capital
spending on road improvements, including in
outer islands.
4.
Despite the rise in overall debt, the
government has continued to reduce its
domestic debt level. Domestic debt-to-GDP
ratio had nearly halved by the end of the last
fiscal year from an average of 13 percent of GDP
seen during the last decade. The majority of the
domestic debt (about 70 percent) is in the form
of long-term government bonds while the
remainder is government guaranteed debt.
5.
Tonga’s DSA builds on the baseline
scenario assumptions presented in Box 1. It
assumes that the near-term GDP growth will
recover to around 1.8 percent and stay at a
similar level over the medium to long term as in
the last DSA.

2

As of March 2012, one private borrower has started
repaying to the government.

TONGA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Box 1. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions

 Real GDP growth is projected to be around
1½ percent in 2011/12 and marginally higher in the
medium and longer term. The recovery in the near and
medium term is led by the fiscal impulse provided by
the China EXIM Bank loans, and recovery in tourism
and remittances. Longer term growth reflects a return
on the ongoing capital projects, but will remain around
1.8 percent constrained by structural impediments.


The Government is assumed to undertake a
revenue-based fiscal consolidation aimed at achieving
an overall fiscal surplus (excluding the China EXIM
Bank loans) of around 1¼ percent of GDP over the
medium term. Reforms in tax policy and
administration is expected to improve the tax-to-GDP
ratio to 17½ percent of GDP from 16¼ percent of GDP
over the medium term, while cash grants will peak at
around 11½ percent of GDP in 2012/13 before
declining to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2016/17. Current
expenditure (excluding project grants) is expected to
slow down, led by a reduction in wage bill by about ¾
percentage point of GDP over the medium term.
Domestically-funded capital expenditure is expected to
increase from about ½ percent of GDP to 2 percent of
GDP.

 Over the longer term, the primary fiscal surplus is
expected to be about 1 percent of GDP as in the last
DSA reflecting a reduction in cash grants. Lower
project grants primarily explain the reduction in
expenditure (excluding the China EXIM Bank loans)
from 25¼ percent of GDP in the medium term to
about 22 percent of GDP in the longer term, while
wage bill averages about 45 percent of domesticallyfunded expenditure as targeted by the government
Domestically financed capital expenditure is assumed
to remain at 2 percent of GDP.


Financing. Majority of the grants, together with
projected disbursements from concessional loans, are
assumed to be spent on development projects and
associated maintenance. Following the final
disbursement of the China EXIM Bank road loan next
year, there will be no external borrowing until the debt
ratio falls below the DSA threshold and all future
external borrowings are assumed comparable to
concessional IFI (AsDB and World Bank) facilities that
will raise the grant element of future borrowing. On
the domestic front, no new (net) domestic borrowing is

assumed as fiscal consolidation advances and the
public debt is brought down (as percent of GDP).



The external current account is projected to reach
a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2011/12, from a deficit
of 1½ percent of GDP in 2010/11, as increase in
imports (along with the economic recovery) more than
offset the increase in grants and remittances. The
deficit should average around 3¾ percent of GDP over
the medium term, while it is expected to improve to
around 3¼ percent of GDP over the longer term,
reflecting slightly better prospects for remittances,
tourism receipts, and exports of goods (see below).



The decline in remittances is estimated by staff to
have bottomed out in FY2009/10 in US$ terms.
Remittances are expected to continue picking up along
with the economic recovery in Australia, New Zealand
and the US, and as Australia implements the Pacific
Seasonal Worker Program on July 1, 2012, building on
the lessons learned from the pilot program.
Remittances are projected to recover to around 22
percent of GDP over the longer term, 10 percentage
points of GDP lower than the average observed during
the past decade.



Tourism receipts are projected to average around
9 percent of GDP over the medium term and gradually
increase to an average of 12 percent of GDP over the
longer term, reflecting the return on the ongoing
efforts to boost tourism.

 The export base is projected to remain narrow and
relatively undiversified with a focus on agricultural
products. Proper operation of the fumigation facility
should help gradually increase exports as the products
will meet New Zealand’s bio-security requirements.
Exports are projected to gradually increase to
3 percent of GDP in medium term (from 2½ percent in
2010/11) and further to 4½ percent by 2030.
 The capital and financial account is projected to
be around 7 percent of GDP in FY2011/12 and
gradually decline to around 2 percent over the
medium term as official foreign borrowing is phased
out. Over the longer term, it is projected to average
4 percent of GDP, reflecting higher FDI inflows.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TONGA

On the fiscal front, the government is expected
to implement an ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan supported by tax reforms,
budget support grants, and restraint on nonpriority and payroll expenditure while increasing
priority spending. Under these assumptions, the
government will be able to rebuild cash balances
and maintain a declining debt path while
covering rising debt service costs. Revenues are
expected to get a boost from the proposed
reforms to tax policy and administration, while
cash grants are higher in 2011/12 and 2012/13
than envisaged in the last DSA based on firm
commitments by donors. Cash grants are
projected to peak in 2012/13 and remain
constant in nominal terms at the level of 2013/14
thereafter. The higher level of grants largely
explains the more favorable external current
account and primary fiscal balance projections
over the medium term. The medium-term overall
fiscal balance (excluding the China EXIM Bank
loans) is projected to average a surplus of about
1¼ percent of GDP, thereby limiting the need for
additional borrowing. Remittances—the largest
source of foreign exchange earnings (one-half of
Tongans live abroad, mostly in Australia, New
Zealand, and the United States)—are assumed to
recover in the medium to long term, in line with
economic recovery in remittance-originating
countries, and remain an important external
cushion. The recovery in remittances is, however,
more sluggish than assumed in the previous
DSA. Remittances are projected to recover from
19 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 21 percent by
2016/17 and 22 percent over the longer term.
This level is consistent with the average level
during 1994–2000, but much lower than the
32 percent of GDP average observed during
2001–10.

6.
The current DSA suggests a similar
path for debt dynamics as in last year’s DSA,
albeit staying at a lower level in the medium
term reflecting the more frontloaded
drawdown of the China EXIM Bank loans in
the past. Tonga continues to be at high risk of
external debt distress, with the debt burden
peaking early in the projection period and then
gradually declining in the absence of any new
external borrowing in the short term. However,
the slightly lower debt indicators relative to the
previous DSA mainly reflect a more front-loaded
drawdown of the China EXIM Bank loans and the
appreciation of the exchange rate over the last
year. The key changes to the macroeconomic
assumptions in the DSA are (Box 1): first, it
assumes a better non-interest external current
account position thanks to better export and
tourism prospects, and higher official cash
grants.3 Second, it assumes that going forward
the Government will undertake planned revenue
reforms that will lead to a greater fiscal
consolidation–including a tightening of existing
tax concessions and exemptions, and
introduction of a presumptive tax regime for
SMEs–contributing to a buildup in adequate cash
reserves. However, the larger primary surplus in
the medium term largely reflects the frontloaded utilization of the China EXIM Bank loans.
In the longer term, the fiscal consolidation path is
assumed to result in same level of primary
surplus (1 percent of GDP on average) as in the
previous DSA.

current account assumptions.

TONGA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
7.
Under the baseline, the external
debt trajectory breaches several policydependent thresholds in the short term
before receding to lower levels over the
medium term (Figure 1a). The present value
(PV) of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt is above 30 percent of GDP, the
indicative threshold level. The PV of PPG
external debt is projected to peak at about
33 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year,
3 percentage points above the threshold, and
drop below the threshold in FY2014/15, (a few
years earlier than suggested in the last DSA)
further declining to around 25 percent of GDP
by 2016/17.
8.
External debt remains well above the
PV of debt-to-export distress threshold over
the medium term. Reflecting Tonga’s low
exports, the PV of PPG external debt-to-exports
ratio would peak at 183 percent in the current
fiscal year and remain above the threshold until
2018/19. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio,
however, would stay below the threshold
throughout the projection period, thanks to the
impact of expected revenue reforms and
significant grant inflows in the medium term.
9.
However, Tonga’s remittances would
help reduce liquidity risks (Figure 1b). Tonga’s
remittances have averaged about eight times the
export receipts over the past decade, and have
provided a stable source of foreign exchange
inflows. Relative to remittances and exports, the
PV of PPG external debt is projected to stay
above the (lower) modified threshold of
80 percent for the next two years, starting to fall

below the threshold five years sooner than when
remittances are ignored.4 Therefore, scenario
analysis that takes into account remittances has
been added, though the risk assessment is still
based on the regular thresholds.
10.
Debt service is expected to rise in the
medium term on account of expiration of the
five-year grace period on the China EXIM
Bank loans. In terms of exports, debt service will
stay close to the threshold of 15 percent in the
medium term (Figure 1a). Given its narrow export
base, Tonga will be unable to expand its exports
in the short term, aggravating the possibility of
solvency and liquidity risks. However, when
remittances are considered with export earnings,
external debt service remains well under the
(lower) modified threshold of 12 percent
throughout the projection period (Figure 1b).
Remittances are expected to have bottomed out
in US$ terms and will likely stabilize at around
22 percent of GDP over the longer term. As
mentioned earlier, this represents a modest
recovery from the recent weakness, although
remittances (in percent of GDP) would be lower
than in the years before the global financial crisis.
With regard to revenue, the ratio of debt serviceto-revenue remains well below the threshold of
18 percent throughout the projection period
albeit with a deterioration in the short to medium
term (Figure 1a).
4

In a recent review (SM/12/10), the IMF Executive
Board approved modifications in some of the
thresholds, while keeping other thresholds
unchanged. The revised thresholds for countries with
weak CPIA ratings, such as Tonga, are: (i) 80 percent
for PV of PPG external debt-to-exports and
remittances (revised from 90 percent), (ii) 12 percent
for debt service-to-exports and remittances (revised
from 15 percent); and (iii) 18 percent for debt serviceto-revenue (previously 25 percent).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TONGA

Sensitivity Analysis
11.
Stress tests show that the external
debt position is vulnerable to a significant
depreciation or a slowdown in exports. A large
one-time depreciation (assumed 30 percent in
FY2012/13) would cause the PV of external debt
to rise to nearly 45 percent of GDP and remain
persistently above the 30 percent threshold in
the medium term (Figure 1a). The same
depreciation shock also causes the PV of debtto-revenue ratio to breach its threshold in the
short term, and debt service-to-revenue ratio to
breach the threshold later in the medium term.
The export shock stress test causes the PV of
external debt to approach nearly 250 percent of
exports and remain above the 100 percent
threshold well into the next decade. The debt
service-to-exports ratio also rises above the
threshold in the medium term. Similar stresses

emerge when remittances are considered though
debt service does not breach the threshold.
(Figure 1b).
12.
However, a shock to remittances is
found not to be the most extreme one to the
external debt position (Table 1b, Bound
Test B4). Remittance inflows have been relatively
stable; therefore, a shock of the size of one
standard deviation is not severe enough to cause
a large deterioration in the debt position,
compared to the baseline scenario.
13.
An alternative scenario based on
historical averages provides a more sanguine
picture than the baseline.5 It is mainly because
the recent China EXIM Bank loans and donor
financed construction projects have caused a
larger current account deficit than in the past. If
the current account deficit were at historical
levels, debt could be reduced faster.

PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
Baseline
14.
The public sector DSA reinforces the
conclusions of the external DSA.6 The high level
of public sector borrowing for road building and
reconstruction of the capital city over the past few
years makes the PV of debt rise to about
37 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year before
starting to decline under the baseline assumption
of fiscal consolidation (Figure 2a).
Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
15.
Stress tests indicate that vulnerabilities
remain throughout the projection period,
especially to a slowdown in real GDP
growth (Figure 2a). The PV of public debt would

virtually remain unchanged over most of the
medium term and would be around 29 percent of
GDP in 2032. Considering remittances yields a
similar conclusion (Figure 2b).
16.
Two alternative scenarios suggest a
very different picture of the debt dynamics
over the longer term relative to the baseline.
On the one hand, maintaining the primary
balance at its 2011 level worsens the debt
situation given higher deficit in 2011 related to
the utilization of the China EXIM Bank loans. On
the other hand, in a historical scenario where the
long-term real GDP growth and primary balance
are fixed at the average of the past decade (both
of which are worse than in the baseline), the debt

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

5

The public sector DSA covers all Government and
Government-guaranteed debt. Public enterprises are
not included but all external borrowing by them is
accounted for as public enterprises do not have access
to international capital markets.

In this alternative scenario, the following four
variables are set at their historical levels; (i) real GDP
growth; (ii) growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar
terms); (iii) non-interest account in percent of GDP; and
(iv) non-debt creating flows.

17.
A no-reform scenario also highlights
the importance of implementing the
ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy
articulated by the Government. In a scenario of
no tax reforms coupled with the status quo in
current government expenditure, the authorities
will have to borrow domestically to bridge the
financing gap. In such a scenario, additional
external funding may not be forthcoming due to
lack of commitment to reforms. This will cause
further stress on the already high public debt
level, and will keep the NPV of the debt-to-GDP
ratio close to the current level for more than a

decade due to the greater debt accumulation as
well as lower growth related to a crowding-out of
private investment. Debt dynamics would
deteriorate in a no-tax-reform scenario even if the
authorities attempt to cut capital spending and
avoid excessive domestic borrowing, due to the
multiplier effects of the lower public investment
on economic growth (see figure).

position would deteriorate over the medium to

over the medium term. The results of these
alternative scenarios highlight the importance of
achieving primary surpluses of around 1 percent
of GDP in the medium to long term, and raising
the potential rate of growth in order to ensure a
more manageable debt dynamics.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
18.
Tonga remains at a high risk of
external debt distress. While Tonga benefits
from high remittance inflows, which clearly
reduces its liquidity risks, remittances are
insufficient to limit risks from projected debt
service payments. Fiscal authorities need to
build enough cash balances to ensure
servicing of the increased external debt
obligations from FY2013/14 without sacrificing
essential public services. In the absence of
further fiscal consolidation through an
increased tax-to-GDP ratio and expenditure
prioritization, Tonga risks repayment
difficulties. Additionally, the authorities have
exposed themselves to a currency mismatch
on the government’s balance sheet (about
61 percent of the external debt are

denominated in Chinese renminbi) which, if
left unhedged, could pose an additional risk to
Tonga’s debt dynamics.
19.
Despite being at high risk, Tonga’s
debt dynamics are manageable. Tonga is
able to service its current obligations, and the
overall public sector debt situation, while
elevated over the short term, shows a
downward trend over the longer run assuming
that the authorities avoid taking on significant

20.
Key medium-term vulnerabilities
include lower GDP growth, major external
shocks, currency mismatches and credit risks
on government’s balance sheet, and new
borrowings on less concessional terms. These
vulnerabilities underscore the importance of
sound macroeconomic policies to improve
Tonga’s growth potential on a sustained basis,
export diversification, and continued efforts in
fiscal consolidation. Moreover, utilization of donor
grants and avoidance of new borrowing in the
next two–three years is necessary to reduce the
risk of external debt distress. Sound public debt
management, anchored in a medium-term debt
management strategy and in line with the
medium-term fiscal framework, is also essential to
guide future development financing in Tonga.
Priority should be given to projects which would
help generate higher growth and employment,
especially in the context of the Tonga Strategic
Development Framework (TSDF), to help build

debt service capacity in the future. Consideration
should also be given to hedging exchange risks
on its foreign liabilities using financial instruments
and developing a comprehensive debt
management strategy with technical assistance.
Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities recognize the risks
posed by the high debt burden and wanted to
bring down the public debt below 40 percent
of GDP. The authorities agreed that further fiscal
consolidation and no new borrowing will be
crucial in reducing the debt burden and creating
fiscal space for priority spending. In discussions
with staff, the authorities noted that they might
seek to reschedule some of its debt obligations to
China EXIM bank, and were also concerned about
the currency risk posed by the current external
debt structure and wanted to learn about possible
ways to mitigate it.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Data refer to last date in fiscal year (e.g., 2012 refers to FY ending June 30, 2012).
2/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
3/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
4/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in
import levels).
5/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
6/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
7/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 3.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Tonga
On May 16, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga.1
Background
Tonga’s economy is recovering gradually from the effects of the global slowdown and
the domestic credit crunch, thanks to the pickup in construction activity and rebound in
tourism. However, private consumption has been anemic due to the decline in
remittance inflows. In addition, banks’ lending standards have remained tight,
constraining private consumption and investment. Real GDP growth is forecast to be
around 1½ percent in FY2011/12, led by stronger tourism activity and a continued fiscal
stimulus funded by donor aid and previously contracted concessional loans.
CPI inflation declined to 2½ percent y/y in February 2012, reflecting mainly stabilization
in fuel and food prices as well as exchange rate appreciation. Inflation is likely to
average around 4½ percent in FY2011/12.
The fiscal position has strengthened but vulnerabilities remain. Generous grant inflows
from donors contributed to narrowing the fiscal deficit to an estimated 2¾ percent of
GDP in 2011/12 (from about 6 percent of GDP in FY2010/11). Capital expenditure is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

expected to be lower by 2 percentage points of GDP due to the completion of the
reconstruction of the central business district and near completion of the road projects
using the China EXIM Bank loans. Nevertheless, Tonga remains at a “high risk of
external debt distress” according to this year’s World Bank-IMF debt sustainability
analysis.
Buoyant official development assistance helped improve the balance of payment
position, which allowed the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) to let the currency
appreciate by 6 percent against the US$ and real effective terms in 2011 to help curb
inflation pressures stemming from rising fuel and food import prices. The level of
reserves increased to around $130 million as of end-2011, covering more than 6 months
of imports of goods and services.
Monetary conditions have remained accommodative over the past two years, but with
no signs of a pickup in private credit. Monetary policy has been appropriately geared
toward encouraging bank lending. The banking system is adequately capitalized and
profitable but credit costs related to the rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) following
the 2004-08 credit bubble remain high; and banks have continued to restrain credit
amidst an uncertain outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Tonga’s recovery from the global crisis but noted remaining
vulnerabilities and a high debt burden. With downside risks clouding the outlook,
Directors emphasized the importance of strengthening policy buffers and the foundation
for faster and more inclusive growth.
Directors concurred that fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild the government’s cash
balances and safeguard debt sustainability. Accordingly, containing the public sector’s
wage bill, prioritizing expenditures, and broadening the tax base remain top policy
priorities for the period ahead. More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to
implement their fiscal plans within a medium-term framework and further improve the
quality of public spending to meet Tonga’s development objectives.
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy stance appropriate in
light of the banks’ cautious approach to lending. Taking note of the staff’s assessment
that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, Directors agreed that, going
forward, the exchange rate could absorb the bulk of external shocks with official
intervention limited to smoothing operations.
Directors supported steps underway to reduce credit risk and strengthen financial
intermediation. They welcomed recent legislation to improve the registration of collateral
and recommended further financial sector reforms such as establishing a centralized
credit bureau, facilitating land leases, and enacting a bankruptcy law. Directors also
urged the authorities to continue to resist pressure to administer bank lending rates.

3

Directors underscored the importance of removing structural hurdles to private
investment and reducing the cost of doing business, including through public enterprise
reforms. Steps in this direction would lay the groundwork for broadening the production
base and reducing poverty.

Statement by Aida S. Budiman, Alternate Executive Director
and Shasha Ridzam, Advisor
May 16, 2012
1.
On behalf of the Tongan authorities, we would like to thank the IMF team for the
focused and constructive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues
in Tonga. The useful advice rendered during the Article IV consultation will be reflected
upon and considered within the authorities’ short- and medium-term plans. For the most
part, there is broad agreement on almost all of the major policy thrusts.
Economic outlook for FY 2012/13
2.
The Tongan economy continues to show encouraging signs of recovery from the
prolonged impact of the global financial crisis. The economy experienced a slowdown in
growth, a sharp fall in remittances and a decline in revenues. The financial sector also
came under pressure as a result of high levels of nonperforming loans in the banking
sector. In addition to these factors, high oil prices and the uncertainties in the global
economy further complicated macroeconomic and financial conditions. However, in the
recent period, domestic economic activity has rebounded with the support of donorfunded construction and infrastructure projects as well as tourism activity.
3.
Going forward, growth is projected at 1.2 percent in FY 2012/2013, slightly lower
than the 1.6 percent estimated in the previous fiscal year. This is on account of the
withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus provided by the China EXIM Bank loans. The
authorities assessed that there has been limited immediate positive spillover to the
indigenous economy, as these projects utilised imported materials and foreign labour.
Nonetheless, the resultant increase in capital stock – in terms of a reconstructed central
business district and improved roads – is expected to facilitate business activity over the
longer term. In the medium-term horizon, growth is estimated to be in line with historical
average. Domestic demand is expected to anchor growth supported by improving private
consumption and investment conditions.
4.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the external balance of the country continued
to improve and confidence in the financial sector was maintained. The level of foreign
reserves continued to increase and remains at comfortable levels. After peaking in mid2011, inflationary pressures have eased and inflation is projected to remain relatively low
in the coming months.
5.
Tonga remains vulnerable to external shocks and natural calamities due to its
geographic isolation, small-sized economy and narrow resource base. The authorities
note that the still-fragile and uncertain global outlook coupled with high commodity
prices present downside risks to the economy via the potential spillover channels as
highlighted by staff. The authorities appreciate work that has been done by the Fund on

2
Pacific Island countries. This is particularly pertinent considering the increased
opportunities and challenges presented by the region’s enhanced economic integration
with neighbouring countries and emerging Asia.
Navigating a Challenging Global Environment: Policy Challenges and Responses in
2012 – 2013
Fiscal Policy
6.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment on fiscal policy.
Notwithstanding capacity constraints, reforms are being pursued to consolidate the
medium-term fiscal position to ensure fiscal sustainability and promote macroeconomic
stability. Fiscal policy is geared to creating more fiscal room to enable the economy to
deal with potential shocks and to place the economy on a sustainable debt trajectory.
Work in this area is guided by the Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF), whereas
careful prioritization of strategic development projects are laid out in the Tonga Strategic
Development Framework (TSDF), the medium-term national development strategy.
7.
Thus far, the overall performance of the 2011/12 budget estimate remains
satisfactory. The authorities continue to carefully and prudently manage the execution of
the budget with significant consideration to not jeopardise the 2011/12 budget that was
based on the principle to “Maintain Macroeconomic Stability without Compromising
Service Delivery”. Measures that were pursued included containing the wage bill,
maintaining current spending by way of careful expenditure rationalisation and
prioritisation, improving transparency through regular reporting budget performance, and
more importantly, pursuing non-distortionary revenue enhancement by improving tax
administration and considering presumptive tax for small businesses.
8.
The budget for 2012/13 will be built on the theme “Creating Opportunity in
Extraordinary Times, in recognition that the fiscal situation will still remain under
pressure. Concurrent efforts will be aimed at restoring fiscal space which will allow the
authorities to better address the known events, such as the increase in debt repayment
from 2013/14, as well as the unforeseen events, including the frequent natural disasters.
9.
In anticipation of the lower budgetary support from donors, the authorities are
developing non-discriminatory tax measures to enhance revenue. Coordination among
related ministries will be enhanced to improve corporate planning and to be in line with
the Medium Term Budget Framework. This will improve value for money in public
expenditure by appropriately allocating resources to ministries and sectors that have the
greatest role to play in achieving the development priorities. This maximises the
opportunities to improve both the credibility of the budgetary process and result in more
effective and sustainable resource allocation decisions.

3
Monetary Policy & Exchange Rate
10.
The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) will remain vigilant to price
developments and stands ready to respond to contain inflation risks and maintain
comfortable level of foreign reserves. At present, the NRBT continues to pay 1%
remuneration on banks’ Exchange Settlement Account balances that are above 1 million
pa’anga. This endeavour has had some success as bank interest rates continued to
decline, by up to 2.65% since the policy took effect in January 2010. However, private
sector credit growth (excluding loans from the China EXIM Bank) remains subdued,
declining by 11.5 percent over the year ending March 2012, compared to -7.1 percent in
the preceding year. The envisaged stimulus to economic activity, therefore, has yet to
materialize. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank will continue to enhance transparency and
disclosure processes and to strengthen the transmission mechanism for monetary policy
framework.
11.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment of the exchange rates and will
continue to use the exchange rate flexibility if required.
Financial Sector
12.
The authorities note staff’s view that it is more effective to incentivise credit flow
via measures that directly tackle the impediments to bank lending, as opposed to
administering interest rates. The latter could entail distortionary effects such as
hampering banks’ ability to price risks and cause a further rationing of credit to the most
creditworthy borrowers. Since the last Board meeting, the new electronic registry under
the Personal Property Securities Act which ensures timely registration of collateral, went
live in April 2011. Further measures to strengthen the credit environment such as the
establishment of the credit bureau and reforms to land administration under the Land Act
are work in progress. The bankruptcy protection law is to be resubmitted for
reconsideration in the 2012 parliamentary session. In addition, effective supervision of
banks to ensure financial stability and transparency (especially, in interest rate and fee
structure), could potentially reduce borrowing costs and improve access to finance. Given
the dominant role of credit risks in explaining interest rate spreads in Tonga, mechanisms
to encourage greater risk sharing such as partial guarantee fund (capitalised by donors or
Government through a budgetary allocation) channeled through the banking sector to
priority economic sectors with clear eligibility criteria is under consideration.
Furthermore, there is a need to build financial competence and inclusion through the
formal education curricula.
13.
On the supervisory front, the NRBT’s oversight continues to focus on banks’
credit risk management owing to the heightened level of NPLs. The spate of loose
lending prior to the global financial crisis, economic malaise and the decline in
remittances have contributed to the rise in NPLs over the past three years. Tonga has
received technical assistance from the IMF and PFTAC to fortify its supervisory

4
framework, such as in designing new prudential returns, onsite examinations, enhancing
offsite monitoring tools and staff training.
Structural Reforms
14.
The authorities recognize that Tonga’s medium-term prospects depend on the
continued implementation of its structural reforms. To promote and remove impediments
to private sector development, broaden the sources of growth, reduce reliance on
remittances and build policy space to respond to future shocks, various measures have
been implemented while others are in the pipeline. The TSDF which encompasses nine
priority areas will continue to guide macroeconomic policy for 2011–2014.
15.
In the latest Doing Business Report by the World Bank, Tonga was ranked as the
top performer in the Pacific for ease of doing business. However, the authorities realise
that more needs to be done in order to dismantle barriers to private sector-led growth. In
recognition of these substantial challenges faced by Tonga, an Economic Dialogue that
gathered stakeholders from various facets of the economy was organized by NRBT in
March 2012. The authorities have agreed to prioritise raising inclusive economic growth
by focusing on the tourism, agriculture and fisheries sectors. This would be through
improving access to finance, improving market access and enhance trade capacity,
improving infrastructure, and enhancing training and capacity building. The proposed
strategies and specific actions have been presented to the first meeting of the
Government’s National Growth Committee in April 2012. This Committee will analyse
and consider the tradeoffs from these strategies, identify priorities given available
resources and capacity and will facilitate implementation under an agreed timeline.
Final Remarks
16.
Tonga has embarked on a far-reaching structural reform agenda that would
elevate it to the next stage of growth and development. The authorities are cognizant of
the considerable challenges that lie ahead and realise that results would take time to
materialise. Given Tonga’s capacity constraints, domestic efforts would need to be
supplemented by support from multilateral institutions and other countries. In this light,
our Tongan authorities would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Fund, the
World Bank, PFTAC and donors for their invaluable technical guidance and support over
the years.
17.
In the immediate term, the authorities are mindful of the significant downside
risks posed by the current challenging global environment. The authorities will closely
monitor developments in the external environment and will respond as appropriate.
