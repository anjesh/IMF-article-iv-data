I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Negotiations with the Romanian authorities on a program that could be supported by
a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) were held in Bucharest July 21–31, 2003, November 11–25,
and February 26–March 5, 2004 and were completed in Washington April 21–26, following
the Board’s discussion of Romania’s Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program
Engagement (EPA) on April 12. The Article IV discussions were held during the February
mission and the Spring Meetings in Washington.1
2.
In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation on January 8, 2003, Executive
Directors noted that steadfast commitment to macroeconomic stabilization and
accelerated structural reforms was required to sustain strong growth. They
recommended perseverance with the essentially exchange-rate-based monetary policy, but
noted that inflation targeting could be a sustainable medium-term framework once inflation
had stabilized in single digits and wage discipline in the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) had
improved. Directors emphasized that vigorously addressing the problem of SOEs’ losses and
quasi-fiscal activities would be crucial for completing the transition to a fully operational
market economy, and for paving the way for EU accession.
3.
Romania made progress in addressing the issues raised by Directors in the
context of the last SBA. In 2001–03, fiscal and monetary polices succeeded in attaining the
disinflation target. Privatization accelerated, employment in SOEs was reduced substantially,
and utilities’ collection rates improved. However, rapid credit growth and an excessive
minimum wage increase in 2003 led to a widening of the external current account deficit and
prevented faster disinflation. The business climate improved owing to greater
macroeconomic stability, strengthened transparency of the tax system, and progress toward
EU accession, but remained adversely affected by governance issues.
4.
The Executive Board discussed Romania’s Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term
Program Engagement on April 12, 2004. Executive Directors concluded that a strong
precautionary SBA with low access would help to strengthen the momentum for structural
reforms, and support the authorities’ efforts toward EU accession. They stressed the
importance of strong ownership and front-loaded conditionality, supported by prior actions in
critical reform areas. Moreover, Directors emphasized that macroeconomic stabilization

The missions, led by Mr. Mates, included Messrs. Westphal, Gueorguiev, and Tieman (all EUR),
Lall (PDR), and the resident representative, Mr. Justice. Ms. Schadler, EUR Deputy Director,
participated in the Article IV discussions. The mission met with Prime Minister Năstase, Governor of
the National Bank of Romania (NBR) Isarescu, Minister of Public Finance Tanasescu, Minister of
Economy Popescu, President of the Privatization Agency Musetescu, Minister for European
Integration Puskas, the President of the Pension House Giurescu, the President of the Forecasting
Commission Panaite, commercial bankers, the Council of Foreign Investors, and the Romanian
Businessmen’s Association. Mr. Croitoru, Advisor to the Executive Director for Romania,
participated in many of the meetings.

-5-

hinged critically on completing structural reforms, including in the areas of privatization and
governance.
5.
The authorities have requested a new precautionary 24-month SBA, to secure
macroeconomic stabilization and keep EU accession on track. They are aware that
macroeconomic stability could be at risk if policies yield to populist pressures in the run-up
to parliamentary and presidential elections in November 2004. Moreover, EU accession in
2007 requires persistent pursuit of structural reforms. In the authorities’ view, both
challenges can be best addressed in the context of a Fund arrangement, which would also
facilitate coordination with other international financial institutions. Political support for EU
accession remains strong across the political spectrum, reducing the risk of program
slippages. The Romanian government has so far concluded 24 chapters of the acquis, and
expects to conclude two more chapters by end-June.
6.
The World Bank expects to disburse the second tranche of the PSAL II by mid2004, and has started negotiations on a three-year Programmatic Adjustment Loan
(PAL). The PAL focuses on civil service and judicial reform, public services, and the
business environment. Reflecting discussions with Fund staff, the Bank has strengthened
privatization and energy sector conditionality (Appendix II). The Fund and Bank are
cooperating closely on the issues of arrears, energy sector reforms, railway and mining sector
restructuring, governance, and the business environment.
7.
Romania accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement in March 1998. The exchange system is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Owing to financial constraints
during the ongoing transition, Romania has not indicated its willingness to participate in the
HIPC Initiative. The statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring (Appendix III).
II. BACKGROUND
8.
After uneven performance in the 1990s, macroeconomic policies improved in
2001–03. The legacy of Ceausescu and stop-and-go policies during the early transition left
Romania behind other transition economies (Figure 1). However, under the most recent SBA,
macroeconomic imbalances were reduced through tight fiscal policy, strong measures to
improve the financial performance of SOEs, and accelerated privatization. The NBR slowed
depreciation and achieved substantial disinflation, lowering the annual inflation rate from
40 percent in early 2001 to 12½ percent in April 2004 (Figure 2). Macroeconomic
stabilization, which preserved the competitiveness achieved with the 1999 depreciation, and
improved prospects for EU accession created a positive supply response, strengthening
industrial production and exports (Text Table 1, Figure 3). Despite these successes, Romania
still lags recent accession countries with respect to price stabilization, the private sector share
in the economy, the quality of governance, and FDI. Even though the Agency for
Privatization has recently accelerated the sale of its portfolio, privatization projects in the

-6-

energy sector—key to ensuring new investment and efficiency in the sector—have been
delayed.

In 2003, domestic demand picked up and the current account deficit widened,
notwithstanding continued strong competitiveness and export growth:
•

Reflecting confidence of banks and households, a sharp increase in credit to the
private sector contributed 2½ percentage points to the growth of domestic demand,
which grew by 7¼ percent, compared to 3½ percent in 2002; a large minimum wage
increase and the ensuing strong economy-wide wage growth contributed another
0.6 percentage point to higher domestic demand growth. Delays in adjusting energy
prices to higher import costs in early 2003, which increased the losses in the sector by
0.4 percent of GDP, also adversely affected the current account deficit. As a result,
final domestic demand grew much faster than output and the current account deficit
widened to almost 6 percent of GDP,

and profit tax laws, which broadened the tax base and eliminated distortionary
preferences, increased tax collections (excluding social security contributions) by an
impressive 17 percent in real terms in 2003.2 Following a 3 percentage point cut in
2002, the authorities further cut the social security tax rates by 5 percentage points in
2003, and another 3 percentage points in 2004, while collections recently improved.
On the expenditure side, the social safety net was strengthened to alleviate the impact
of energy sector reforms.
•

Fiscal developments outside of the general government were on balance also helpful.
After a delayed policy response to import prices in early 2003, gas prices were
increased substantially in the second half of 2003 and early 2004 (Text Table 3).
Electricity prices were brought to the cost recovery in September 2003, but further
increases will be needed to provide an appropriate return on equity. Consumer
heating prices were also raised toward cost recovery levels. Collections in the gas and
electricity sectors are now high, but district heating collections remain weak, although
they improved in Q1 2004.

Scope for further improvement remains: according to the MoF’s database, the net increase
in tax arrears (excluding interest and penalties) of the largest 549 debtors was equivalent to
0.6 percent of GDP in 2003, with two private oil refineries responsible for a large share of
the increase.

reversed the trend in response to some weakening in the balance of payments, rapid

High wage growth particularly hurt railways, where the minimum wage adjustment pushed
the entire wage scale up almost proportionally, and the mining sector, substantially
increasing the losses and arrears in these two sectors.

•

The improved confidence of banks and households and lower perception of country
risk led to very rapid credit growth of about 55 percent in real terms in 2003.
Consumer and mortgage credit tripled in real terms, albeit from a low base, while
corporate credit also remained strong.

•

According to the 2003 FSAP assessment, systemic risks for the financial system,
while growing, are still low. Banks are well capitalized and liquid, and financial
soundness indicators and stress tests suggest that banks can withstand various shocks.
Loans classified as “doubtful” and “loss” have stabilized at about 4 percent of total
loans. Banks have insured about half of their household loans with domestic
insurance companies, which in turn have reinsured some of this exposure abroad.
However, owing to strong credit growth, banks are rapidly increasing exposure to
credit and market risks.

12.

Progress in structural reforms was mixed, and governance remains a problem:

•

Years of slow privatization still hold back the economy. However, progress is now
evident. As indicated by the most recent data, the private sector accounted for only
65 percent of GDP in 2002, the smallest share among new member states of the EU
and accession candidates. Recently, the authorities stepped up their efforts and
implemented a large-scale employment reduction program to facilitate privatization.
Overall, 35 large companies with over 112,000 employees were privatized in
2001–03, of which half in the last year. Although energy sector privatization has been
slow, a number of projects are now in the pipeline, the most important of which is the
privatization of the largest company in the country, the oil and gas producer Petrom.
However, short deadlines for some privatization projects, including those in which
minority private shareholders benefited from the write-off of tax arrears, have raised
transparency concerns.

•

In addressing governance and corruption problems, Romania stills lags other
countries in the region. Based on the World Bank governance database (Figures 10
and 11), Romania lags particularly with respect to government effectiveness and the
control of corruption. And while the indicator on effectiveness improved between
1996 and 2002, the indicator on corruption worsened.

III. ARTICLE IV POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The Article IV discussions focused on external current account risks, rapid credit
growth, and the medium-term fiscal stance; on the structural side, governance issues and the
need to accelerate privatization played a prominent role. Growth in the past few years
benefited from progress with stabilization and a favorable competitive position. However, to
sustain this performance, further efforts are needed to reduce inflation to low single digits
and to keep the current account deficit within a safe range. The main risks for these

- 14 -

objectives are large wage increases, rapid credit growth and fiscal pressures, which could
lead to overheating and an unsustainable real effective appreciation of the leu. Moreover,
maintaining strong growth performance requires an improvement in the business climate and
a decisive break with the past in terms of governance.

A. Macroeconomic Framework
14.
Staff viewed continuing macroeconomic stabilization and tight fiscal policy as
crucial for sustaining strong growth. Staff pointed out that the exchange rate-based
stabilization, even in Romania’s soft variant, had inherent risks and could be sustained only if
competitiveness were preserved and the current account deficit kept well within safe
margins, with fiscal policy playing a central role in this process. In particular, as neither low
inflation nor monetary policy credibility had yet been established, while wage policies had
often slipped, fiscal policy needed to be more supportive. Moreover, the experience of other
transition economies demonstrated the importance of reducing the budget deficits during
periods of high growth to prevent a deterioration to unsustainable levels during recessions.
Staff therefore argued for a general government deficit target of less than 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term, supported by measures to contain credit growth, to facilitate a current
account deficit of about 5¼ percent of GDP (Box 1). Regarding potential GDP growth rate,
staff saw 5 percent as achievable, provided the reform effort was strong, although downside
risks dominated (Box 2). The target to reduce inflation gradually to 4 percent by 2008 was
seen as appropriate, given the need for further relative price adjustments.
15.
The authorities were more sanguine than staff about medium-term risks.
Pointing to trends in other transition economies, they saw the sustainable level of the current
account deficit in a range of 5½–5¾ percent of GDP, which would be consistent with a
general government deficit of 2½–3 percent of

Box 1. Medium-Term Current Account Developments
Romania’s sustainable current account deficit is now estimated somewhat higher
than at the previous Article IV consultation. Non-debt-creating inflows are
projected at 3½ percent of GDP on average over the next five years (2004–08),
reflecting the large-scale privatization projects in the pipeline (BCR, Petrom, the
two gas distribution companies, estimated conservatively at US$1.1 billion), rising
greenfield FDI as EU accession approaches, and the utilization of pre-accession
funds. A current account deficit of 5¼ percent of GDP, in line with the recent
trends and projections for the region (Figure 12), would cut the gross external
debt-to-GDP ratio by 1 percentage point (Appendix IV). Under this scenario,

the adjustment would be

sustainable current account deficit would be 4¾ percent of GDP, or ½ percentage
point less than in the baseline projection.
6

The analysis is less sensitive to exchange rate developments. Even a large real
effective depreciation of 15 percent (such as triggered by the 1999 balance of
payments crisis, about a half of which was reversed in 2000) would increase the
external debt to GDP ratio to 45 percent, which, based on available evidence,
would not put external sustainability at risk.

- 17 -

Box 2. Romania’s Medium-Term Growth Potential
The targeted GDP growth rate appears feasible, assuming that macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms continue. After mediocre performance over the
1990s, Romania’s GDP growth averaged about 4½ percent in 2000–03. The
gradually accelerating privatization and restructuring process increased total factor
productivity (TFP) by shedding surplus labor, importing FDI-related know-how, and
improving managerial practices. Macroeconomic stabilization and the improved
prospects for EU accession attracted strong investment in a number of industries and
services. Employment, which fell throughout the 1990s, continued to drop, but more
slowly.
Looking ahead, an increase in fixed capital formation relative to GDP by
2¾ percentage points over the next five years, consistent with a somewhat higher
current account deficit,

and the appeal of EU

such prospects. Privatization and SOE restructuring could sustain annual
productivity gains above 2 percent. Employment is expected to stabilize just below
its present level, with job creation in the private sector broadly matching the layoffs
from further restructuring.

B. Fiscal Policy Over the Medium Term
16.
The government’s medium-term budget plans are driven by the intention to cut
taxes and increase investment (Text Table 5). The authorities envisage a revenue loss
relative to GDP of about 1.3 percentage points by 2007 as a result of cuts
in social security contributions, a planned VAT rate differentiation and lower dividends as
privatization progresses. The loss would be partly offset by higher excises and improved
collections. Investment would increase relative to GDP by about 1 percentage point, while
spending on maintenance and operating expenditure would decline substantially.

17.
Staff advised against tax cuts, except for social security taxes, and supported
improvements in revenue administration. In light of the need to maintain a tight budget
balance and increase expenditure on EU accession-related items, staff felt that plans for
broadening the scope of goods subject to the reduced VAT rate were unwarranted. Moreover,
the proposed tax relief for reinvested profits would be unnecessary and costly alongside the
already well-functioning scheme for accelerated depreciation. Staff supported the reduction
in the number of income tax brackets from five to three, but advised that the reform be
revenue neutral. Further cuts in the still high social security taxes were appropriate, but they
needed to be compensated by broadening the tax base. Staff welcomed progress in
implementing the FAD TA recommendations in tax administration.
18.
The authorities’ medium-term expenditure plans included reducing subsidies
and increasing sharply spending on motorway construction. They acknowledged that
spending on various forms of subsidies needed to be cut in line with their commitment to
reduce state aid in the run-up to EU accession and improve the financial performance of
SOEs. In response to staff’s concerns about fiscal commitments created by the recent
decisions to start numerous motorway projects, the authorities agreed to seek World Bank
advice on prioritizing the program. Moreover, to address concerns about awarding a large
motorway project without a competitive bidding procedure, the authorities hired a consultant,
financed by the World Bank, to assess the fairness of the unit prices in the contract.
19.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need for further reform of the pension
system. The current pay-as-you-go system could be improved by broadening the tax base,
accelerating the schedule for increasing the statutory retirement age, and equalizing the
retirement age for men and women, as recommended by the World Bank (Box 3). Staff also
advised against a new scheme for compensating specific categories of pensioners for lowerthan-average adjustments during 1990–98 (so-called recorrelation), as most of their pensions
had been granted on a more generous accrual formula than under the current, reformed
system. The mission discussed the authorities’ plans for introducing a second, fully-funded
pillar in January 2006, which was subsequently postponed to 2008. In staff’s view, the stable
projected old-age dependency ratio over the next 10–15 years provided a window of
opportunity for such a reform, before the aging of the population made the reform more
difficult.

- 19 -

Box 3. Romania’s Pension System
The pension system has recently incurred only small deficits, but further reform is
important for keeping the deficits under control. Stable spending of about
7 percent of GDP and a deficit below 1 percent of GDP over the last few years
reflected a low and declining replacement rate, which compensated for a high and
rising dependency ratio. Staff project that the deficit could increase relative to
GDP by almost 1 percentage point by 2008, reflecting: (i) the authorities’ intention
to further reduce the social security tax rate by 5 percentage points; (ii) limited
scope for further decline in the replacement ratio; and (iii) an increase in the
dependency ratio as employment remains flat while the number of retirees
continues to increase (Text Table 6). In the long run, the Pension Fund balance
will be affected by

adjustments. On
the other hand, the fact that the pension system’s dependency ratio is five times
higher than the old-age dependency ratio suggests that the current pension fund
balance reflects a transition-induced early retirement surge.

C. Wage Policy
20.
Staff and the authorities agreed that prudent wage policies are critical for
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Staff emphasized that wage policy was one of the
pillars of the disinflation strategy, and that wage and employment controls in SOEs would
need to remain in place until hard budget constraints were firmly established. The framework
of multi-layered collective contracts, while helpful in preserving social peace, needed to be
modified to ensure that labor contracts reflect specific conditions in each enterprise.
Moreover, further real increases in the minimum wage, which is now high compared to the
economy-wide average wage, would be detrimental to competitiveness. The authorities saw
the minimum wage tool as an instrument to ensure a fairer distribution between labor and
capital, but also acknowledged the importance of wage policy for macroeconomic
management.

- 20 -

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
The authorities believed strongly that the gradual disinflation strategy had been
and remained appropriate. With the strong persistence of inflation (Selected Issues,
Chapter II) and the need for further adjustment in relative prices, the risks of rapid
disinflation would exceed its benefits. The strategy of anchoring monetary policy on the
exchange rate (see ¶ 11 above), restricting short-term capital inflows, and keeping interest
rates high had proved effective in reducing inflation over the past three years. Staff agreed
with the authorities that such a framework could deliver further disinflation until the
introduction of inflation targeting planned for 2005. Recent favorable developments in
respect to inflation and the excess supply in the foreign exchange market suggested that the
next step of the NBR might be to cut the policy interest rate, which at 23½ percent was high
relative to the inflation rate of 12½ percent. While such a cut was unlikely to affect domestic
demand owing to low interest rate sensitivity of demand for credit, it would reduce
appreciation pressures on the leu. No change in the targeted depreciation rate seemed
necessary, as competitiveness has remained appropriate (see ¶ 9 above, and Figures 4–6), but
developments in competitiveness and export performance would need to be carefully
monitored.
22.
The NBR has long considered inflation targeting (IT) as the appropriate
medium-term monetary policy framework for Romania and intended to adopt it in
2005. The Bank wanted to be able to credibly commit to focusing on inflation, shifting the
responsibility for the external current account to fiscal and income policies. Moreover, IT
was seen as conducive to further strengthening NBR independence, which the Bank
occasionally felt was under pressure. The NBR also considered that the various forms of
explicit fixed exchange rate regimes would be overly risky and would expose Romania, in
the absence of strong fiscal and wage policies, to volatile short-term capital flows. This left
IT as the preferred framework.
23.
Staff pointed out that a move to IT would require strong efforts to complete
technical preparations and clarify the policy framework. Staff welcomed the authorities’
decision to approve amendments to the NBR law to facilitate its independence in line with
the relevant EU acquis. However, an MFD TA mission on IT indicated that substantial
technical work was still needed in the areas of information gathering, analysis and policy
decision-making procedures. Staff also noted that the challenge of implementing IT reflected
difficulties in estimating the transmission of interest rates to activity and inflation.
Consequently, the NBR would need to continue to rely on exchange rate interventions to
control inflation. In contrast to the use of the exchange rate as an intermediate policy
objective, the exchange rate path would need to be regularly adjusted in line with the
evolving inflation outlook.

- 21 -

E. Financial Sector Policies
24.
While the authorities believed that the financial system was strong, they remain
vigilant. In line with the FSAP recommendations, staff advised the authorities to stress-test
banks' portfolios periodically for credit, foreign exchange, interest rate, and interbank risks,
by simulating a broad range of shocks, which the authorities accepted. Other
recommendations included measures for ensuring a safe introduction of the RTGS payment
system, and improving the oversight of the nascent capital market. The authorities are also
drafting, with assistance from the World Bank, a new capital market law.
25.
The FSAP also noted the risks created by rapid credit growth, an issue that staff
and the authorities had discussed since late 2002. The authorities considered that banks’
capital adequacy ratios, exceeding BIS standards by large margins, provided comfort, as did
the fact that about half of the banking sector was owned by reputable foreign banks. The
stock of bank credit to the nongovernment sector was also low (16 percent of GDP at end2003), and growth in credit reflected the improved confidence in macroeconomic
stabilization. Staff, however, expressed concerns about the massive flows of consumer and
mortgage credit, which were raising domestic demand, slowing disinflation, and pushing the
current account deficit beyond prudent limits. Furthermore, credit screening could deteriorate
with such a rapid expansion, a problem aggravated by the lack of a credit bureau.
26.
The authorities agreed that the macroeconomic and prudential risks required a
policy response. They noted that the NBR had tightened eligibility criteria for consumer and
mortgage loans in January 2003. The Insurance Supervision Commission had imposed limits
on insurers’ retained exposure on consumer and mortgage loans.4 The NBR also prompted
commercial banks to organize a credit bureau, now under way. The measures had had a
noticeable effect in slowing consumer credit growth in February and March. Recently, the
authorities have also extended the eligibility-tightening measures to non-bank financial and
retail sectors and drafted a truth-in-lending act to improve consumer awareness of credit
terms. Nevertheless, they indicated willingness to implement additional measures if
necessary, including imposing mandatory reporting by all creditors to the credit bureau.
Together with MFD staff, they are preparing a study on the macroeconomic and prudential
risks of rapid credit growth, following up on the 2003 FSAP recommendations.
F. Structural Policies and the Trade Regime
27.
The authorities saw structural reforms as crucial for continuing rapid GDP
growth but expressed concerns about possible adverse social effects. The Ministry of
Economy and Commerce, which attributed delays in the energy sector privatization to weak
market conditions, intended now to accelerate this process. The authorities also
acknowledged the need for continuing gas price adjustments, reversing their previous
4

See ¶ 6 of the MEFP.

- 22 -

reluctance motivated by social concerns. On the privatization of Romgaz, the country’s main
natural gas extraction company, they expressed concerns given its large market share, and
indicated preference for joint ventures with foreign investors. Following discussion with
staff, the authorities agreed to consider the privatization option after the successful
privatization of Petrom. They also agreed to restructure the mining, railways, and district
heating sectors, but pointed to the need for retraining and relocation support for the
redundant employees. Staff urged the authorities to come up with realistic budgets for the
mining and railway companies, to prevent further accumulation of arrears in these sectors. In
the banking sector, the authorities accepted staff’s suggestions to accelerate the privatization
of the Savings Bank, which will be completed in 2005.
28.
Labor markets need to be made more flexible. The new labor code, approved in
March 2003, is seen by the business community as overly restrictive in many areas.
Particularly at issue are provisions on hiring and firing, the collective contracts, and a new
wage-guarantee fund for bankrupt companies. The authorities pointed out that the Labor
Code was an attempt to modernize Romania’s labor legislation in accordance with ILO
principles, while seeking a compromise between the interests of employers and employees.
They agreed, however, to address the issues that have raised concerns by amending the law
in early 2005, in line with the recommendations of the World Bank (MEFP ¶ 44).
29.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to liberalize the trade regime. The average
overall effective barriers to trade are small. Owing to the agreement with the EU and other
countries, the average effective tariff rate, measured by import duty revenue relative to
imports, is very low, only 1.6 percent in 2003. Trade in industrial products with the EU is
free from tariffs, but agricultural tariffs are expected to be eliminated only upon accession.
Romania also maintains a large number of Free Trade Agreements with the CEE countries,
and is in negotiations with some South East European countries. Staff welcomed the ongoing
efforts at liberalizing trade with non-EU partners, including plans to lower the MFN tariffs.
IV. DISCUSSIONS ON A PRECAUTIONARY SBA
30.
Romania has requested a new Fund arrangement to strengthen macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms in the run-up to EU accession. The authorities’
program aims at addressing risks identified in the Article IV discussions, in particular the
recent surge in the current account deficit, and the need to bring inflation to single digits. The
fiscal consolidation and measures to contain credit growth will play a crucial role in
containing domestic demand. Specifically, the fiscal stance of the broad public sector
(general government and SOEs) will be tightened relative to GDP by 1¼ percentage points
compared with the 2003 outcome. Credit growth, reflecting measures implemented in early
2004, is expected to slow to about 35 percent in real terms on average, which will reduce the
contribution to growth in domestic demand by about 2 percentage points relative to 2003. As
a result, the external current account deficit in 2004 is projected to decline by ¾ percentage
points relative to 2003, to 5¼ percent of GDP, while end-period inflation would be lowered
to 9 percent. The saving-investment balance of the private sector would still have scope to

- 23 -

worsen by about ½ percent of GDP, as private consumption and savings are expected to react
only gradually to lower growth in credit and wages. On the structural side, the priorities are
accelerated privatization, including of the largest company in the country, Petrom, and
measures to arrest the accumulation of arrears, and improved governance.
A. Fiscal Policy in 2004
31.
To support the program objectives, the authorities will amend the 2004 budget.
The supplementary budget, to be approved in July, will reduce the 2004 general government
deficit ceiling to no more than 2.1 percent of GDP, compared to 3 percent of GDP in the
approved budget (¶ 12–14 of the MEFP). Owing to very strong revenue performance, this
reduction can be achieved exclusively by saving surplus revenue, which the authorities
estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP. Moreover, any revenue surplus over that amount would also
be used for reducing the deficit, instead of increasing spending.5 Spending on motorway
construction under the PPPs will be included in this target unless it satisfies strict criteria
established by an FAD TA mission. As one of the measures to eliminate arrears, the budget
will provide resources for clearing the health system arrears accumulated in 2002, while
expenditure controls in this sector will be strengthened.
32.
Energy price adjustments and wage policy will be the main instruments for
improving the SOEs’ financial position. The gas and electricity price adjustments are
expected to increase savings relative to GDP by 1.1 percentage point. The wage program for
70 large SOEs is expected to deliver savings relative to GDP of ½ percentage point. These
savings, partly offset by an increase in SOEs’ investment of 0.3 percent of GDP, will
improve, with sufficient cushion, the SOEs’ S-I balance relative to GDP by about
1 percentage point of GDP.
33.
The authorities will step up the fight against the nonpayment of taxes. Besides
measures to avoid the accumulation of new arrears of SOEs, the authorities accepted that the
reduction in tax arrears of the largest private debtors to the budget be a performance criterion
under the program (MEFP ¶ 18). Moreover, as a prior action, the authorities initiated
bankruptcy procedures against a large private refinery and a number of other companies that
had incurred arrears to the budget and suppliers.6

Based on April data, staff estimates that this surplus could amount to at least 1.1 percent of
GDP relative to the approved 2004 budget.

Chapter I of the accompanying Selected Issues paper addresses the issue of arrears in the
Romanian economy.

- 24 -

B. Wage Policy
34.
Wage policy in 2004 will aim at containing domestic demand (MEFP ¶ 21–22) .
Realizing that the sharp statutory minimum wage hike in 2003 was partly responsible for the
widening of the current account deficit, the authorities raised it by only 12 percent in January
2004 and committed to keep it constant throughout the year. The adopted SOE wage program
requires that net wage growth be contained at 1 percent in real terms, while employment is
reduced by 5 percent. However, recent developments have put this program at risk, as labor
unions are pushing for a higher minimum wage in a nation-wide collective contract, which
would supersede the statutory minimum wage for all medium-size and large enterprises. To
address this issue, the government will instruct managers in SOEs and use its influence so
that the agreed minimum wage in the national collective contract does not deviate
substantially from the statutory minimum wage (MEFP ¶ 21).
C. Energy Sector Policies, Privatization and SOE Restructuring
35.
The authorities are intensifying efforts to improve collections of the main
utilities. Based on input from the World Bank, the authorities are preparing a strategy for a
comprehensive overhaul of district heating, including credible measures to improve
collections (MEFP ¶ 25). The policy of disconnections will continue in other utilities.
36.
The program provides for decisive steps to increase domestic gas producers’
price toward import parity by 2007 and adjust electricity prices. In 2004, the final user
gas prices will be increased by 5 percent every quarter, which combined with the carryover
effects of adjustment in late 2003, will facilitate an increase in domestic producer prices from
US$29/tcm in 2003 to US$61/tcm in 2004 (MEFP ¶ 23). The authorities also announced a
schedule for further increases in producer prices through 2007. Electricity prices will
continue to be adjusted in line with rising costs and to provide an appropriate margin for the
return on equity in the distribution sector, to facilitate privatization (MEFP ¶ 24).
37.
Privatization in the energy sector will proceed. In cooperation with the World
Bank, the mission advised the authorities to relax constraints on the restructuring of Petrom,
to improve the chances for its successful privatization. In response, the authorities have
shortened the restriction on major reorganizations to four years and eliminated penalties for
labor reduction faster than stipulated in the tender documents (MEFP ¶ 27). They also
indicated that they would consider proposals for divesting one refinery before that deadline,
and assume all pre-privatization ecological indemnities. For two electricity distributors, the
authorities are close to signing a contract, while two other distributors are scheduled to be
privatized later in the year (MEFP ¶ 28). For the two gas distribution companies, bids are
now expected by mid-July.
38.
Staff and authorities discussed measures for keeping the momentum in the
privatization of other large companies. Staff welcomed the plans of the Agency for
Privatization to divest all remaining companies in its portfolio, by end-2004, and to reduce
employment in such enterprises in advance of privatization if necessary (MEFP ¶ 29). On the

- 25 -

BCR, the authorities indicated their intention to proceed with selling their remaining shares
as son as possible, in agreement with the EBRD and IFC.
39.
The authorities will initiate decisive restructuring in the large loss-making
mining and railway sectors, responsible for the bulk of arrears to the budget and the
energy suppliers. To prevent the incurrence of new arrears in the mining sector, the
authorities agreed to close 30 mines and lay off 8,000 miners in two steps in 2004
(MEFP ¶ 33). The government has also approved an ambitious strategy for restructuring the
mining sector. The strategy aims at phasing out state support for the minerals sector by 2007
and for the coal sector by 2010, reducing employment in the sector by over 40 percent by
2007, in line with commitments to the EU. The World Bank is to provide support for social
mitigation schemes in the affected regions. In the railways, staff supported the authorities’
proposal to close or give in concessions 3,000 kilometers of low-traffic lines (MEFP ¶ 32). In
view of the labor unions’ demand for higher wages, the authorities proposed an overall
employment reduction of 8,000 positions, about half of which will be layoffs.
D. Governance Issues
40.
In cooperation with the World Bank and in response to the EU Commission
recommendations, the authorities are making significant efforts to improve governance.
The agreed program includes conditionality for a judicial reform, including strengthening the
role of the Superior Council of the Magistrates as the guarantor of judicial independence
(MEFP ¶ 41). Moreover, the law on the declaration of politicians’ assets was amended and
the office of the special anticorruption prosecutor will be strengthened (MEFP ¶ 42–43). The
authorities also agreed to implement legislation that would eliminate immunity granted to
former cabinet members. To address concerns raised by the recent privatization of a large
tobacco company, the authorities have hired a reputable consultancy firm to review the
privatization (MEFP ¶ 31). They will continue with the practice of publishing the list of
largest tax nonpayers on a web site and will also regularly publish financial statements of
large SOEs on the web. The agreed measures to enforce tax collections against large
nonpayers also aim at improving the business climate.
E. Monetary Policy Under the Program
41.
Monetary policy will focus on lowering inflation to single digits in 2004. The
current exchange-rate-based framework remains appropriate, and the NBR will use both
interest rate policy and selective market interventions to steer the exchange rate consistent
with the inflation target and a modest real appreciation (MEFP ¶ 38). However, the
authorities will need to remain vigilant in keeping the current account deficit well within safe
margins. While fiscal policy would have to lead in this process, the NBR would closely
watch credit growth and implement additional measures if necessary (MEFP ¶ 39).

- 26 -

F. Vulnerabilities and Balance of Payments Prospects
42.
Vulnerability indicators point to reasonably low short-term risks, but mediumterm prospects depend on persevering with stability-oriented policies and structural
reforms. External debt, and public and publicly guaranteed debt-to-GDP ratios are on the
low side. The level of official reserves is high relative to money aggregates and short-term
debt, and comfortable relative to prospective imports of goods and services (Appendices IV
and V on debt sustainability). Romania’s haphazard policy implementation has proved to be
the main source of macroeconomic risks. An election-motivated deterioration in the fiscal
stance and the postponement of structural reforms in 2004–05 could lead to a loss of market
confidence, reversal in disinflation, and current account pressures. These developments
would likely be accompanied by rising sovereign spreads, and weakening FDI. While losing
access to external financing seems unlikely, the prospects of significantly improving living
standards and putting in place the reforms needed to successfully compete in the EU could be
pushed back.
43.
In general, the outlook for growth and inflation is expected to be robust to
moderately adverse changes in the external environment. Export resilience despite slow
partner demand in 2003 indicates that Romania could weather a slow recovery in the EU.
44.
The balance of payments outlook in 2004 and over the medium term appears
favorable. The improved confidence in the economy in the run-up to the EU accession will
spur an increase in FDI and business confidence. Foreign borrowing will be reduced in line
with the lower budget deficit.
45.
Banking system vulnerability remains low for the immediate future; however,
the recent speed of credit expansion has been excessive. The overall indebtedness of the
private sector and its exposure to foreign-currency-denominated credit (both to domestic
banks and foreign creditors) are low compared with other accession countries. Should,
however, the recent excessive pace of credit expansion not abate, the authorities would need
to implement additional measures to protect the solvency of banks.
46.
Staff is presently completing a safeguards assessment with respect to the
precautionary SBA. Preliminary conclusions do not indicate serious vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the NBR has considerably strengthened its safeguards framework since the 2002
assessment that was conducted under the previous SBA.
V. ACCESS, PHASING, MONITORING, AND OTHER ISSUES
47.
The authorities intend to treat the proposed 24-month arrangement as
precautionary. The length of the arrangement reflects the need to implement structural
reforms, in line with EPA recommendations. Total access of SDR 250 million (24.3 percent
of quota) would be made available in nine purchases (Table 13). The precautionary nature
and the low access level reflect the absence of an immediate balance of payments need.

- 27 -

48.
Front-loaded conditionality ensures the implementation of crucial
macroeconomic and structural policies, in line with recommendations in the Ex-post
Assessment. The macroeconomic objectives of reducing inflation and containing the current
account deficit are addressed, in addition to conventional quantitative PCs, with a
quantitative PC on the wage bill of SOEs and several structural measures to improve the
financial performance of the energy sector. The important issue of arrears is addressed via
quantitative targets for collection rates of the main utilities, targets for tax arrears, and other
arrears of SOEs, and structural conditionality on reforms in the mining, railways, and district
heating sectors, developed in close coordination with the World Bank. The Bank has also
considered that more frequent Fund reviews could be more effective in implementing energy
price reforms. Reflecting the Executive Directors’ views expressed on EPA, the program
includes conditionality on governance issues, which builds upon the work of the World Bank
and the authorities’ discussions with the EU Commission. A broad consensus has developed
that Fund conditionality would be most effective for a timely implementation of these
measures.
49.
Reviews will be conducted on a quarterly basis. In addition to the main financial
performance indicators, they will assess progress in implementing the structural elements of
the program.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Romania’s notable progress in addressing long-standing policy deficiencies has
improved its macroeconomic performance. After the “lost decade” of the 1990s, Romania
has gone a long way toward cutting its budget and broader public sector deficits The
resulting reduction in macroeconomic imbalances, together with a strong improvement in
competitiveness stemming from the 1999 devaluation, has boosted confidence and private
investment, leading to a strong pick-up in growth. Inflation has fallen steadily and both the
saving and investment rates have risen. Declining unit labor costs and the considerable
resilience of exports to the slowdown in the main trading partner economies suggest
favorable supply conditions.
51.
However, the structural reform agenda remains large. Romania’s share of the
public sector in the economy is still the largest among accession countries. While recently the
Agency for Privatization successfully accelerated the privatization of enterprises in its
portfolio, privatization projects in the energy sector have been delayed, and no project has yet
been completed. The financial performance of SOEs remains a problem, particularly in the
railways and mining sectors. Weak governance and corruption problems continue to be
significant obstacles for larger FDI.
52.
Macroeconomic stabilization needs to be completed. To proceed with the
stabilization that relies on exchange rate policy, the current account deficit has to be kept
well within safe margins. Fiscal policy is crucial for this purpose and, over the medium-term,

- 28 -

the general government budget deficit should be kept below 2 percent of GDP. This is
particularly important because neither low inflation nor monetary policy credibility has yet
been established, while wage policies have often slipped.
53.
Efforts to contain the general government deficit will need to be pursued in
tandem with measures to improve the structure of revenues and expenditures. Social
security contribution rates need to be lowered further; meanwhile, excise taxes will need to
increase gradually to EU levels and tax collection should be strengthened further.
Expenditures must be carefully prioritized to make room for accession-related investment
spending.
54.
Completing the task of stabilization hinges crucially on progress in imposing
hard budget constraints on the state-owned enterprise sector. Large and volatile losses of
these enterprises, particularly in the energy sector, mines, and railways, have undermined
previous stabilization efforts. In the energy sector, the emphasis must be on raising gas prices
to import parity, and timely adjustment of electricity and heating prices in line with costs.
The fight against the nonpayment of utility bills and tax arrears should also continue.
Significant downsizing of the loss-making mining and railway sectors should be
accompanied by enhancing the social safety net and programs for retraining and relocation.
55.
Prudent wage policies are critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Every effort is needed to prevent that collective contracts derail the SOEs wage program and
invalidate the government’s decision on the statutory minimum wage. Moreover, further real
increases in the minimum wage, which is now high compared to the economy-wide average
wage, should be avoided, as they would aggravate demand pressures and harm Romania’s
competitiveness. Employment and wage controls in SOEs need to continue.
56.
The authorities’ plans for privatization need to be pursued vigorously. It is
encouraging that the authorities plan to sell or close by end-2004 most of the companies
remaining in the portfolio of the Agency for Privatization. In the energy sector, the
privatization of the largest company in the country, Petrom, and several distribution
companies is crucial.
57.
The Labor Code needs to be overhauled to increase labor market flexibility. The
recent favorable growth performance reflected a flexible labor market, but the new Labor
code includes many regulations that take steps in the wrong direction and have adversely
affected the flexibility of the labor market. Staff welcomes the authorities’ willingness to
amend the law.
58.
The authorities are aware that comprehensive governance reforms are necessary
for further improving the business climate. Catching up with other EU accession countries
requires stepping up the fight against corruption, perceived as a key impediment to a better
business climate. Reform of the judiciary system to improve its effectiveness and
independence, in particular, stands out. Romania must also demonstrate that it has

- 29 -

established an efficient bankruptcy mechanism, a crucial element of a fully functioning
market economy.
59.
The current monetary policy of guiding the exchange rate consistent with the
inflation target and real appreciation in line with the differentials in sectoral
productivity remains appropriate for the near future. This guidance is achieved with
market interventions combined with interest rate policy. Recent NBR measures seem to have
moderated consumer credit growth; nevertheless, the authorities will need to strengthen bank
supervision and strictly enforce the new regulations on consumer and mortgage lending.
60.
With further progress in stabilization and the completion of technical
preparations, it will be appropriate to move to an IT framework for monetary policy.
The introduction of IT needs to be well prepared by establishing the institutional, operational,
and analytical prerequisites for its success. The strengthening of the NBR’s independence,
accomplished by the amendments to the NBR law in June 2004, is an important step in this
direction. However, extensive changes in the structure of information gathering, analysis, and
monetary policy decision-making remain to be accomplished. In case of delays, the
authorities should consider postponing the switch to IT. They should also consider
introducing joint announcements by the NBR and the government of the annual inflation
target, to better coordinate monetary, fiscal, and incomes policies and increase the credibility
of the target.
61.
The financial system appears healthy, although risks from rapid credit growth
cannot be ignored. Financial soundness indicators suggest that banks can withstand
considerable stress as they are liquid and well capitalized. However, in the context of
exceptionally rapid credit growth, enhanced on-site supervision is a must, together with a
systematic assessment of risk exposure through stress-testing of portfolios. While the overall
exposure of the private sector to foreign currency risk is currently limited, additional
measures will be needed should rapid growth in foreign currency loans re-emerge.
62.
In staff’s view, the authorities program presented in the attached Letter of
Intent and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, includes the policies
necessary to achieve further progress in macroeconomic stabilization. Staff therefore
recommends that the authorities’ request for the SBA, which they intend to treat as
precautionary, be approved.
63.
It is suggested that the Article IV Consultation with Romania be held on the twentyfour-month cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved
by the Board on July 15, 2002.

1/ Including called-up loan guarantees.
2/ Difference between financing and the deficit of the consolidated general government.
3/ As the 2003 budget incorporated various extrabudgetary revenues and expenditures, the budgets for 2002 and 2003 are not fully comparable. On a comparable basis, they are by 0.3 percent of G
4/ Including National Administration of Roads (AND).
5/ Owing to the merger between the privatization agency (APAPS) and the asset recovery agency (AVAB) on May 1, 2004, revenues and expenditures of the consolidated general government are
by lei 630 billion higher than in the budget approved by parliament on December 3, 2003, as the latter did not comprise AVAB revenues and expenditures.

1/ All changes are 12-month rates of change, unless indicated otherwise. The NFA/NDA contribution rates are adjusted for the change in the euro/US$ exchange rate from December 2003.
2/ Adjusted for write-offs in the last 12 months and changes in the US$/euro exchange rate.
3/ Real lei credit growth and foreign currency credit growth, weighted by their respective shares.
4/ Numbers before and after December 2003 are not strictly comparable, owing to an update in the US$/euro exchange rate used to convert euro stocks in US$-equivalent.

1/ For program purposes, all values are defined on a monthly average basis.
2/ Program definition excludes deposits of commercial banks to meet required reserves against foreign currency deposits. This, and the fact that the figures here are monthly averages, explain the diffe
3/ All changes are 12-month rates of change, unless indicated otherwise.
4/ Adjusted for changes in minimum reserve requirements.
The minimum reserve requirement for lei deposits was decreased in 2002 from 25 percent to 22 percent in April and further to 18 percent in December.
5/ Adjusted to correspond to a 25 percent reserve requirement until end-2003 and 18 percent afterwards.

Program

1/ Cost recovery price estimates based on WEO fuel price projections.
2/ Estimates, as of September 2001, based on the assumption that the adjustments as envisaged under the program were not implemented.
3/ The reduction in losses only partially translates into an improvement in the saving-investment balance, owing to three offsetting factors: (i) increase in losses in other public enterprises,
(ii) higher tax payments of the energy sector, (iii) higher investment in the energy sector. For 2003 and 2004, this effect is estimated at 1/2.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangements

From August 1994, a decentralized direct dealing interbank market has been in operation.
The official reference rate published by the NBR is an average of rates reported for interbank
and client transactions. Romania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4, with effect from March 25, 1998. Romania’s exchange system is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Romania
maintains de jure a managed floating exchange rate regime with no preannounced exchange
rate path, while the de facto regime is an unannounced crawling band.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
Romania is on the 24-month consultation cycle subject to the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles approved by the Board on July 15, 2002. The last consultation was
concluded on January 8, 2003.
IX.

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of
areas with more than 40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities
have had a mixed record with regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused
on a number of key areas, including: fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and
the banking system; creating a market-oriented legal structure; training; and improving the
collection and reporting of statistics. The implementation of a comprehensive tax
administration reform designed in line with the recommendations of several technical
assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department has started in January 2003. A
report on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency was
completed on November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254).

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the NBR is subject to an assessment with
respect to the new precautionary Stand-By Arrangement, which is currently being
finalized by the staff. The preliminary conclusions do not indicate material weaknesses in
the safeguards in place at the NBR. Moreover, staff found a substantial strengthening of
the NBR's safeguards framework since the last assessment, which was completed in 2002
under the previous SBA for Romania.

APPENDIX II

ROMANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
1.
The Romanian authorities are pursuing a strategy designed to maintain
macroeconomic stability and establish sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction,
moving towards the eventual goal of accession to the European Union. Key elements of this
policy include tightening payments discipline throughout the economy, especially in the
energy sector, hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises, actively pursuing
enterprise and banking privatization and restructuring, and strengthening the social safety
net. Over the medium term, continuation of the current economic recovery will depend
critically on the maintenance of reform momentum and moving steadily ahead with
governance and private sector development reforms. Such reforms would stress transparency
and accountability in government, improvements in the business environment, and actions to
strengthen the regulation and oversight of financial and capital markets.
2.
In broad terms, the IMF has taken the lead in assisting Romania in maintaining
macroeconomic stability. As such its program focus is on the fiscal framework, monetary
policy and those elements of the structural reform program that have a direct bearing on the
macroeconomic situation. The main vehicles for its dialogue with the authorities are the
recently completed Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) covering the period October 31, 2001 to
October 15, 2003 and the proposed precautionary SBA
3.
The World Bank has taken the lead in policy dialogue on structural issues, including
poverty reduction measures, private sector development, institution building and governance.
It has a range of instruments through which it conducts dialogue, including adjustment
lending operations such as PSAL 1 and PSAL 2, a planned series of Programmatic
Adjustment Loans, several sector investment operations and economic work such as the
recently completed Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (PEIR), and the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM).
4.
In some areas where the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue, its analysis is shared
with the IMF and is used as input for the fiscal framework, but there are no directly
corresponding structural benchmarks or policy conditions in the IMF SBA. In other areas
where the Bank takes the lead, the SBA does reflect certain elements in its conditionality.
These are generally structural reform measures which have important fiscal implications,
such as energy sector reform and restructuring. There are further areas of formal joint
responsibility such as the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
5.
Overall the IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s reform program and are coordinating their policy advice to the
Romanian authorities.

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

A. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
6.
The policy areas in which the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into
the IMF program or country dialogue include strengthening the social safety net, revitalizing
the economy in rural areas, institution building and governance, and improving the business
environment. Bank policy dialogue for strengthening the social safety net includes poverty
monitoring, social assistance, pension reform, child welfare reform, health sector reforms,
and labor retraining and redeployment. These have been supported by the Bank’s
Employment and Social Protection Loan, the Social Sector Development Loan, the Social
Development Fund and the Mine Closure Loan. They are further supported by economic
work such as the recently completed Poverty Profile and the Local Services Delivery Study,
and by planned economic studies on poverty and vulnerability, pension reform and gender
assessment.
7.
The Bank has a range of programs to revitalize the economy in rural areas. These
include the Rural Finance Loan which supports income generation activities and will be
complemented by a Rural/Urban Linkage Growth Study to set the stage for a Rural
Development Loan supporting infrastructure development and improved governance at the
community level. The Irrigation Rehabilitation loan supports infrastructure rehabilitation and
institutional reform. Other supporting economic work includes the Community Networks
Study and the Jiu Valley Development Study.
8.
The Bank has a strong institution building and governance program. This builds on
recent reforms in local public finance and taxation and decentralization. Policy dialogue has
been facilitated the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (PEIR) which included
analysis and recommendations relating to 1) improved resource allocation in the health
sector; 2) delivery of social assistance at the local level; 3) pension reform; 4) institutions for
budget management 5) fiscal decentralization; and 6) reforms to the budget process in the
judiciary. The policy dialogue has also been supported by a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA). The Bank completed a Diagnostic Survey of Corruption in Romania
prior to the Government’s preparing of its National Program for Prevention of Corruption. A
series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PAL) will be launched shortly. These will focus
on institutional and governance reforms in the public service and the judiciary as well as
public expenditure management as well as the remaining structural reform agenda. They will
be supported by a $18.6 million Private and Public Sector Institution Building Loan (PPIBL)
which will provide technical assistance for these activities and others relating to
privatization. Other institution-building support includes financing of a cadastral and land
titling project, a project on the environmental aspects of mine closures, a hazards mitigation
project cofinanced by a GEF grant which focuses on damage from earthquakes, floods toxic
wastes and other hazards in high risk areas, and by a regional project on Trade and
Transportation Facilitation in South East Europe.

- 49 -

APPENDIX II

9.
Policy advice and support for reforms in the business environment have been offered
by the Bank in several areas. Through PSAL 1 and PSAL 2 the Bank has focused on
reducing barriers to entry for firms and joint ventures, implementing internationally
recognized accounting standards and introducing improved bankruptcy and liquidation
procedures. The PALs will also address business environment issues, and all these initiatives
will be supported by technical assistance provided under the PPIBL.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
10.
The Bank supports the GOR’s privatization program through PSAL 2 which includes
targets and timelines for privatization of commercial SOEs and financial institutions. The
program builds on the progress established under PSAL 1 and identifies pools of SOEs from
which set minimum numbers of enterprises are selected for case-by-case privatization and
workout. Specific enterprises including Alro, Alprom, and Petrom, were also identified. Key
to the success of this program is agreement with the Bank on strategies for the privatization
of theses entities and the subsequent adoption of a clear, open and transparent tender process
using the services of qualified investment advisors in a manner consistent with Bank policies.
11.
The Bank has led the dialogue on restructuring, reform and eventual privatization of
enterprises in the electricity, district heating and gas industries and on the adoption of
regulatory legislation in preparation for privatization to strategic investors. As part of this
process the Bank is supporting, inter alia, energy tariff reforms and the elimination of arrears
in the electricity, district heat and gas sectors, and these objectives are woven into the policy
conditions of PSAL 2, along with conditions related to the privatization of electricity
distribution enterprises. These conditions have been closely coordinated with the IMF since
the SBA also includes provisions for structural reforms in the energy sector including tariff
setting, arrears clearance and collection rates. The Bank is leading the IFI dialogue with the
Government on such critical long-term issues as power generation sector restructuring and
the integration of the Romanian power sector with the South East European Regional
Electricity Market and with the EU’s electricity market, and provides assistance on the
associated regulatory and market operation issues. The Bank has also provided technical
assistance to the Ministry of Industry to establish a system of pricing and taxation of gas
consistent with attracting further investment into the industry. Policy dialogue in these and
other areas, notably including the district heating sector, will be further facilitated by ongoing
dialogue with the Government on the recently completed Energy and Infrastructure Strategy
paper and its operational recommendations. Again, the series of PALs will be used as
vehicles for incorporating policy advice in these areas into Bank lending operations.
12.
The Bank has taken the lead in dialogue and policy advice regarding regulation,
restructuring, privatization and liquidation of banks. Under PSAL 1 the Law on Bank
Privatization was modified and transparent privatization procedures established. Liquidity
and solvency requirements of the NBR were tightened and provisions introduced for
improved compliance with prudential regulations and external audits conducted according to
International Accounting Standards. Legal and institutional reforms were introduced for

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

orderly disposition of non-performing assets. These policy changes underpinned liquidation
of the most troubled bank (Bancorex ) while Bank Agricola was restructured and eventually
privatized as were two smaller state owned banks. This policy agenda is continued under
proposed PAL with steps to complete the sale of Banca Comerciala Romana (BCR) the
Savings Bank (CEC). The Bank is continuing dialogue with the government on the need to
move forward with further improvements of the legal and regulatory framework for the
securities and insurance sectors. The PPIBL will provide funding for these activities.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
energy sector as described above, the IMF has a strong interest from a macroeconomic
perspective since privatization revenues are used to retire public debt, and quasi-fiscal
deficits of the SOEs present a threat to macroeconomic stability. Accordingly, there is high
degree of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these matters. The
IMF has introduced into its SBA conditions relating to electricity tariff rates, arrears in gas
and electricity collections as well as the privatization of a subset of the enterprises covered
under the Bank’s program. While the terms of the respective programs are mutually
consistent and supportive, the focus and motivation for the Bank’s program are on the
efficiency of the resulting market structures, improved enterprise operation, service delivery
and financial performance, and the transparency of the process and improvement in overall
sector governance, and that of the IMF are on immediate revenue generation and expenditure
control, and containment of ongoing fiscal burdens.
14.
The Bank and the IMF jointly conducted a Financial Sector Assessment Program
which was completed in June 2003.
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
15.
While the Bank has focused on simplifications to the taxation system as a means of
improving the business environment the Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters. In
addition to the achievement of overall fiscal targets the Fund’s Stand-By program includes
structural benchmarks and performance criteria relating to introduction of new VAT and
profits tax laws, increases in specific excises, and elimination of tax preferences under the
customs duty and profit tax systems. The IMF is also providing technical assistance in
support of unification of the payroll tax systems.
16.
The IMF leads the dialogue on certain polices to contain certain expenditures in the
public sector. These include policies regarding wage-setting in both the public service and
SOEs and the budgets of SOEs In addition the IMF has lead the discussions relating to
requirements for disconnections of non-payers in the gas and electricity sectors.
17.
In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
18.
The IMF is fully responsible for the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the
exchange rate regime, the balance of payments and all the related statistical and measurement
issues.
B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
19.
A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania was presented to the World
Bank’s Board on June 19, 2001. The CAS defines the Bank's lending and advisory services
based on the Government’s priorities of poverty reduction and EU accession, and builds on
the work initiated under the Comprehensive Development Framework, for which Romania
was one of the pilot countries. About one half of the FY02–04 lending program is adjustment
lending. Two distinct lending scenarios were outlined. A low case in which Romania in the
event of a hesitant pace of reforms would result in significant reductions in Bank Group
support to a level of $60 million during FY02–04 with actions centered on a few poverty
focused interventions. However, Romania has successfully remained in the high-case lending
scenario under which Bank commitments of up to $995 million during FY02–04 were
envisaged, compared with $600 million in FY98–00. This reflects the sustained fulfillment of
the high-case triggers, which included progress in establishing a macroeconomic
environment conducive to lower inflation and sustainable growth as well as progress on
structural issues including privatization as initiated under PSAL 1, initiation of the
privatization and work-out process for a number of remaining large state-owned enterprises,
agreement on a plan and schedule for reducing energy arrears, agreement on a method and
timetable for privatization of Romanian Commercial Bank and the Savings Bank,
improvements in the financial sector legal and supervisory framework, an agreement on an
anti-corruption strategy, and approval of social assistance legislation.
20.
The high-case scenario embodies a program of accelerated structural and sectoral
reforms that will pave the way for Romania’s eventual accession to the EU. The first stage of
this program has now been launched with the approval of PSAL 2 by the Bank Board in
September 2002, and the delivery of the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (PEIR)
in July 2002. In the second stage to follow PSAL 2, the Bank would offer support through a
series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs) focusing on institutional and governance
reforms, completion of the privatization agenda, implementation of the recommendations of
the Energy and Infrastructure Strategy Paper and improvements to the business environment,
as well as a Country Financial and Accountability Assessment and a Country Economic
Memorandum focusing on the reform agenda for Romania’s accession to the EU.
The World Bank has been active in Romania since 1991 and has built up a portfolio
21.
of 39 Bank-financed operations with total commitments of US$3.9 billion. Romania's
portfolio is the second largest in ECA in terms of number of projects and the fourth largest in
terms of commitments. The active portfolio as of April 30, 2004 consists of 19 projects with
aggregate net commitments totaling $1,144.7 million and a total undisbursed balance of

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

$749.2 million. Sector composition in terms of net commitments is dominated by energy and
infrastructure (42 percent, seven projects) and the social sectors (15 percent, four projects).
22.
The quality of the Bank’s Romania portfolio has been improving over the past several
years. While the overall performance indicators are positive, several cross-cutting
implementation issues persist. These include: (i) project management capacity (specifically,
issues relating to procedures, inter-agency coordination, and project implementation unit
staffing and facilities), and (ii) the timely availability of counterpart contributions as well as
the quality and processing of disbursement applications, to yield maximum development
impact from the Bank’s portfolio.
23.
IFC has dedicated substantial resources to implementing a strategy intended to
advance structural reform, assist the development of capital markets and infrastructure
(utilities and telecommunication), and provide support for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs). To date, IFC has committed US$393 million in 26 projects. As of end December
2003, IFC portfolio in Romania stood at $267 million. In addition to investments, IFC has
undertaken a number of advisory assignments aimed at supporting the privatization and
restructuring of large state-owned enterprises, public utilities and the health sector.

APPENDIX III

ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Romania’s data collection and reporting is adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. The authorities have made progress improving their economical and financial
database with the help of Fund TA missions, although more needs to be done in the areas of
balance of payments and fiscal statistics, and ensuring the consistency between monetary and
fiscal data. Romania has participated in the GDDS since February 2001. The November 2000
STA mission assisted the authorities in preparing GDDS metadata and prepared a ROSC for
the data module which is now posted on the IMF website. An STA monetary and financial
statistics mission visited Bucharest during May 11–23, 2003 to review the status of the
GDDS Plans for Improvement for the National Bank of Romania (NBR) and assist in
adopting the recommendations of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). A BOP mission between June 23–July 8, 2003 undertook a detailed review of the
compilation methodology on the balance of payments and the international investment
position. Romania nominated an SDDS Coordinator in October 2003 and is currently
working towards SDDS subscription.
Real Sector
2.
The quarterly and annual national accounts statistics produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a
timely basis for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). However,
harmonization of quarterly and annual national accounts is not done on a regular basis and
late revisions can sometimes be significant. The INS has moved to update the framework
from the European System of Accounts 1979 (ESA79) to ESA95; ESA95-based data were
released at end-2000. Constant price estimates are in the process of being converted to annual
chain-linked indices, as recommended by ESA95. The INS staff has been downsized
significantly over the past few years, which might affect the quality and timeliness of the data
in the period ahead.
3.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and it is
considered to be reliable. Based on technical assistance recommendations from the European
Union’s PHARE Program, the INS reduced the coverage of the Producer Price Index (PPI)
from the value of all shipments of the covered industries to shipments for domestic uses only
beginning with 1998 data. As of January 2004 the INS changed the coverage of the PPI back
to include the domestic and non-domestic markets.
Public Finance
4.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported annually for the
GFS Yearbook and quarterly for IFS, while EUR receives monthly budget data. The STA
multisector statistics mission that visited Romania in December 1999 recommended that all
major fiscal categories be reported on a quarterly and monthly basis. The mission also called
for the documentation and reporting of all government transactions related to the Agency for
Bank Asset Recovery (AVAB) which has received large amounts of nonperforming bank
claims in exchange for the `bank receipts of government securities. The mission also

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

recommended the introduction of detailed financing and debt classifications in the Treasury’s
chart of accounts and budget classifications, but these recommendations have yet to be
implemented. Work continues on the establishment of a new aid coordination unit to monitor
external grants.
Monetary and Financial
5.
The NBR reports monetary and financial statistics on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the IFS. The overall assessment of the May 2003 monetary and financial
statistics mission is that the NBR has implemented important recommendations of previous
STA missions in the area of monetary statistics. The monetary statistics compiled and
disseminated by the NBR meet, and in some instances exceed, the recommendations of the
GDDS with respect to coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of dissemination.
6.
Nevertheless, monetary statistics needs to be reconciled with government finance
statistics. In line with 1993 SNA and MFSM, accrued interest on deposits and loans, and
securities other than shares should be incorporated in the outstanding amount of financial
assets or liquidity.
7.
With the gradual harmonization of Romania’s monetary and financial statistics with
the 1995 ESA and European Central Bank statistical reporting requirements, important
deviations from the IMF’s statistical methodology are expected to diminish over time as a
result of the strong concordance among the 1995 ESA, 1993 SNA, and MFSM.
Balance of Payments
8.
The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund in a timely
fashion. Data collection and compilation have improved following technical assistance. The
ROSC data module of November 2001 noted particular concerns with the coverage of the
direct investment data (stocks and flows) and related income flows, and with the quality of
data on current transfers, in particular with the general government sector. The NBR has
decided to adopt a new balance of payments compilation system in consultation with
Eurostat. In July 2003, a balance of payments statistics mission concluded that the proposed
system is broadly appropriate. The mission supported the implementation of the new system
in 2004 along with the conduct of the new FDI survey. A switch from annual to quarterly
frequency in the outward portfolio survey could also be considered for implementation in
2004 (or later) as well as the collection of stock data on equity securities via the National
Commission of Securities.

APPENDIX IV

ROMANIA: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Following recent macroeconomic consolidation, Romania’s external position appears
robust. The external debt to GDP ratio under the baseline scenario is expected to remain at
about 34 percent, the level at end-2003. Under standard stress tests, debt dynamics remain
under control. Romania’s gross external financing need is projected to remain stable relative
to GDP throughout the projection period; under most of the stress tests it rises only
marginally over the baseline.
The historical-average scenario (A1) shows results similar to the baseline, implying that
forecasts are not overly optimistic. The debt-stabilizing level of the current account deficit
is almost unchanged from the baseline, and the debt to GDP ratio rises to only 35 percent,
compared to 34 percent under the baseline. The slight improvement in Romania’s mediumterm prospects under the baseline over historical averages is justified due to continued
structural reforms and conservative fiscal policies.
Even under the scenario of weak policy implementation (A2), debt levels and external
financing needs do not rise far from the baseline. Romania’s current-account deficit
remains above 4 percent of GDP for 2004-2006, GDP growth is lower, and the adjustment
currently envisioned for the program period is delayed. The gap relative to baseline is
financed largely by debt-creating flows. However, while these factors cause a temporary
deterioration in gross external financing, their effect on the debt ratio is minor compared to
the baseline.
Among the standard stress tests (B1-B6), Romania’s debt appears most vulnerable to a
shock to GDP growth or worsening of the current account. Romania’s GDP growth was
fairly volatile during the past decade, which explains the large deviation under the slowgrowth scenario. The combined-shock scenario (lower U.S. inflation, larger Romanian
current account deficit and slower GDP growth) increases the debt to GDP ratio to nearly
50 percent. Therefore, continued forbearance in consumption growth and the implementation
of structural reforms to increase long-term growth potential are important to maintain
Romania’s sustainable position.

APPENDIX V

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY SIMULATIONS
Based on a continuing fiscal consolidation in the run up to EU accession, the debt to
GDP ratio is projected to stay roughly stable under the governments’ medium-term
fiscal plans. The level of about 27 percent of GDP projected for end-2004 is low compared
to most other transition countries. Stress tests indicate that the most likely shocks would
increase the debt-to-GDP ratio only moderately. The combinations of shocks that could raise
public debt to permanently higher levels are unlikely to occur.
The alternative scenarios appear to be benign. With key variables at their historical
averages (Scenario A1), the public debt ratio drops considerably by 2009, but this is an
artifact of the applied methodology, particularly the very low projection for the real interest
rate. Similarly, the historical average nominal depreciation against the U.S. dollar is not a
good guide for the future, as the depreciation rate has exhibited a declining trend since
inflation was brought under control. Note that to mitigate these factors, all the alternative
scenarios are based on historical averages for the last 3 years.
The bound tests do not raise concerns either. Using the standard assumption of a
30 percent sustained real depreciation in 2005, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise
some 10 percentage points. The same follows from assumption that other debt creating flows
increase by 10 percent of GDP in 2005. These outcomes are judged moderate after such
extreme shocks, which staff considers unlikely. Scenarios with a lower primary balance,
lower GDP growth, or real interest rates at 5 percent for 2005-06 all increase public debt by
less than 1.5 percentage points.
Nonetheless, further fiscal adjustment over the medium term is necessary to sustain
rapid medium-term growth without jeopardizing hard-won progress in stabilization of
the economy. The process of macroeconomic stabilization has not been completed and the
credibility of fiscal policy is yet to be entrenched. With the expected further strengthening in
private sector investment, fiscal policy will need to prevent widening in the external current
account deficit. Medium-term fiscal plans should therefore aim at further reducing the
general government deficit and improving the financial performance of state-owned
enterprises.

Real interest rate is at 5 percent in 2005 and 2006
Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

Dear Mr. de Rato:
The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) specifies
understandings reached with staff in discussions on a 24-month program supported by a StandBy Arrangement (SBA) with access of SDR 250 million (24.27 percent of quota), which we
intend to treat as precautionary.
Over the course of the previous program (2001-2003), macroeconomic imbalances in our
economy were reduced, structural reforms advanced, and GDP growth and investment rose
fast. We brought inflation from 40 percent in early 2001 to 14 percent at end-2003, in line with
the program targets. After a sharp reduction in 2002, the current account deficit widened in
2003 as a result of rapid credit and wage growth, and FDI-related imports. Privatization and
structural reforms advanced, albeit slower than targeted.
Our main macroeconomic objectives are to consolidate stabilization and gradually lower
inflation to mid-single digits by 2006, keep the current account deficit below 5½ percent of
GDP and maintain reserve coverage at 3½ months of imports. Moreover, in line with our
strong commitment to accede to the European Union in 2007, we intend to decisively
improve governance and the business climate and complete the privatization agenda. The
MEFP specifies measures, some of which already implemented, to achieve these objectives.
Based on this, we are requesting the approval of the arrangement.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of its program and ensure sustainable macroeconomic developments in
2004–2006, but it will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this
purpose. Romania will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation.
Yours sincerely,

MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2004–06
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum describes the main economic and financial objectives and policies
of the government and the National Bank of Romania (NBR) for the period 2004–06. The
program reflects our strong commitment to consolidate and advance the macroeconomic
stabilization achieved under the previous Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and accelerate
structural reforms with a view to establishing sustainable rapid growth and ensuring EU
accession in 2007. Following the implementation of the comprehensive reform agenda and
ambitious macroeconomic objectives under the program, we expect that Romania will no
longer need Fund arrangements.
II. BACKGROUND
2.
With prudent fiscal and monetary policies, we achieved far-reaching progress in
macroeconomic stabilization in 2001–03, and established the basis for robust economic
growth. Fiscal tightening, reduction in losses in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and prudent
monetary policies reduced inflation from 40 percent in early 2001 to 12.5 percent in April
2004. Moreover, disinflation was achieved without adverse effects on GDP growth, which at
about 5 percent during the last three years was among the highest in the region. Investment
picked up strongly, with the fixed investment rate increasing from 18.9 percent of GDP in
2000 to 22½ percent in 2003. After a long decline, the number of salaried workers increased
by 1/3 percent in 2003. Our external position strengthened remarkably, with official reserves
increasing from 2½ months of prospective imports at end-2000 to about 3¼ months at
end-2003. Ratings for our sovereign bonds have been raised several times, while spreads
have declined rapidly.
3.
However, extremely rapid credit expansion, and to a lesser extent wage growth,
led to a widening of the current account deficit in 2003. On the back of improved
confidence, banking credit to the private sector surged, growing at over 50 percent in real
terms in 2003, led by consumer and mortgage loans. The resulting strengthening in domestic
demand, which also reflected the spillover of the minimum wage increase in January 2003,
pushed up imports, while the protracted economic weakness in the euro area slowed our
exports. These developments widened the current account deficit from 3.4 percent of GDP in
2002 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2003, exceeding our target by about 1.1 percent of GDP.
4.
Following overperformance in reducing inflation in the first half of 2003,
disinflation stalled in the second half of 2003. The slowdown reflected both the effects of
the minimum wage adjustment, strong domestic demand and energy price increases.
Nevertheless, we largely met our annual target of 14 percent by December, and disinflation
resumed in early 2004.
5.
Fiscal policy in 2003 stayed on track. The general government deficit came out
0.3 percent of GDP better than targeted. The SOEs’ S-I balance improved by 0.1 percent of

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT

GDP, as the increase in arrears to the budget was lower than in 2002. We succeeded in
keeping SOE wages within the approved company budgets. Moreover, the collection rates of
the main utilities have stayed in the 95–98 percent range, except for heating.
6.
Monetary policy has been tightened and bank supervision strengthened. In
response to the temporarily slowing disinflation and rapid credit growth, the NBR raised the
policy interest rate by cumulative 300 basis points since August 2003 and introduced
prudential norms to tighten household eligibility for consumer and mortgage loans. In
particular, the NBR limited the monthly payment-to-net-income ratio to 30 percent, imposed
mandatory 25 percent downpayment or a co-signer/insurance for consumer loans and a cosigner, insurance or collateral for personal loans. The NBR and the Security Supervision
Commission lowered the maximum payment-to-net income ratio to 35 percent for mortgage
credit and introduced a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent. All these measures
became effective on February 1, 2004. Similarly, the Insurance Supervision Commission
issued a regulation limiting insurance companies’ retained exposure to bank loans. The
commercial banks are in the process of establishing a credit bureau to monitor consumer and
business credit, expected to be operational in Q4 of 2004. We have also postponed the
liberalization of leu deposits of nonresidents in local banks, scheduled for January 2004.
Despite the rapid growth of credit so far, we consider the resulting prudential risks to be
manageable as banks are well-capitalized and liquid. Following the introduction of a new
regulation on loan classification in early 2003, provisioning against credit risk is in our view
adequate, which was also confirmed by the FSAP conducted in 2003.
7.
In 2003 and early 2004, we have made substantial progress in privatization and
improving the business climate. Since the beginning of 2003, the Privatization Agency sold
23 large loss-making SOEs with over 70,000 employees. In about 70 largest SOEs monitored
under the program, employment was reduced by 7½ percent, or over 34,000 thousand
employees, with particularly large cuts achieved in the railway sector. We have completed
negotiations on the investment of the IFC and EBRD in the largest bank, BCR, and the
settlement is expected in early June. Moreover, we have received three binding bids for the
privatization of the largest company Petrom and have selected the winning bidder. Delays
have, however, been experienced in the privatization of the electricity and gas distributors.
To improve the business climate, we have approved an anticorruption plan and established an
anticorruption public prosecution office in 2003.
8.
Energy sector reforms advanced significantly in 2001–03. Sharp increases in
energy prices have reduced energy sector losses substantially. We have brought electricity
prices close to cost-recovery levels, sharply increased heating prices, and raised domestic gas
prices, though the latter remain substantially below import parity. Our fight against the nonpayment culture has been effective in the gas and electricity sectors, but more efforts are
needed in the heating sector.

III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
A. Objectives and Strategy
9.
The main objectives of our 2004–06 program are to sustain and advance
macroeconomic stabilization and accelerate structural reforms. Our key macroeconomic
objectives are: (i) to reduce inflation to 9 percent by end-2004, 6 percent by end-2005, and
5 percent by end-2006; (ii) to contain the external current account deficit to below
5½ percent of GDP; and (iii) to maintain reserve cover at a comfortable level of 3½ months
of prospective imports. We expect that our economy will grow at an average annual rate of
5 percent during 2004–06, helping to reduce the GDP per capita gap relative to the EU.
Stabilizing inflation at single digits for the first time in Romania’s transition history would in
our view be a powerful signal that sound economic policies have taken hold. As about 2/3 of
the current account deficit is projected to be covered by non-debt creating flows, we view its
projected level as sustainable. With the private sector S-I balance expected to decline further,
all the improvement in the external current account deficit will have to come from the public
sector, the budget and S-I balances of SOEs. External risks remain manageable in light of our
progress in structural reforms, low external and public debt-to-GDP ratios, and the favorable
term structure of our debt.
10.
The main elements of our macroeconomic policy package in 2004 will be as
follows: The S-I balance of the broad public sector will be improved by about 1¼ percentage
point of GDP, which will be achieved by tightening our 2004 budget target, a modest
nominal increase in the minimum wage, a prudent wage program for SOEs, and further
reforms in the energy, railway and mining sectors. Monetary policy will be appropriately
tight and, together with prudential measures, should slow credit growth to facilitate
disinflation and contain the current account deficit.
11.
Structural reforms in 2004–2006 will aim at completing the privatization
agenda, strengthening financial discipline and tax compliance in SOEs and private
companies alike, and decisively improving governance and the business climate. The
program will provide a strong impetus to privatization in the energy sector, including the
largest company in the country, Petrom, the entire gas distribution sector, and many
electricity generation and distribution companies. In this context, the reform of the pricing
mechanism for natural gas with a view to raise domestic producer prices to import parity by
January 2007 gains in urgency and importance. The program will also facilitate the
privatization or liquidation of the remaining 19 large loss-making SOEs under the
Privatization Agency. Decisive measures will be taken against private tax nonpayers, while
the financial performance of the state-owned nonpayers—concentrated primarily in the
railway and mining sector—will be improved by strong and credible loss-reduction
programs. Other measures will aim at improvements in the important areas of governance,
competition, and the business climate.

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT

B. Fiscal Policy
12.
Fiscal policy in 2004 will support disinflation and help contain the external
current account deficit, while creating scope for further private sector investment.
In particular:
•
In May 2004, we will publicly announce the decision to tighten the
general government deficit target to 2.1 percent of GDP, with a view to assuring
markets that we are taking appropriate measures to contain the current account
deficit. We will approve a supplementary budget in line with this revised deficit
target by July 20, 2004 (structural PC). Owing to much stronger revenue performance
than assumed at the time of the 2004 budget approval, we will be able to achieve this
objective by preserving the overall budgeted expenditure envelope, while
compensating somewhat higher local government spending with cuts at the central
government level. If revenue comes out stronger than consistent with the deficit target
of 2.1 percent of GDP, we will not increase the expenditure envelope envisaged in the
program, and will use all the additional revenue for reducing the deficit. Expenditures
for all motorway projects, including projects on the basis of public-private
partnerships and projects financed with off-budget guarantees, will be accommodated
within the new budget deficit ceiling, unless a different treatment would be
appropriate in line with the recommendations of the FAD technical assistance.
Privatization proceeds will continue to be treated as a financing item in fiscal
accounts (Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), section III).
•
We will implement measures to improve the saving-investment balances
of the SOEs to facilitate an overall adjustment in the broad public sector deficit
of 1¼ percent of GDP. The measures are described in paragraphs 21–26 and 32–33.
To help us ensure that the fiscal objective for the broad public sector is met, we will
establish monthly monitoring of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR),
which will be a quantitative benchmark in 2004. We will make every effort to
improve the reliability of these data with a view to convert this benchmark into a
quantitative PC starting with the first quarter of 2005.
13.
We stand ready to tighten fiscal policy further if our current account or
disinflation targets are at risk. We expect that the targeted reduction in the budget deficit
and the measures to improve the saving-investment balance of SOEs are sufficient to contain
the recent strong growth in domestic demand and will result in an improvement in the
external current account deficit in the first half of 2004. Should this not be the case, we are
firmly committed to implementing corrective measures, including tightening fiscal policy
further. Supplementary budgets and possible revisions of expenditure ceilings will be
discussed in the context of quarterly reviews under the arrangement.
14.
On tax policy, we have decided to give priority to a further reduction in social
security contribution rates. Following the reduction of payroll taxes by 3 percentage points

- 68 -

ATTACHMENT

in 2002 and 5 percentage points in 2003, we have cut the employers’ pension fund
contribution rate by 2.5 percentage points and the employers’ unemployment fund
contribution rate by 0.5 percentage points on January 1, 2004. The eligibility for the reduced
VAT rate will be limited to pharmaceutical products, hotel accommodation, newspaper
distribution, and a small group of previously VAT-exempted products. We will refrain from
reducing profit tax and personal income tax rates in 2004, as they are comparable with rates
in other EU accession countries and we cannot afford further loss of revenue. We have also
decided to refrain from introducing interest deductibility for mortgage loans. We will not
modify tax legislation in 2004 and will consult with Fund staff on any amendments that we
may envisage for 2005. Moreover, we will refrain from introducing tax holidays or any other
new distortionary tax incentives or postponing the discontinuation of expiring ones
(continuous structural benchmark).
15.
The implementation of the comprehensive tax administration reform will
continue. On January 1, 2004 we established the National Agency for Fiscal Administration
(NAFA) under the Ministry of Public Finance and transferred the collection of social security
contributions to the new agency. The modernization of our revenue administration will now
focus on operations, systems and processes, and human resources. We intend to create a
function-based structure with strong supervision from headquarters, which will control
automated business processes and implement risk-based compliance programs. In line with
the recommendations of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), we have established
project structures for the recommended reforms. Detailed plans for the achievement of the
main objectives will be approved by end-June 2004. In July 2004, we will begin discussions
on potential funding with donor organizations. Moreover, to ensure that all revenue
collection functions are integrated, the government will approve an act that would
subordinate, as of January 1, 2005, customs administration and the Financial Guard to the
Minister of Public Finance (structural performance criterion).
16.
We remain strongly committed to keeping budgetary sector wages and pensions
within the limits of the 2004 budget. We have limited the increase in budget sector wages
in 2004 to 6 percent in nominal terms on January 1, 2004 and another 6 percent on October 1,
2004 by approving Government Ordinance 123/2003. The annual bonus for 2003, paid in
early 2004, was limited to the equivalent of one month’s salary in 2003, and we will apply
this principle accordingly for the 2004 bonus to be paid in 2005. In the SOEs sector, to avoid
that the use of SOE profits for wage bonuses undermine our wage program, we will amend
by end-July 2004 Government Ordinance 64/2001 to limit the use of profits for this purpose
to one monthly average base wage. Taking into account the need to consolidate the pension
fund, we are determined not to exceed the scheduled increase in pensions and the pension
expenditures in the 2004 budget. To ensure the medium-term sustainability of the public
pension system, we will agree with the World Bank in the context of the Programmatic
Adjustment Loan operation to accelerate the increase in the retirement age and to start the
equalization of the retirement age for men and women starting with July 1, 2005. We will not
decide on any new pension “recorrelation” after completing the current “recorrelation” by
mid-2004 without prior consultations with Fund and World Bank staff.

- 69 -

ATTACHMENT

17.
We will step up the fight against expenditure arrears of the budget. We will
ensure that the local authorities do not incur arrears, including with respect to subsidies to
district heating companies. Moreover, the unpaid amount of the arrears to health sector
suppliers accumulated in 2002, identified in protocols agreed with the supplier organizations
in amount of lei 3,644 billion, will be repaid by end-September 2004 (structural performance
criterion). To avoid the recurrence of arrears, we have approved in February 2004 legislation
strengthening the procurement legislation for medical supplies. Based on World Bank
recommendations to improve the efficiency of the hospital system, we will approve by
end-June 2004 a strategy for the short-, medium-, and long-term rationalization of the entire
health sector.
18.
We will move decisively against large tax nonpayers and tax evasion. In addition
to our efforts to ensure full tax payment by SOEs, we will vigorously address the issue of
private sector arrears to the budget. In 2002–03, the largest private sector arrears to the
general government were accumulated by three refineries. Bankruptcy procedures against
one of these companies were initiated on January 22, 2004. As a prior action, on March 31,
2004 the Ministry of Finance initiated bankruptcy against the second largest refinery.
Subsequently, the Ministry initiated bankruptcy procedures against 4 other private companies
with the largest flow of arrears to the budget, as well as a large number of other companies.
The largest private refinery has improved its tax compliance after the rescheduling of its
stock of arrears. However, we will revoke the rescheduling if the company fails to pay taxes
and service the rescheduled stock of arrears on time and in full. Reduction in arrears of the
452 largest private debtors to the state budget and the social security funds will be a
quantitative performance criterion under the program (TMU, section V), while the reduction
in SOE arrears to the general government will be an indicative target (TMU, section VI).
Moreover, we will continue posting a list of the top 549 debtors to the state budget on the
internet and update this list every quarter, while also including, as of January 1, 2004, arrears
to the four social security funds (updated monthly data will be shared with Fund staff). We
will step up the fight against tax evasion. For this purpose, we will approve by end-June 2004
a comprehensive plan to (a) eliminate the illegal trade in petroleum products and cigarettes,
areas where corruption is perceived to be pervasive; and (b) to fight corruption in the
customs administration. This plan will be prepared in close consultation with business
associations and other stakeholders. In addition, we will request technical assistance from the
Fund to review by end-June 2004 the legislation on prevention, discovery, control, and
sanction of tax fraud. Moreover, decisions by the Competition Council on state aid, including
on tax arrears rescheduling, will be made public on the internet together with the explanation.
19.
In financing the 2004 budget deficit, we will give priority to domestic borrowing,
to limit supply pressures for private sector credit. Taking into account large expected
privatization receipts from abroad, we will limit our Eurobond issuance to not more than
€600 million in 2004, €425 million of which will not be spent in the current year (the number
is subject to revision in the first review). Domestic financing will aim at extending the
maturity of lei-denominated securities.

- 70 -

ATTACHMENT

20.
We will contain the issuance of all external off-budget guarantees in 2004 to
2.3 percent of GDP (US$1.5 billion) compared to 2.2 percent in 2003, to ensure that the
target for the overall fiscal stance of the broad public sector is met. The ceiling will
apply to off-budget guarantees for fuels, loans from multilateral and official creditors, and
other off-budget guarantees. Within the ceiling, we will give priority to projects for
modernizing the energy and railway sectors. We will limit the issuance of domestic
guarantees to a maximum of the lei equivalent of €20 million (excluding guarantees for
bridge loans to local authorities for temporary financing of projects under the SAPARD 21
program), with guarantees limited to cases approved by the Competition Council. In addition,
by end-September 2004, we will amend Emergency Ordinance 146/2002 (approved by
Law 201/2003) to preclude any further loans from the treasury to state-owned enterprises.
C. Wage Policy
21.
To protect the competitiveness of our economy, we only modestly increased the
minimum wage in 2004. We approved a government decision, stipulating an increase of
12 percent in the statutory minimum wage on January 1, 2004, to lei 2.8 million, a level that
will remain unchanged until end-2004 (continuous structural PC). All government officials
attending the negotiations on the national collective contract will seek to ensure that the
minimum wage in this contract does not significantly deviate from the statutory minimum
wage. Moreover, the government will instruct the representatives of the state-owned
companies (a) not to accept a minimum wage different from the statutory minimum wage;
and (b) to request the employers associations which they are affiliated with to refuse
accepting any such deviation. The government will also ensure that such a national contract
or other collective contracts will in no way affect the SOEs wage program stipulated in the
following paragraph, while it will use persuasion to moderate wage settlements in the private
sector. The appropriate minimum wage increase in 2005 will be discussed with Fund staff in
the context of the first review of the program.
22.
Our SOE wage policy in 2004 aims at improving the financial performance of
72 large monitored companies by about ½ percent of GDP. To ensure prudent wage
policy in the SOE sector, we will rectify the budgets of the monitored companies by
end-April, 2004, limiting the wage bill growth to 7 percent (prior action). With the scheduled
reduction of employment by 19,000 positions, this implies an average gross wage growth of
about 11 percent in nominal terms, below the projected average inflation. To strengthen the
credibility of our wage bill target, the ministries will block payments equivalent to 4 percent
of the quarterly wage bill in monitored SOEs until the last month of the quarter and will
release it only after it has become clear that the respective target will be reached.
D. Energy Sector Reforms
23.
To reduce our growing dependency on gas imports, we will continue increasing
domestic producer prices with a view to reaching import parity level by January 2007.
On March 15, we announced a schedule for gas price increases (prior action). For 2004, the
schedule specified that the end-user gas prices would be increased every quarter by 5 percent

- 71 -

ATTACHMENT

in lei terms (prior action for April 1 and July 1, structural PCs thereafter). For 2005–2007 the
schedule specified the producer price for the regulated market, as envisaged in the ordinance
approved on December 18, 2003. While under the current system domestic producers
effectively receive the residual after the variable import costs of imports are covered (in
addition to the costs of transport, storage, and distribution), under the new system the gas
distributors and end-users will have to absorb variable import costs and the gradual increase
in producer prices to import parity. The first yearly increase of the end-user regulated price
according to the new pricing system will be effective as of January 1, 2005, when domestic
producer prices for the regulated market will be increased by at least US$25/tcm, starting
from the estimated 2004 level of US$60/tcm (structural PC; the exchange rate used for
converting the U.S. dollar increase into lei prices is specified in the TMU, section VII). The
following adjustment of the same size will be effective as of January 1, 2006.
24.
We will continue adjusting the electricity and heating prices to cost recovery
levels. End-user and Termoelectrica electricity and heating prices will be adjusted to costrecovery levels (including return on capital for distribution companies) every semester on
January 1 and July 1 (a prior action for July 1, 2004 and structural performance criteria
thereafter). The regulatory agency will produce reports on these adjustments and share them
with the staff (continuous structural benchmark). Moreover, in cooperation with the World
Bank, in March 2004 we reviewed the structure of electricity prices, which has confirmed
that the final-user distribution prices are consistent with the full payment to producers and
will fully cover the distributors’ margins once the Bank’s proposal for the July 2004 price
adjustment is implemented. The World Bank has also reviewed the electricity producer price
for thermo-producers, concluded that they are at an appropriate level, and recommended that
the government approve a plan to deal with the thermo-producers’ high-cost units (“stranded
assets”). The Bank has also recommended that the July 1, 2004 adjustment include a margin
required to provide a return on capital at least equal to the cost of debt in the distribution
sector, which is an important step for the commercialization and privatization of distribution
companies. We will implement these recommendations, which will require a final-user price
adjustment of about 6–7 percent. In the context of the first review, we will discuss with staff
further steps in energy sector reform, including the elimination of the uniform retail tariff
policy allowing the end-user price differentiation across regions, the elimination of the
national development tax, and the steps for increasing hydro-power producer prices with a
view to fully liberalizing the market by 2007.
25.
We will approve a reform strategy for the district heating system in close
cooperation with the World Bank (prior action). This strategy will envisage a switch to
heating contracts or conventions with individual households, the installation of thermostatic
valves and heat meters, and the introduction of a split-tariff structure. In addition, we will
review social assistance for households and modify it if necessary. A timetable for
introducing these measures was prepared in April 2004. We will approve an Emergency
Ordinance by June 10, 2004, terminating all subsidies and delivery of fuel by state-owned
companies to 15 inefficient heating plants (prior action) and we are committed not to resume
such subsidies or deliveries, and hence encourage the local administrations to stop production
and decide on the closure of the plants. By end-June, we will ensure that, for each of these

- 72 -

ATTACHMENT

plants, either the local administration has taken such a decision, or bankruptcy procedures
have been started by the government (in case of debts to the budget) or by a state-owned fuel
supplier (in case of debts to the fuel suppliers) (prior action). We will share the documents
proving that these decisions were made with the Fund and World Bank staff. In addition, we
together with the local administrations will take the necessary measures to assist the few
remaining connected households to switch to individual heating systems. Termoelectrica’s
producer heating price will be raised by 12 percent as of July 1, 2004. The National
Reference Price for heating will be raised by 12 percent as of August 1, 2004 (structural PC).
The respective Government Decision will be approved by mid-July 2004. By end-September,
we will prepare an analysis outlining the necessary steps for the elimination of the current
system of producer subsidies by enhancing the existing targeted household support for
heating and thus abolishing the National Reference Price.
26.
We will continue our efforts to eliminate the nonpayment of electricity and gas
bills by strict enforcement of the disconnection deadlines for electricity and gas
payments. However, in 2004, the budget will continue to assume payments of energy bills
for a few large loss-makers (the list of eligible SOEs will be approved through a Government
Decision by end-July 2004), the disconnection of which would be socially disruptive. We
will also intensify our efforts to improve collections from households. For that purpose, we
will enforce seizure of assets of nonpayers through the judiciary system, as specified in
Government Ordinance 85/2001 and Government Decision 400/2003. The largest industrial
nonpayers to the four utilities will stay disconnected or on minimum supply until full
payments for all bills from December 2002 onwards have been received by the utilities,
while the bills for companies on minimum supply will be paid by the government
(continuous structural benchmark).
E. Privatization, Liquidation, and Restructuring
27.
The successful privatization of Petrom is our highest priority. We have eliminated
some restrictions and uncertainties that could have adversely affected the success of the
privatization. Specifically, as a prior action in March 2004, we decided that: (a) the entire
amount of arrears to the general consolidated budget in litigation would be cancelled at the
time of the share transfer; (b) the government would assume responsibility for environmental
indemnities; and (c) there would not be any penalties for post-privatization deviations from
employment levels included in the investors’ business plan. Moreover, we subsequently
clarified, by a letter to short-listed investors, that the government would assume
environmental liabilities associated with abandoned wells, and limit restrictions on the
restructuring of the company, including the sale of core assets, to at most four years, while
also indicating that we would agree with the divestment of one refinery and the
petrochemical complex even before that deadline. As indicated in paragraph 23, the schedule
for gas price adjustments was announced on March 15, 2004. All these decisions have
increased the value of the company and created conditions for successful privatization.
28.
We aim to achieve substantial progress in the privatization of utilities, building
on recommendations from the World Bank. In close consultation with the World Bank,

- 73 -

ATTACHMENT

we will accelerate preparations for the privatization of the two gas distributors by inviting
binding bids by July 20, 2004 (prior action). We have received one binding offer for the
privatization of two electricity distribution companies in March, for which negotiations are
ongoing. We will not offer special tax incentives to investors or preferential treatment in
subsequent privatizations. If this fails, we will either re-launch the privatization for these two
companies, or select two others for privatization in 2004, in addition to the two in the
pipeline. By end-September 2004, we will prepare a privatization strategy for ElectricaMuntenia Sud, with the aim of inviting binding offers by end-March 2005. We will start
discussions with the World Bank on the privatization of Romgaz, and power generators
Rovinari and Turceni.
29.
We will either privatize or liquidate the remaining 19 large SOEs under AVAS
by end-September 2004. In addition to the company already privatized in Q1 of 2004, we
initiated bankruptcy for five large SOEs (companies with more than 1,000 employees),
including Republica, CUG and Turnu (prior action). Thereafter, we will either privatize or
liquidate six such companies in Q2 and another six in Q3 (structural benchmarks), leaving
two for Q4 of 2004. To improve the prospects for successful privatization, we implemented
an employment reduction program and eliminated 15,000 positions in March, including
2,600 layoffs in Roman (prior action). Moreover, as part of the approved 2004 wage program
a wage-freeze will be imposed in all companies under AVAS that incurred losses (after
taxes) in 2003 (prior action); those that have not incurred losses can benefit from a wage
increase by up to 9 percent. For companies with particularly weak financial results, in March
the Privatization Agency and the shareholder meetings decided on the voluntary liquidation
of 15 unviable SOEs (including Republica, CUG, and Turnu) and is now appointing
liquidators. We will also establish quarterly targets for the privatization or liquidation of
smaller companies.
30.
On the privatization of Roman, we are determined to prevent any parts of the
company from returning to state ownership. As part of the privatization deal, 2,600
layoffs in the remaining units of Roman were implemented by April 15, 2004 (prior action).
Should any parts not pay energy bills and taxes on time, we will immediately start
foreclosure proceedings (continuous structural benchmark).
31.
We will review the privatization of the National Tobacco Company. We
concluded a contract with an internationally reputable accounting firm to carry out due
diligence of the privatization contract, which will be finalized by end-June. We will re-tender
the National Tobacco Company by end-June 2004 if the tender process is found to have been
deficient.
32.
Our efforts to restructure the railway sector will continue. Following the large
layoffs and the privatization of 21 subsidiaries in the second half of 2003, we intend to close
by end-June 2004 about 3,000 km of loss-making secondary lines (26 percent of the total
network), if the respective segments are not taken over by investors in the form of concession
contracts by June 15, 2004. We passed the corresponding government decision in January
2004. For the segments under subconcession contracts, we will not impose on the investors’

- 74 -

ATTACHMENT

obligations to maintain employment. Employees that are not taken over by the investors will
be laid off by CFR by the date of the effectiveness of the concession contract but no later
than end-June 2004. We will continue with reducing employment in the railway companies
by 8,000 employees in January–September 2004. To improve the financial performance of
railways, we raised the price of passengers’ tickets by 6.3 percent on February 15 and will
raise it by another 6 percent on July 15, 2004. We also increased the freight tariffs by
10 percent on March 1 and will raise it by another 10 percent on July 1, 2004. By July 1,
2004 we will complete the outsourcing of the CFR messenger service to a private company,
which is expected to result in savings of about lei 200 billion. The 2004 budgets of the
railway companies will be rectified to ensure that the remaining operating losses, as well as
obligations to the utilities and the general government budget, are fully covered by the
allotted budgetary subsidies. The railway companies will also continue with the privatization
of four subsidiaries and the divestment of non-core assets.
33.
We will implement an ambitious restructuring plan in the mining sector. We
approved and published on May 28, 2004 a strategy for restructuring the mining sector in
2004–10, which was formulated in cooperation with the World Bank and in line with EU
guidelines for environmental protection (prior action). The strategy set out detailed schedules
for the mines to be privatized or closed, necessary employment reduction for each mine, as
well as programs to address the social problems of the regions affected. It also includes the
action plan and for 2004, with employment reduction plans and the list of mines to be closed,
and a decision on 30 mines to be closed by June 30, 2004. In line with the strategy, 4,000
mining sector employees were made redundant by end-June 2004 (prior action), and another
4,000 will be made redundant by September 30, 2004 (structural PC). The 2004 budgets of
the mining companies will be rectified to ensure that the remaining operating losses, as well
as obligations to the utilities and the general government budget, are fully covered by the
allotted budgetary subsidies.
34.
As part of our plans to improve the overall efficiency of our medium-term
expenditure plans for motorways, we are working with the World Bank to assess the
overall affordability of the program. Prior to the finalization of motorway contracts
currently under negotiation, we will seek the World Bank assistance on the following
matters:
•

A report of an advisor, financed by the World Bank, assessing the unit prices and
financial arrangements associated with the Bors-Brasov motorway project;

•

We asked the World Bank to prepare by end-July 2004, in consultation with the
EBRD, a study assessing the priorities and the best routing of motorway
construction. This study will also address the overall affordability and risk sharing
associated with the PPP projects planned for the Brasov-Bucharest motorway, and
the options for their re-tendering;

•

A review, prepared in consultation with EC and other stakeholders, of the
implementation of the procurement legislation, including the relevant norms, used

- 75 -

ATTACHMENT

for awarding large infrastructure projects and guidelines for awarding such
contracts in the future.
•

Following the preparation of the above reports, we will consult with Fund staff on
the fiscal sustainability of the overall motorway program, including possible
re-tendering, rerouting and phasing of the motorway program, before proceeding
with the finalization of the existing projects under preparation.

•

We will limit expenditures for motorway construction (including expenditures
under PPP contracts, the Bechtel project, and projects financed with off-budget
guarantees) to €260 million in 2004.

35.
Our efforts to complete the privatization in the banking sector will continue. In
April, we decided the timetable for the privatization of CEC, the State Savings Bank, with a
view to complete it in 2005. Furthermore, we will announce a tender for a privatization
advisor for the bank by end-May 2004. We will also finalize settlement for the EBRD’s and
the IFC’s purchase of a share package in BCR by end-June, 2004 (prior action).
36.
We will implement several measures to fully improve transparency and
accountability in the enterprise sector: (i) the government will decide by end-March 2004
(prior action) that all the 72 monitored SOEs publish on the websites of the responsible lineministries their independently audited annual earnings statements, starting with the accounts
for 2003; in the same vein, we will also publish their (unaudited) quarterly financial results
on these websites; (ii) we will continue publishing on the internet regularly reports on state
aid, including subsidies in the form of arrears; and (iii) the internationally accepted
accounting standards will be fully mandatory for all economic agents above a certain size in
2005.
F. Monetary Policy and Banking Issues
37.
The NBR will continue to focus on lowering inflation to single digits while
managing monetary policy’s transition to a new framework. The new NBR Law, to be
passed by end-June 2004 (prior action), will ensure the independence of the NBR in
accordance with the relevant EU acquis, as well as make price stability the Bank’s primary
monetary policy objective. This, together with our advances in forecasting inflation and
elaborating transparency and accountability procedures, will provide the necessary legal,
technical and institutional prerequisites for a gradual implementation of inflation targeting.
The new regime will take into account that the exchange rate pass-through to prices still
dominates interest rate changes in determining inflation developments.. With inflation firmly
stabilizing in single digits and transmission from policy to market interest rates improving
over time, the onus of policy action will gradually shift toward the interest rate.
38.
In 2004, monetary policy will continue to apply the current framework. The NBR
will continue to guide the exchange rate along a path consistent with the inflation objective
and modest real appreciation against the new 75/25 euro/U.S. dollar basket, in line with the

- 76 -

ATTACHMENT

estimated Balassa-Samuelson effect. This policy combines substantial short-term exchange
rate flexibility with inflation-stabilizing guidance over a longer horizon. Tight fiscal and
wage policy, as outlined above, will facilitate improvement in the external current account,
allowing the NBR to focus on disinflation. We will begin to gradually lower the policy
interest rate after we are assured that disinflation and the current account are firmly on track.
We will continue with the liberalization of non-resident leu deposits with local banks when
the interest rate differential between domestic and world markets would not create
opportunities for large and potentially destabilizing inflows.
39.
The NBR will continue to monitor credit growth and implement decisive
measures to contain it as needed for both macroeconomic and prudential reasons.
Should the rapid credit growth not subside following the eligibility-tightening measures
introduced in February, we will introduce mandatory reporting by banks and non-banks to
the newly established credit bureau and consider further measures to contain credit growth,
including by increasing the reserve requirements for sources of financing denominated in
foreign currencies. As of September 1, 2004, the NBR’s credit bureau will expand its data
base on delinquent loans with loans below lei 200 million, not monitored hitherto. As
insurance companies have insured more than half of banks’ household credit portfolio, the
insurance supervisory commission will monitor insurers’ pricing and re-insurance of that
risk. Furthermore, for consumer protection we will adopt a law requiring truthful disclosure
of lending terms and risks by all suppliers of consumer credit.
G. Governance Issues, Business Climate, and Labor Market
40.
Our efforts to strengthen public administration, eliminate corruption and
improve the business climate will continue in close cooperation with the EU and the
World Bank.
41.
We are intensifying our efforts to improve the functioning of the judiciary. By
June 30, 2004 we will obtain parliamentary approval of laws on judicial organization, on the
statute of magistrates, and on the Superior Council of the Magistracy (SCM) as a single,
coherent package (prior action) after full consultation with the EU Commission, the World
Bank, and local stakeholders. The new laws will strengthen the role of the Superior Council
of the Magistracy as guarantor of the independence of the judiciary. In particular, the new
laws will establish the full authority of the Council with respect to the recruitment, training,
and professional careers of judges and render decisions in disciplinary actions in the judiciary
(most of these powers have so far been vested with the Ministry of Justice). Having
eliminated the extraordinary appeal procedure by the Attorney General for civil cases, we
submitted to parliament on April 1, 2004 legislation to eliminate it for all other cases (prior
action). We will ensure approval of this legislation by July 20, 2004 (structural performance
criterion). Moreover, in consultation with the World Bank, we will review the issue of
excessive length of court procedures in civil and commercial cases, particularly in restitution
and bankruptcy cases, and decide by October 1, 2004 on the establishment of a monitoring
system according to the law.

- 77 -

ATTACHMENT

42.
In consultation with the World Bank we have strengthened the legislation on the
declaration of assets by government and parliamentary officials and near relatives (in
particular, valuation and disclosure requirements). The new legislation improves the
transparency of the asset declaration form, includes some itemization of assets, expands
coverage of the declaration to candidates running for office, and lowers reporting thresholds.
The legislation was approved in May, 2004 (prior action). Furthermore, we will explore the
option of establishing special offices in each ministry responsible for checking the
declaration of assets of all persons involved in the decision-making process and reach a
decision by end-June 2004.
43.
We will provide additional resources for the National Prosecutor's AntiCorruption Office (ANC) in 2004. In particular, we will increase the number of
ANC-prosecutors (currently 95) by about 50 percent. The ANC will give a higher priority to
the investigation and prosecution of grand corruption. Moreover, we will approve by endJanuary 2005 legislation amending Article 24, paragraph 2, of the Law on Ministerial
Responsibilities (Law 115/1999), which granted immunity also to former members of the
government.
44.
In cooperation with the World Bank, we will evaluate the impact of the new
Labor Code on the labor market and employment and amend it accordingly with a view
to preserving labor market flexibility. The comprehensive overhaul of the labor code in
early 2005 will address concerns of the stakeholders, among which is the concern about the
wage guarantee fund, regulations on hiring and firing, and red tape The overhaul of the code
will be agreed upon with the World Bank within the framework of the EU acquis, and be
submitted to parliament by end-March 2005. The corresponding PC will be set at the time of
the second or third review under the program.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
45.
The program will be monitored on the basis of the performance criteria and
indicative targets as described below. The program will be reviewed by the IMF on a
quarterly basis during the period of the SBA (June 2004–June 2006). In addition to the main
financial performance indicators, the reviews will be devoted to assessing progress in
implementing the structural elements of the program, in particular, those regarding energy
price adjustments, wage discipline, the reduction in arrears, and steps to privatize the
remaining large SOEs, including Petrom. Agreements on the 2005 and 2006 general
government budget, minimum wage decisions and SOEs’ wage and employment program
will be conditions for completing a review.
46.
The quantitative performance criteria are as follows: (i) quarterly ceilings on the
net domestic assets of the NBR; (ii) quarterly floors on the net foreign assets of the NBR;
(iii) quarterly ceilings on the deficit of the consolidated general government; (iv) quarterly
ceilings on the cumulative nominal wage bill in the monitored state-owned enterprises;
(v) quarterly floors on collection rates of four utilities; (vi) quarterly ceilings on domestic

- 78 -

ATTACHMENT

guarantees by the general government under public debt law and other laws, excluding export
promotion guarantees; (vii) quarterly ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing by the
government of nonconcessional external debt; (viii) quarterly ceilings on the arrears of the
452 largest private debtors to the state budget and the four social security funds, and (ix) a
continuous performance criterion of no accumulation of external payments arrears will also
apply.
47.
The indicative targets under the program are as follows: (i) quarterly ceilings on
the total financing of the public sector; (ii) quarterly ceilings on arrears of monitored stateowned enterprises to the consolidated general government; (iii) quarterly ceilings on the
exposure of commercial banks to SOEs; (iv) quarterly floors on collection rates for electricity
and heating for Termoelectrica and its externalized units; and (v) separate quarterly floors on
the collection rates of the gas distributors Distrigaz Nord and Distrigaz Sud. The second
review will explore the feasibility of converting the ceiling on the total financing of the
public sector into a performance criterion.
48.
All quantitative performance criteria are specified in Table 1; the list of prior actions,
structural performance criteria, and benchmarks are specified in Table 2. The main
definitions appear in the TMU.

I. CEILINGS ON THE AVERAGE NET DOMESTIC ASSETS OF
THE NATIONAL BANK OF ROMANIA
The average net domestic assets of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) for the indicated
month are defined as the difference between average reserve money (as defined below) and
average net foreign assets (as defined in Section II of this attachment), both expressed in
local currency.
Average reserve money is defined as the sum of average currency in circulation outside the
NBR and average deposits (required plus excess reserves) of the commercial banks at the
NBR for the indicated month. Commercial bank deposits exclude required and excess
reserves in foreign exchange for foreign exchange deposits. Data on reserve money will be
monitored from the daily indicators data of the NBR, which shall be supplied to the IMF
weekly by the NBR. The stock of average reserve money as of March 2004 was lei 111,778
billion.
The reported figures of average reserve money will be adjusted in the following
circumstances:
(1) Should reserve requirements be increased/decreased from 18 percent on all required
reserves held in lei, the reported reserve money figures would be increased/decreased by the
product of the change in the reserve requirements and the programmed deposits for which
required reserves are held in lei. The level of the programmed deposits is lei 242,609 billion
for June 2004, lei 258,598 billion for September 2004 and lei 293,672 for December 2004.
(2) The reported reserve money figures will be lowered by the shortfall in actual reserves
from required reserves for any individual bank, measured from the 24th of the previous month
to the 23rd of the test-date month, as provided for in the relevant NBR regulation.
Average net foreign asset stocks will be converted into lei for the purposes of calculating
average net domestic assets at the average monthly lei/U.S. dollar rates specified in
consultation with Fund staff. The average stock of NFA is defined as the average of the daily
NFA as defined in Section II. The limits will be monitored from daily data on the accounts of
the NBR supplied weekly to the IMF by the NBR. The average NDA as of March 2004 was
lei -122,235 billion.
The ceiling on average net domestic assets of the NBR will be adjusted under the following
circumstances:
(1) Downwards (upwards), prorated for the fraction of the month that gross foreign financing
exceeds (falls short of) programmed levels, specified in Section II, by the lei equivalent of
the said excess (shortfall).
(2) For any change in reserve requirements as described above. Before undertaking any such
changes, the NBR will consult IMF staff.

(3) Upwards (downwards) by the lei equivalent of the decrease (increase) in the stock of
foreign currency denominated Treasury bills (cumulative from end-March 2004).
(4) Downwards by the lei equivalent of the increase in foreign currency receipts from large
privatizations (sale price above $10 million, cumulative from end-March 2004), excluding
proceeds from the sale of BCR, as specified in Section II.
(5) Downwards by the shortfall in actual reserves from required reserves for any individual
bank.
II. TARGETS FOR FLOOR ON NET FOREIGN ASSETS OF
THE NATIONAL BANK OF ROMANIA
Net foreign assets of the NBR consist of reserve assets minus foreign liabilities. For the
purposes of the program, reserve assets shall be defined as monetary gold, holdings of SDRs,
any reserve position in the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange in convertible currencies
by the NBR. Excluded from gross reserves are long-term assets, NBR redeposits at the
commercial banks, any assets in nonconvertible currencies, encumbered reserve assets,
reserve assets pledged as collateral for foreign loans, reserve assets pledged through forward
contracts, and precious metals other than gold. Monetary gold shall be valued at an
accounting price of US$407 per ounce and SDRs at US$1.48597 per SDR. NFA stocks are
measured at the last working day of the respective month.
For the purposes of the program, foreign liabilities shall be defined as loan, deposit, swap
(including any portion of the NBR gold that is collateralized), and forward liabilities of the
NBR in convertible currencies including foreign currency deposits of resident commercial
banks at the NBR; IMF purchases; borrowing from international capital markets; and bridge
loans from the BIS, foreign banks, foreign governments, or other financial institutions,
irrespective of their maturity.
All assets and liabilities denominated in convertible currencies, other than the U.S. dollar,
shall be converted at their respective exchange rates against the U.S. dollar on December 31,
2003. All changes of definition or valuation of assets or liabilities as well as details of
operations concerning sales, purchases, or swap operations of gold shall also be
communicated to the IMF staff.
The NFA of the NBR will be adjusted:

- 86 -

(i)
upwards/downwards by 100 percent of the excess/shortfall of gross foreign financing9
from the programmed levels on a cumulative basis from end-March 2004 as follows:
June 2004
September 2004
December 2004

US$756.87 million
US$756.87 million
US$756.87 million

(ii) by the change in the stock of foreign currency denominated Ministry of Finance
Treasury Bills including those issued for bank restructuring (on a cumulative basis from endMarch 2004. The outstanding stock on March 31, 2004 was US$450.891 million evaluated at
the program exchange rates.
(iii) upwards by the amount of foreign currency receipts from large privatizations (sale
price above $10 million) (cumulative from end-March 2004), excluding proceeds from the
sale of BCR, which are already included in the target.
The end-of-period NFA will be monitored on the basis of the monetary survey. Daily data
will still be used, however, to calculate average NFA. All data is provided by the NBR. The
end-of-period NFA figure was US$7,304 million on March, 2004.
III. CEILINGS ON THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIT OF THE
CONSOLIDATED GENERAL GOVERNMENT
The consolidated general government includes the state budget; the budgets of the local
authorities; the social protection funds;10 the “Special Fund for Modernizing Roads”, the
“Special Fund for the Development of the Energetic System”, the “Special Reinsurance
Fund”, the “Authority for the Sale of State Assets” (AVAS)11, the “Fund for the
Development of Romanian Agriculture”, the “National Administration of Roads (AND)”,
other extra-budgetary funds managed by the Ministry of Public Finance or other Ministries
and agencies outside the budgetary framework; other extra-budgetary operations of ministries
financed by foreign loans; and the counterpart funds created from the proceeds of foreign
loans. Any new funds created during the program period to undertake operations of a fiscal
9

Foreign financing is defined as disbursements of balance of payments support loans to the
government with a maturity of more than a year from multilateral and bilateral creditors and
resources with a maturity of more than one year raised in the international capital markets by
the government. This excludes use of IMF resources.
10
These include the State Social Security Fund, the Insurance Fund for Work-Related
Accidents, the Unemployment Fund, and the Health Social Insurance Fund.
11
AVAS emanated from the merger of the “Privatization Agency” (APAPS) and the “Asset
Recovery Agency” (AVAB) on May 1, 2004. Before this merger, APAPS was a component
of the consolidated general government, while AVAB was not.

- 87 -

ATTACHMENT

nature as defined in the IMF’s Manual on Government Finance Statistics will be
incorporated within the definition of consolidated general government.
Under the program, the deficit of the consolidated general government will be measured
based on (a) revenue and expenditure data provided by the Ministry of Public Finance as well
as (b) on “below the line” financing data, i.e., the sum of domestic and external financing of
the budget as well as privatization proceeds received by all entities of the consolidated
general government and proceeds from the recovery of bank asset and other state assets by
AVAB. All efforts will be made to reconcile the measurement of the deficit from “below”
and from “above the line”. However, should these efforts not succeed in eliminating the
discrepancies, the respectively higher deficit number will be used for program purposes.
For program purposes, net credit of the banking system to the consolidated general
government is defined as all claims of the banking system on the consolidated general
government less all deposits of the consolidated general government with the banking
system. Foreign-currency denominated credit to government outstanding at
December 31, 2003 will be converted in U.S. dollars at the end-December 2003 exchange
rate and from dollars into lei using the rates specified in consultation with Fund staff.
Foreign-currency denominated credit newly issued in 2004 will be valued at the exchange
rates specified in consultation with Fund staff. Government loans to banks at an interest rate
less than the reference rate of the NBR to finance on lending to economic agents are
excluded from government deposits; an agreed listing of the accounts to be treated as
government deposits for program purposes is contained in the FAD aide memoir “Romania:
Measuring the Fiscal Deficit”, Part II, Appendix 11, February 1994.
IV. CEILING ON AGGREGATE WAGE BILL OF
MONITORED STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
The set of 72 state-owned enterprises, whose wages are to be monitored under Emergency
Ordinance 79/2001, is specified in Government Decision 393/2004.
The wage bill targets will be adjusted as follows:
(i) downwards by the amount of savings due to “externalization” (defined as the
spinning off of a unit or its transfer to another entity, or temporary/permanent transfers
of employees when the sum of these transfers exceeds 100 employees per month). In
each month, savings from externalization will be calculated on a company by company
basis as the product of the number of externalized employees so far and the company’s
average gross wage.
(ii) if a company is privatized, downwards by the budgeted wage bill of the privatized
company, starting with the month in which the privatization contract is signed.
The wage bills will be measured on a cumulative basis across the different sectors, on a
monthly basis. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection will undertake the responsibility

- 88 -

ATTACHMENT

of collecting data from the various line ministries (regie autonomes and national companies)
and AVAS (commercial companies), and will report the wage bills and employment figures
for each of the monitored enterprises (including aggregate figures for each ministry and for
the overall total) to the IMF on a monthly basis. Employment reduction resulting from all
forms of outsourcing will be reported in the “externalization” column of the respective tables,
with a footnote, if necessary.
V. CEILING ON THE STOCK OF ARREARS OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISES TO THE STATE
BUDGET AND THE FOUR SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS
The ceiling applies to the outstanding stock of arrears of the set of 452 private companies
(fully private or with state-ownership of less than 50 percent) monitored by the National
Agency for Fiscal Administration (NAFA). These 452 companies are a subset of the 549
companies (private as well as state-owned) with the largest arrears to the state budget and the
four social security funds as of December 31, 2003. Data on the stock of arrears of these 549
companies are published on a quarterly basis on the external website of the Ministry of
Public Finance (with a breakdown into arrears to the state budget and each of the four social
security funds; separately for the stock of arrears including and excluding interest and
penalties). The complete data set is provided to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a
reporting lag of at most 35 calendar days following the end of the respective month. The
performance criterion refers to the stock of arrears excluding interest and penalties. Changes
in the stock of arrears owing to the cancellation of arrears will not be reflected in the data
used for measuring the stock of arrears under the program. Fund staff has to be notified on a
company-by-company basis about all cancellations of arrears within at most 5 business days
following the approval of the cancellation. For changes to the set of monitored companies,
the targets will be adjusted downwards/upwards by the amount of arrears of the companies
removed/added to the set. In particular, in the case of the privatization of a fully state-owned
company or a majority state-owned company on the above-referenced list of the 549
companies, the respective company will be added to the list of private companies (for the
base date as well as for future test dates) to which the performance criterion applies. These
companies will be added to the list in the moment of the final and binding signature of the
privatization contract. In the case of the initiation of bankruptcy procedures against a
company on the above-referenced list of 452 companies, the respective company will be
removed from the list (for the base date as well as for future test dates) to which the
performance criterion applies. These companies will be removed from the list in the moment
in which the file requesting bankruptcy is submitted to court. The stock of arrears at
end-March 2004 was lei 54,866 billion.

VI. INDICATIVE TARGET FOR CEILINGS ON ARREARS OF MONITORED STATE-OWNED
ENTERPRISES TO THE CONSOLIDATED GENERAL GOVERNMENT
The ceiling applies to the outstanding stock of arrears of the set of 72 monitored state-owned
enterprises, whose arrears are to be monitored under Emergency Ordinance 79/2001 and
Government Decision 393/2004. Under the ordinance, arrears are defined as accounts payable past
the due date stipulated explicitly in the contracts, or if no such explicit date exist, 30 days after
services/products are provided. The reporting on total arrears will have the following subcategories:
to the state budget, to the social security budget; to the local budget; to special funds; and to other
creditors. Arrears to the consolidated general government are defined as the sum of the first four
categories. Amounts reflecting tax arrears exclusive of penalties will be reported separately. For
arrears which have been rescheduled/canceled, the rescheduled/canceled amounts (including
penalties) will not be counted as arrears reduction, and has to be reported. The report will include a
breakdown of arrears to the ten largest creditors for each company. The report will also include data
on overdue claims of each of the monitored companies, as reported under Emergency Ordinance
79/2001 and Government Decision 393/2004. For changes to the set of monitored companies owing
to privatization or the initiation of bankruptcy procedures, the targets will be adjusted
downwards/upwards by the amount of arrears of the companies removed/added to the set. Data for
monitoring purposes shall be supplied monthly to Fund staff by the Ministry of Public Finance by at
most 35 calendar days after the end of the respective month. The stock of arrears at end-March 2004
was lei 42,262 billion.
VII. FLOORS ON CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE COLLECTION RATES OF DISTRIGAZ SUD,
DISTRIGAZ NORD, TERMOELECTRICA AND ELECTRICA
Floors will be set on the cumulative collection rates of the following companies:
•

the combined rate (performance criterion) of Distrigaz Nord and Distrigaz Sud
(indicative targets on the individual company collection rates);

•

on the combined collection rate for heating and electricity of Termoelectrica, including
the production units externalized to local authorities (performance criterion). Indicative
targets will be set on the collection rates for (i) electricity for both Termoelectrica and
the production units externalized to local authorities; (ii) Termoelectrica’s district
heating; (iii) heating in the externalized units;

•

on Electrica’s collection rate (performance criterion).

The floors on collection rates are defined as follows:

- 90 -

ATTACHMENT

(i) Termoelectrica and local authority units (Heating sector), Distrigaz Nord and Sud:
Heating and gas bills are lagged by one month. Definition of 12-month moving collection
rate c(m) for the month m=1,2..12.:
c(m) =
sum(heating collections(m):heating collections(m-12) divided by
sum(heating bills(m-1):heating bills(m-13)).
(ii) Termoelectrica and local authority units (Electricity sector); Electrica; Definition of
12-month moving collection rate c(m) for the month m=1,2..12:
c(m) =
sum(electricity collections(m):electricity collections(m-12) divided by
sum(electricity bills(m):electricity bills(m-12)).
Using these definitions, the collection rate of Termoelectrica including the externalized units
at end-December 2003 was 87.9, of Electrica 98.1, and of the two gas companies 98.8.
Data for these companies will be collected by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce and
reported to the IMF on a monthly basis. Revenue resulting from obtaining shares through
debt-equity swaps will be excluded from collections, unless the shares are sold for cash. The
Ministry of Economy and Commerce will include in this report data on billings and
collections registered by Distrigaz Nord, Distrigaz Sud, Electrica and Termoelectrica, as well
as information on possible dis- and reconnections for the following industrial (a) and heating
(b) companies.
a) SC Siderurgica, COS Targoviste, Minvest SM-Rosia Poieni, Moldomin, Minvest-SM,
Balan, Snif, SC Industria Sarmei, Gavazzi Steel, Minvest-SM Baia de Aries, SC Turnu, CUG

Termo Craiova, Ram Buzau, RA Termo Brasov, Aquaterm Tg. Jiu, Aquaterm 98 Pitesti.
Also, to monitor actual payments in the electricity sector, the Ministry of Economy and
Commerce will include in these reports the following tables on monthly payments.
a) a table containing amounts billed to Electrica by power generators, paid by Electrica to
power generators, and the payment rate (i.e. the second column divided by the first column).

- 91 -

ATTACHMENT

The table will contain a separate line for amounts billed and collected related to the
developments tax and hence amounts billed an collected by Electrica itself should exclude
the development tax.
b) Four collection rate tables from Termoelectrica containing amounts billed to and received
from electricity distribution companies. Table one contains the total amounts billed and
received, table two contains amounts billed and received from Electrica, table three contains
amounts billed and received from Hidroelectrica, and table four contains amounts billed and
received from other TE customers. Hence the amounts in tables 2–4 should add up to the
amounts in table 1. Each table should be split up according to the amounts billed and
received by the various Termolectrica plants, i.e. Termoelectrica-core, Rovinari, Turnceni,
Craiova, Deva.
For the period January 2004–April 2004, these tables will be compiled retrospecitively. From
April 2004 onwards, these tables will be included in the monthly reports on collection rates.
The exchange rate (ROL per USD) used to calculate the annual producer gas price increase
of at least $25/tcm (LoI paragraph 23) per January 1 of each of the years 2005–2007, will not
be lower than the average exchange rate in the month of November preceding the date of the
increase.
VIII. CEILING ON THE ASSUMPTION OF ENTERPRISE DEBT TO BANKS
BY THE CONSOLIDATED GENERAL GOVERNMENT AND ON THE ISSUANCE OF DOMESTIC
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES ON BANK LENDING TO ENTERPRISES
The ceiling applies to the cumulative stock from end-March 2004 of newly guaranteed or
assumed domestic debt by the consolidated general government. For program purposes, the
assumption of enterprise debt to banks by the consolidated general government and the
issuing of a guarantee to assume enterprise debt to banks are treated as being equivalent. This
limit includes any loan on which the government pays or guarantees interest, even if the
principal is not guaranteed. The consolidated general government is defined in Section III of
this attachment. The criterion also applies to the use of AVAS resources for recapitalizing
enterprises or as collateral for bank loans. Foreign currency denominated loans will be
converted at accounting exchange rates specified in consultation with Fund staff.
This ceiling excludes:
•

the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt, for which separate limits are set out in
Section IX of this attachment;

•

debt transferred in the process of bank restructuring, privatization or liquidation of stateowned enterprises; and

- 92 -

•

ATTACHMENT

the assumption of debt as a result of an activation of a guarantee or collateral.

Data for monitoring purposes shall be supplied monthly to the IMF by the Ministry of
Finance. The stock of guarantees and debt assumed as described in this section was lei
746 billion as of end-March 2004.
IX. CEILINGS ON CONTRACTING OR GUARANTEEING OF EXTERNAL DEBT
The ceilings apply to the cumulative flow since the beginning of each year of newly
contracted or guaranteed external debt by the consolidated general government. The
consolidated general government is defined in Section III of this attachment. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the IMF
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign debt adopted on August 24,
2000 (Executive Board Decision No. 12274–(00/85)) but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The ceilings also apply to any assumption
of loans for debt outstanding which were not previously contracted or guaranteed by the
consolidated general government. Excluded from the ceilings are liabilities to the IMF and
bridge loans from the BIS, foreign banks, foreign governments, or any other financial
institution. Debt falling within the ceilings shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective. Loans considered
concessional are also excluded from the ceilings. Off-budget debt includes all debt to nonbudget entities from private sector creditors guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance. Loans for
fuel imports for Distrigaz, Romgaz, Termoelectrica, and the 23 heat-producing units which
were transferred from Termoelectrica to local authorities, and any further units externalized
during the program, are included in the overall ceilings, and the appropriate off-budget
guaranteed debt ceilings.
Concessional loans are defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent of the
value of the loan, using currency-specific discount rates based on the commercial interest
reference rates reported by the OECD (CIRRS) in effect at the time of contracting or
guaranteeing the loan.
The ceiling on contracting and guaranteeing external debt with maturity over one year
includes an Eurobond in the amount of €600 million (see paragraph 19 of the MEFP). In case
an Eurobond is not issued or is issued for a smaller amount, the ceiling will be adjusted
downwards by 100 percent of the shortfall on a cumulative basis from end-March 2004 as
follows:
June 2004
September 2004
December 2004

US$ 0 million
US$780 million
US$780 million

For the purposes of this adjustor only, an exchange rate of US$1.3/€1 will be used.

- 93 -

ATTACHMENT

The ceilings shall be monitored from data supplied monthly to the IMF by the Ministry of
Finance. The accumulated since January 1 flow of contracted or guaranteed debt at endMarch 2004 was US$157 million for maturities over one year (US$1 million of which was
off-budget), US$1 million for the subceiling of debt with maturity of one to three years (all
of which was off-budget), zero for debt with less than one year maturity.
Nonaccumulation of external payments arrears of the government will be a performance
criterion monitored on a continuous basis. For program purposes, arrears with respect to
called-up sovereign loan guarantees are defined as external payments overdue more than
30 days.
X. INDICATIVE TARGETS FOR CEILINGS ON BROAD MONEY
Broad money is defined as the liabilities of the banking system with the non-bank public.
Broad money includes foreign currency deposits of residents, but excludes government
deposits and deposits of foreign monetary institutions and other non-residents. For the
purposes of the program, deposits which are denominated in foreign currency will be
converted into lei at the accounting exchange rates specified in consultation with Fund staff.
Data on broad money will be monitored from the monthly monetary survey data, which shall
be supplied to the IMF monthly by the NBR. The stock of broad money was lei 481,460
billion as of March 31, 2004.
XI. INDICATIVE TARGETS FOR CEILINGS ON BANKING SECTOR’S TOTAL
EXPOSURE TO STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
Total exposure covers all loans, advances, holdings of debt and off-balance sheet exposure of
resident banks to state-owned enterprises. Data on loans will also be reported separately from
total exposure. State-owned enterprises are all regie autonomes, national and commercial
companies with majority ownership by the general government, as defined in Section III of
this attachment. For the purposes of monitoring, foreign currency denominated debt will be
converted in lei at end-month leu/U.S. dollar exchange rates specified in consultation with
Fund staff. Foreign currency denominated credit in convertible currencies, other than the
U.S. dollar, shall be converted at their respective exchange rates against the U.S. dollar as
specified in Section II. Data on banking sector lending to state-owned enterprises will be
monitored from monthly data provided by the NBR.
The amount of total exposure, as reported by the NBR, will include (on a cumulative basis
from end-March 2004):
(i) exposure to companies where the majority ownership shifted to the private sector. For
this purpose, AVAS and the relevant ministries will provide a monthly update of their
portfolio to the NBR;

- 94 -

(ii)

ATTACHMENT

any amount of debt or off-balance sheet write-offs; and

(iii) any assumption of debt or off-balance sheet items by the general government or other
public bodies.
Additionally, the NBR will report monthly on total exposure of the banking system to stateowned enterprises with outstanding exposure over lei 100 billion, on a company-by-company
basis. The stock of banking sector exposure to state-owned enterprises at program exchange
rates as of March 31, 2004 was lei 49,260 billion of which lei 17,377 billion was to BCR.
XII. INDICATIVE TARGETS ON THE TOTAL PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICIT FINANCING
The Public Sector Deficit Financing is monitored on a monthly basis and compiled by the
Ministry of Finance, with data also supplied to the Ministry by the NBR and the National
Securities and Exchange Commission (CNVM). It consists of the financing of the
consolidated general government as defined in Section III and the state-owned enterprises.
The consolidated general government financing consists of net external financing, nonbank financing, and bank financing. Net External Financing comprises sovereign bond and
BOP support loans, on-budget project financing, leasing operations of ministries and local
governments, and T-bills, issued domestically, held by non-residents (computed separately in
lei and foreign exchange). Non-Bank Financing comprises privatization receipts (total
privatization receipts of all components of the general government independent of whether
they are transferred to the treasury), asset recovery (AVAS receipts from asset recovery
transferred to the consolidated general government), municipal bonds (bonds issued by the
municipalities either domestically or internationally, computed as the difference between
issuance and redemptions during the month), and T-bills and bonds held by the non-bank
public (computed separately in lei and foreign exchange). Bank Financing is defined as the
sum of T-bills and bonds in lei held by banks, T-bills and bonds in foreign currencies held by
banks, bank loans in lei and foreign currencies, decrease in government deposits in lei (a
positive number indicates a decline in deposits), and decrease in government deposits in
foreign currencies (a positive number indicates a decline in deposits).
The state owned enterprises financing consists of net external financing, bank financing,
and the accumulation of arrears. Net External Financing comprises of state-guaranteed bills
and bonds (excluding called guarantees and including state-guaranteed fuel imports), bills
and bonds without state guarantee, state-guaranteed loans (excluding called guarantees), and
loans without state guarantee. Bank Financing is defined as the sum of the increase in credit
to SOEs (computed separately in lei and foreign exchange), and decrease in SOEs deposits
(computed separately in lei and foreign exchange; a positive number indicates a decline in
deposits). The accumulation of arrears is defined as increase of arrears to the general
government by the group of 72 large monitored SOEs, excluding interest and penalties as
specified in the law.

- 95 -

ATTACHMENT

The monthly flows of financing are approximated by the following methodologies:
(i) for stocks in lei—change of stocks between the end of the respective months;
(ii) foreign exchange stocks expressed in lei are first converted in U.S. dollar stocks using the
end-month leu/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Then the change in U.S. dollar stocks is converted
in lei by using the monthly average leu/U.S. dollar exchange rate;
(iii) foreign exchange flows expressed in U.S. dollars are converted in lei by using the
monthly average leu/U.S. dollar exchange rate; and
(iv) conversion of stocks and flows in foreign currency other than the U.S. dollar in U.S.
dollars is done according to the convention of the reporting institution (usually, the market
exchange rate either at the time of the transaction or at the end of the month).
The principal providers of data are:
(i) the Ministry of Finance on:
- sovereign bonds and BOP support loans;
- on-budget project financing;
- privatization receipts;
- asset recovery;
- state-guaranteed bills and bonds;
- state-guaranteed loans (excluding called guarantees); and
- the accumulation of SOE arrears to the general government by the group of 72 large
monitored SOEs.
(ii) the NBR on:
- leasing operations of ministries and local governments;
- T-bills, issued domestically, held by non-residents;
- T-bills and bonds held by the non-bank public;
- T-bills and bonds in lei and foreign currencies held by banks;
- T-bills and bonds in foreign currencies held by banks;
- bank loans in lei and foreign currencies, including to the “National Road
Administration” (AND);
- decrease in government deposits in lei and foreign currencies, including deposits of
the “National Road Administration”( AND) ;
- externally issued bills and bonds by SOEs without state guarantee,
- external loans to SOEs without state guarantee;
- domestic bank loans to SOEs; and
- decrease in SOEs deposits with domestic banks.
(iii) the National Securities and Exchange Commission on local government bonds.

This statement summarizes information that has become available since the issuance
of the staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation and Request for Stand-By
Arrangement. The staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2. Recently released macroeconomic data are broadly in line with the agreed program.
•

Industrial production rose 5.2 percent year-on-year in April, compared to 4.2
percent in Q1. This, and the already stronger than expected GDP growth in Q1,
suggests the possibility of an upward revision in GDP growth projection for 2004.

•

The 12-month headline inflation rate fell to 12.3 percent in May, about ½
percentage point below the program projection.

•

The current account deficit for the four months through April reached 1.2 percent
of annual GDP, in line with the annual program target.

•

In May, economy wide net wage growth was relatively high (9 percent in real
terms compared to a year earlier), similar to growth in January-April. However,
real wage growth in the monitored state-owned enterprises is hovering around
zero, in line with the program.

•

The general government budget deficit was contained to 0.5 percent of annual
GDP in January-May, reflecting buoyant revenue performance and expenditure
restraint early in the year.

•

To prevent nominal appreciation, the NBR bought €390 million in June, bringing
total purchases to €1.1 billion in Q2. In response to the lower inflation and the
persistent excess supply on the foreign currency market, the NBR cut its policy
rate by 50 basis points on June 7, to 22.8 percent.

3.
All prior actions have been fully met, except for one, the main objectives of which
was, however, observed. Regarding the permanent closure of 15 inefficient district heating
plants, the mayors of the corresponding districts confirmed that the heating services of all the
plants had been terminated, about half which had already ceased operations in 2003. As the
government incurred legal problems in the rapid liquidation of these plants, it approved a
decree that, in addition to terminating all subsidies to these plants, requested from the local
councils to adopt measures for their permanent closure or reorganization. As the government
is committed not to reinstate the subsidies, without which the plants cannot function, the
objective of the agreed prior action has been achieved. Staff therefore recommends that the
Board approve the program.

On May 25, the authorities eliminated the authority of the prosecutor general to
reopen civil cases after their adjudication by courts (“extraordinary appeal procedure”). (The
World Bank also saw this procedure as undermining the integrity of the judicial process and
the autonomy of the judiciary). The corresponding structural PC under the program has
therefore been met.
5.
FIN completed the safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) on
June 17, 2004. The safeguard framework was found to be considerably improved and
generally adequate. Regarding the remaining weaknesses, the main recommendations were
that (i) the NBR establish a statutory deadline for completing external audits within three to
four months after the end of the financial year; and (ii) strengthen the procedures for
reviewing the compilation of data reported to the Fund under the program. The authorities
have agreed with the recommendations and staff will monitor their implementation in the
context of the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement.

IMF Approves US$367 Million Stand-By Arrangement with Romania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 24-month
Stand-By Arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 250 million (about US$367 million) for
Romania. The Romanian authorities do not intend to make any drawings since they are treating
the arrangement as precautionary.
Romania’s previous Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF for a total amount equivalent to SDR
300 million (about US$440 million) expired on October 15, 2003 (see Press Release No.
03/171). On April 12, 2004, the Executive Board reviewed Romania's experience with Fundsupported programs since the early 1990s, under the new guidelines on assessments of countries
with a longer-term program engagement (see Public Information Notice No. 04/44).
Following the Executive Board discussion, Anne Krueger, First Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“The Romanian authorities are to be commended for their sound macroeconomic policies and
progress in structural reforms, which have contributed to continued disinflation and robust GDP
growth in 2003. The authorities’ program—supported by a new Fund arrangement, which the
authorities intend to treat as precautionary—aims at strengthening the external current account
balance, further reducing inflation, sustaining rapid GDP growth, and preparing the economy for
EU accession. The program emphasizes continued prudent macroeconomic policies and progress
with wide-ranging structural reforms.
“Key stabilization policies are a reduction in the general government budget deficit, a
strengthening of the finances of state-owned enterprises through energy price adjustments and
wage restraint, and measures to contain credit growth. Wage restraint by state-owned companies
and a prudent statutory minimum wage policy will help to keep economy-wide wage growth in
line with productivity growth. The program includes efficiency-enhancing adjustments in fiscal
revenue and expenditure. Further cuts in social security taxes are envisaged, together with
measures to broaden the tax base and improve tax administration. However, the successful VAT
and profit tax reforms would be put at risk by introducing exemptions, which would create new
distortions and undermine tax administration. Prioritization of expenditure will help finance
investment in infrastructure.

-2-

“Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at striking a balance between
reducing inflation and maintaining Romania’s external competitiveness. The authorities are
intensively preparing for the introduction of inflation targeting, and an important step in this
direction was the approval of the new central bank law strengthening the central bank’s
independence. Supervisory procedures and regulation have been strengthened to stem the risks
arising from rapid growth in credit to households, and the authorities stand ready to take further
measures if necessary.
“The authorities are confronting the long-standing issues of tax arrears and nonpayment of utility
bills by large loss-making state-owned enterprises. The largest loss-makers will be downsized,
and employees will be assisted in retraining and relocation. Notable progress has been made in
privatization, with future efforts concentrating on the energy sector. Particularly encouraging is
the authorities’ strong commitment to privatize Petrom, the largest company in the country.
“With the passage of a number of new and amended laws, the authorities have started an
overhaul of the judicial system, which will contribute to improving the business climate,
strengthening the judicial system’s independence, and improve the capacity to address the
problem of corruption,” Ms. Krueger said.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Under the most recent Stand-By Arrangement, macroeconomic imbalances were reduced
through tight fiscal policy, strong measures to improve the financial performance of state-owned
enterprises, and accelerated privatization. Between 2000-03, Romania’s GDP growth averaged
about 4.5 percent and is estimated to reach 5 percent in 2004. The National Bank of Romania
(NBR) gradually reduced the depreciation rate and achieved substantial disinflation, lowering the
annual inflation rate to 12.3 percent in May 2004 from 40 percent in early 2001.
Macroeconomic stabilization, which preserved the competitiveness achieved with the 1999
depreciation, and improved prospects for EU accession created a positive supply response,
strengthening industrial production and exports. In 2003, however, domestic demand
strengthened and the current account deficit widened to almost 5.9 percent of GDP. Fiscal policy
provided continued support for macroeconomic stabilization. The successful value-added tax
(VAT) and profit tax reforms, improvements in tax administration, and savings on interest
payments helped reduce the budget deficit relative to GDP to 2.3 percent in 2003 from
2.6 percent in 2002.
Improved confidence of banks and households, and a lower perception of country risk premium
led to very rapid credit growth of about 55 percent in real terms in 2003. Consumer and
mortgage credit tripled in real terms, albeit from a low base, while corporate credit also remained
strong. However, the tightening of eligibility criteria for consumer and mortgage credit in early
2004 was successful in mitigating credit expansion.
Following a decade of slow privatization, the privatization of large state-owned companies
accelerated in 2003 and 2004, following the implementation of a large-scale employment
reduction program to attract investor interest. Moreover, after several delays, a number of
important privatization projects in the energy sector are now close to completion, including the
privatization of Petrom, the largest company in the country.
Program Summary
The Romanian government aims at strengthening macroeconomic stabilization and structural
reforms in the run-up to EU accession in 2007. The program is designed to address the recent
surge in the current account deficit, rapid credit growth, and the need to bring inflation to single
digits. Fiscal consolidation and measures to contain credit growth will be crucial for containing
domestic demand.
The fiscal stance of the broad public sector (general government and state-owned enterprises)
will be tightened relative to GDP by 1¼ percentage points compared with the 2003 outcome.
Credit growth is expected to slow to about 35 percent in real terms on average, which will help
moderate domestic demand. As a result, the external current account deficit in 2004 is projected

-4-

to decline by ¾ percentage points to 5¼ percent of GDP relative to 2003, while end-2004
inflation would be lowered to 9 percent from 14.1 percent at the end of 2003.
The authorities will reduce the 2004 general government deficit ceiling to 2.1 percent of GDP,
compared to 3 percent of GDP in the approved budget. Owing to very strong revenue
performance, this reduction can be achieved exclusively by saving surplus revenue, which the
authorities estimate at 0.9 percent of GDP. Energy price adjustments and wage policy will be the
main instruments for improving the state-owned enterprises’ financial position.
Monetary policy will focus on lowering inflation to single digits in 2004. The current exchangerate-based framework remains appropriate, and the NBR will use both interest rate policy and
selective market interventions to steer the exchange rate consistent with the inflation target and
a modest real appreciation. However, the authorities will need to remain vigilant in keeping the
current account deficit well within safe margins. While fiscal policy would have to lead this
process, the NBR would closely watch credit growth and implement additional measures if
necessary.
On the structural side, the priorities are accelerated privatization—including the privatization of
Petrom, measures to arrest the accumulation of arrears, and improved governance.
The authorities are intensifying efforts to improve collections of the main utilities. The program
provides for further decisive steps to increase domestic gas producers’ price toward import parity
by 2007 and adjust electricity prices. The authorities will initiate decisive restructuring in the
large loss-making mining and railway sectors, responsible for the build of arrears to the budget
and energy suppliers.
The authorities are making significant efforts to improve governance and the agreed program
includes conditionality for judicial reform, including the strengthening of judicial independence.
Further measures aim at improving the business climate by strengthening the office of the special
anticorruption prosecutor, increasing transparency on issues of privatization and financial
disclosure, and enforcing tax collections.

Statement by Yuriy G. Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director for Romania
and Lucian Croitoru, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 7, 2004
The Broad Picture
The Romanian authorities appreciate the staff report, which accurately assesses
the country’s performance in recent years and provides a realistic view of the policy
challenges ahead. They broadly agree with staff recommendations and consent to the Fund’s
publication of the report.
In the context of the previous successfully concluded SBA, Romania has made
progress both in strengthening the macroeconomic environment and in promoting
structural reforms, thus reducing macroeconomic imbalances. In 2003 the authorities
overperformed for the third year in a row by reducing the fiscal deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP
relative to the target of 2.7 percent of GDP. The National Bank of Romania (NBR)
implemented prudent policies and disinflation targets were constantly met in the last three
years. From 41 percent at end-2000, inflation went down to 12 ⅓ percent in May 2004, and
available figures indicate that the 2004 target of 9 percent is likely to be met. Macroeconomic
stabilization has preserved competitiveness, while official reserves have maintained
comfortable import cover levels. Several measures to improve the financial performance of
state owned enterprises (SOEs) were implemented, including significant upward adjustments
in energy prices and higher collection rates in the gas and electricity sectors. Privatization has
accelerated, with 35 large companies with over 112000 employees being privatized in 200103, of which half in the course of the last year, and further progress has been made in Q1
2004. The financial sector is healthy, with liquid and well-capitalized banks. Progress with
stabilization, continued strong competitiveness, and improved prospects for EU accession
have ensured a robust response of the economy, with GDP growth averaging 5.2 percent a
year in 2001-03, and 6.1 percent in the first half of 2004.
Looking forward, the authorities view consolidating macroeconomic
stabilization and accessing the EU in 2007 as interlinked goals, which require intense
structural reform. To secure further progress in macroeconomic stabilization, the
authorities will employ further fiscal consolidation and a prudent monetary and exchange rate
policy, including measures to contain the rapid credit growth. In view of adopting inflation
targeting in 2005, strong efforts will be devoted to complete the technical preparation and
further formalize the policy framework, including shifting the responsibility for managing
developments in the external current account to fiscal and income policies. In accordance
with guidelines in the Ex Post Assessment, the authorities are determined to move further
with imposing hard budget constraints, accelerating the privatization process in the energy
sector, and improving governance and the business environment, thus achieving mediumterm external viability.
In addressing these challenges, the authorities are convinced that a new
precautionary 24-months SBA is crucial to anchor ownership of reforms and to reduce
balance of payments vulnerabilities. The strong conditionality of the program, based on

-2front-loaded measures and supported by prior actions (which have all been met), is in line
with recommendations of the Ex Post Assessment. The successful implementation of
structural reforms under this program should facilitate exiting from Fund program
engagement. As also recommended in the Ex Post Assessment, the authorities, but also our
chair, started a public relations policy to help preparing public perception for the future
graduation to a surveillance-based relationship.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy will continue to play a decisive role in disinflation and in keeping
the current account deficit within safe margins, while creating scope for further private
sector investment. Consistent with this mission, the authorities decided to tighten the
general government deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP, 0.9 percent of GDP below the approved
budget. Given the very strong revenue performance, this deficit adjustment can be achieved
entirely by saving the revenue surplus. The authorities will keep expenditure to the
programmed level if revenue comes out stronger than consistent with the budget target, but
are also ready to tighten fiscal policy further if the current account or disinflation targets are
at risk. Expenditure for all motorway projects will be accommodated within the new budget.
In addition, measures envisaged to improve the saving-investment balances of the SOEs
(energy price adjustments and wage control in 72 large SOEs) would allow for an overall
adjustment in the broad public sector deficit of more than 1 percent of GDP. To ensure that
the fiscal objective for the broad public sector is met, this year the authorities will establish
monthly monitoring of the public sector borrowing requirement.
On tax policy, the authorities decided to continue their policy to reduce payroll
tax rates, improve tax administration and step up the fight against tax arrears
accumulation. In January 2004 the authorities reduced the employers’ contributions to the
pension fund (2.5 percentage points) and to the unemployment fund (0.5 percentage point).
They have limited the eligibility for the reduced VAT rate to pharmaceutical products, hotel
accommodation, newspaper distribution, and a small group of previously VAT-exempted
products. No other modification in tax legislation is planned for 2004 and any amendments
that may be envisaged for 2005 will be done in consultation with Fund staff. The
modernization of the newly established revenue administration will now focus on operations,
systems and processes, and human resources. In their fight against tax arrears, the authorities
have initiated bankruptcy procedures against a large private refinery and other companies
that incurred tax arrears.
To ensure the long-term sustainability of the public pension fund, the authorities
are committed to the World Bank’s proposal to accelerate the increase in the
retirement age and to equalize it for men and women starting with July 1, 2005. These
reforms would be necessary to compensate for the envisaged further cuts in social security
rates, which are relatively high, but also for the foreseeable increases in the already high
dependency ratio and for the low replacement ratio.
Monetary policy
In 2004 the NBR will continue to apply the same monetary policy strategy before
moving to inflation targeting (IT) in 2005. Since early 2001, the strategy of guiding the
exchange rate along a path consistent with the inflation objective, in the context of restricted

-3capital inflows and positive real interest rates, has proved efficient in gradually lowering
inflation. Both the authorities and staff believe that such strategy could deliver further
disinflation in 2004. The NBR will use both interest rate policy and selective market
intervention to keep the exchange rate consistent with the inflation target through a modest
annual real appreciation against the implicit euro-dollar basket. Reacting to favorable
developments with respect to inflation and to excess supply in the foreign exchange market,
the NBR has reduced the policy interest rate by 50 bps in June 9, and is contemplating further
interest rate reductions aimed at confirming disinflation progress, while maintaining the
prudent stance of monetary and exchange rate policy. With a view towards enhancing longerterm policy effectiveness, the NBR has started preparation for adopting an IT framework for
monetary policy. The legal underpinnings of such a shift are incorporated in the recently
adopted NBR Law, which fully transposes EU central banking acquis, guaranteeing price
stability as a primary objective, as well as consolidating the independence of the central
bank. Efforts are currently being undertaken to establish the institutional, operational and
analytical prerequisites for a successful implementation of IT in line with suggestions from
the MFD TA mission. Moving to full inflation targeting will require progress in
strengthening information gathering, analysis and forecasting techniques, formalizing
monetary policy decision-making, and further increasing transparency through improved
communication.
To address risks associated with rapid credit growth, the NBR will continue to
improve its instruments for managing the financial system. Although the financial system
appears healthy, on-site supervision will be enhanced to make sure that credit increases
associated with the process of financial deepening and cyclical movement of the economy
will not adversely affect the resilience of credit institutions to macroeconomic shocks. The
NBR will also perform additional systematic assessment of risk exposure through stresstesting of portfolios and more conservative regulatory practices will be adopted in relevant
areas if necessary.
Wage policy
Wage policy is aimed at managing demand pressures. Therefore, the government
approved a prudent annual increase of 12 percent in the statutory minimum wage on January
1, 2004. To ensure a prudent wage policy in the SOE sector, the government also limited the
average net real wage growth to about 1 percent and decided to reduce employment by 5
percent. To strengthen the credibility of the wage bill target, the ministries will block
payments equivalent to 4 percent of the quarterly wage bill in 72 monitored SOEs until the
last month of the quarter, and will release these amounts only when it is clear that the
respective target will be reached. In response to recent pressures from labor unions, who are
pushing for higher minimum wages in a nation-wide collective contract, the government will
instruct managers in SOEs and use its influence to prevent significant deviations of the
agreed minimum wage from the statutory minimum wage.
Structural reforms and the business climate
Under the new SBA the authorities will adopt a more forceful approach to
privatization (including selling the largest company in the country, Petrom), strengthen
financial and payment discipline in SOEs, and improve governance. Progress in these

-4areas will improve the business climate and will allow the Romanian economy to become a
full functioning market economy, able to withstand competition within the EU.
Privatization in the energy sector is a high priority, privatization of the SOEs in
the privatization authority’s portfolio is to be completed by end-2004, and decisive
restructuring will be initiated in the large loss-makers in the mining and railway
sectors. Four electricity distribution companies are scheduled to be privatized in 2004, the
authorities being close to sign contracts for two of them. For two gas distribution companies
bids are expected by mid-July. Furthermore, the authorities will start discussion with the
World Bank on the privatization of Romgaz, the Romanian gas producer, and two big power
generators. In the railway sector the authorities intend to continue restructuring efforts by
closing by end-June 2004 about 3000 km of loss-making secondary lines if the respective
segments are not taken over by investors. In the mining sector, they agreed to close 30 mines,
laying off 8,000 miners in 2004. In addition, the authorities have adopted an ambitious
strategy for restructuring the mining sector, approving the phasing out of state support for the
mineral and coal sector by 2007 and 2010 respectively, in line with the EU commitments.
Efforts to complete privatization in the banking sector will also continue. The authorities’
remaining shares in BCR will be sold as soon as possible, in agreement with EBRD and IFC.
The timetable for the privatization of CEC, the State Savings Bank, was decided in April this
year, with a view to completion in 2005, and a tender to select the consultant for privatization
was announced in May.
The authorities will continue to reduce losses from quasi-fiscal activities in the
energy sector and eliminate the nonpayment of electricity and gas. Price adjustments
have allowed losses from quasi-fiscal activities in the energy sector to decrease from 4.7
percent of GDP in 2000 to 2.8 percent in 2003. For the gas sector, the authorities have
decided to move to a new price system, under which distributors and end-users will have to
absorb variable import costs and a gradual increase in producer prices to import parity. To
this end, the final user gas price will be further increased by 5 percent every quarter in 2004,
and the authorities have also announced a schedule for further increases in the producer gas
prices so as to reach import parity in 2007. Electricity prices will continue to be adjusted not
only to cover rising cost, but also to provide an appropriate margin for return on equity in the
distribution sector, to facilitate privatization. Efforts to fight nonpayment in the electricity
and gas distribution sectors are already reflected in significant increases in bill collection
rates. Further efforts to increase collection rates will focus on the closure of unviable
industrial consumers with large arrears, seizure of assets from nonpayers through the
judiciary system, and intensified efforts to improve collection from households. In addition,
the authorities are working on a reform strategy for the district heating system. This strategy
will be based on: (i) switching to heating contracts with individuals, (ii) termination of
subsidies to at least 15 inefficient heating plants, (already implemented) and (iii) increasing
both the heating price (12 percent as of July 1, 2004, already met) and the National Reference
Price for heating (12 percent as of August 1, 2004). The authorities will also enhance the
existing targeted support for households with a view to abolishing the National Reference
Price. To mitigate the social impact of structural reforms, the administrative capacity of the
social safety net will be improved and the coverage of the minimum income guarantee
scheme will be broadened.

-5Efforts to improve governance, strengthen public administration, eliminate
corruption and improve the business climate are underway. In cooperation with the
World Bank and in response to EU recommendations, the authorities have approved laws on
judicial organization, on the status of magistrates, and on the Superior Council of the
Magistrates. The new laws strengthened the role of the Superior Council of the Magistrates
as guarantor of the independence of the judiciary. Stepping up the fight against corruption is
a prerequisites for further improvements in the business climate and should remains top
priority of the reform agenda. The extraordinary appeal procedure by the Attorney General
has already been eliminated. Furthermore, the legislation on the declaration of assets by
government and parliamentary officials and near-relatives has been strengthened to be more
effective in containing corruption. The National Prosecutor's Anti-Corruption Office (ANC)
will be provided with additional resources this year. In early 2005, in cooperation with the
World Bank and within the framework of the EU acquis, the authorities will overhaul the
new labor code and amend it in order to promote greater labor market flexibility.
In closing, we would like to convey to the management and staff of the Fund the
appreciation of the Romanian authorities for their continuing support, frankness in discussion
and constructive policy advice.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Romania
On July 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2004 Article IV Consultation with Romania.1
Background
After uneven performance in the 1990s, macroeconomic policies improved in 2001–03.
Macroeconomic imbalances were reduced through fiscal policy, measures to improve the
financial performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and accelerated privatization.
The National Bank of Romania (NBR) slowed the depreciation of the leu and achieved
substantial disinflation, lowering the annual inflation rate from 40 percent in early 2001 to
12.3 percent in May 2004. Macroeconomic stabilization, which preserved the competitiveness
achieved with the 1999 depreciation, and prospects for EU accession created a positive supply
response and facilitated rapid growth over the last three years.
However, in 2003 domestic demand picked up and the current account deficit widened,
reflecting a sharp increase in credit to the private sector and a large minimum wage increase in
January 2003. As a result, final domestic demand grew faster than output and the current
account deficit widened to 5.9 percent of GDP.
Fiscal policy provided continued support for macroeconomic stabilization. Far-reaching valueadded tax (VAT) and profit tax reforms and improvements in tax administration strengthened
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2revenue collections despite sizable cuts in social security contribution rates. With interest
payments declining, the budget deficit was reduced relative to GDP from 2.6 percent in 2002 to
2.3 percent in 2003. The authorities were also successful in reducing losses from quasi-fiscal
activities. After a delayed policy response to higher international prices in early 2003, gas prices
have been increased substantially since mid-2003, and electricity prices were brought to the
cost recovery level in September 2003. Collection rates in the gas and electricity sectors
increased significantly, but progress has been insufficient in district heating.
After a decade of slow privatization, a large-scale employment reduction program facilitated an
acceleration of the privatization program. Overall, 35 large companies with over 112,000
employees were privatized in 2001–03, half of which were privatized in the last year. Although
energy sector privatization has been slow, a number of important privatization projects are now
close to completion, the most important of which is the privatization of oil and gas producer
Petrom, the largest company in the country.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Romanian authorities for the prudent conduct of
macroeconomic policies and progress with structural reforms. These achievements have
contributed to a decline in inflation and to Romania’s strong economic growth over the past
three years.
Directors stressed that sustaining strong growth over the medium term will require further efforts
to complete macroeconomic stabilization and accelerate structural reform. In particular,
continued disinflation and containing the current account deficit within a safe range, in the
context of the current exchange rate-based stabilization framework, will require further efforts to
reduce the budget deficit over the medium term, eliminate losses and quasi-fiscal activities in
state-owned enterprises, and implement a strict wage policy. In the structural area, Directors
emphasized the importance of completing the privatization agenda and stepping up efforts to
improve the business climate, especially governance. It will be particularly important to keep up
the momentum on these policies in the run-up to the general elections in November 2004 and in
their immediate aftermath.
Directors commended the authorities’ plan to lower the general government deficit in the context
of the amended 2004 budget, and to use any additional revenue for further deficit reduction.
They stressed the importance of maintaining a sufficiently tight fiscal policy over the medium
term. Directors encouraged improvements in the structure of revenue and expenditure to
support further budget consolidation efforts. They welcomed the reduction in Romania’s high
social security contribution rates, and supported further cuts in these provided they are
accompanied by a broadening of the tax base and improvements in tax administration. Directors
cautioned against eroding the value added and profit tax bases through the granting of
exemptions. They strongly supported efforts to reduce subsidies, and noted that expenditure will
need to be carefully prioritized to make room for planned increases in infrastructure investment.
It was suggested that the articulation of a medium-term expenditure framework could usefully
support such efforts.

-3Directors generally considered that the current monetary policy framework, which features a
gradually declining targeted depreciation rate as a nominal anchor, has been a key factor
underlying the success in reducing inflation. Directors agreed that once inflation has been
brought down to single-digit levels and wage discipline in state-owned companies strengthened,
inflation targeting will become a viable framework for the medium term. Steps to strengthen the
central bank’s independence in line with Maastricht requirements, are welcome, and Directors
encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to fulfill the institutional, operational, and analytical
prerequisites for the introduction of inflation targeting in 2005. Directors noted that the banking
system remains healthy, and that recent measures have been effective in containing the growth
of household credit. Nevertheless, they recommended that the authorities remain vigilant and
prepared to take additional measures should the brisk growth of credit resume.
Directors stressed the need for hard budget constraints on state-owned enterprises.
They welcomed the measures directed at reducing tax arrears and the nonpayment of utility
bills, particularly in the mining and railway sectors. Directors supported the closing of unviable
operations, with appropriate provision for relocating and retraining employees, and the
adjustment of prices to fully cover costs. They commended the authorities’ decision to raise gas
prices to import parity, and also encouraged them to implement the recently-approved strategy
for the district heating sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to prudent wage policies, considering that this
will be critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing state-owned enterprise
losses. While commending the moderate increase of the statutory minimum wage and the tight
state-owned enterprise wage program in 2004, they urged the authorities to remain firm in the
implementation of these policies. They also underscored the need to keep wage settlements in
collective labor contracts in line with productivity growth, thereby protecting employment and
competitiveness.
Directors stressed that preserving labor market flexibility will be key to keeping the economy on
a fast growth path and completing the far-reaching restructuring process. Accordingly, they
urged the authorities to review the provisions in the newly-approved Labor Code that have
adversely affected flexibility and increased the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to offer most of the state-owned companies outside the
energy sector for sale by end-2004. They also stressed the importance of accelerating
privatization in the energy sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue reducing
employment in state-owned enterprises, as they considered this necessary for reducing losses
and accelerating privatization.
Directors commended the authorities for the recent progress in improving the business climate,
including judiciary reform and the implementation of measures to fight against corruption.
To attract higher private investment, it will be crucial to sustain these institutional reforms,
further strengthen the fight against corruption–in particular through further efforts to increase the
independence and effectiveness of the judiciary–and improve transparency in privatization and
public procurement.

-4It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Romania will be held on the 24-month
cycle, subject to the provisions in the decision on the consultation cycles approved by the Board
on July 15, 2002.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are
also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Romania is also available.
