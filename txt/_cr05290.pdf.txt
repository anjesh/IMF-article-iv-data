GRENADA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Grenada
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
June 24, 2005
• Economic context: Grenada is a multi-island economy in the eastern Caribbean, with a population of
about 104,000 and per capita GDP of US$4,200. It is one of eight island states comprising the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). Its GDP accounts for nearly 15 percent of the region. The ECCU has a
common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern
Caribbean dollar, that has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per US$1 since July 1976.
• Political situation: Grenada is a Westminster-style democracy with a bicameral parliament consisting
of 13 appointed senators and 15 elected representatives. Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of the New National
Party has been in office since 1995. Although his party won a third consecutive term in November 2003, its
majority in Parliament fell to just one seat.
• Relations with the IMF: Grenada has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions (Appendix I). Two purchases under the Fund’s policy on emergency assistance for natural
disasters of SDR 2.93 million (25 percent of quota) each were approved in January 2003 and
November 2004, respectively, in support of the government’s efforts to deal with the impacts of Tropical
Storm Lili (September 2002) and Hurricane Ivan (September 2004).
• Previous Article IV consultation: The last consultation was concluded on January 27, 2003. While
acknowledging the difficult economic situation faced by Grenada, Directors expressed concern about the
high level of public debt and urged strong fiscal adjustment measures in 2003 and the medium term. They
stressed the need for a comprehensive tax reform, reductions in tax concessions, and improved expenditure
management. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen debt management and exercise caution in
granting guarantees. Discussions for the 2004 consultation were held in St. George’s during May 13−25 but
not concluded because Hurricane Ivan rendered the projections and some of the policy discussions obsolete.
• Last Board discussion: On November 15, 2004, Directors approved Grenada’s request for a purchase
under the emergency assistance policy for natural disasters. They noted the authorities’ progress in
addressing Grenada’s challenges prior to the hurricane, including a comprehensive review of the tax system
and reductions in concessions. They agreed that these efforts were set back by the hurricane, and welcomed
the authorities’ intention to work closely with the Fund on a medium-term framework encompassing fiscal
consolidation, a debt strategy, and measures to bring about recovery and enhance growth.
• Discussions: A staff team comprising Prakash Loungani (Head, EXR), Rishi Goyal and Werner Keller
(both WHD), and Harald Finger (PDR) held discussions in St. George’s during April 28–May 12. The team
met with Prime Minister Mitchell, Deputy Prime Minister Bowen, Finance Minister Boatswain, other
members of Cabinet, senior government officials, and representatives of the opposition, trade unions, private
sector and civil society. Staff of the ECCB and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also participated in the
discussions. Ratna Sahay (WHD) and Paul Jenkins (OED) attended the final discussions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Eight months after Hurricane Ivan devastated Grenada, economic conditions
remain difficult. Following a decline by 3 percent last year, growth of only 1 percent is
projected in 2005. Tourism and agricultural activities remain weak and nearly offset the
stimulus from the reconstruction boom. Poverty rates have reportedly risen sharply,
particularly in the rural sector. The majority of homes are still in need of repair.

•

Debt is unsustainable and the government faces large financing gaps. Gaps of about
4½ percent of GDP this year and 12–14 percent of GDP per year between 2006 and 2010
are projected. Public debt is projected to increase from 130 percent of GDP to nearly
150 percent by 2010 on present policies. The authorities announced in October 2004 that
they intend to seek a cooperative solution with their creditors.

•

A comprehensive medium-term plan is needed to deal with these challenges. The
plan should: (i) include measures to close the financing gaps and ensure debt
sustainability; (ii) facilitate economic recovery and raise medium-term growth; and
(iii) reduce vulnerabilities to adverse shocks. The authorities plan to resume work on a
home-grown structural adjustment program, with help from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), that would incorporate these goals.

•

Burden sharing will be required to fill financing gaps and reduce debt. Although too
large to be filled by any one source alone, the financing gaps could plausibly be filled
through fiscal effort, cooperative debt restructuring agreements, and donor support.

•

The 2005 budget shows a commitment to fiscal effort, but implementation will
require building a social and political consensus. Staff recommended some measures
for this year and additional fiscal consolidation of 5 percent of GDP per year for
2006–10, including an increase in retail fuel prices. A special levy on incomes proposed
by the authorities has been rejected by the opposition party and labor unions. As
background, the ruling party holds a slim one-seat majority in Parliament.

•

There has been progress on the debt restructuring strategy, but hurdles remain. A
debt exchange offer to commercial creditors is expected to be launched this summer.
While official creditors have also been contacted, the situation is complicated by
diplomatic estrangement with Taiwan Province of China, the largest bilateral creditor.

•

Reinvigorating growth is a high priority. In the near term, the performance and
transparency of the newly created reconstruction agency need to be stepped up. Raising
medium-term growth will require skill development, improving the investment climate,
diversifying into new services, and tapping the funds and skills of the diaspora more
effectively.

•

Continued efforts are needed to address vulnerabilities. Improving natural disaster
mitigation and management is a top priority. Close attention should be paid to the health
of the financial sector, including through enhanced supervision.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Grenada is a largely tourism-based, small, open economy that is vulnerable to
external shocks. Over the past two decades, the economy has shifted from the oncedominant agricultural sector into services, which now account for over three-quarters of total
value added. Most of the goods consumed or invested domestically are imported. The
economy remains susceptible to changes in global economic conditions, particularly growth
in advanced economies, and to natural disasters.
2.
Sustained private sector growth has proven elusive, adding to fiscal and debt
imbalances.
•

Following slow growth and domestic fiscal adjustment in the early- to mid-1990s,
growth picked up in the second half of the 1990s, driven by the telecommunications,
construction, and manufacturing sectors (Figure 1).1 Although fiscal policy was
expansionary, the public debt-to-GDP ratio remained at around 50 percent of GDP, as
deficits were financed partly by privatization proceeds.

•

Adverse external shocks in 2001–02—the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the
slowdown in the global economy, and the damage from Tropical Storm Lili—resulted
in economic contraction. Fiscal policy became even more expansionary, as current
and capital expenditures were increased (Figure 2). Public debt spiraled to
110 percent of GDP by end-2003, as privatization receipts declined, guarantees were
granted, and leases associated with public-private partnerships were purchased.

•

With the economy’s recovery in 2003, the government began to consolidate its fiscal
accounts and to develop a medium-term fiscal strategy. Nevertheless, debt remained
high and the interest burden continued to rise.

3.
Economic conditions and policy priorities changed abruptly when Hurricane
Ivan hit in September 2004. Damage from the hurricane exceeded 200 percent of GDP
(Box 1). The economy contracted by 3 percent in 2004, a sharp setback from the 4 percent
growth that had been projected earlier. Progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as the
authorities gave priority to post-hurricane relief and revenues fell.2 Nonessential expenditures
were curtailed, and pledges of US$150 million (34 percent of 2004 GDP) were marshaled
quickly through two successful donor conferences. Grenada also purchased US$4.4 million
(25 percent of quota) under the Fund’s emergency assistance policy for natural disasters in
November 2004. The World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also

This pattern differs from that in other ECCU countries, where growth continued to decelerate.

provided assistance.3 There was no run on bank deposits, and banking sector conditions
remained stable.
4.
A month after Ivan struck, the authorities announced public debt to be
unsustainable. As revenues contracted sharply and relief expenditures soared, there were
difficulties in servicing debt. In October 2004, the authorities announced that the public debt
was unsustainable and their intent to seek a cooperative solution with their creditors and
donors. After interest payments on two large international bonds were missed in late
December, Grenada was downgraded to ‘selective default’ by Standard & Poor’s.

Box 1. Impact of Hurricane Ivan
The damage to Grenada from Hurricane Ivan exceeded 200 percent of GDP (EC$ 2.4 billion).
• Virtually every house on the island was affected, with 30 percent completely destroyed; schools
and universities suffered extensive damage, as did hospitals and shelters.
• Productive sectors were hit hard. In the tourism sector, few hotels escaped damage. In agriculture,
the nutmeg sector—in which Grenada was the world’s second-largest producer and which
employed an estimated 30 percent of the population directly or indirectly—was decimated. Nutmeg
trees take 7–10 years to grow. Cocoa, bananas, and other crops also were damaged.
• The entire population was without water and electricity in the immediate aftermath of the
hurricane.
Measured in economic damage relative to the size of the economy, Hurricane Ivan was one of the
most severe natural disasters in recent decades. On average over the past 30 years, the damage to
countries worldwide hit by natural disasters has been 0.6 percent of GDP. Even for the more disasterprone ECCU region, the damage on average has been 2 percent of GDP, with a maximum of 101 percent
of GDP (from two successive hurricanes impacting Dominica in 1979).1

Social indicators, already weaker
than in other ECCU countries,
deteriorated. Nearly 8 percent of the labor
force was displaced from their jobs in the
immediate aftermath of Ivan, raising the
unemployment rate to over 20 percent.
Starting from an already high incidence of
over 30 percent, poverty levels have
reportedly risen sharply among farmers and

women. There is considerable anxiety about the 2005 hurricane season, in part because the
majority of houses have not yet been fully repaired.
6.
Political tensions are high. Having won less than a majority of the popular vote in
the 2003 election, and with only a one-seat majority in Parliament, the government has found
it difficult to build a social and political consensus on a course of action for recovery. Fiscal
measures have met with resistance, particularly from labor unions and the opposition.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS
7.
The economy is expected to recover slowly over the course of 2005. Staff projects
growth of about 1 percent as conditions in the tourism and agricultural sectors are weak and
nearly offset the stimulus from the reconstruction boom (Table 1). About 50 percent of hotel
rooms have resumed service; more than 80 percent are expected to be in operation for the
tourist season starting later this year. Farmers have turned to short-cycle crops as near-term
prospects for nutmeg and cocoa remain

8.
Although competitiveness indicators have improved since 2001, Hurricane Ivan
dealt a temporary setback to agricultural exports and tourism services. Owing mainly to
the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) has
depreciated by more than 15 percent since end-2001, unwinding the appreciation of the
late 1990s (Figure 3). Tourism-based REER measures have also depreciated. Grenada’s
market share of Caribbean tourist arrivals increased sharply in 2002 and 2003. While real
wages have grown rapidly between 1995 and 2003, they have been in line with real GDP
growth.4
9.
A sharp deterioration in the external current account deficit is expected this
year. In 2004, substantial foreign grant inflows and insurance payments led to a strong
improvement in the external current account deficit to about 17 percent of GDP, even though
the balance of trade in goods and services deteriorated markedly after Ivan struck (Table 2).
This year, reconstruction-related imports have started to surge while exports and tourism

The government faces a financing gap of 4½ percent of GDP in 2005. In 2004, the
government could not fully service its debt obligations despite generous international
assistance and sustained efforts to reduce nonessential expenditures. In 2005 thus far,
revenue collections have exceeded expectations, on account of booming tax collections on
imports such as construction materials (temporary tax relief measures on imports, put in
place after Ivan struck, were mostly phased out in February) and a large one-time back
payment of taxes (Table 3). This year’s budget, approved in April, proposes revenueenhancing measures (Box 2). Yet, despite the revenue effort and exceptional donor support,
the financing gap is large because of high reconstruction expenditures.

Box 2. The 2005 Budget and the Reconstruction Program
To stabilize the public finances, new revenue measures yielding over 2 percent of GDP have been
proposed. The measures include: (i) a special levy on incomes instituted for a five-year period, the
proceeds of which are to be deposited in the Grenada Reconstruction and Development Fund (RDF);1,2
(ii) an increase by about 13 percent in the retail price of fuel, which has been fixed since
December 2000, and the adoption of a flexible fuel price mechanism; (iii) an increase in excise taxes on
alcohol and tobacco; and (iv) strengthened tax administration. Given the immense property damage,
however, the taxes payable on residential properties were reduced by 50 percent for 2005 only.
Moreover, taxes on certain vehicle tires and brakes and on alternative (renewable) energy products were
lowered.
To promote reconstruction, capital expenditures have been increased sharply. Given the large
reconstruction needs, the government plans to incur capital expenditures of 19.2 percent of GDP this
year. The priority areas are (i) provision of housing and shelter; (ii) rehabilitation of schools;
(iii) revitalization of agriculture, the mainstay of a large proportion of the poor in Grenada, through
product diversification for near-term growth and replanting of traditional tree crops for longer-term
recovery; (iv) reactivation of the business sector; (v) social recovery, that is, policies aimed at addressing
the needs of the most vulnerable; (vi) skills training; and (vii) reconstruction of sporting facilities,
including the National Stadium to meet Grenada’s commitment to co-hosting the 2007 Cricket World
Cup.
Current expenditures are also budgeted to increase. The wage bill is expected to increase by over
8 percent in 2005 (an additional 1 percent of GDP), comprising a 4½ percent contracted wage increase
that had been agreed as part of the 2002–05 wage negotiations with the labor unions and salary
increments. In addition, transfers and spending on goods and services have been increased.
_________________________________
1
Legislation to establish the RDF was passed by the lower house of Parliament in April 2005. The RDF
is the mechanism to receive the monies for the reconstruction and development effort.
2
Under the present income tax system, personal income above EC$60,000 per year is taxed at a rate of
30 percent.

11.
Progress has been made in developing a comprehensive debt strategy, and a
successful outcome would help in filling the financing gap. Public debt at end-2004 rose to
almost 130 percent of GDP (Table 4). In January 2005, the government hired legal and
financial advisors to assist in the formulation of a comprehensive debt-reduction strategy.
Pending the development and outcome of the strategy, Grenada has discontinued servicing
most commercial and official bilateral debt obligations. In April 2005, a creditor committee
representing a majority of Grenada’s commercial debt obligations was formed.5 In May, the
authorities published their debt sustainability analysis (DSA), following which they held
meetings with the committee.6 They are preparing an exchange offer for their commercial
5

While the committee largely represents external creditors, there are strong linkages with domestic creditors
through bank ownership.
6

The authorities’ DSA is broadly similar to staff’s baseline scenario, but shows a higher financing gap in 2005
(6.4 percent of GDP) and lower financing gaps in 2006–10 (between 9 and 12 percent of GDP compared to
staff’s projections of 12–14 percent of GDP) owing to differences in assumptions.

debt and have also approached their official creditors to negotiate debt and debt-service relief
on at least comparable terms.

Prudential indicators for the banking system did not show a deterioration
through March 2005. After Ivan struck, banks granted blanket moratoria on loans, sharply
increased loan loss provisions, and assessed loan-by-loan credit quality.7 The share of

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
13.
The authorities welcomed the close policy dialogue with staff and timely
financial disbursement from the Fund after Hurricane Ivan struck. They noted that
staff’s presentations in the donor conferences had helped trigger international support and the
Fund’s policy advice was helping address their economic challenges. The authorities
expressed their desire to develop a home-grown adjustment program, as had been developed
in 1992–94. To develop this program, they intend to maintain close consultation with the
Fund, especially in light of the severe technical capacity constraints they face.
14.
Policy discussions centered on the government’s efforts to recover from the
effects of Hurricane Ivan, restore growth, and achieve fiscal sustainability. The mission
strongly recommended a comprehensive strategy, centered on a medium-term
macroeconomic plan with fiscal targets for the next 3–5 years that would be based on a broad
consensus and approved by Parliament. Such a strategy would feature three key components:
•
7

Restoring debt sustainability and closing financing gaps;

While the period of blanket moratoria on loan payments has expired, staff discussions with banks suggest
moratoria are being continued for some borrowers or the terms of the loans softened by stretching out
repayment periods.

- 14 -

•

Facilitating reconstruction and enhancing growth; and

•

Reducing vulnerabilities to adverse shocks, in particular, through natural disaster
preparedness and by strengthening financial sector supervision and regulation.

The mission noted that such a plan could help unlock further donor financing and ensure the
success of debt restructuring. It encouraged the authorities to continue to hold extensive
national consultations to build ownership of the fiscal effort required.
15.
The authorities were in full agreement with the mission’s recommendation on
the elements of the medium-term plan. They noted progress made during 2003–04 under
the Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Program (SATAP), with assistance from the
Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC). They stated their intention to
resume work on this project such that a medium-term fiscal plan could be used as the basis
for the 2006 budget consultations later this year.8
B. Addressing Fiscal and Debt Imbalances
16.
Resolving the unsustainable debt and filling large financing gaps in 2005 and
beyond will require burden sharing by all stakeholders. In staff’s baseline projections,
capital expenditures remain high, while revenues recover gradually and grants taper off
rapidly after 2006.9 Financing gaps in 2006–10 range between 12–14 percent of GDP. Public
debt rises to nearly 150 percent of GDP by 2010 (Tables 7 and 8). Filling the gaps and
resolving the

A mission from CARTAC is expected to visit Grenada this summer.

Beyond 2005, the external current account is also expected to deteriorate further, as the trade balance will take
time to recover while reconstruction-related insurance payments are poised to fall sharply. The current account
deficits are expected to be financed mainly through sustained inflows of foreign direct investment and private
capital transfers.

the disbursement of pledged donor support and additional requested support, would fill the
gap for 2005. However, for 2006 and beyond, further fiscal effort and donor support would
be needed in addition to the contribution from a successful debt strategy.
18.
A feasible burden sharing would fill the financing gaps and bring debt down to
safer levels. Staff have developed a burden-sharing scenario that is based on: (i) fiscal effort
that has been discussed with the authorities; (ii) illustrative calculations of debt relief
(pending the availability of details on the debt exchange offer); and (iii) additional donor
support. Under this scenario, the debt service burden would be reduced to more manageable
levels, and the ratio of public debt to GDP would decline steadily, although it would initially
remain high (Tables 9 and 10, and Figure 4).

Fiscal adjustment
19.
The authorities’ fiscal plans for 2005 seem broadly appropriate provided the
promised new revenue measures are implemented.
•

The impending increase in retail fuel prices has been widely accepted by the public.
The authorities are working on the legislation needed to implement the increase,
including on introducing a flexible price mechanism.

•

The special levy on incomes, however, has met with stiff resistance from the
opposition and the unions. The authorities have taken the measure back to the public
for consultations on its design, but stated their commitment to implementing it. Staff
urged the authorities to show the proceeds of the levy transparently on the budget.

- 17 -

•

The mission stressed the importance of prioritizing capital expenditures, and asked if
expenditures could be scaled back or delayed, especially because the shortage of
skilled staff in line ministries limits implementation capacity. The authorities
responded that the capital projects were high priority under the circumstances and that
implementation was being improved, among other things, with the operations of the
Agency for Reconstruction and Development (ARD).10

•

The authorities had considered a wage freeze for 2005 and 2006, but acceded to union
demands for payment of the contracted 4½ percent wage increase for this year.

20.
The mission recommended further fiscal effort of about 5 percent of GDP per
year (relative to the baseline) during 2006–10 to help fill financing gaps. The mission
also urged the authorities to identify contingent fiscal measures that could be put in place
quickly should adverse events make the already-difficult situation worse. Several revenueenhancing and expenditure-reducing measures were discussed, many of which had already
been contemplated by the government.

10

The ARD was established in November 2004, and officially launched on March 15, 2005, to coordinate
domestic and international efforts to rebuild Grenada after Ivan. It was set up to improve the policy and
institutional framework for reconstruction, strengthen the project implementation capacity of line ministries,
monitor implementation of projects, and report back to stakeholders, particularly the donor community.

- 18 -

21.
Higher revenues of 3–4 percent of GDP per year could come from implementing
petroleum price reform, broadening the tax base, and improving tax collection.11
•

Restoring tax collections from retail fuel prices (Figure 5): Even after the proposed
increase, retail fuel prices will remain below world prices, with the effective tax rate
on fuel imports below the tax rates on most other imports.12 The mission
recommended that retail prices be adjusted more frequently—possibly monthly and
according to a transparent, rules-based formula—to yield needed revenues and
promote fuel efficiency and conservation. The authorities agreed that retail fuel prices
need to catch up to world prices and thereafter reflect movements in world prices.
However, they expressed concern about the impact on vulnerable groups, especially
through increases in bus fares for school children.13

•

Reducing tax concessions. Grenada has been granting very generous concessions over
the past decade. The estimated costs in terms of customs revenue forgone (as
a percentage of GDP or current revenues) have been one of the highest in the ECCU
(Figure 6). Surveys have indicated that infrastructure, skilled workers, and low tax
rates, among other factors, are more important than tax concessions in attracting
investment. The mission emphasized that concessions should be phased out. As an
interim step, concessions should be nondiscretionary, transparent, and subject to a
fixed upper limit in EC dollar terms and a clear expiration date. The authorities
agreed that concessions were not among the most critical determinants of investment,
but felt the pressure to extend them due to competition from neighboring countries.
They acknowledged the need for harmonization of concessions in a regional context.
They also intend to review their concessions policy to move away from a system of
tax holidays towards granting tax credits.

11

The scope for divestment of government assets is limited. Significant privatization occurred during the 1990s.
The government retains only small shareholdings in a few enterprises. The authorities said that they have been
examining the possibility of divesting some of the remaining shares.

12

The proposed increase in fuel prices should yield over ½ percent of GDP in additional revenues. Full pass
through of the world price increases since end-2000 would have brought in about 2 percent of GDP in
additional revenues. Inflation would increase temporarily by about 1½ percentage points. The impact on growth
is expected to be modest.

13

Currently, there is no publicly-financed transportation system in Grenada. Staff discussed with the authorities
the possibility of providing a subsidy for school children’s bus fares. Moreover, a gradual catch up to world
prices perhaps over two years would ease the impact on the vulnerable, and would give the authorities time to
design social safety nets.

•

Lowering the threshold for personal income tax exemption and introducing a lower
rate. Currently, the threshold for paying personal income taxes is over five times per
capita income. In place of the proposed levy on incomes, the mission recommended
lowering gradually the threshold, and introducing a schedule of lower tax brackets.
The authorities had made an election promise not to impose new personal income
taxes. They noted that they are designing the special levy so that it would not be
regressive.

•

Improving collection of taxes and fees. A menu of administrative measures were
discussed, including strengthening the administrative capacity of the Lands and
Surveys Department, enhancing the audit capacity of the Inland Revenue and
Customs and Excise Departments, and tightening enforcement at Customs.14 The
authorities have already implemented measures this year, including requiring tax
identification numbers for those getting concessions or licenses. Moreover, a CDBfinanced project is expected to improve internal auditing and enforcement procedures
at Customs and intensify anti-smuggling efforts.

22.
Expenditure efforts could include containing the growth of noninterest current
spending, particularly the wage bill, and achieving greater efficiency in capital projects.
Measures amounting to 2−3 percent of GDP per year were discussed.
•

Keeping the wage bill aligned to inflation and productivity growth. With the 8 percent
increase in this year’s wage bill, the cumulative increase over the last five years has
exceeded 40 percent, far outstripping inflation and real per capita GDP (Figure 7). The
mission stressed the importance of aligning the wage bill to inflation and productivity
growth. While noting that there had been a freeze on new employment, the mission
emphasized that civil service reform should entail some transfer of authority from the
Public Service Commission to managers to lay off workers. The authorities considered
tripartite discussions among labor, business, and the government as a way to obtain
agreement on wages during 2006–09. They expect to table a public sector reform bill
before Parliament in the coming months to enhance public sector efficiency and
productivity.15 However, a critical need is donor financing for potential severance
payments.

14

Prior to the hurricane, Grenada had begun taking steps to implementing a value added tax (VAT) by
January 2006, as per technical assistance from FAD (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States: Modernization
of the Tax System, 2003). The date for introducing the VAT has now been deferred by at least two years.

15

The World Bank has begun providing technical assistance for the Public Sector Modernization Project.

Controlling expenditures on goods and services. The authorities indicated that savings
could come from commercialization of services, improving the procurement system, and
reducing spending on professional and other services.

•

Realizing greater efficiency in capital expenditures. The mission recommended that
capital expenditures be carefully prioritized and planned, keeping in mind the
implementation capacity of the line ministries, and that reconstruction activity be carried
out at a measured pace, in step with developments on the financing side. The authorities
noted that concessional finance and grants had been sought for projects.

23.
The authorities have requested donor-supported technical assistance to carry
out the needed fiscal effort. The administrative capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the
Customs and Excise Department needs to be boosted. At the Ministry of Finance, additional
staff are needed for economic management and revenue administration. Technical assistance
is needed to bring the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise Departments on a
common data platform, which would contribute to the revenue effort. Assistance is also
needed to evaluate, among other things, the feasibility and cost effectiveness of public
transportation and commercialization of services.

- 22 -

Debt restructuring
24.
As part of the burden sharing among the Grenadians, creditors, and donors, the
government hopes to strike a cooperative agreement with creditors to restructure debt
and help close financing gaps. The mission emphasized that any restructuring agreement
should: (a) be transparent; (b) be nested in a comprehensive medium-term macroeconomic
framework; (c) involve a close and constructive dialogue with all creditors, private and
official; (d) ascertain and incorporate to the extent possible the preferences of creditors with
respect to new debt instruments; and (e) treat comparably the different creditor groups. The
mission also encouraged the authorities to launch the exchange offer in a timely fashion.
25.
The mission noted that progress has been made towards reaching a cooperative
agreement with creditors but hurdles remain. The authorities intend to launch their
commercial debt exchange offer this summer.16 They have approached their bilateral
creditors, asking them for full debt forgiveness or—at a minimum—for relief on comparable
terms with commercial creditors.17 However, diplomatic relations with Taiwan Province of
China, the largest bilateral creditor, were ruptured in December 2004 when Grenada
established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. The authorities also
noted that the preference of some Paris Club creditors for a Fund program has complicated
matters.
26.
Although debt levels and debt servicing would decline under staff’s illustrative
burden-sharing scenario, Grenada would remain exposed to risks. The mission presented
several stress tests with reference to different risk factors, including natural disasters
(Tables 11 and 12). In some scenarios, debt increases substantially (Annex I). The authorities
agreed that burden sharing would pave the way for Grenada to emerge from its difficulties
but would not resolve all vulnerabilities.
Additional donor support
27.
Even with strong fiscal adjustment and creditor support, additional donor
support would be required to fill remaining financing gaps. The authorities urged the
international community, including the IMF, to play its part in triggering and providing
grants and technical assistance.

16

The extent to which sovereign claims of the domestic banking system will be included in the exchange offer
is still being discussed by the authorities and their debt advisors.

17

The assumptions underlying staff’s burden-sharing scenario are that bilateral creditors grant net present value
reductions similar to those granted by commercial creditors and that the CDB provides additional concessional
loans covering future debt service payments.

C. Reviving Growth and Enhancing the Growth Potential
28.
The authorities agreed that reconstruction, essential to restoring the economy’s
growth potential, has been proceeding slower than desired. A number of houses have
been re-roofed or reconstructed, but the vast majority of the homes are still in need of repair.
There has been some clearing of agricultural lands and replanting of short-cycle crops under
an emergency resuscitation program, which had to be halted temporarily owing to
administrative difficulties. A national replanting program for nutmeg and cocoa is expected
to commence soon. The authorities pointed to limitations of institutional capacity in relation
to the sheer magnitude of the effort required. They further noted that while relief and
rehabilitation aid had arrived quickly after Ivan struck, disbursement of grants for
reconstruction projects was proving much more cumbersome and slow moving.
29.
The mission discussed ways to speed up the reconstruction and to disseminate
information on the status of the effort.
•

The mission encouraged the authorities to set measurable targets. Moreover, collecting
and regularly disseminating information on the status of the reconstruction effort would
improve accountability and help assuage the population’s concerns regarding the slow
pace of reconstruction and recovery. The authorities agreed that information from
different sources on the reconstruction effort needed to be gathered more systematically.

•

The mission stressed the importance of stepped-up performance by ARD. The agency has
had a slow start, attaining a critical mass of staff and moving into permanent offices only
in March. The RDF is not yet operational. ARD’s staff acknowledged the teething
troubles, particularly the potential for institutional overlap with line ministries if lead
roles were not clearly spelled out. They are working to overcome some of the problems,
and are undertaking greater outreach to promote public understanding of the agency’s
role and its plan of action.

•

The mission stressed the importance of ensuring that the operations of ARD are
consistent with the overall prioritization of capital expenditures and decision-making of
Parliament through the budget discussions. Staff also urged that the RDF and ARD’s
operating expenditures be reported transparently as items in the regular budget. The
authorities noted that ARD’s activities are monitored by its Executive Board (which
includes the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) and will be subject to a
regular independent audit. They also pointed out that the separation of RDF and ARD
from regular budget procedures was done in part to assuage donor concerns that the
enormous task of reconstruction could not otherwise be carried out speedily and
transparently.

30.
There was broad agreement on ways to realize the country’s medium-term
growth potential. Staff and the authorities agreed that medium-term growth of 4−4½ percent
a year could be achieved through appropriate policies on a number of fronts:

- 24 -

•

Improving the investment climate: Diagnostic reviews have identified needed steps,
including changes in the investment code, changes in customs’ regulations to speed
up clearance, and strengthening the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation’s
capacity to serve as a ‘one-stop shop’ for investment.

•

Increasing the contribution of the service sector: The authorities agreed more could
be done to develop the tourism sector, the mainstay of the economy. Linkages
between agriculture and the tourism sector could be improved, for instance by having
farmers grow produce for use in hotels. The authorities also saw promise in
developing the sports and entertainment industries within the service sector.

•

Enhancing skills by training and tapping the diaspora: According to a World Bank
report, the shortage of local specialized skills is the main hindrance to raising private
investment and growth.18 Therefore, training and the quality of education need to be
enhanced. The very high rate of emigration from Grenada over the last few decades
has created a large diaspora in places such as Trinidad and New York (Figure 8). The
authorities indicated that they are considering ways to tap the diaspora’s skills, garner
funds for reconstruction and productive investment, and build networks for trade and
tourism promotion.

31.
The authorities agreed that there was a need for structural measures to bolster
competitiveness. The authorities felt that the quasi-currency board arrangement has served
Grenada well. However, they recognized that, given the fixed exchange rate regime and the
temporary setback to exports, continued inflows of foreign direct investment, remittances and
private capital transfers would be crucial to ensuring balance of payments sustainability. In
this regard, they noted that improving the investment climate and enhancing productivity are
especially critical.
32.
The mission discussed steps being taken to promote trade. The authorities have
begun formulating a national export strategy with support from the Commonwealth
Secretariat and in consultation with the private sector. The authorities indicated that benefits
from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with the European Union and other
industrialized countries remain limited for Grenada—key export products, including nutmeg,
cocoa, and spices, are not covered by GSP. In addition, market access to industrialized
countries has become more complicated by heightened administrative requirements, arising
from regulations such as the U.S. Bioterrorism Act.

The authorities are committed to deepening regional integration, in particular
through progress towards the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy
(CSME). They noted that potential benefits include collective provision of government
services, such as security, and harmonization of tax concessions. While CSME is slated to
become fully effective in January 2006, the authorities stressed that many elements of
CSME, including partial liberalization of labor movement, are already in place. Progress is
being made towards implementing the remaining elements, including changes to
administrative rules and procedures. The authorities, however, intend to seek an extension of
their right to impose certain quantitative restrictions after 2005.19 They stressed their
commitment to other ongoing regional initiatives, including the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States Economic Union and the Free Trade Area of the Americas.

19

Under Caribbean Community (CARICOM) rules, the right of least developed countries, including Grenada,
to impose quantitative restrictions on other CARICOM members, ends in 2005. Grenada has imposed
restrictions on a number of items (including curry, wheat flour, uncooked pasta, aerated beverages, and candles)
and intends to seek an extension by soliciting support from more developed CARICOM countries. For trade
with non-CARICOM countries, the restrictions have to be converted into tariffs in order to be consistent with
WTO rules. The authorities stated their intention to negotiate higher bound rates under WTO before converting
the quantitative restrictions into tariffs.

- 26 -

D. Reducing Vulnerabilities to Adverse Shocks
34.
Grenada’s high vulnerability to natural disasters emphasizes the need for
disaster-preparedness initiatives to cope with these shocks. The catastrophic impact of
Hurricane Ivan exposed deficiencies in Grenada’s disaster mitigation and management
capacity. The authorities noted that the National Disaster Management Agency (NaDMA) is
taking measures to rectify the situation by procuring better communications equipment,
working with communities to identify structures that proved resilient and could serve as
shelters and emergency housing, and raising awareness of and strengthening enforcement of
building codes.20 Staff was encouraged that new construction by aid agencies and the
national Housing Authority is reportedly resistant to category 3 hurricanes. The authorities
are exploring interest for risk-pooling in the region and are working with the World Bank to
investigate the cost-efficacy of regional catastrophe insurance pools as a risk transfer
mechanism.
35.
Maintaining a sound financial system is also key to limiting vulnerabilities and
sustaining growth. The mission urged that close attention be paid to the health of the
financial sector, especially to detect signs of stress that might arise on portfolio quality post
Ivan. Staff’s calculations suggest that the banking system could withstand a further
deterioration in nonperforming loans, although some banks are more vulnerable.21 The
authorities noted that the banking sector had held its own thus far, partly because before Ivan
struck, banks had been in a strong position, which provided them with room to maneuver,
including by increasing provisions.
•

The mission encouraged the authorities to ensure, in conjunction with the ECCB, that
effective banking supervision take place, including through onsite inspections. The
mission also urged a resolution without delay of the issue of the unregulated bank that
had been referred to the courts.

•

The authorities expect to bring shortly before Parliament the new Uniform Banking
Act that would enhance the effectiveness of banking supervision. However, it is
regrettable the recommendation of the regional Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) to give licensing authority to the ECCB is not likely to be accepted.

•

The authorities acknowledged that supervision of the insurance sector was weak, and
noted that this was a problem across the region. With the assistance of CARTAC,
draft insurance legislation is expected to be finalized by end year.

20

NaDMA is receiving technical assistance from the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency
(CDERA) and funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).

21

Relative to the impact from Hurricane Ivan, the adverse impact on bank balance sheets from debt
restructuring (on terms comparable to those assumed in staff’s illustrative burden-sharing scenario) is much
smaller.

- 27 -

•

The authorities noted that supervision of the nonbank financial sector, including
credit unions, money transfer agencies, the offshore financial sector and insurance
companies, is expected to be strengthened by passage of the Grenada Authority for
the Regulation of Financial Institutions (GARFIN) Act, which would establish a
single supervisory agency. Additional staff are also expected to be recruited.
E. Statistical Issues

36.
Despite ongoing efforts to enhance statistical databases, Grenada’s statistical
data remain weak in terms of coverage and timeliness. Major improvements in all areas
are needed, including in national accounts, tourism, labor markets, public enterprises, balance
of payments, and debt (Appendix IV). While data provision for surveillance purposes has
remained generally adequate, shortcomings have affected, for instance, the accuracy of
staff’s assessments of fiscal, labor market, and external sector developments. The authorities
acknowledged the need to enhance statistical databases, and are seeking financial and
technical assistance from donors. With assistance from the UNDP, a Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire survey is being conducted to improve the timeliness and reliability of poverty
monitoring data (Table 13). The data would help in designing better-targeted social safety
nets.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The Grenadians deserve credit for their efforts to recover from the effects of
Hurricane Ivan. The population showed resilience in putting their lives back together in the
face of a shock of unprecedented devastating magnitude. The government maintained fiscal
stability in 2004 under challenging circumstances—nonessential expenditures were
curtailed—and international support was marshaled quickly to help fill financing gaps.
38.
These efforts notwithstanding, the economic situation remains very difficult. The
economy is expected to recover slowly this year while the external current account deficit is
expected to deteriorate sharply. The fiscal situation is challenging and there are large
financing gaps in 2005 and beyond. Public debt, already at unsustainable levels, is projected
to rise further.
39.
Staff and the authorities agree that a comprehensive economic program is
needed to fill financing gaps, restore debt sustainability, and ensure medium-term
growth. The program should be centered on a medium-term macroeconomic framework,
with appropriately ambitious fiscal targets for the next 3–5 years based on a broad consensus
and approved by Parliament. The program should aim to: (i) close financing gaps and move
Grenada toward a sustainable debt level through a burden-sharing strategy—a combination
of fiscal adjustment, additional donor support, and a cooperative agreement with creditors;
(ii) bring about successful reconstruction and economic recovery and take steps to enhance
the growth potential; and (iii) reduce vulnerabilities to adverse shocks.

- 28 -

40.
There has been progress with the burden sharing strategy, but its eventual
success will require the cooperation of all stakeholders. The financing gaps are too large
to be filled through contributions from one source alone. While the authorities recognize this,
adequate support from creditors, donors, and the Grenadians is needed urgently.
41.
The government has shown a commitment to fiscal effort, but has not been able
to build the requisite consensus that would support its implementation. The authorities
agree that additional fiscal effort in 2006 and beyond is needed to contribute to filling
financing gaps in those years. The 2005 budget announced specific measures to help make
some of that contribution. However, while the impending increase in retail fuel prices has
been widely accepted by the public, the special levy on incomes has met with stiff resistance
from the opposition party and labor unions, forcing the authorities to consider changes to its
design. In addition to the passage of the levy, other revenue-enhancing measures, such as
continued increases in fuel prices toward world levels and reductions in tax concessions, will
be required.
42.
To build consensus, the authorities need to strengthen public consultations and
regularly disseminate information on both the fiscal situation and their reconstruction
efforts. Frequent consultations through town hall meetings, debates, and press conferences
could help build consensus. There is a need to set measurable targets and to collect and
regularly disseminate information on the status of the reconstruction effort. This would help
improve accountability and assuage concerns that not enough is being done. It is critical that
the tripartite negotiations among government, labor unions, and the private sector result in an
agreement that limits wage growth over 2006–09 to productivity increases.
43.
Progress has been made toward reaching a cooperative agreement with creditors
but hurdles remain. With help from their debt advisors, the authorities have made progress
in discussions with their commercial creditors and a debt exchange offer is expected to be
launched this summer. Progress is also being made in the discussions with official creditors
and the authorities have approached all their bilateral creditors for relief. However, the
situation is complicated by the diplomatic estrangement with Taiwan Province of China, the
largest bilateral creditor, and the preference of some Paris Club creditors for a Fund program.
44.
A successful reconstruction effort will require a stepped-up performance—and
increased transparency—from the Agency for Reconstruction and Development (ARD).
Eight months after Hurricane Ivan struck, the vast majority of the homes are still in need of
some repair, which is a source of great anxiety as the hurricane season gets underway. The
government and ARD, the main agency in charge of coordinating the reconstruction of both
private and public assets, need to focus on priority areas such as housing. It is regrettable that
the mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability of ARD’s operations, which were
promised at the donors’ conference last November, are still not fully in place. In particular,
the Grenada Reconstruction and Development Fund, the main conduit for the agency to
receive and account for the donor funds directed to reconstruction, should be made
operational. ARD’s operations should be recorded transparently in the budget.

- 29 -

45.
Staff and the authorities are in agreement on ways to realize the country’s
medium-term growth potential. The authorities’ medium-term program should outline the
specific steps being contemplated to improve the investment climate, increase the
contribution of the service sector to growth, and tap the diaspora for assistance. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ willingness to deepen regional integration.
46.
Even if the burden-sharing scenario unfolded as envisaged, Grenada would
remain exposed to risks. Financing gaps could re-emerge and debt and debt service could
rise substantially in the event of adverse shocks such as shortfalls in donor financing and tax
revenues, increases in real interest rates, natural disasters, and other exogenous economic and
financial events.
47.
The deficiencies in Grenada’s disaster mitigation and management capacity
need to be addressed immediately. The steps initiated by Grenada’s National Disaster
Management Agency—such as raising awareness of building codes and carrying out
inspections—are in the right direction and staff urges their continued and forceful
implementation. Staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to investigate the cost-efficacy
of regional catastrophe insurance pools.
48.
It will be critical to monitor the health of the financial sector closely. The ECCB
should ensure that effective banking supervision takes place, including through onsite
inspections. The issue of the unregulated bank should be resolved without delay. The new
Uniform Banking Act should be passed by Parliament and implemented as soon as feasible to
enhance the supervisory authority. Licensing authority should be transferred to the ECCB.
Supervision of the nonbank financial sector, including the insurance industry, should also be
strengthened as planned.
49.
Despite ongoing efforts to enhance statistical databases, Grenada’s statistical
data remain weak in terms of coverage and timeliness. Major improvements in all areas
are needed, including in national accounts, tourism, labor markets, public enterprises, balance
of payments, and debt. While data provision for surveillance purposes has remained
generally adequate, shortcomings have affected, for instance, the accuracy of staff’s
assessments of fiscal, labor market, and external sector developments. Staff welcomes efforts
to improve poverty assessment data, which would help in designing targeted social safety
nets.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle. Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to publish the mission’s concluding
statement and the transcript of the press conference held at the conclusion of the mission.

1/ Central government, government-guaranteed, and non-guaranteed public sector debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The baseline and downside scenarios are discussed in the text.
10/ The assumed expenditure path is similar in nominal terms to the baseline projections, while the revenue path is similar in terms of its ratio to GDP.
11/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007 10/
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 11/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

ANNEX I

Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability

1.
Under the current circumstances, Grenada’s large stock of public and publicly
guaranteed debt is unsustainable. In the baseline scenario described in the text, public debt
service is projected to range between 32 and 42 percent of revenue in 2005-10, and financing
gaps, already large at 5 percent of GDP this year, are expected to increase to 13 percent of
GDP in 2006-10. Both debt service ratios and financing gaps would increase further over the
longer term. Moreover, the ratio of public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP, already high
at 130 percent of GDP at end-2004, would continue its upward dynamics, reaching nearly
150 percent by 2010 (Table AI.1).
2.
The burden-sharing scenario discussed in the text implies a gradual return to
sustainability. The scenario assumes substantial additional fiscal consolidation over the
medium term, additional foreign grants, and the implementation of a comprehensive debt
restructuring in 2005. This burden-sharing among Grenadians, their donors, and their
creditors results in: (i) a primary fiscal surplus by 2008, which reaches 3.8 percent of GDP
over the longer term; (ii) a reduction in debt service obligations to between 10 and 18 percent
of GDP, and financing gaps that are fully covered; and (iii) a decline in the ratio of debt to
GDP to below 100 percent of GDP by 2010 and below 50 percent by 2020.
3.
Notwithstanding the considerable improvements in debt and debt service
dynamics, the burden-sharing scenario contains non-negligible risks. Staff presented to
the authorities a number of scenarios and bound tests which show that—depending on the
macroeconomic conditions—debt-service ratios and debt dynamics could turn out
considerably worse than under the burden-sharing scenario (Figures AI.1 and AI.2).
•

Natural disaster scenario. Staff presented a scenario assuming a natural disaster
in 2006 (Table AI.1). Although assumed to be of much smaller magnitude than
Hurricane Ivan, the disaster would lead to a decline in GDP growth relative to the
burden-sharing scenario by 3½ percent of GDP in 2006 and 1½ percent of GDP
in 2007. Notwithstanding an annual increase in foreign grants by 1 percent of GDP
in 2006 and 2007, the temporary decline in revenue collection and the increased
expenditure needs for reconstruction would lead to an expansion of the primary fiscal
deficit relative to the burden-sharing scenario by 4 percent of GDP in 2006, 3 percent
of GDP in 2007, and 1 percent of GDP in 2008. As a result, the debt-service burden
would increase markedly over time, reaching almost 28 percent of revenue over the
medium term. Similarly, the downward momentum in the debt-to-GDP ratio would
be diminished, with the ratio staying close to 130 percent until 2007.

•

Historical averages scenario and bound tests. A scenario using historical averages
for the projection of key variables, as well as a number of bound tests also point to

- 45 -

ANNEX I

non-negligible risk (Table 11).1 For instance, under the historical averages scenario,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue its upward trend, while under a bound test that
shocks real GDP growth, the real interest rate and the primary balance by one
standard deviation in 2006 and 2007, the debt-to-GDP ratio would quickly rise to
above 170 percent in 2007 before stabilizing.

Grenada is a member for the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per
U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasi-currency board,
maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities of close to
100 percent.

APPENDIX II

Grenada—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 25, 2005)
The FY 2002–06 Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
includes commitments of US$107 million for five borrowing member states of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), including Grenada. The main goals of
the strategy are to reduce income insecurity and vulnerability at the national and household
levels, and build human and institutional capacity to meet the challenging economic and
social environment. Most new projects are being provided, in close collaboration with subregional organizations and external partners, under a sub-regional umbrella mechanism using
horizontal Adaptable Program Loans (APLs). The World Bank is currently preparing a new
CAS for the OECS sub-region for FY 2006–09.
A. Projects
There are five active World Bank projects in Grenada for a net commitment of approximately
US$38 million as well as two Global Environmental Facility (GEF) projects with total
commitments of US$8.7 million.
The Grenada Disaster Management Project, approved in October 2000, is part of a regional
program for the OECS countries to fortify, reconstruct, and/or rehabilitate key economic and
social infrastructure and facilities, in order to minimize the potential damage or disruption
caused by future disasters, and to improve disaster response and emergency recovery. Of a
total program size of US$34 million, Grenada’s component is US$10.7 million.
In March 2002, the World Bank approved US$20.9 million in loans and credits to support
Emergency Recovery Projects in the OECS sub-region, including in Grenada. The projects
support efforts aimed at fostering recovery from the fallout of the events of
September 11, 2001, including: (i) efforts to safeguard the productive capacity of the tourism
sector by securing energy imports; (ii) investments to enhance security at sea ports and
airports; and (iii) the development of institutional capacity for security programs as mandated
by international civil aviation and maritime transport agencies. The Bank’s support to
Grenada under this project is for US$3.8 million.
The Grenada Education Reform Project, approved in June 2003 for US$8.0 million, is a
follow-up to an earlier education project. Its objective is to build human capital, with a view
to contributing to economic diversification and more sustainable growth. Key objectives are
to: (i) increase equitable access to secondary education; (ii) improve the quality of the
teaching and learning processes, with more direct interventions at the school level and an
increased focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthen management of the
education sector and to improve governance of schools.
Approved in July 2002, the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program is funded under
the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region. Its objectives are to: (i) curb the spread of
the HIV/AIDS pandemic; (ii) reduce the morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS;

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

(iii) improve the quality of life for persons living with HIV/AIDS; and (iv) develop a
sustainable organizational and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. The Bank’s support to Grenada under this project amounts to US$6.0 million.
In November 2004, the World Bank approved US$10 million in emergency assistance for
Grenada to respond to the effects of Hurricane Ivan. The project supports the recovery
efforts of the government of Grenada through the financing of critical imports and
rehabilitation activities in key social sectors.
Grenada is also participating in two Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects. The
Caribbean-Wide Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change Project became
effective in June 2003 and aims to facilitate an enabling environment for climate change
adaptation. The project components aim to: (i) build regional capacity to collect and analyze
data, thereby expanding the knowledge base on climate change impacts and helping to assess
the associated physical and socioeconomic vulnerabilities; and (ii) build in-country capacity
to formulate and analyze adaptation policy options and finalize sectoral adaptation strategies
for the countries. The project is being executed by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
and is intended to receive financing of approximately US$10.9 million, of which
US$5 million is GEF funding. The OECS Protected Areas and Associated Alternative
Livelihood became effective December 2004. It aims to remove barriers to the effective
management of protected areas, and to increase the involvement of civil society in the
planning, management and sustainable use of these areas. The OECS Secretariat will execute
the project and receive financing of about US$7.6 million, of which US$3.7 million is GEF
funding.
B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to: public sector capacity in the
OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, the OECS
Procurement Assessment Review, and the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment. In
conjunction with the IMF, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in
early 2004. The Bank also recently completed an OECS study on Growth and
Competitiveness. Work is ongoing on a review of large scale energy options for the OECS,
under the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program. Grenada also stands to benefit
from ongoing Caribbean-wide work on social protection.
For Grenada specifically, the Bank recently completed an Analysis of Fiscal Issues, which
examines the management and allocation of public expenditure. In June 2004, Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) conducted a diagnostic review with recommendations
to improve the investment climate in Grenada.

Grenada: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of March 31, 2005)
A.

Projects

In 2004, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved two loans and five grants to
Grenada with gross commitments of US$9.6 million. Special Development Fund (SDF)
resources were provided for programmes and projects that assisted Grenada advance its
economic recovery, reconstruction, and transformation process.
Given the importance of the nutmeg industry as a major contributor to Grenada’s economic
growth and development, the CDB approved a technical assistance grant amounting to
US$150,000 to assist the Government of Grenada (GOG) to assess the feasibility of
manufacturing and marketing value-added products from nutmeg with a view to promote
product diversification and enhance industry performance and competitiveness. The CDB
approved a technical assistance grant for the institutional strengthening of the Customs and
Excise Department to reduce the incidence of fraud and non-compliance and optimize
revenues. In education, a technical assistance grant was approved for the development of the
T.A. Marryshaw Community College. In the area of the environment, environmental training
workshops were conducted to impart the basic tools to conduct environmental screening and
scoping of projects while assistance was provided for the institutional strengthening for
environmental management.
Following the passage of Hurricane Ivan, the CDB approved immediate assistance in
September 2004, amounting to US$620,000 under its Natural Disaster Management Strategy
and Operational Guidelines (NDMSOG). This consisted of a grant of US$100,000 for
emergency relief, and a loan of US$500,000 and associated grant of US$20,000 to the GOG
for cleaning, clearing of debris, and restoring public services including utilities. In line with
the NDMSOG, which provides that the CDB, in consultation with the affected country, may
reallocate available balances under loans already approved, the Board of Directors approved
the reprogramming of approximately US$27.8mn in undisbursed credits from a number of
operations, in accordance with new priorities to be agreed between CDB and the GOG. This
included US$2.7 mn in grants under the CDB’s Basic Needs Trust programme. The GOG’s
counterpart contribution for projects financed utilizing these redirected resources was also
waived. In addition, a budget support loan of US$8.1 mn from its Special Development Fund
was provided to assist the GOG in meeting its fiscal obligations. The CDB also applied to,
and obtained from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a grant of US$200,000 for
the GOG for relief assistance for immediate repairs to housing and medical supplies to health
clinics. The grant was fully disbursed by the CDB in March 2005. At the same time, good
progress was made in assisting Grenada strengthen its capacity for hazard mitigation through
the development of disaster risk reduction policies and practices. Technical assistance was
provided to develop a national policy and operational framework for mainstreaming disaster
risk reduction into the reconstruction process. Training in incorporating disaster risk
management into development project is scheduled for 2005.

APPENDIX IV

Grenada—Statistical Issues
Grenada participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board, although these have not
been updated recently. The metadata include short- and medium-term plans for statistical
development. Improvement in several key areas are needed to facilitate effective
surveillance. Some of the outstanding issues are detailed below.
A.

Real Sector

There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. National accounts are provided
annually. However, GDP by expenditure is available only with long lags, and real GDP by
sector is not available. The estimation of gross capital formation needs to be improved and
sectoral price deflators computed. There are discrepancies in the foreign trade estimates
prepared by the customs department and the Central Statistical Office (CSO), and coverage,
consistency, and timeliness of tourism data are limited.
Consumer prices are the only real sector data provided between missions. The basket used to
compute the consumer price index was last updated in 2000. A producer price index is not
available.
Labor statistics are limited and outdated, with 1998 being the most recent year for which data
are available. There are no regular wage and unemployment data. Data collected during
the 2001 population census are still being processed. The CSO is working with the
International Labor Organization (ILO) to improve the coverage of labor market statistics.
B.

Public Finances

The reporting of central government data has improved in recent years, with data being
provided in Fund economic classification format with lags of about two months. However,
there appear to be inaccuracies in the composition of public expenditure. Moreover, capital
expenditures could include current expenditure items, and the nature of expenditures in the
Public Sector Improvement Program needs to be scrutinized carefully. In addition, spending
on outsourced activities is not broken down into the appropriate categories, but rather
grouped into a single category.
The coverage of the rest of the public sector is very limited, and there are no consolidated
public sector accounts. There is no systematic reporting of information to the Ministry of
Finance. Annual statements for some public enterprises are provided during Fund missions. It
would be useful to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data pertaining
to the rest of the public sector.
The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The 2002 GFS Yearbook
contains data for 1991 to 1995, and covers only the central government. No financing data

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

are reported. Grenada has not provided any fiscal data, either on a GFSM 2001 basis, or a
cash basis, for either the 2003 or the 2004 GFS Yearbooks.
C.

Monetary Accounts

The ECCB compiles monthly data on commercial banks with a lag of about two months.
Information is reported on a regular basis for publication in IFS. The Ministry of Finance
does not collect data regularly on nonbank financial institutions. Coverage of the offshore
financial sector is limited.
Expanding institutional coverage to include nonbank financial institutions, such as credit
unions and insurance companies, would enhance understanding of savings and credit as well
as improve compilation of monetary aggregates. In addition, improved classification of
financial instruments and loan categorization would enhance identification of credit flows to
different sectors of the economy.
D.

Balance of Payments

The ECCB compiles and reports balance of payments statistics on an annual basis, using
information collected by the CSO. Many of these statistics are based on information collected
from surveys, and are not comprehensive. Trade statistics are more reliable and are available
by SITC classification on a quarterly basis. The latest data published in the IFS and Balance
of Payments Yearbook are for 2002.
Enhanced data sources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy
of balance of payments statistics. Moreover, quarterly balance of payments statistics and
international investment position data are not compiled.
E.

External and Domestic Debt

The database for government and government-guaranteed external debt is quite
comprehensive, and can be used to provide detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of
disbursements and debt service. However, the database on domestic debt, including
government-guaranteed debt, is limited, and there is no compilation of data on private
external debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Grenada
On July 13, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Grenada.1
Early in the morning of July 14, just hours after the Article IV staff report was discussed by the
Executive Board, Grenada was struck by Hurricane Emily. The hurricane caused loss of life, injury
and significant damage to a country still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Ivan, which hit the
country in September 2004. Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato has written to Grenada’s Prime
Minister Mitchell, conveying the Fund’s sympathies and assuring him of its readiness to help the
people of Grenada in the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery that lies ahead.

Background
Grenada’s economy has been highly susceptible to changes in global economic conditions,
particularly growth in advanced economies, and to natural disasters. Macroeconomic
conditions have been difficult in Grenada since 2001 as a result of adverse shocks—the
decline in tourism in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the damage
caused by Tropical Storm Lili and Hurricane Ivan. Real GDP growth, on average, has been low
over the last five years compared with growth of nearly 6 percent a year in the late-1990s.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2The absence of sustained growth has added to fiscal and debt imbalances. Although fiscal
policy was expansionary in the mid-1990s, the public debt-to-GDP ratio remained broadly
stable at around 50 percent of GDP, as deficits were financed partly by privatization proceeds.
However, public debt spiraled to 110 percent of GDP by end-2003, as privatization receipts
declined, guarantees were granted, and leases associated with public-private partnerships
were purchased. As the economy began to recover in 2003, the government began to
consolidate its fiscal accounts. Nevertheless, debt remained very high and the associated
interest burden continued to rise.
Economic conditions and policy priorities changed abruptly when Hurricane Ivan hit in
September 2004. Damage from the hurricane exceeded 200 percent of GDP. The economy
contracted by 3 percent in 2004, a sharp reversal from the 4 percent growth that had been
projected for the year pre-Ivan. Progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as the authorities
gave priority to post-hurricane relief and rehabilitation and revenue collection stalled.
Nonessential expenditures were curtailed, and donor pledges of US$150 million (34 percent of
2004 GDP) were marshaled quickly through donor conferences. Grenada also received
US$4.4 million (25 percent of quota) under the Fund’s emergency assistance policy for natural
disasters in November 2004.
A month after Hurricane Ivan struck, the authorities announced public debt to be
unsustainable. In October 2004, they announced their intent to seek a cooperative solution
with their creditors and donors. Interest payments were missed in December 2004 on two
large international bonds pending their orderly restructuring. Grenada was downgraded to
‘selective default’ by Standard & Poor’s. In January 2005, Grenada hired legal and financial
advisors to assist in the formulation of a comprehensive debt-reduction strategy.
Inflation has remained low and stable within the framework of the currency board arrangement.
The inflation rate has averaged 2 percent over the past 15 years. The annual inflation rate in
April 2005 was 1.8 percent.
External current account deficits have been large, although mostly financed by foreign direct
investment and capital transfers. Having averaged around 20 percent of GDP in 1997–2000,
the current account deficit increased further to 32.7 percent by 2003. In 2001–03, more than
half of the current account deficits were financed by foreign direct investment, and nearly one
third by capital transfers, including migrant capital transfers.
Financial sector indicators have strengthened in recent years. Enforcement of regulations
governing the offshore sector improved, leading to Grenada’s removal from the Financial
Action Task Force list of noncooperative countries in February 2003. Prudential indicators of
the domestic banking sector have generally compared favorably with Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union (ECCU) averages, with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans being
the lowest in the region at 4½ percent at end-2003. After Ivan struck, banks granted moratoria
on loans, sharply increased loan loss provisions, and assessed loan-by-loan credit quality. The
share of nonperforming loans in the total rose to 5.8 percent at end-March 2005.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the people and government of Grenada for their efforts to
overcome the effects of the massive damage caused by Hurricane Ivan. They praised the
authorities’ actions to maintain fiscal discipline in 2004 while outlining an agenda for
reconstruction and reform under these daunting circumstances. Despite these efforts, the
situation remains challenging. Directors noted that the economy contracted by 3 percent last
year and is expected to recover only slowly over the course of this year. The external current
account deficit is expected to deteriorate, the government faces large financing gaps, and the
public debt stock stands at a very high level.
Directors welcomed the close cooperation between the authorities and the Fund staff to help
Grenada overcome these problems. They expressed strong support for the authorities’ intent
to adopt a comprehensive medium-term plan to fill financing gaps and reduce and restructure
public debt, with a view to restoring debt sustainability and boosting growth. Directors were
encouraged by the authorities’ progress with their home-grown structural adjustment program.
They noted that in the absence of an official financing package, a sharp fiscal adjustment
would be needed in order to restore external viability.
Directors agreed that filling financing gaps requires the collective effort of all stakeholders—
creditors, donors, and the Grenadian people themselves. In this context, they commended the
government for the measures proposed in the 2005 budget and urged their early
implementation to address fiscal imbalances. They noted that an increase in retail fuel prices
was scheduled for later this year and encouraged the adoption of social safety nets to protect
groups most vulnerable to the effects of this increase. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intent to continue to work closely with the staff on the design of a mechanism for regular
changes in retail fuel prices in line with world prices. They hoped that the public consultations
conducted by the government in recent weeks would result in the adoption of a special levy on
incomes that has broad support.
Most Directors noted, however, that further fiscal effort would be required beyond the
measures announced in the 2005 budget. Efforts should be made on the revenue side to
reduce tax concessions and strengthen tax audits and collection. On the expenditure side,
Directors urged wage moderation—following the cumulative increase of 40 percent in the
public sector wage bill over the last five years. They advised that public sector wage increases
should be aligned with productivity growth. Directors also drew attention to the importance of
carefully prioritizing capital expenditures. They supported the authorities’ requests for technical
assistance to catalyze their efforts.
Directors were encouraged by the generous donor pledges that Grenada received in the
aftermath of Hurricane Ivan, but noted that continued efforts were necessary to ensure the full
disbursement of pledged funds.
Directors welcomed the progress that the authorities have made in their discussions with
commercial creditors. They looked forward to the launch and successful completion of a debt
exchange offer. Directors urged the authorities to continue their dialogue with official creditors

-4and to respect the principle of inter-creditor equity. Several Directors saw an important role for
the Fund in assisting Grenada to move to a position of debt sustainability, including by
facilitating the process of restructuring the country’s Paris Club debt. The need to engage the
non-Paris Club creditors was also underscored.
Directors noted the important role that the Agency for Reconstruction and Development will be
required to play in bringing about Grenada’s economic recovery. They strongly urged that the
mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of donor funds be made fully
operational. In particular, the operations of the Reconstruction and Development Fund and the
Agency’s own operational expenses should be recorded transparently as an item in the
budget. The importance of setting clear priorities and enhancing implementation and capacity
building in carrying forward the reconstruction process was also noted.
Looking beyond the near-term recovery of the economy, Directors urged that the government’s
economic program should include structural measures to improve the investment climate and
increase the contribution of the services sector to growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’
recognition of, and willingness to promote, greater regional integration as a way of boosting
medium-term growth prospects.
Directors noted that Grenada’s high vulnerability to natural disasters highlights the urgent need
for strengthening its ability to prepare for and cope with these shocks. They accordingly
welcomed efforts to boost disaster mitigation and preparedness, particularly through better
enforcement of building codes. They welcomed the authorities’ openness to looking into ways
to transfer disaster risk, including through regional insurance pools.
Directors stressed the importance of close monitoring of the health of the financial sector.
They urged the authorities to ensure, in conjunction with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB), that there is effective supervision of the banking sector, including through onsite
inspections. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the legislative framework for
financial system regulation and supervision and their intention to strengthen regulation of the
insurance industry.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the quality, coverage, timeliness, and
frequency of the statistical database to facilitate policymaking and effective surveillance.
They welcomed the recent efforts to improve data on poverty, which should help in the design
of effective social safety nets.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
