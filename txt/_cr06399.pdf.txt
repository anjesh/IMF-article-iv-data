•

A mission visited Vientiane during November 7–18, 2005 for discussions on the 2005 Article IV
Consultation and met with Minister of Finance Chansy Phosikham, Acting Bank of the Lao P.D.R.
Governor Phouphet Khamphounvong, and other senior officials as well as representatives of the private
sector and civil society.

•

The staff team comprised Messrs. Bingham (head), Nakabayashi, and Syed (all APD),
Mr. Mirzoev (PDR) and Ms. Mishra (FAD). Ms. Phang and Mr. Sitthilath (both OED), and
Mr. Takeda (APD) also participated in the discussions. The mission was assisted by Mr. Beaugrand, the
resident representative, and liaised closely with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on November 29, 2004. Fund policy advice in recent
years has focused on consolidating macroeconomic stability and advancing structural reforms to improve
revenue mobilization and expenditure management, as well as strengthen the banking system. While there
has been broad agreement on macroeconomic policies, which has contributed to an improved
macroeconomic performance, progress in the structural area has been more difficult due to capacity
constraints and a lack of consensus on reforms.

•

Lao P.D.R.’s statistical data base has significant limitations for surveillance purposes (Annex IV). The
Fund has provided guidance on the steps needed to participate in the General Data Dissemination
Standard (GDDS) and the authorities are receiving assistance from Sweden (SIDA) to build up the
capacity of the National Statistics Office and address weaknesses in their statistical systems.

•

Lao P.D.R. maintains exchange restrictions imposed for the preservation of national or international
security, which have been notified pursuant to Decision No. 144–(52/51), and a restriction subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some transactions). Staff does
not recommend approval of this latter restriction, and has advised the authorities to eliminate it before
accepting the obligations under Article VIII.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Lao P.D.R.’s macroeconomic performance continued to be encouraging in 2005, but
underlying fragilities remain. Macroeconomic conditions remained stable and growth was
robust, driven by an expansion in the mining and hydro-power sectors. However, structural
reforms remained slow, especially with regard to revenue mobilization, and directed credits
at the state-owned commercial banks continue to pose a risk to macroeconomic stability.
The economic outlook is relatively favorable, if progress is made on structural reforms.
The main risk to the medium-term outlook is that fiscal reforms will remain slow and
tentative, undermining progress towards debt sustainability. In addition, a weak and underdeveloped banking system could pose a constraint on economic development. Sustaining
high rates of growth will also require a concerted effort to advance trade reforms and
improve the economy’s investment climate.
Discussions focused on policy priorities for consolidating macroeconomic stability and
laying the foundations for broad-based economic growth:
• Macroeconomic policies. Discussions focused mainly on establishing a sound framework
for the 2005/06 budget, based on realistic revenue targets and a sustainable expansion of the
wage bill, and containing the impact of large directed credits at the state-owned commercial
banks.
• Fiscal reforms. The focus has continued to be on advancing structural reforms to
mobilize revenues and improve expenditure management. Progress on both fronts will
involve strengthening collaboration with provinces, and ultimately necessitate a broader
reform of center-province relations.
• Banking reforms. There is a need for accelerated progress in restructuring the stateowned commercial banks, including by exploring more actively the possibility of seeking
joint-venture partners, and improving their regulatory framework. Further efforts are also
needed to extend the coverage of bank supervision and improve the overall banking
environment, by providing a more level paying field for all participants.
• Structural reforms. Private sector investment is needed to widen the resource base and
diversify exports. In this context, further efforts are needed to strengthen Lao P.D.R.’s
competitiveness, placing special emphasis on trade facilitation and reforms to the business
climate.
An Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of performance under Lao P.D.R.’s PRGF and ESAF
programs has been completed. The EPA concluded that the design of the programs had
been broadly appropriate, but that slippages with regard to key structural reform objectives
suggested that there had been insufficient government ownership.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Lao P.D.R.’s economic performance in recent years has been encouraging in
many respects. Macroeconomic conditions have been relatively stable, reflecting improved
monetary and fiscal discipline, and economic activity has been robust—particularly over the
last couple of years, when a number of large mining and hydro-power projects came on
stream (Chart 1). The gradual integration of the economy with that of its fast growing
neighbors has also brought substantial benefits and contributed to progress in reducing
poverty (Annex V).
2.
However, significant challenges remain. The macroeconomic situation is still
fragile, as the underlying fiscal trends—with spending on wages and debt service
outstripping revenue growth—are not sustainable, and directed credits at the state-owned
commercial banks continue to pose a risk to monetary stability. Sustained economic
development and poverty reduction also require reforms to improve Lao P.D.R.’s investment
climate, as the large projects that are currently driving growth have few linkages to the rest
of the economy (Box 1). There is also a need to improve the efficiency of public spending, as
Lao P.D.R. remains one of the poorest countries in the world and its social indicators
continue to lag far behind those of its neighbors in the region (Chart 2).
3.
The Article IV Consultation discussions were timely as the authorities were in
the process of finalizing their next development plan. The sixth national development plan
(2006–2010), which will be presented to the Seventh Party congress in April, provides an
opportunity to move the economic reform agenda forward, as there is a recognition that
progress needs to be made in key reform areas such as mobilizing budget revenues and
strengthening the state-owned commercial banks. However, the outlook for reform is
uncertain. While there is a broad consensus on the basic development strategy, some of the
underlying policies remain highly contentious, especially in the area of fiscal reform which
touches upon the sensitive issue of center-province relations.
4.
Lao P.D.R.’s PRGF arrangement, approved in April 2001, lapsed in April 2005,
with only three of six reviews completed (Annex I). Although macroeconomic performance
remained broadly on track, lack of progress on structural reforms and safeguards policies
prevented completion of further reviews. The accompanying Ex Post Assessment (EPA)
evaluates Lao P.D.R.’s performance under the PRGF and previous ESAF program, and
draws lessons for future Fund engagement (see section E).
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The economy performed well during 2005 (Table 1). Staff estimates that growth
increased to 7 percent in 2005 from 6½ percent in 2004, driven mainly by an expansion in
activity at the Oxiana gold and copper mine, and the construction of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2)
hydroelectric dam. The stimulus from these large projects, combined with buoyant growth in
tourism and non-traditional exports, more than offset the impact of the expiry of the

-5-

Box 1. Lao P.D.R.: Macroeconomic Impact of Large Projects
Lao P.D.R.’s medium-term outlook is significantly influenced by three large operations in the natural resource sector:
the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydroelectric power project, whose construction commenced in mid-2005 and which is
expected to begin exporting electricity in 2009; and Oxiana and Pan Australian, two foreign-owned gold and copper
mining companies which began operations in 2004–05 and are expected to reach full capacity by 2007.
Growth and employment. While these large projects are expected to make significant contributions to growth over
the next few years (on average, around 1½ percentage points per year during 2006–2010), this impact will ease as the
mining projects reach full capacity and construction of the NT2 dam winds down.1 Moreover, the projects have few
linkages to the rest of the economy, and will not be a major source of employment generation.2
Balance of Payments. Although the projects are expected to nearly double merchandise exports by 2010, their net
impact on the balance of payments is more modest. Net inflows are projected to average about 3 percent of GDP in
2005–2010. Over the next few years, a larger current account deficit, due to increased capital imports associated with
the construction of NT2, is expected to be more than fully financed by capital inflows in the form of private
NT2-related loans (Figure 1). This trend is projected to reverse around 2007, when an improvement in the current
account due to a surge in mining (and later, electricity) exports will be offset by large capital outflows associated with
the repayment of NT2-related loans and the repatriation of mining profits.
Budget. The large projects will generate additional budget revenues in the form of taxes, royalty payments, and
dividends. These revenues are expected to increase from 0.2 to 1.3 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2010 (Figure 2).
The fiscal impact is relatively modest for a project of its size (50 percent of GDP), because the revenue stream from
NT2 is significantly back loaded—indeed revenues from NT2 are expected to remain below 1 percent of GDP until the
end of the concession period in 2035. The government has agreed on a strategy with the major backers of the NT2
project to ensure that these revenues will result in increased spending on poverty reduction and environmental
protection. To ensure this, the government has launched a major public expenditure initiative (PEMSP).
Overall assessment. While the large projects will generate a substantial impact on Lao P.D.R.’s “headline”
macroeconomic indicators (growth, current account balance, etc.), their net impact on the economy will be more
modest. This reflects the fact that they are externally-financed enclave projects which are largely insulated from the
rest of the economy, and that the associated government revenue streams are also relatively moderate. Ensuring broadbased economic growth and continued poverty reduction will consequently depend mainly on the performance of the
“underlying” economy.

There will be a large (2½ percentage point) one-off-jump in growth in 2010, when the NT2 project comes on stream.

The mining projects employ about 2,000–3,000 workers. The NT2 project will ultimately employ about 5,000–6,000
workers during the construction of the dam, but this will drop to a few hundred once the plant is commissioned.

The balance of payments has held up
well in 2005, despite a number of adverse
shocks, but a high external public debt
remains an important vulnerability (Table 2).
A surge in mining exports helped offset the
impact of higher oil prices and lower garment
exports in 2005. Imports associated with the
NT2 project caused the external current account
deficit to widen to 16 percent of GDP, but this
was offset by higher capital inflows. External
reserves remained broadly unchanged, ending
the year at around $230 million, or 3 months of
imports (Figure 2). However, external public
debt remains high, at close to 80 percent of
GDP.5

The government has kept tight control over the cash budget deficit, despite slow
revenue growth and rising spending pressures (Table 3). The latest data suggest that the
budget deficit in 2004/05 was limited to 3½ percent of GDP, broadly unchanged from
2003/04. However, staff estimates that budget revenues, at 10.9 percent of GDP, were well
below the revised budget target of 11.4

The Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) has maintained monetary stability, but credit
developments at the state-owned commercial banks remain a concern (Table 4). Net
domestic assets of the BoL, which had expanded sharply in the first quarter of 2005, have
since stabilized, and the rapid growth in Kip reserve money has moderated. However, credit
growth at the state-owned commercial banks accelerated sharply in 2004/05 (35 percent),
largely on account of large credits that the banks extended to two projects.8 In addition to
breaching the BoL’s prudential regulations on single-borrower exposures and violating their
governance agreements, these credits caused a significant tightening of the liquidity position
of the two main state-owned commercial banks (BCEL and LDB). Both banks were having
difficulty meeting their reserve requirements in the latter half of 2005.
10.
Progress on structural reforms has been mixed. The government has taken a
number of positive steps to strengthen the investment climate and move trade reform forward
(see paragraphs 28 and 29). However, progress in core macroeconomic reforms has been

The authorities are reporting a higher revenue outturn (11.2 percent of GDP), but staff
understands that this includes “accrued” revenues (e.g., provincial estimates of tax arrears).

For example, the government is running arrears on its utility bills and does not have
sufficient funds to distribute donor-funded vaccines.

limited. While a new Customs law addressing a number of WTO-related issues (e.g., on
customs valuation) was enacted and progress made in rolling out a new government financial
information system (GFIS), the broader fiscal reform agenda is still stymied by a lack of
consensus on how to strengthen the central government’s control over provincial tax,
customs, and treasury operations. On the banking side, the financial position of the
state-owned commercial banks remains precarious9 and the extension of large directed
credits to the Thakek project has highlighted weaknesses in their oversight.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
11.
Staff has updated its assessment of the economic and debt sustainability outlook,
on the assumption that structural reforms will be accelerated (Annex VI). In such a
scenario, headline GDP growth is projected to stay at 6–7 percent, with underlying
growth—i.e., excluding the effects of the large projects—being sustained at 5 percent.10 In
addition to the stimulus from the NT2 project and a continued expansion of gold and copper
production, the scenario assumes that further integration of the economy into the region—
driven by the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) and other regional initiatives11—will
also raise growth, particularly in agriculture, tourism, and small-scale manufacturing.
12.
However, there are a number of risks to the outlook. In the short-term, the main
risk to macroeconomic stability stems from the fragile condition of the budget and the
state-owned commercial banks. The possibility of a natural disaster—such as an avian flu
pandemic—also poses a risk to economic prospects. Sustaining underlying growth at
5 percent over the medium-term will require concerted efforts to advance trade reforms and
improve the economy’s investment climate.12 This will become increasingly important when
the stimulus from the large projects starts to diminish towards the end of the decade. In the
absence of progress on this front, underlying growth is projected to slow to around
3–4 percent, limiting the potential for employment generation and poverty reduction.

9

The capital deficit of the two main state-owned commercial banks stood at around 4 percent
of GDP at end-2004.
10

This relatively positive outlook is less optimistic than the authorities’ medium-term growth
targets, which are in the range of 7–8 percent.

11

Including the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, which
aims to promote investment, agriculture and tourism, and the AsDB’s Greater Mekong
Sub-Region program, which focuses on developing infrastructure and transport links.

12

The contribution to growth from traditional exports such as timber and garments is
expected to be modest.

IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions focused on the main macroeconomic policy priorities for the
sixth development plan. The authorities acknowledged that much remains to be done to
consolidate macroeconomic stability and lay the foundations for broad-based economic
growth. In addition to the long standing issues in fiscal management and the banking sector,
the discussions focused on steps to improve the investment climate, which is essential for
raising Lao P.D.R.’s growth potential.
A. Fiscal Policy
15.
The main short-term priority is to avoid an unsustainable expansion of
spending, especially on the wage bill. In this context, staff noted that the revenue target in
the 2005/06 budget plan (11.9 percent of GDP) was overambitious and that the plan to
further reduce non-wage domestic spending14 was unlikely to be sustainable. To strengthen
the budget plan, staff proposed that the authorities adopt a more conservative revenue target
(11.6 percent of GDP), and limit the wage bill to 5.0 percent of GDP—rather than
5.2 percent in the budget plan—to alleviate the compression in non-wage spending in priority
sectors. Staff also proposed that the budget deficit be reduced from 4.2 to 4.0 percent of
GDP, at which level it would be fully financed by concessional donor financing.

13

The debt service-to-export ratio is less elevated, remaining in the range of 7 to 9 percent.

14

Excludes donor-financed capital spending.

- 10 -

16.
The authorities agreed with the need to limit the growth in the wage bill, which
had been rising rapidly in recent years. To this end, they had decided not to award an
increase in base salaries in 2005/06. They were planning to recruit an additional
8,000 employees for priority sectors (e.g., education and health), but were confident that they
could limit the wage bill to 5.0 percent of GDP, provided that they managed to contain
recruitment of contractual employees by the provinces. The authorities acknowledged some
uncertainty in the revenue outlook, and agreed that it would be prudent to make the planned
recruitment of additional staff conditional on a satisfactory revenue outturn in the first
semester.
17.
The longer term challenge is to enable Lao P.D.R. to meet its substantial
development needs within a sustainable fiscal framework. In this regard, staff noted that
the planned increase in the budget deficit over the medium-term to 4½ percent of GDP (or
more)15 did not appear consistent with the outlook for available ODA flows. Moreover, the
staff’s debt sustainability analysis suggested the need for some fiscal consolidation. Staff
consequently proposed that the government aim to lower the budget deficit to 3–3½ percent
of GDP over the medium-term, which would be consistent with reducing government debt to
65 percent of GDP by 2010.
18.
It was agreed that the main priority is to mobilize revenues. While there is some
scope for additional tax policy measures,16 there is a consensus that the focus should be on
improving tax administration, and that this will require strengthening central control over the
administration of major taxes (e.g., customs and the turnover tax). The latter will ultimately
need a broader reform of the decentralization framework (see paragraph 20), but there is
potential in the interim for greater collaboration between the center and provinces, which
could yield a significantly improved revenue performance. The discussions focused in
particular on the following:
• Incentives. The new revenue bonus scheme proposed by the government could reduce
the incentive of provinces to collaborate with the center in revenue mobilization. Under the
new scheme, provinces would be required to remit all revenues in excess of their spending
needs to center, in return for a small fee (0.5–1.5 percent of revenues collected). In staff’s
view, collaboration would be strengthened if the government retained the existing scheme of
incentives, which allows the provinces to keep a significant share of any revenues collected
in excess of their targets—provided these targets are set realistically (Box 2).
15

The authorities indicated that the fiscal framework in their draft development plan had yet
to incorporate additional allocations for priority sectors.

16

The introduction of a VAT—currently scheduled for 2008/09—remains the main tax
policy change in the medium-term. In the interim, there is scope for raising revenues through
moving to a single-rate turnover tax and adjusting excises (especially on diesel and tobacco).

Box 2. Lao P.D.R.: Center-Province Fiscal Relations
Center-province relations have been a major issue on the fiscal reform agenda in Lao P.D.R. In particular, the
fragmented administration of major taxes has been an important contributory factor to the poor revenue
performance.
Current Situation17
Currently in Lao P.D.R., the majority of
taxes are administered by the provinces.
Each province is assigned
revenue and expenditure targets that are
formulated in the context of the annual
national budget plan. In principle, surplus
provinces are expected to remit their entire
surplus to the center and deficit provinces
are covered by transfers from the center.

Provinces whose revenue collections
exceed their assigned targets are permitted
to retain 50 percent of this excess revenue,
with the balance remitted to the center.
Provinces who fail to meet their revenue targets are expected to reduce their expenditures accordingly.

The system, however, does not work effectively for a number of reasons. First, the fragmentation of tax
administration has severely compromised efforts to enforce tax compliance. The center’s control over provincial
operations is limited since the provinces have powerful support from regional factions within the party
hierarchy. Moreover, civil servants in the provinces report predominantly to the Governor, who typically
controls the payroll. Tax enforcement is also undermined by ad hoc exemptions granted by the provinces to
promote investment in their regions. Second, the tendency towards overambitious revenue targets in the national
budget plan has reduced the incentive of provinces to participate in efforts to mobilize revenues, as the
possibility of provinces being able to outperform their targets (and retain some of the excess revenues) is
effectively eliminated. Moreover, with provinces expected to remit all of the difference between their revenue
targets and expenditure allocations, they have little incentive to collect more than their expenditure needs.
Regional Experience
Both China and Vietnam faced similar challenges and launched reforms to address weaknesses in their fiscal
arrangements. These reforms were broadly successful in enhancing tax administration, boosting revenues, and
increasing resources available to the center. This was achieved by (i) giving the center the authority to
administer key taxes; and (ii) introducing a revenue sharing formula, which assigned taxes between the center
and the provinces and incorporated a rules-based transfer mechanism. These experiences suggest that provinces
can be persuaded to relinquish control over the administration of major taxes, provided that a credible
framework for revenue sharing and government transfers is put in place. The experiences of China and Vietnam
does, however, also suggest that more attention needs to be placed in the design stages to ensure that the transfer
system is sufficiently equitable and transparent (as discussed in the Selected Issues Chapter).

This describes the situation at the end of FY 2004/05.

• Capacity building. The main priority is to reduce the fragmentation in the administration
of major taxes. On the customs side, implementing the new Customs Law, which clarifies the
roles and responsibilities of the center and provinces, would be a step forward, as would
establishing regional customs offices to oversee operations in the provinces. This would
complement ongoing reforms to strengthen capacity at customs headquarters in Vientiane.
On the tax side, the focus should be on improving oversight of large and medium taxpayers,
through re-establishing a tax identification number (TIN) system initially in the national
Large Tax Payer Unit and the three largest provincial tax offices. The TIN would form the
basis of a tax reporting system for these offices.18
19.
Staff discussed progress under the Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP), being supported by the World Bank. The longer term
goal is to establish a strong National Treasury with effective control over public finances.19
Budget planning and execution are also to be strengthened to improve public service
delivery. In the shorter term, the authorities have developed an annual implementation plan
for the PEMSP for 2005/06, which would focus on the following key priorities: (i) revising
the chart of accounts, to develop a functional classification that would enable the government
to monitor expenditures in key activities (e.g., primary education); and (ii) extending the
GFIS system to cover the center and all major provincial treasury offices.20
20.
The sixth development plan is expected to give greater prominence to the reform
of center-province relations. This reflects a recognition that there needs to be a clearer
assignment of revenues and expenditures between the center and provinces, and a credible
mechanism for revenue sharing and intra-governmental transfers. Provinces are unlikely to
cede control over revenue and treasury operations until such a framework is in place. The
authorities emphasized that this issue is highly sensitive, and that building consensus for
reform was likely to take some time. However, they intend to initiate discussions with the
provinces on reforms to center-province fiscal relations, which may be incorporated into
planned revisions to the organic budget law.21 Staff also noted that the experience of

18

The tax reforms are being supported by a technical assistance program from Sweden
(SIDA). With expiration of UNDP’s Customs project, the department is only receiving
peripatetic support from the IMF.

19

This would, inter alia, require a common pooling of national revenues and rationalizing the
government’s banking arrangements to bring them under the National Treasury’s control.

21

The objective is to produce regular budget execution reports for the center and provinces.

The Ministry of Finance plans to finalize a revised draft of the budget law by the end of
2006.

neighboring countries (such as China and Vietnam), who had overcome similar challenges in
raising their revenue effort, could provide valuable lessons for Lao P.D.R.22
B. Monetary and Banking Issues
21.
The authorities reiterated that policy would remain geared towards containing
inflation and did not envisage any major changes in the monetary framework. The
broad aim would continue to be to keep the BoL’s net domestic assets, the main anchor of
monetary policy, relatively stable. This would be underpinned by a government commitment
to avoid bank financing of the budget. The authorities expected the level of gross reserves to
be maintained at around 3 months of imports, which would be consistent with reserve money
growing at around 12 percent.
22.
Staff endorsed the authorities’ basic approach to exchange rate management.
The current policy of keeping the Kip relatively stable has served Lao P.D.R. well in the past
couple of years (Figure 5), with the authorities being able to smooth out most fluctuations in
the exchange rate, without jeopardizing
9,000
225

their reserve position.23 Staff agreed that a
more flexible Kip would be unlikely to
9,300
235
materially affect Lao P.D.R.’s

competitiveness, because of the high level

The authorities were aware of the risks posed by the large directed credits to the
Thakek cement project. They indicated that the state-owned commercial banks had been
instructed to freeze further credits to the project and that the government was actively
seeking a strategic investor to place the project’s finances on a more sustainable footing.
Staff welcomed these initial steps but emphasized the urgency of securing alternative sources

Exchange rate management has been sufficiently flexible to ensure that the parallel market

of funding, to avoid pressure on the banks to provide further credits to the project.25 This
experience has also highlighted the need for a coherent regulatory framework for single
borrower exposures and stricter oversight by the BoL.
24.
The authorities indicated that they were rethinking some of the broader
elements of their state bank reform strategy.26 In particular, they were beginning to
explore more actively the possibility of seeking joint-venture partners for the banks, although
they acknowledged that achieving consensus on this might take time. In the interim, the
focus would be on improving and enforcing the governance agreements of the state-owned
commercial banks, within the framework of the AsDB-supported state bank restructuring
program. Staff supported the plan to start recapitalizing the banks, but urged the authorities
to ensure that it be conditional on progress in their reform. Staff also encouraged the
authorities to maintain a complement of international advisers in the banks until their
operational restructuring was more advanced.
25.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to make further progress in strengthening
the general banking system. The main priority is to strengthen bank supervision. In
addition to building up the supervisory capacity of the BoL and improving bank regulations
to limit the scope of regulatory forbearance, supervision of private banks should be
strengthened as they are not effectively covered at the moment.27 Bankers also emphasized
the need to strengthen contract enforcement mechanisms and ensure a level playing field,
particularly with regard to differential capital requirements, the restrictions on opening
branches outside of Vientiane, and the state bank monopoly on natural-resource related
banking services.
C. External Debt Issues
26.
The mission discussed the potential implications of the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) for Lao P.D.R. The authorities noted that the MDRI would significantly
reduce external public debt (Figure 6), but noted that the requirement to participate in the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative could cause complications. In particular, the cash flow
implications for the budget would be somewhat uncertain under such a scenario. In addition
to a lower gross IDA allocation—a feature of the MDRI—participation in the HIPC Initiative
would likely have ramifications for Lao P.D.R.’s relations with creditors and donors,
particularly given their earlier commitments to creditors not to seek HIPC debt relief.
25

Staff understands that further credits have since been provided, raising the banks’
combined exposure to $30 million.

26
27

See Chapter II of accompanying Selected Issues.

This will also be important to bring Lao P.D.R. into line with international anti-money
laundering regulations.

- 15 -

Consequently, while the MDRI
had prompted some discussion
within government, the
authorities foresaw a number of
obstacles to Lao P.D.R.
participating in the two
initiatives.

limited borrowing space, staff
underscored the need to continue efforts to mobilize grants and highly concessional loans,
and ensure that new funds are allocated to projects with the highest economic and social
return. Borrowing on less concessional terms should be limited only to projects with firm
financial viability. Establishing such viability in a transparent and credible manner would be
important to maintain creditor confidence in government policies.
D. Structural Reforms
28.
Accelerating private sector development is a key objective of the government. In
addition to addressing Lao P.D.R.’s substantial infrastructure needs, which are being tackled
by the AsDB and other donors, there has been an increased focus in recent years on
improving the investment climate, which ranks poorly relative to neighboring countries. In
this context, the main constraint on investors has been the absence of clear and predictable
“rules of the game” for operating in Lao P.D.R. The approval of a New Enterprise law in
2005, which streamlines licensing and other regulatory requirements imposed on the business
community, is a step forward, as the law, if fully implemented, should help reduce the cost
(and uncertainty) of doing business in Lao P.D.R. However, more needs to be done to make
laws and regulations less vague and open to discretion by officials.28 Longer term there will
also need to be a greater focus on developing the legal and judicial system to provide
effective, rules-based, mechanisms for dispute resolution and contract enforcement.
29.
The authorities recognize that maintaining the momentum of trade reform will
also be critical for developing the private sector. They indicated that significant progress
had been made in this respect over the past year. In addition to moving ahead with their
commitments under AFTA, the government has signed an important bilateral agreement to
normalize trade relations with the United States (NTR) and begun formal negotiations for
WTO accession. They noted that import licenses at the central level were now limited to only
28

These issues are discussed in greater length in the forthcoming Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study prepared by the World Bank.

four products— fuel, cement, steel and vehicles— but acknowledged that more needed to be
done to rein in additional regulatory requirements imposed by the provinces.
E. Ex Post Assessment of Program Engagement, 1993–2005
30.
The EPA team concluded that Lao P.D.R. had made significant progress under
the ESAF and PRGF programs, but many challenges remained. The team noted that
economic growth had been strong, balance of payments stability had been restored, and
poverty had been significantly reduced. Lao P.D.R. had also made good progress in its
transition to a market based economy. However, the underlying macroeconomic situation
remained fragile, because of weaknesses in the fiscal position and the large burden of
external public debt. More also needed to be done to enhance the competitiveness of the
economy, by improving the trade and investment regime. Strengthening public expenditure
management to ensure a more effective use of fiscal resources towards poverty reduction was
also a priority.
31.
The design and conditionality of the ESAF and PRGF programs were
considered to have been broadly appropriate. However, slippages with regard to key
policy objectives on revenue mobilization, public sector financial management, and banking
sector reform, suggested that there had been insufficient government ownership of reforms,
especially under the PRGF program. The lack of progress on safeguards policies was an
additional complication. While the staff had endeavored to correct the slippages in these
areas, the EPA team considered that the program had appropriately been allowed to lapse
after the third review was completed.
32.
The main challenge going forward would be to foster greater consensus for
needed structural reforms, especially in the fiscal and banking areas. Progress on the
latter should be a precondition for any future Fund program. In the meantime, the EPA team
was of the view that surveillance, combined with appropriately targeted technical assistance,
would be the most appropriate form of engagement. Close and effective collaboration with
donors would be essential in this regard.
33.
The authorities expressed broad agreement with the EPA report. They
considered that the general design and conditionality of the Fund programs had been wellsuited to meet Lao P.D.R.’s needs, and that the programs had contributed to the economy’s
transition to a market-based system. Their main reservation was that the programs had, on
occasion, focused excessively on stabilization objectives, without due consideration to the
need to encourage investment and economic growth. They agreed that reforms in some areas
fell short of program targets, and acknowledged the difficult challenges posed by Lao
P.D.R.’s decentralized fiscal system. However, they thought that capacity constraints rather
than lack of government ownership had been the most important factor in slowing the pace of
reform. They consider Lao P.D.R.’s current engagement with the Fund, through surveillance
and technical assistance, to be well-suited to the country’s needs in the near term.

- 17 -

F. Data Issues
34.
There is a broad recognition that the quality of economic statistics needs to be
improved for effective monitoring and policy formulation. The main priorities are to
strengthen the balance of payments, where the absence of reliable data is a major impediment
to the analysis of economic developments. It is also the major constraint in the construction
of a robust system of national accounts. Further strengthening of the quality of government
finance statistics is also needed, especially at the provincial level. There is also a need to
address weaknesses in the accounting systems at the BoL, which in addition to contributing
to delays in finalizing the 2003 and 2004 audits, are also impeding effective monitoring of
monetary and foreign exchange developments.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The economy’s performance in 2005 continued to be relatively encouraging, but
underlying fragilities remain. Macroeconomic conditions remained stable and growth was
robust, driven by an expansion in the mining and hydro-power sectors. The authorities
maintained disciplined monetary and fiscal policies, but the pace of structural reforms to
strengthen the budget and state-owned commercial banks continued to be slow.
36.
The economic outlook is favorable, if progress is made in structural reforms.
Growth should remain strong during the next few years, provided that the stimulus from the
NT2 hydroelectric dam and the planned expansion in mining activity is complemented by
reforms to facilitate private sector development and promote further trade liberalization. The
external outlook is also reasonably buoyant, as these large resource projects should generate
sizeable net balance of payments inflows. The main risk to the medium-term outlook is that
the pace of reforms remains slow and tentative on the fiscal side, undermining progress
towards debt sustainability. Without further reform, the state-owned commercial banks will
also continue to pose a threat to macroeconomic stability.
37.
On the fiscal side, the immediate challenge is to avoid an unsustainable
expansion of spending, especially on the wage bill. In addition to having the 2005/06
budget based on more conservative revenue targets, steps should be taken to limit the growth
in the wage bill to provide adequate resources for non-wage spending. The main priority is to
rein in unauthorized recruitment of contractual employees by the provinces, but the planned
recruitment of teachers and health workers should also be made conditional on a satisfactory
revenue performance to ensure that it is sustainable. Staff also encourages the authorities to
limit the budget deficit to no more than 4.0 percent of GDP, which would be consistent with
available concessional donor financing.
38.
The medium-term priority is to mobilize revenues to enable Lao P.D.R. to meet
its development needs within a sustainable fiscal framework. This is especially important
given the need for some fiscal consolidation over the medium-term to bring the level of debt
down to sustainable levels. While an increase in mining revenues will make a contribution,
reforms to strengthen central government control over provincial revenue and treasury

- 18 -

operations will need to be accelerated. This will ultimately require a broader review of
center-province relations, as provinces are unlikely to cede control until a clear and credible
revenue sharing framework is in place. However, the process of achieving consensus on this
key reform is likely to take some time. In this context, the authorities’ intention to hold
discussions with the provinces is welcome and in the interim, greater collaboration with the
provinces should be fostered, through providing an effective incentive structure, and capacity
building efforts at the tax and customs departments should be advanced.
39.
Progress under the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program is
essential to strengthen fiscal management and improve the allocation of public
resources. The main priorities in the short-run will be to improve budget reporting, inter alia
by revising the chart of accounts, and strengthening budget monitoring by developing an
effective reporting system covering key provincial treasury offices.
40.
Prudent debt management will be needed to mitigate the risks from Lao P.D.R.’s
high debt burden. This will be particularly important if Lao P.D.R. decides not to avail
itself of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. In addition
to maximizing grant funding and borrowing only on highly concessional terms, a gradual
reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement will be needed to ensure progress in
reducing the public debt burden.
41.
The current framework of monetary and exchange rate policy is appropriate,
but oversight of the state-owned commercial banks needs to be strengthened. The initial
steps to limit the exposure of the banks to a large domestic cement project were appropriate,
but there is an urgent need to find a strategic investor for the project to put its finances on a
sustainable footing. Recent reports of further credits by the state-owned commercial banks to
the project are of concern. The experience has also highlighted the need for a coherent
regulatory framework for single borrower exposures.
42.
The authorities’ intention to explore more actively the possibility of seeking
joint-venture partners for the banks is welcome. In the interim, the focus should be on
strengthening the governance frameworks for the banks. Greater progress is also needed to
improve bank supervision and strengthen the general banking environment, especially with
regard to providing a more level playing field for new entrants.
43.
The authorities have taken steps to improve the investment climate and
promote trade, but more needs to be done. The authorities’ commitment to moving ahead
with AFTA and starting the process of WTO accession is an important step towards
integrating the economy into the regional and global markets. However, more needs to be
done to improve the economy’s competitiveness. In addition to reducing the cost of business
by streamlining licensing and regulatory requirements, improving governance is a key
priority, as the absence of clear and predictable “rules of the game” for operating in Lao
P.D.R. is a major constraint for investors. The development of the legal and judicial system
to provide effective, rules-based, mechanisms for dispute resolution and contract
enforcement is an important longer term priority.

- 19 -

44.
Economic monitoring and policy formulation are being hampered by the poor
quality of economic statistics. The main priorities are to strengthen the balance of
payments, where the absence of reliable data is a major impediment to the development of
effective national accounts, and to improve the quality of government finance statistics,
particularly at the provincial level. Weaknesses in the accounting systems at the BoL, which
are impeding effective monitoring of monetary and foreign exchange developments, also
need to be addressed.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Lao P.D.R. take
place on the standard 12 month cycle.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative

Lao P.D.R. is eligible for assistance under the HIPC Initiative. However, to date the authorities
have indicated that they do not want to avail themselves of this facility.

Safeguards Assessments

A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) was completed in April 2003 with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in 2001. The main findings, recommendations,

- 27 -

ANNEX I

and progress thereon, were reported in IMF Country Report No. 03/308 and IMF Country
Report No. 05/8. Progress on safeguards recommendations has been slow. The authorities
have indicated that they are not in a position to implement an earlier agreement to undertake
a joint-audit of the BoL’s 2003 and 2004 accounts by the state auditor and an international
audit firm.
IX.

Exchange Rate

In September 1995, Lao P.D.R. adopted a managed floating exchange rate system. From
October 1997, commercial banks have been encouraged to follow the parallel market closely.
From October 27, 2003, the commercial bank exchange rate is calculated by the BoL as the
weighted average of the previous day’s commercial banks’ and interbank market rates. The
BoL provides this reference rate to the commercial banks, who then set their own rates,
keeping them close to the parallel market rates. On January 30, 2006 the commercial bank
exchange rate was kip 10,450 (buying) and kip 10,540 (selling) per U.S. dollar.
X.

Exchange and Payments System

Lao P.D.R. no longer maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV,
Section 2, but maintains restrictions imposed solely for the preservation of national or
international security, which have been notified pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51), and a
restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required
for some transactions). A joint LEG/MFD mission in August 2004 conducted a review of the
exchange system to establish the remaining measures that would facilitate Lao P.D.R.’s
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, including the elimination of an exchange
restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Last Article IV Consultation Discussions

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during July 21–

ANNEX II

Lao P.D.R.: Fund-Bank Relations Annex29
Partnership for Development
The Government (GOL) of the Lao Peoples’ Democratic Republic (P.D.R.) aims to achieve
rapid economic growth in order to improve the living conditions of its poor and graduate
from its status as a least-developed country. The World Bank Group—International
Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Mekong Private
Sector Development Facility (MPDF), World Bank Institute (WBI) and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)—provides technical and financial support to
Lao P.D.R. in the implementation of this strategy.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
The IMF takes the lead in advising the GOL on macroeconomic policy. This support covers
tax, fiscal, monetary, interest rate and exchange rate policies, balance of payments and
related statistical issues. In addition, some aspects of four structural policy areas that have an
important bearing on macroeconomic performance (financial sector, revenue administration,
public expenditure management, and trade policy) are also integral to the Fund’s work
program. The Bank has taken the lead in supporting the GOL in growth strategies, poverty
analysis and advice, poverty and social impact assessments, consultations for the poverty
reduction strategy, SOE reform and restructuring, and legal/judicial development, in addition
to natural resource management and sectoral reforms. The Bank in coordination with the
Fund advises the GOL on structural areas of the financial sector, public expenditure
management and trade policy as well as in supporting the GOL in the implementation of its
poverty reduction strategy (NGPES). Both institutions also collaborate closely with the
AsDB on financial sector reform and public expenditure management, and with the UN
agencies in the trade policy and the NGPES implementation and costing.
Bank and Fund Policy Dialogue
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Bank and the Fund, together with UNDP, have provided
assistance to the GOL’s process of formulating its medium-term poverty reduction strategy.
In April 2001, the GOL submitted an I-PRSP to the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF,
and Progress Reports on the preparation of the full PRSP were submitted in August 2002 and
September 2003. In May 2003, the GOL circulated the first draft of the full PRSP, which was
initially called the National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP). The final text takes the
name of National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), and is based on the
five-year National Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2001–05 (NSEDP). The Bank and

ANNEX II

the Fund’s Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the strategy has been prepared in
October 2004, and was considered by the IDA and IMF Boards in November 2004.
Public Expenditure Management. In 2002, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure,
Financial Management and Procurement Review (PER), jointly with the IMF, the AsDB and
the GOL. These assessments provided a further basis for the GOL’s reform program that has
been supported by the IMF’s PRGF and by the Bank’s financial support in the form of the
Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC),30 and the technical assistance provided
by the Financial Management Capacity Building Credit (FMCBC), the IDF grants to improve
public financial management, the efficiency of the procurement regime, and tariff-studies.
Over the medium term, the Bank expects to further support public financial management
reforms through a number of Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs). The PRSOs,
adjustment operations supporting the implementation of the NGPES, will assist the
GOL’s reform efforts, inter alia, in the areas of public sector governance, social sectors,
trade, and private sector development (PSD). PRSO-1 was considered by the IDA and
IMF Boards in March 2005, and supported critical public sector reforms targeted to
(a) public resource management; (b) public expenditure policies; and (c) sustained growth.31
The GOL has agreed to the implementation of the Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP) and of a rolling program of PERs, public expenditure
tracking surveys (PETS) and analytical work geared to monitoring progress in the
implementation of PEMSP and assessing the compliance environment and the impact of
public spending in key sectors. The 2005 PER is a key element of this program, and its
findings will facilitate both (i) the update of the PEMSP action plan; and (ii) the effective use
of public resources from NT2 and other natural resource projects.
Financial Sector Reforms. The World Bank and the IMF have worked closely with the
AsDB to support the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) in developing and implementing a
multi-year banking reform program, with technical assistance provided by the AsDB. The
Bank’s FMAC and PRSO-1 supported restructuring of state-owned commercial banks
(SCBs) and their move to a more commercial basis of operation, as well as the development
of rural micro-finance institutions. The FMAC, supported by the FMCBC, the PRGF and
PRSO-1 have sought to break the NPL destabilizing cycle as a key step in the process of
better management of public resources and fiscal stability. It is expected that this support will

PRSO-1 was disbursed in September 2005, for the amount of US$ 10 million: a credit of
SDR3.0 million (US$ 4.5 million equivalent) and a grant of SDR3.6 million (US$ 5.5 million
equivalent). The terms for the Credit are standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace
period. For the Grant, standard IDA grant terms.

- 31 -

ANNEX II

be needed over the medium term, which could be provided by follow-on PRSOs and the
programs of the IMF and the AsDB.
Trade Policy. Trade policy was an integral part of both the Bank and IMF’s earlier analytical
work and programs. The WBI conducted several seminars on trade policy issues, and in
April 2004, organized a face-to-face workshop on WTO accession and its potential for
exports and poverty reduction. The Bank completed the updating of earlier work on
Lao P.D.R.’s trade regime and exports, and is leading a larger piece of diagnostic work on
trade policy and export potential during June–October 2004; this is being done jointly with
the GOL (led by the Ministry of Commerce) under the Integrated Framework program.
Reforms in this area are were supported by PRSO-1 and will be supported by follow-on
PRSOs.
The Bank’s Key Roles in Policy Dialogue
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The SOEs have been large users of resources and
certainly have been the main debtors to SCBs; they have also been major contributor to the
problem of NPLs at SCBs. Accordingly, the FMAC and PRSO-1 supported the GOL’s
ongoing SOE reform program aimed at improving and institutionalizing the reporting and
recording of annual performance of all SOEs, the restructuring of the nine large SOEs
including, BPKP, Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3, Nam Papa Lao, Lao Airlines, DAFI,
Electricité du Lao, and DAI SOEs, and appropriate pricing policy for public utility SOEs.
The Bank will support the implementation of the SOE’s multi-year restructuring plans, the
monitoring system as well as the utilities’ tariff-policies beyond FMAC and PRSO-1; this
will be done through follow-on PRSOs, the technical assistance grants and credits, and
analytical work.
Private Sector Development. The Bank supports the development of the private sector, both
economy-wide and in sectors. Over the next 12 months the World Bank Group (IDA, IFC,
MPDF) will carry out extensive analysis in the PSD area to define a prioritized and feasible
multi-year Action Plan with the objective of removing the constraints to private sector
growth. Specific activities under this initiative include a joint ADB-WBG Investment
Climate Survey of manufacturing and tourism firms in Lao P.D.R., provincial level reviews
of the regulatory procedures and PSD promotion initiatives of local governments; a review of
the key business laws, and coordination of the donor working group on macroeconomic and
PSD issues.
Forestry Development. The GOL is involved in a continuing process of reforming its
forestry sector and improving the implementation of forestry programs and projects. The
Bank is trying to ensure that the GOL’s objectives and strategy for forestry are nested within
and consistent with the overall NGPES/PRSP, Rural Development Program, and Agriculture
Development Strategy. Through these, the GOL is, inter alia, seeking to (i) stabilize or
increase forest cover and condition; (ii) ensure protection of water resources and critical

- 32 -

ANNEX II

infrastructure through forest conservation; and (iii) put forest resources to work directly for
the reduction of rural poverty through partnerships with local communities.
The Nam Theun 2 Hydro-power Project. The World Bank Group’s has supported this
project through an IBRD partial risk guarantee, an IDA environmental and social project and
a MIGA guarantee. The World Bank decision to support the project was linked to
(i) Lao P.D.R. establishing and implementing a viable development policy framework,
characterized by concrete performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and
social and environmental protection; (ii) the technical, financial, economic and
implementation aspects of the project, as well as the design and implementation of
safeguards policies, being sound; and (iii) wider understanding and broader support from the
international donor community and global and local civil society for Lao P.D.R.’s
development framework and the project.
World Bank Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The last CAS was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2005; this timing was aimed at using the NGPES as the basis for the CAS. The CAS
selectively targets key NGPES priorities, including: (i) sustaining growth through linking to
and capitalizing on regional opportunities and better natural resource management;
(ii) improving social outcomes through strengthening financial management and service
delivery capacity; (iii) strengthening management capacities, partnerships, and monitoring
for NGPES implementation, and (iv) implementing the NT2 program as a model for
supporting sustainable growth, improving social outcomes, and building key development
capacities. This consists of a lending and non-lending program, with a notional program of
about US$128 million in new commitments (credits and grants) for the four years of the CAS
during July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (subject to the IDA Performance Based Allocation
system).
Non-Lending Program. The current sources of growth in the Lao P.D.R. economy have been
examined in a Country Economic Memorandum/Sources of Growth report, which was
completed in May 2004 and shared with the GOL.

capacity building, and risk guarantees. In the last three years, IDA support has focused on the
CAS objectives, with an average commitment of about US$31 million (excluding
guarantees), while disbursements averaged US$41 million. Future IDA credits/grants will
finance projects in the social sectors, infrastructure, public financial management, rural
livelihoods, capacity building, and reforms in support of poverty reduction.

Lao P.D.R.—Relations with the Asian Development Bank32
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has extended development assistance to Lao P.D.R. since 1968. In
the 1970s and 1980s, AsDB assistance was focused mainly on economic growth projects involving
infrastructure development in the transport and energy sectors, as well as agriculture. AsDB has been
active in financial sector development since the latter part of the 1980s. Since the early 1990s, the
emphasis of AsDB assistance to Lao P.D.R. has been broadened to include rural development, social
development and environment. Since the late 1990s, the AsDB has focused its activities on poverty
reduction.
AsDB worked with the Government and other stakeholders to formulate its current Country Strategy and
Program in 2001 to guide its operations in Lao P.D.R. for the next five-year period. The theme of AsDB’s
interventions in Lao P.D.R. will be poverty reduction by broadening community participation and
opportunities. The core strategies for poverty reduction are: sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and good governance. The main strategic focus will be on four operational priorities
including rural development and market linkages, human resource development, sustainable environmental
management, financial and private sector development, and regional integration.
Lao P.D.R. is a key actor in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) program as a land-link among the
other member countries. The AsDB will aim to explore various options to maximize the benefits to Lao
P.D.R. from sub-regional cooperation. To enhance the development impact of projects and ensure their
close monitoring, AsDB’s interventions will focus primarily on the poor northern region provinces and
along the East-West economic corridor, which links Thailand to Savannakhet and Vietnam.
Since 1970, the AsDB has approved 62 loans (including four loans for the financial/banking sector
reforms) for a total of $1,113.1 million by end-December 2004, when 23 of these loans were still active.
As of end-December 2004 technical assistance amounting to $101.9 million comprising 208 projects has
been approved.
In 2005, four new lending products (including a loan and a grant for the public sector, and a private sector
investment facility and guarantee) have been approved by end-August, and three additional loans and
grants are envisaged to be approved, with the planned annual commitments of $156.0 million. Technical
assistance of $1.82 million was approved during the first eight months of 2005.

ANNEX IV

Lao P.D.R.: Statistical Issues
The quality of macroeconomic statistics needs to be significantly improved for effective
monitoring of economic developments and policy formulation. In this regard, a multisector
STA mission visited Vientiane during October 2002 to facilitate the preparation of the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata. It recommended greater coordination
between the various agencies responsible for compiling macroeconomic statistics, including
the formation of an inter-agency working group. While a GDDS coordinator has been
appointed, the authorities have yet to finalize the GDDS metadata and a strategy for
statistical improvement. Two STA missions took place in April/May 2004 in the areas of
government finance statistics and monetary and financial statistics. Economic and financial
data are published in periodic reports by the National Statistical Center (NSC) and the Bank
of Lao P.D.R. (BoL).
National accounts
National accounts consist of annual estimates of GDP by activity at current and
constant 1990 prices, broadly following the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA).
The lack of regular surveys to collect comprehensive data on current economic activities and
the use of inadequate compilation methods raise questions about the coverage and reliability
of the GDP estimates. The estimates rely heavily on data on production or volume indicators
collected by line ministries. The October 2002 multisector STA mission recommended that
the authorities establish a system for collecting data on current economic activities based on
regular surveys and implement compilation methods in accordance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). The Swedish International Development Agency
(SIDA) is providing technical assistance to the NSC to improve the national income
accounts. With SIDA support, the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2002–2003
(LECS 3) has been finalized and released. A STA regional advisor will assist the authorities
in improving the real sector indicators during visits scheduled for 2006.
Prices
The NSC compiles a monthly CPI that is available on a timely basis. The latest CPI was
introduced in January 2000 (with December 1999 as the reference period), using the results
of the 1997/98 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) for deriving a
consumption basket. It comprises nine product categories covering major urban centers,
including Vientiane. The NSC plans to revise the weights and review the sample of outlets
and products on the basis of the LECS 3. With SIDA’s assistance, the NSC is also working
on the development of a producer price index (PPI) on a quarterly basis.
Government finance
Government finance statistics are weak and there is scope to significantly improve their
accuracy, coverage, and transparency. The Budget Department produces monthly, quarterly,

- 37 -

ANNEX IV

and annual revenue and expenditure statistics. Most data are recorded on a cash basis.
Expenditure data by economic type are compiled by central government and the provinces.
Data on bank and nonbank financing of the budget, including treasury bill operations, need to
be made consistent with the monetary accounts. The social security fund and off-budget
activities are not included in fiscal data. Annual budget and outturn data are not disseminated
according to an international standard, which complicates fiscal analysis. A government
finance statistics mission in 2004 recommended improving the quality of fiscal statistics and
developed a roadmap for eventual migration to GFSM2001.
Budget planning, execution, reporting, and cash management require significant upgrading,
as noted by the October 2002 FAD mission on public expenditure management. Moreover,
greater decentralization in 2000/01 further complicated the timely reporting of fiscal data
from lower government levels, as monitoring systems are weak and skilled staff limited. This
continues to hamper the accurate reporting of various items to the central budget, such as
timber-related royalty payments.
Central government debt data are compiled by two departments of the MOF; external debt by
the External Financial Relations Department and domestic debt by the Budget Department.
Debt data are comprehensive and available by type of debt holder and instrument. Efforts are
being made to further improve coverage, particularly relating to SOE debt.
Monetary statistics
The BoL regularly reports its balance sheet (with a two-week lag) and commercial bank
balance sheet (with a four-week lag) to APD for surveillance purposes and to STA for
publication in IFS with a lag of two to three months. In recent years, the authorities have
been implementing some of the recommendations of STA missions.
However, the latest monetary and financial statistics mission in April/May 2004 identified a
number of problems in the compilation of monetary statistics and made further
recommendations for (i) improvement in the sectorization of various institutional units
(e.g., nonfinancial public enterprises) and uniform treatment of sectors on both asset and
liability sides of the commercial bank balance sheet; (ii) valuation of financial assets and
liabilities (e.g., valuing monetary gold at market prices); (iii) classification of financial
instruments (e.g., classifying loan loss provisions as other liabilities and valuation

the inconsistent sectorization of units on the asset and liability sides of the commercial bank
balance sheet.
Balance of payments
Data on foreign reserves are reported weekly and derived from the monetary survey at the
prevailing kip per U.S. dollar end-month exchange rate. Balance of payments statistics need
significant frequency and coverage improvements in the following areas: (i) customs trade
data, (ii) the commodity composition of external trade, (iii) services and income, (iv) actual
foreign direct investment flows, (v) separation of current and capital transfers as well as
coverage of some type of grants, especially from international nongovernment organizations,
(vi) the reconciliation of fiscal and balance of payments data on external loans and grants,
and (vii) monitoring of external debt, especially of state owned enterprises. In 2001, the
MOF adopted the Commonwealth Secretariat-Debt Recording and Management System
(CS-DRMS) for processing and maintaining external debt data.
New customs procedures (the Customs 2000 system) and equipment permitted (with FAD
technical assistance) production of more accurate trade data in October 2000. However, for a
range of technical reasons, the customs department has not yet produced these data on a
regular basis. Fund missions have emphasized that this problem needs to be urgently
addressed. In order to produce accurate balance of payments updates on a regular basis, there
is a need to improve the coordination between the agencies involved in BOP compilation,
viz., the BoL, the NSC, the Customs and the External Financial Relations Departments of
the MOF, the Department of International Cooperation of the Committee of Planning and
Investment, and the commercial banks. The Japanese Government is providing technical
assistance to address some of these issues.

ANNEX V

Lao P.D.R.: Analysis of Poverty Trends33
Lao P.D.R. is among the poorest countries in the world. Lao P.D.R.’s per capita gross
national income is one of the lowest in East Asia, and three out of every four of its citizens
survive on less than $2 a day. The incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas, and in the
Northern and Central parts of the country.
There has been a notable decline in income
poverty over the last decade. Based on the
national poverty line, the incidence of poverty
fell by more than a quarter in a decade—from
46 percent in 1992/93 to 39 percent in
1997/98 and 33.5 percent in 2002/03. This
rate of reduction compares favorably to the
experience of some other developing Asian
economies during the 1990s. While the
reduction in poverty has been impressive,
Lao P.D.R. still has some way to go to catch
up with its neighbors in the region.

The distribution of income has also remained relatively equal. At 33 percent, Lao P.D.R.’s
Gini index implies a remarkably low level of inequality, partly reflecting the dominance of
subsistence agriculture in the economy. While there was some deterioration during the early
1990s, the distribution of income has remained reasonably constant over the last decade as a
whole. This casts a favorable light on the equity of the development process, although the extent
to which it was the result of deliberate policy is unclear.
While there has been little rigorous analysis of the determinants of the decline in income
poverty, a number of factors are likely to have contributed, including:
• Robust economic growth. Lao P.D.R. enjoyed sustained growth of around 6 percent for much
of the last decade, with per capita income increasing at an annual rate of over 3 percent. The
growth elasticity of poverty (the percentage change in poverty associated with a one percent
increase in per capita income) is estimated to have increased from -1.3 during 1992–1997 to 3.8 during 1998–2003, implying that growth was markedly more pro-poor during the latter
half of the decade (despite the hyperinflation during this period).
• Infrastructure development. There was an improvement in the state of infrastructure—
including roads, electricity, and school and hospital buildings—in many poor rural areas,
33

particularly towards the second half of the decade. Indeed, studies suggest that as much as
one-sixth of the reduction in rural poverty over this period can be explained by improved
road access alone, and that rural poverty incidence could be further reduced by up to
7 percentage points by providing all rural districts with all-weather road access.
• Trade liberalization. Lao P.D.R. has made steady progress in integrating into the regional
(and global) economy, especially after joining ASEAN and AFTA in 1998. Regional
linkages have been reinforced by some major cross-border infrastructure projects (such as the
East-West corridor linking Thailand and Lao P.D.R. to Vietnam). During the latter half of the
decade, as trade relations with China and Vietnam were strengthened, poverty fell
dramatically in the traditionally disadvantaged Northern districts bordering these countries.
Further trade liberalization should result in continuing gains: a study by Fane and Kong
(2005) suggests that poverty could be reduced by up to 1.5 percentage points between 2005
and 2009, simply on the basis of implementing AFTA commitments and extending them to
all countries on an MFN basis.
However, progress has been more limited in several other dimensions of poverty.
Notwithstanding the success against the target of halving income poverty relative to 1990, Lao
P.D.R. lags behind on a number of Millennium Development Goals, in particular, those related
to universal completion of primary education, maternal health, child malnutrition, and
environmental sustainability (Table 1). More generally, it is ranked 133rd out of 175 countries
on the basis of its human development indicators, most of which lag far behind those of other
countries in the region. Indeed, some of these indicators are reminiscent of sub-Saharan Africa
(Table 2). Average life expectancy is 15 years lower than in Vietnam, and below the average for
low-income countries. The maternal mortality rate is more than five times as high as the average
for the East Asia and Pacific region, and child malnutrition is higher than the average for lowincome countries. Most indicators of educational attainment are also lower than in neighboring
countries. One-third of the adult population—and nearly half of all females—cannot read or
write, and the primary school enrollment rate is significantly lower than in Vietnam and
Cambodia.
Inadequate public services have contributed, at least in part, to these poor social
outcomes. Access to basic goods and services, such as education and health care, is severely
limited. About half the children who enroll in primary school drop out, reflecting both the low
quality and quantity of available schooling educational services. Although 85 percent of villages
report having a primary school, only half of them offer all five grades. There are fewer than 100
doctors per 100,000 people, one of the lowest ratios in East Asia. Less than one-fifth of births
are attended by skilled health staff, compared to around one-third in sub-Saharan Africa and
87 percent in East Asia and the Pacific. The immunization rate for children under 12 months
(against major childhood illnesses such as measles and DPT) is below 50 percent, significantly
lower than even in sub-Saharan Africa. More than half the population lives without access to an
improved water source and more than three-quarters without access to improved sanitation,
compared to 42 percent and 64 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. This backlog of
deprivation presents a challenging agenda for the period ahead.

Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA.35 The annex also assesses the potential impact of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) on Lao P.D.R.
2.
The update confirms earlier findings that Lao P.D.R. remains in the category of
low-income countries with a high risk of debt distress. Provided that sufficient progress is
made in economic reforms, the medium-term debt service outlook is manageable. However,
there are significant risks, especially on the fiscal side, if the pace of reform remains slow.
Debt relief under HIPC and MDRI would significantly reduce the external public debt
burden, but its impact on net resource flows is more uncertain, as consequences for the
country’s access to new concessional financing from IDA and bilateral creditors is difficult
to quantify. The authorities have not, to date, expressed interest in seeking debt relief under
these initiatives.
A. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Background

Although external public debt has been declining as a percent of GDP, it
remains high (Figure 1). At end-2004, the

The last comprehensive DSA for Lao P.D.R. was prepared in the context of the 2004
Article IV Consultation (IMF/Country Report No. 05/8).

35

Due to the negligible size of domestic public debt in Lao P.D.R. (1.5 percent of GDP in
2004) and a lack of sufficient information on the level and terms of private external debt
obligations, the debt sustainability analysis focuses exclusively on external public and
publicly guaranteed debt. The analysis employs a modified LIC DSA external template,
which incorporates both fiscal and balance of payments indicators.

ANNEX VI

4.
Almost 75 percent of Lao P.D.R.’s debt is in the form of concessional loans from
multilateral creditors, primarily the World Bank and the AsDB (Table 1). Concessional
borrowing from these two institutions accounts for the bulk of the increase in public external
debt since 1999.36 The two largest bilateral creditors are Russia and Japan, who account for
19 and 2 percent of the stock of public debt respectively.37 The bulk of the external debt is
owed by the central government, with state-owned enterprises accounting for slightly over
5 percent of the total debt stock.
5.
While the external debt service burden has remained at manageable levels due
to a high degree of concessionality, it has been rising in recent years. In the last 3 years,
the debt service-to-revenue ratio has risen by 6.4 percentage points to 21.7 percent at end2005, bringing it within reaching distance of the indicative threshold for low CPIA countries
(25 percent). The debt service-to-export ratio has also risen, but much more modestly, and, at
7.8 percent, remains well within the indicative sustainability threshold (15 percent).
Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
6.
Achieving the government’s development objectives will require an acceleration
of structural reforms. In addition to maintaining sound macroeconomic policies, stepped up
efforts to mobilize revenues and reform the state-owned commercial banks are needed to
ensure macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Sustaining high rates of economic
growth will also require a concerted effort to strengthen the investment climate, to enable
Lao P.D.R. to take advantage of the opportunities for economic integration in the region.
7.
The staff have prepared
a medium-term economic
outlook based on such a
scenario (Table 2). Under this
reform scenario, economic
growth would remain at around 67 percent between 2005–2010
(Text Table 2). The two large
mining projects (Oxiana and Pan
Australian)38 and the construction

Over 80 percent of the debt accumulated between 1999 and 2004 represents concessional

37

To facilitate analysis, the stock of Russian debt prior to 2003 is valued at $387 million, in
line with the agreement reached between Lao P.D.R. and Russian Federation in December
2003.

of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydroelectric dam are projected to contribute around 1½
percentage per year to growth during this period. Underlying growth would be sustained at 5
percent—close to the average for the past five years—as growth in agriculture, tourism and
small-scale manufacturing, stimulated by trade reforms and improvements in the investment
climate, offset slower growth in garments following the expiration of the MFA quota
system.39
8.
A gradual consolidation of fiscal policy will be needed to ensure debt
sustainability over the medium term (Table 3). Under the baseline scenario, the overall
fiscal deficit would decline from 4 percent of GDP to around 3 percent of GDP by 2010. The
fiscal consolidation will need to be driven largely by an improved revenue effort—revenue is
projected to rise from 11.6 percent to 12.8 percent of GDP, in part due to increased mining
royalties and taxes. Non-resource revenues would rise from 10.1 percent to 10.6 percent of
GDP.40 Primary expenditure is expected to remain broadly unchanged under this scenario at
around 16 percent of GDP, with the composition shifting gradually from capital to recurrent
spending (partly reflecting a gradual decline in foreign-financed capital expenditure). The
wage bill is assumed to stabilize at 5.0 percent of GDP, to ensure adequate resources for nonwage operating expenses in the budget.
9.
The medium-term fiscal outlook would be underpinned by efforts to enhance
non-resource revenues and improve the efficiency of spending. The scenario assumes that
progress will be made in the authorities’ efforts to improve tax and customs administration,
based on greater collaboration with the provinces, and that it would be complemented by
additional revenue-generating initiatives, culminating with the introduction of a VAT
towards the end of the decade.41 These reforms are expected to offset any revenue losses
from tariff reductions under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.42 Expenditure reforms
would focus most immediately on improving budget monitoring at the center and in the
provinces and on enhancing budget preparation, through improving the timeliness and
transparency of basic budget documents. The longer-term goal would be to establish a strong
national treasury, with full control over national public finances, and build up the systems of
39

The impact of the expiration of the MFA quota system on GDP growth is expected to be
relatively modest as the garments sector’s contribution to GDP (less than 1 percent) is
relatively small, and the loss of market share in the EU should be partly offset by improved
access to the U.S. markets following the granting of normal trade relations in November
2004.

41

The authorities aim to introduce a VAT in 2008/09. In the shorter run, tax reforms such as
the introduction of a single rate turnover tax and reforms of excises on petroleum and other
products (especially tobacco) have some revenue generating potential.

Staff estimate the loss in revenue from AFTA at 0.5 percent of GDP, in the absence of any

budget planning and execution to enable the allocation of public resources to be effectively
aligned with the government’s development goals.
10.
The external current account deficit, which will remain high (12–15 percent of
GDP) in the next few years, is projected to decline sharply by the end of the decade.
Export volume growth is projected to rise sharply over the next 5 years—averaging
11 percent between 2005 and 2010—driven by increased gold and copper exports (and
electricity once the NT2 dam comes on-stream in 2009/10). While the terms of trade are
expected to deteriorate, reflecting mainly softer copper prices, export value growth is
expected to average around 10 percent over the period. Initially, the increase in exports will
be offset by higher imports associated with the construction of the NT2 dam. However, the
current account deficit should start to decline sharply from 2007 onwards as these capital
outlays wind down. Although the improvement in the current account deficit will be largely
offset by higher capital outflows, associated with the repayment of NT2-related loans and the
repatriation of mining profits, the net inflows from these projects should be sufficient to
sustain external reserves at around 3-3½ months of imports.
Debt Outlook
11.
The baseline scenario suggests that achieving long-term debt sustainability is
feasible (Figure 2 and Tables 4.a.-c.). While external public debt will remain at elevated
levels throughout the projection period, the main debt-stock indicators are projected to
decline steadily and approach the indicative thresholds by the end of the projection period
(Text Table 3).43 This relatively favorable debt profile hinges on the following key
assumptions: (i) that robust GDP and export growth will be sustained, which in the longerterm will depend on improving Lao P.D.R.’s investment climate; (ii) progress is made in
mobilizing revenues; (iii) public borrowing declines over the medium term; 44 and (iv) the
authorities maintain a high level of concessionality on new borrowing.

43

Under the baseline scenario, Lao P.D.R.’s NPV of debt-to-export ratio would fall below
the HIPC threshold of 150 percent in 2008/09.

44

The scenario assumes that the Russian debt will be serviced according to the preliminary
agreement reached in December 2003. Discussions on the agreement are currently ongoing,
which, if successful, could alleviate some of the increase in debt service over the next few
years.

Despite a two-fold increase in debt service between 2004 and 2010, the debt
service-to-exports ratio is expected to remain at manageable levels (Figure 3).45 This
reflects mainly the fact that the rise in debt service will coincide with a period of rapid export
growth, as the gold and copper mining (and later NT2) projects come on stream. As a result,
the debt service-to-export ratio is expected

The outlook on the fiscal side is
more precarious. Although the debt

remain within the indicative thresholds,
they remain elevated throughout the
medium term, and significantly above
levels in recent years. The margin for
slippage on the fiscal side is therefore
much narrower than on the external side.

Of the total projected increase in debt service between 2005 and 2010, 47 percent

commercial debt.

- 51 -

ANNEX VI

Risks and Vulnerabilities
14.
The medium-term outlook is susceptible to several risks. The main risk is that the
pace of structural reform will remain slow and tentative, especially on the fiscal side.
Although the economy will still receive a significant stimulus from the large natural resource
sectors, a slow pace of reforms to improve the trade and investment environment would
weaken the growth outlook for the underlying economy. On the fiscal side, the main risk is
that higher resource revenues may be seen as a substitute for undertaking difficult reforms to
mobilize non-resource revenues, limiting improvement in the overall revenue effort.46 With
the fiscal space constrained by a weak revenue effort, fiscal consolidation would be more
difficult and there could be pressure to maintain high levels of borrowing to finance Lao
P.D.R.’s development needs.
15.
Staff have factored these risks into an alternative scenario, characterized by
limited progress in structural reforms. The alternative scenario assumes lower GDP and
export growth, weaker revenue performance and a higher level of borrowing. Specifically,
the growth rate of exports and GDP is one percentage point lower than in the baseline
scenario, revenues remain stagnant at their 2005 level of 11.3 percent of GDP, and borrowing
is not reduced over time, remaining at its recent level of 6 percent of GDP.
16.
The debt outlook under such a “muddle-through” scenario is significantly less
benign, especially on the fiscal side. The decline in debt stock ratios is much less
pronounced, and they remain well above the indicative sustainability thresholds throughout
the projection period. The debt service burden is also considerably higher. While the debt
service-to-export ratio is expected to remain at manageable levels even under the alternative
scenario, the debt service-to-revenue ratio rises significantly above the indicative threshold,
suggesting the possibility of debt distress.
17.
The standardized stress tests of the low-income DSA template broadly confirm
these risks (Table 4.c.). In particular, they highlight the importance of containing the
volume, and ensuring high concessionality, of new borrowing. It would be critical to limit
borrowing on less concessional terms to projects with firm financial viability. Assessing such
viability in a transparent manner and through reputable sources will be important in
maintaining donors’ confidence in government policies. However, some stress tests are not
that well suited to analyzing risks to Lao P.D.R.’s debt sustainability. For example, while
setting export growth at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2006–07 (bound
test B2) has a larger impact on debt ratios in 2006–2015 than the alternative scenario, such a
shock is unlikely due to the planned expansion of mining operations, which are projected to
46

The projection for mining revenues is also subject to some uncertainty. While they are
based on conservative commodity price assumptions, the parameters for profit taxes had to
be estimated, as they are confidential. It is also assumed that the provinces will fully remit
these revenues to the center.

- 52 -

ANNEX VI

considerably raise exports in 2007. A more plausible risk is that trend growth in exports over
the longer-term will be slower than assumed in the baseline scenario.
B. Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
Background
18.
Lao P.D.R. is eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. It
qualifies under the export window, as the NPV of its external public debt was 197 percent of
exports at end-2004,47 well above the HIPC Initiative threshold of 150 percent. If Lao P.D.R.
were to participate in this process, it could receive debt relief through three channels:
(i) traditional debt relief mechanisms, through which Lao P.D.R. would be eligible for
rescheduling on its bilateral debt; (ii) debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, which would aim
to reduce the NPV of Lao P.D.R.’s external public debt to 150 percent of exports; and
(iii) debt relief from the IMF and IDA under the MDRI.
19.
The timing of any debt relief under the HIPC/MDRI initiatives would depend on
how fast Lao P.D.R. could reach a completion point under the HIPC initiative. There
would be three basic steps in this process:
•

The first step would be to negotiate a new PRGF program, a necessary condition for
participating in the HIPC initiative.

•

Once a new PRGF program is approved, Lao P.D.R. would need to build a track
record to reach a decision point under the HIPC initiative. Provided Lao P.D.R.
demonstrates strong performance and commitment to macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms, it could build such a track record in 6-12 months.

•

The timing of the completion point, when the MDRI relief would be received, would
depend on meeting the completion point criteria. The average time between decision
and completion points has been about 2-3 years.

20.
There is a risk that Lao P.D.R. might become ineligible for HIPC/MDRI debt
relief, if the decision point is significantly delayed. Exports are expected to rise
considerably over the next three years, mainly because of higher mining exports, and this
could push the debt-to-exports ratio below the 150 percent threshold. In such an event, Lao
P.D.R. would no longer be eligible for either HIPC or MDRI debt relief.

47

After assumed application of traditional debt relief. The calculation is based on HIPC DSA
methodology. Pending further information, it also assumes an SDR discount rate on AsDB
debt.

- 53 -

ANNEX VI

Potential Impact on Debt Sustainability
21.
Staff have prepared an illustrative scenario based on the assumption of a HIPC
decision point in 2007 and a completion point in 2009. The basic assumptions are the same
as for the baseline scenario discussed above, with the exception that the scenario has, for
illustrative purposes, lowered public sector borrowing by 0.5 percent of GDP compared to
the baseline, to reflect the possible impact of a lower gross IDA allocation and a lower access
to concessional loans from some bilateral creditors (see paragraph 23).
22.

The main results of this illustrative MDRI scenario are as follows:

•

Lao P.D.R.’s external public debt would be substantially reduced. The NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to around 30 percent after Lao P.D.R. received the full
MDRI debt relief at the HIPC completion point. The bulk of the debt relief would
come from the cancellation of the IDA debt borrowed before end-2003 and traditional
debt relief from Lao P.D.R.’s bilateral creditors (Table 5).

•

Lao P.D.R.’s debt
service burden would
also be significantly
lower (Figure 4). Staff
estimate that the debt
service savings could be
of the order of 1-2 percent
of GDP in 2007-2015.
These savings would start
as soon as Lao P.D.R.
started to receive HIPC
interim debt relief once it
reached the decision point.

23.
Notwithstanding the potentially substantial reduction in the debt service burden,
the impact on net resource flows to Lao P.D.R. remains uncertain. In particular, the
authorities are concerned that gross resource inflows could be reduced by more than the
0.5 percent of GDP assumed in the illustrative scenario. In addition to receiving a lower IDA
allocation under the MDRI, participating in the HIPC Initiative may negatively affect Lao
P.D.R.’s access to concessional loans from bilateral creditors. It might also disrupt
disbursements for large hydro sector projects, whose creditors had previously received
assurances that Lao P.D.R. would not seek HIPC debt relief.

1/ From 2006 onwards growth rates of GDP and exports are lowered by one percent. Fiscal revenues are kept at 11 percent of GDP. Gross public borrowing stays at present level
(6 percent of GDP) .
2/ Assumes a decision point in 2007 and a completion point in 2009. Traditional debt relief was applied with a cut-off date in June 1999. Calculations are based on end-2004
discount and exchange rates. MDRI delivery was based on remaining end-2003 debt to IDA and end-2004 debt to IMF.

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the Lao People's
Democratic Republic
On March, 8, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.1
Background
The economy performed well during 2005. Economic growth increased to 7 percent, driven
mainly by an expansion in activity at the Oxiana gold and copper mine and the construction of
the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydro-electric dam. Higher rice and fuel prices put upward pressure on
inflation in mid 2005, but core inflation remained at around 5-6 percent. With food prices easing,
headline inflation fell back to 8.8 percent in December. The external position held up well,
despite a number of adverse shocks. A surge in mining exports helped to offset the impact of
higher oil prices and lower garment exports. Consequently, external reserves remained broadly
unchanged, at around $230 million or 3 months of imports.
Macroeconomic policies remained on track, but the underlying situation continues to be fragile,
especially in view of Lao P.D.R.’s high external public debt (80 percent of GDP). The
government kept a tight control over the cash budget deficit (3.5 percent of GDP) despite
shortfalls in revenue. However, with debt service and the wage bill continuing to rise, non-wage
spending has come under increasing pressure. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. maintained
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the March, 8, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

the state-owned commercial banks pose a risk to macroeconomic stability.
The economic outlook is favorable, provided progress is made on structural reforms. Growth
should remain strong during the next few years (in the range of 6-7 percent), driven by the
continuing stimulus from NT2 and the large mining projects. The external outlook is also
reasonably buoyant as these projects should generate sizeable net inflows. However the
prospects for sustaining a rapid pace of growth and development depend on actions to address
key structural weaknesses—especially with regard to revenue mobilization, which is critical for
progress towards debt sustainability, and reform of the state-owned commercial banks.
Progress on both fronts continued to be slow in 2005. Further efforts will also be needed to
advance trade reforms and improve the investment climate.
Lao P.D.R.’s PRGF arrangement, approved in April 2001, lapsed in April 2005, with only three
of six reviews completed. Although macroeconomic performance remained broadly on track,
lack of progress on structural reforms and safeguards policies prevented completion of further
reviews. An Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of performance under Lao P.D.R.’s PRGF and ESAF
programs has been completed. The EPA concluded that the design of the programs had been
broadly appropriate, but that slippages with regard to key structural reform objectives suggested
that, in addition to capacity constraints, there had been insufficient government ownership of the
reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Lao P.D.R. authorities for maintaining stable
macroeconomic conditions and welcomed the robust economic growth and the progress in
reducing poverty. While disciplined economic management has underpinned the improved
performance of the economy in recent years, Directors noted that many challenges remain. The
underlying macroeconomic situation remains fragile, reflecting weaknesses in the fiscal position
and the banking system, as well as the large external debt burden. There is also a need to
improve the trade and investment regime to enhance the competitiveness of the economy, and
expenditure management needs to be strengthened to ensure a more effective use of public
resources for poverty reduction. Directors encouraged the authorities to use the opportunity
provided by the sixth national development plan to move forward in these critical areas.
Lao P.D.R.’s economic outlook is favorable given the sizeable stimulus from major projects in
the mining and hydropower sectors, but Directors stressed that this is not without risk. The
immediate priority is to ensure a sound budget framework for 2005/06, based on realistic
revenue targets and a sustainable expansion in the wage bill. In this context, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to make the expansion in civil service employment
conditional on strengthened revenue mobilization. This would allow for alleviation of the
compression in nonwage spending in priority sectors, while containing the overall deficit to a
level consistent with available concessional donor financing.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to gear monetary policy toward
reducing inflation. They agreed that the Bank of the Lao P.D.R.’s net domestic assets should

-3remain the main anchor of monetary policy, and that firm control of net domestic assets should
be underpinned by prudent fiscal management. Directors noted that rapid credit expansion by
state-owned commercial banks, reflecting large credits to a government-sponsored project,
posed a risk to monetary stability. They welcomed the initial steps to rein in the exposure of
these banks, but emphasized the need to strengthen the regulations on single borrower
exposure and to limit the scope of regulatory forbearance in this area. The authorities should
also move swiftly to find a strategic investor to place the project on a financially viable footing.
Directors considered Lao P.D.R.’s exchange rate system, with intervention focused on
smoothing transitory fluctuations, to be appropriate.
Directors stressed the importance of mobilizing revenue to enable Lao P.D.R. to meet its
substantial expenditure needs within a sustainable fiscal framework. The main priority is to
establish a strong tax and customs administration to raise revenues and support major tax
policy reforms, including the introduction of a VAT. Progress on this front would depend
importantly on reforms to strengthen central control over revenue operations in the provinces.
Directors urged the authorities to advance the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening
Program. While the immediate focus on improving budget monitoring is appropriate, the main
priority is to establish a strong national treasury with effective control over public finances.
Given its decentralized structure, strengthening fiscal management will require a broader review
of center-province relations to clarify the assignment of revenue and expenditure responsibilities
and establish a clear and credible revenue-sharing framework.
Directors noted the government’s decision not to avail itself of debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives. To lower the country’s high external debt, they
encouraged the authorities to maximize grant financing and maintain a high level of
concessionality on new borrowing, in addition to strengthened domestic revenue mobilization.
Directors urged the authorities to expedite the restructuring of the financially weak state-owned
commercial banks. They encouraged the government to seek private participation in the banks
to facilitate their reform and enhance the banking system. In the interim, it will be important to
maintain close oversight of the banks until their restructuring is complete. Directors also
emphasized the importance of improving bank supervision, and urged the authorities to provide
a more level playing field for private banks.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the trade and investment climate to improve
the economy’s competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to move ahead with the
ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and their initiation of formal negotiations for WTO accession,
and considered these as important steps towards integrating the economy into the regional and
global markets. Directors were encouraged by the approval of a new Enterprise Law, but noted
that more needs to be done to create a transparent and predictable regulatory environment for
investors, and develop an effective legal and judicial system.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Lao P.D.R.’s performance under Fund
arrangements since the early 1990s. They agreed that Lao P.D.R. had made significant
progress in reducing poverty and moving towards a market based economy under the ESAF

-4and PRGF-supported programs, but noted that many challenges remain. Looking ahead,
Directors considered that, in addition to building capacity, a strong consensus within
government on needed structural reforms, especially in the fiscal and banking areas, will be
important. Evidence of progress on this front should be a precondition for any future Fundsupported program. In the meantime, Directors were of the view that surveillance, combined
with well-targeted technical assistance, would be the most appropriate form of engagement.
Directors expressed concern that the poor quality of economic statistics is hampering effective
surveillance and urged the authorities to strengthen the balance of payments, the national
accounts, and government financial statistics, especially at the provincial level. They also
encouraged the authorities to address weaknesses in the accounting systems at the Bank of the
Lao P.D.R., which are hindering the effective monitoring of monetary and foreign exchange
developments.

Introduction
The Laotian authorities would like to convey their appreciation to the staff for the
constructive discussions on issues pertaining to the Laotian economy during the Article IV
consultation. The authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s analysis and policy
recommendations regarding the main challenges facing the economy, and thank the staff for
a comprehensive set of papers. The authorities also appreciate the excellent and timely
technical assistance provided by the Fund on bank supervision and the seminar presented by
the staff on the topic of central-province relations and fiscal reforms during the recent
mission.
The Laotian economy achieved very robust overall growth during the fifth development plan
(2001-2005), with GDP growth on average exceeding 6 percent per annum, accompanied by
a stable exchange rate and comfortable levels of international reserves. These achievements
have resulted from the maintenance of prudent macroeconomic policies and the
implementation of structural reforms. Despite these positive outcomes, the Laotian
authorities are well aware of major challenges ahead to sustain high rates of broad-based
growth and eradicate poverty. As highlighted in the staff report, Lao PDR’s “poverty remains
high, as over 73 percent of the population live on less than $ 2 per day.”
While recognizing the enormity of the task to reduce the poverty levels for such a wide
segment of the population, the authorities note that one of the main causes of this high
incidence is the legacy of heavy bombing during the Indochina war, with unexploded
ordinances (UXO) still affecting half of the country’s territory, as indicated in Box 1 of the
IMF Country Report No. 05/8. Since the end of the war, these leftover bombs have
continuously threatened the lives of the Lao people, causing widespread injury and death,
thus naturally affecting the socio-economic development of the country. The authorities
would like to express appreciation to the donor community for financial support aimed at
accelerating UXO clearance as this is needed to help meet MDGs.
Recent Economic Developments
Real GDP growth in 2004/05 has been quite robust as in the previous year. The estimated 7.2
percent growth was attributable mainly to industrial production, construction, tourism and
agriculture. The exchange rate has remained stable since 2002 and the spread between the
bank and parallel market rates has been kept below 2 percent. Inflation accelerated in
October 2005 to 9.4 percent, mostly stemming from supply-side factors, particularly
increasing oil and rice prices. Stable world oil supply and a new harvest of rice gradually
reduced inflation to 8.8 percent by the end of 2005.

-2As the staff indicated, Lao PDR’s external position was stable in 2005 despite a number of
adverse shocks. Rapid export growth, high world gold and copper prices and FDI inflows
allowed gross official reserves to reach US$226 million by the end of 2005, equivalent to
about 3 months of imports. However, strong growth in imports arising mainly from higher oil
prices and capital goods associated with the construction of the NT2 dam and the mining
sector kept the external current account deficit at 17 percent of GDP.
Outlook
Lao PDR’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with expected growth rates of about 7-8
percent, led by manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and construction. This is higher than the
staff’s medium-term projection of about 6-7 percent which does not take into account many
pipeline projects that would have a large impact on future economic activity, revenues and
exports. Since the end of 2005, an increasing number of foreign companies have shown
interest in investing in the hydro-power sector in Lao PDR, in addition to the Nam Theun 2
project. In particular, the Xekaman 3 hydropower project ($273 million) is expected to export
electricity to Vietnam starting 2009. This will be a joint venture with Vietnamese concerns
and Electricité de Lao (EDL) with a 15 percent stake. The $800 million Nam Ngum 2 project
is slated to export electricity to Thailand starting in late 2010. This project will be equally
owned by the government of Laos and three Thai companies. In addition, the construction of
the $600 million Nam Ngum 3 project, which will have a capacity of 460 MW, is scheduled
to begin in 2008 and is expected to be able to generate power by 2013. This project will be
equally owned by the Lao government, two Japanese companies and a Thai industrial utility
developer.
My authorities also believe that even aside from these large projects, the underlying strength
of the economy is greater than described by the staff, although there are of course many
challenges. Large investment in roads and bridges and the decentralization policy have also
promoted growth, albeit mainly in areas close to the fast growing neighboring countries. In
the tourism sector, the National Tourism Administration is expecting more than a million
visitors to Laos in 2006, generating huge revenues for the tourism sector. This will spawn the
emergence and growth of small and medium scale enterprises which would support broadbased growth. The many rural development activities that were initiated in the fifth
development plan should help the rural sector although this process may be slower to show
results.
Fiscal Policy
On the fiscal front, the authorities agree with the staff that the main priority is to mobilize
revenue through an improved tax and customs administration as well as by strengthening
central government control over revenue administration and treasury operation in the
provinces. This will take due regard of sequencing, especially the need to strengthen local
administrative capacity and financial reporting and auditing. In this connection, as a first
step, the authorities have passed the new Customs Law and established the regional customs
offices under the authority of the National Customs Department.

-3As highlighted in the staff report, the preliminary fiscal outturn for 2004/05 indicates that the
budget deficit declined to 3½ percent of GDP, the same level as in 2003/04, whilst revenue
collections increased from 11 to 11.4 percent of GDP. For the 2005/06 budget, the authorities
will implement the fiscal package approved by the National Assembly in October 2005,
which targets revenue at 11.9 percent of GDP and expenditure at 20.1 percent of GDP.
The staff highlighted that the revenue target is overambitious and warned that the new
revenue bonus scheme will erode revenue collection. Our authorities disagree and believe
that the new revenue bonus scheme, at one percent of total taxes collected (0.5 percent for
customs duties and 1.5 percent for other taxes) will be an important element to strengthen
revenue performance. These funds go to the Tax and Customs Departments to pay for the
cost of collecting revenue. In particular, this will give the local revenue offices a stronger
incentive to administer the revenue system according to the law. Nevertheless, the authorities
are keeping an open mind on this and if the actual outturn shows that the new revenue bonus
scheme does not produce the expected positive results, the authorities are committed to
strengthening other revenue reforms for the next fiscal year.
On the expenditure front, the authorities’ focus will be on the health and education sectors
along with road construction and institutional capacity building. In particular, the authorities
have given priority to improved social services, particularly in terms of health and education
for the rural areas, which lack teachers and nurses. In this connection, the authorities will be
recruiting 8,000 employees to be deployed in the rural areas, with the commitment to cut
back spending should the revenue outturn fall below target. The staff have pointed to the
need to contain increases in the wage bill and the authorities agree with them. However, the
authorities wish to clarify that the increase in the wage bill reflects the extra cost of the eight
thousand to be deployed to the rural areas and not the basic salaries of civil servants.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) has been successful in implementing its monetary policy
framework to cap inflation at a single digit. In order to further reduce inflation, the monetary
stance of the BOL will continue to remain firm. Tight control over the BOL’s net domestic
assets will continue to be the main anchor of monetary policy. Credit extended by the State
commercial banks (SCBs) will continue to be restrained and limited to 12 percent in the year
ending September 2006, compared to 14 percent growth for total commercial bank credit.
The actual credit growth of SCBs will be based on a careful risk assessment under new
appraisal procedures, especially for foreign currency loans. Under this cautious stance, broad
money is expected to grow by 18 percent in the year ending September 2006. This will allow
gross international reserves to further increase to $240 million (3 months of imports) by
September 2006.
On exchange rate policy, a managed floating exchange rate system has served Lao PDR well.
The exchange rate has remained stable since 2002 and the spread between the bank and
parallel market rates has been kept below 2 percent. The stable exchange rate has allowed the
BOL to continue a prudent easing of the monetary policy stance while maintaining reserves
at a comfortable level. In this respect, the authorities’ intervention in the foreign exchange

-4market is aimed at smoothing transitory fluctuations in the exchange rate, and maintaining an
adequate level of reserves.
Structural Reforms
On the structural front, the authorities recognize that strengthening structural reform efforts
in all sectors, particularly in the state commercial banks, state owned enterprises (SOEs) and
the trade sector, and undertaking reforms to improve the investment climate for the
promotion of private sector driven growth will be key to promoting economic efficiency and
competitiveness. And these are crucial for sustainable economic growth and poverty
eradication. Toward this end, the authorities will focus their efforts on increasing tax
collection, strengthening public expenditure management and fiscal transparency,
implementation of an agricultural and rural development strategy, reduction in transaction
costs for initiating business activity, a strengthened financial system and reform of the
judicial sector.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s overall assessment of Lao PDR’s financial
system. In this context, the government will continue to implement the banking sector reform
program supported by the AsDB, the World Bank, and the European Union. The authorities
will maintain the two international bank advisors and four assistant bank advisors in the
SCBs. As the SCBs become stronger under the reform process, the government will seek a
strategic investor for one of the two reformed SCBs by 2006. The authorities agree with the
staff that on-site and off-site inspections and overall credit limits for the SCBs will be
maintained and critical operational benchmarks will continue to be provided for these
institutions. In this context, the authorities intend to proceed with the recapitalization of the
SCBs in four tranches from 2006 to 2008, based on the performance of each bank with
respect to its respective governance agreement.
With regard to the cement project, the authorities consider it to be essential to the economy’s
future. Based on their assessment, the project is a viable and bankable project and the
authorities are exploring ways to increase equity in this project and to diversify its sources of
financing. Recently, the authorities have received investment bids from countries eager to
participate in the project, namely Canada, France and Switzerland, and the authorities are
now engaged in the process of selecting the most appropriate investor.
External Debt
Although Lao PDR’s level of external debt is high, our authorities are committed to bringing
the debt to GDP ratio on a downward trend. The authorities have reaffirmed that they do not
intend to seek debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. In particular, our authorities
believe that the analysis in the staff report overstates the risks for servicing the debt
accumulated since 1999. A substantial part of this debt was incurred to support the
government’s investment in the electricity sector as well as in other utilities and roads and
bridges. Our authorities believe that this debt will directly add to the economy’s capacity to
service this debt. Although much of this debt was channeled through the government, it was
onlent to enterprises, especially EDL, who will be responsible for servicing this debt from

-5export earnings and user charges, and will contribute royalties and dividends to the
government.
The Lao PDR authorities reiterate their continued commitment to sound macroeconomic
management and the reform agenda, consistent with the sixth five-year plan (2006-2010) and
the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The reform program seeks
to raise Lao PDR from the rank of least-developed country by 2020 while the key policy
goals for the sixth five-year plan (2006-2010) are robust growth, rural development, poverty
reduction, low inflation, and improvement in fiscal and monetary management. Despite our
authorities’ view on the HIPC Initiative, they acknowledge the large challenge in attaining
these objectives. For this reason, our authorities would welcome a shift to grant financing by
the international financial institutions, especially for social sector, rural development, poverty
reduction, environmental, and technical assistance projects.
Data Issue
Despite the recent improvements in statistical data, our authorities recognize that there is
room for further improvement in many areas to ensure quality data is used for policy
formulation and dissemination to the public. Therefore, they would welcome receiving
assistance from the donor community to provide capacity enhancement in this area, including
suitable training for local personnel and the development of necessary processes.
Ex Post Assessment
The authorities appreciate staff’s efforts and broadly agree with the ex post assessment
(EPA) provided by staff. The EPA confirms that the Fund-supported programs that Lao PDR
engaged in over the last decade have been beneficial. Under the Fund-supported programs,
balance of payments stability was restored, the government’s GDP targets were met, and
poverty was reduced. On the structural front, prices were liberalized, the trade and payments
systems have gradually opened up, and the privatization of non-strategic state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) has been largely completed. In particular, macroeconomic stability
regained momentum under the PRGF arrangement during April 2001-April 2005. However,
the EPA also highlighted that the implementation of fiscal and banking reforms has been
slower than originally planned. Persevering with these reforms will be the focus of our
authorities’ efforts in the period ahead.
The findings of the EPA raised concerns about the authorities’ ownership of the reforms
under the PRGF. Our authorities are strongly committed to the reforms agreed under the
PRGF and other IFI-supported programs. However, they believe that capacity constraints
both at the provincial and local government levels, coupled with a desire to move ahead with
reforms on many fronts, contributed significantly to the difficulties in the timely
implementation of the many conditions agreed under the IFI-supported programs. In
particular, during the period 2002-2005, the authorities were simultaneously implementing
the PRGF, a Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC) and Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) - which later became the Poverty Reduction Support Operation
(PRSO) - financed by the World Bank, and a Banking Sector Restructuring Program Loan

-6(BSRPL), financed by the AsDB. Also, as more experience and input on the reforms were
obtained, some modifications to the substance, sequencing, and timing were needed.
Nevertheless, as evident in the progress reported on the revenue, public expenditure
management, and banking reforms, our authorities are fully committed to achieving the
objectives of these economic reforms. Looking forward, they agree that engagement with the
Fund is currently best served through surveillance and technical assistance. Our authorities
look forward to the support and understanding from the international community to assist in
the continuation of the reform efforts in Lao PDR.
Conclusion
Our authorities highly value continued support from the international community, including
the Fund. Despite the numerous difficulties of the past, our authorities have achieved
significant economic success, not least of which is stabilizing the economy. They recognize
that much remains to be done before the country can achieve its medium term poverty
reduction goals. They are studying best practice approaches to adopting a VAT that is
appropriate for the Laotian economy in order to improve revenue mobilization. Our
authorities are encouraging the private sector to utilize the opportunity of the NTR with the
US to foster trade and are taking some primary steps toward WTO accession. The authorities
are firm in their intention to continue with prudent macroeconomic policies, liberalization of
the economy and improvements in the business climate.
We are pleased to inform the Board that the Laotian authorities consent to the publication of
the staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation, and the accompanying documents, with
necessary deletion of market sensitive information.
