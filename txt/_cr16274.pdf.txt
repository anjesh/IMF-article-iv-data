IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Chad
On July 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with Chad.1
Macroeconomic outcomes continue to underperform potential, due to the major impact of
two exogenous shocks: the lower oil prices and the elevated regional insecurity. Oil revenues
have collapsed to a fraction of their previous level and are expected to only partially and
gradually recover. The threat to security in the region remains serious, causing economic
disruption, reprioritization of spending to defense, hosting of refugees and internally
displaced persons, and exacerbating the difficult economic situation.
Economic activity has slowed sharply in 2015, with GDP growth estimated to have
decelerated to 1.8 percent from 6.9 percent in 2014. Disruptions to cross–border trade flows
with Cameroon and Nigeria have led to increased volatility of domestic prices, reaching 3.7
percent on average in 2015, slightly above the CEMAC target of 3 percent. Despite a large
fiscal adjustment, the overall fiscal deficit remained high (6.6 percent of non-oil GDP) in
2015 and domestic arrears were accumulated to reach 3.9 percent of non-oil GDP (CFAF 200
billion) at the end of the year. Money supply contracted and credit to the private sector
slowed significantly in 2015. The external current account deficit widened from 9 percent of
GDP in 2014 to an estimated 12.4 percent of GDP in 2015 on account of the further decline
in oil prices and a corresponding fall in exports.
The short and medium term outlooks remain challenging. Including a contraction of 1.1
percent in 2016, GDP growth is projected to average about 2 percent per year over 2016–18,
compared to almost 5 percent over 2013-15. A gradual recovery of non-oil GDP growth is
expected over 2016-2018, reaching 4 percent per year over the medium term. This would be
largely driven by agriculture, commerce, and transportation and as fiscal constraints ease
with a rebound of fiscal oil revenues. The external position is projected to remain weak, with

only a gradual improvement in the trade balance starting in 2017. Foreign direct investment
in the oil sector will remain a key source of external financing.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Chadian authorities’ policy efforts, with a substantial
fiscal adjustment achieved, and progress on the structural front despite an adverse external
environment. Nonetheless, the macroeconomic situation and the near-term outlook are being
seriously affected by the collapse in oil revenue and the elevated regional insecurity, which
have weakened economic activity and worsened the fiscal situation. Against this backdrop,
Directors stressed that additional fiscal efforts and bolder structural reforms are needed to
safeguard fiscal and financial stability and the recent progress in human development as well
as to bolster the non-oil economy. Continued close engagement with the Fund and the
international community is crucial to support the authorities’ efforts.
Directors welcomed the fiscal adjustment measures adopted, including in the revised 2016
budget. Noting the precarious liquidity situation and uncertainty regarding exceptional
receipts from the sale of an oil sector asset, they urged the authorities to elaborate a
contingency plan to guide spending should the risk of a significant shortfall in fiscal receipts
materialize. Directors also recommended limiting spending commitments strictly to available
resources to avoid a breakdown in the expenditure chain and further accumulation of arrears.
They stressed that a comprehensive arrears clearance strategy, based on the validation
process of an independent audit, is imperative.
Directors underscored the need for a medium-term fiscal strategy that incorporates a sizable
permanent adjustment while protecting the more vulnerable segments of the population.
Welcoming the authorities’ intention to mobilize more non-oil revenue, Directors noted the
importance of expanding the non-oil revenue base, reducing tax exemptions, and
strengthening tax and customs administrations.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to strengthen public financial
management, with a focus on stricter spending controls and enhanced spending efficiency.
They stressed that enhanced oil revenue transparency is crucial for better budget preparation
and execution as well as for accountability.
Directors noted that, despite high liquidity levels, the banking sector is vulnerable to the
fiscal deterioration and needs to be closely monitored in coordination with relevant regional
bodies. They encouraged the authorities to be mindful of possible crowding out of credit to
the private sector when placing government securities with commercial banks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed that the challenges posed by the difficult economic environment represent
an opportunity to press ahead with bold structural reforms aimed at diversifying the
economy, improving the business climate, fostering financial inclusion, and achieving more
inclusive growth. They looked forward to the details of the authorities’ upcoming national
development plan covering 2016–2020, particularly in the areas of agriculture, human
capital, governance, judiciary reform, and social protection.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic outcomes continue to underperform potential, due to the
major impact of two exogenous shocks: the lower oil prices and the elevated regional
insecurity. Oil revenues have collapsed to a fraction of their previous level and are
expected to only partially and gradually recover. Spending has been significantly
retrenched, but liquidity problems abound, and domestic arrears are accruing on a large
scale. Given the government’s share in the economy, the spillovers to the rest of the
economy are severe and recent gains in development outcomes under threat. The
threat to security in the region remains serious, causing economic disruption,
reprioritization of spending to defense, hosting of refugees and internally displaced
persons, and exacerbating the difficult economic situation.
Article IV discussions focused on the adaptation of the fiscal stance to low oil prices,
on macro-financial linkages— financial sector vulnerabilities have increased—and on
the strategy to diversify the economy, including through enhanced effectiveness and
transparency of government operations. Progress should help Chad exit from fragility.
Key policy recommendations:
 Ensure a fully-financed 2016 budget. Implement cash-based budget management
procedures for the remainder of the year to avoid the accumulation of new arrears.
 Target medium-term non-oil primary deficits consistent with fiscal and debt
sustainability, and expand fiscal space through non-oil revenue mobilization efforts. A
large upfront fiscal adjustment is needed and under current oil price and volume
prospects would need to be mostly permanent.
 Define and implement a comprehensive strategy for clearing domestic arrears and
avoid further accumulation going forward.
 Strengthen public financial management, including investment planning and
execution, and enhance oil revenue transparency and integrity.
 Closely monitor the health of the banking system given its high direct and indirect
exposure to government operations.
 Foster inclusive growth and economic diversification by implementing the priorities
of the upcoming 2016-2020 National Development Plan including improving the
business environment and strengthening financial inclusion.

BACKGROUND
1.
Human development indicators are improving slowly in Chad, but challenges to longterm development remain. The onset of oil production in 2003 helped increase spending in
various socio-economic areas and accelerated economic growth. Real GDP per capita increased by
around 20 percent between 2007 and 2014. But because of rapid population growth and domestic
armed conflicts that plagued Chad up to 2009, the absolute number of the poor still increased and
per capita consumption for the poorest rural households declined. The arrival in 2010 of internal
political stability paved the way for improved economic management and Chad achieved the HIPC
Completion Point in April 2015. Still, despite the progress, Chad’s human development indicators
remain among the lowest in the region (Text Fig. 1). A recent deterioration in external (economic
and security) conditions poses challenges to the achievement of the country’s socio-economic
development goals.

2.
In Presidential elections in April 2016, President Déby comfortably won a fifth term in
office. Mr. Déby, who is in office since 1990, received nearly 62 percent of the votes while running
against 12 opposition candidates. Legislative elections are also due for 2016 but no date has been
set yet.
3.
The massive and persistent decline in oil prices since mid-2014 combined with
elevated regional insecurity pose huge challenges for Chad. From 2013 to 2015, Chad has
experienced an 80 percent reduction in fiscal oil revenue. This is mainly the result of the drop in oil
prices, but also the repayment of the 2016 installments on the oil sales’ advances which funded the
government’s acquisition in 2013 of a large oil asset. Meanwhile, the deterioration in regional
security is disrupting economic activity, especially cross-border trade. N’Djamena was the target of
terrorist attacks by Boko Haram in June and July 2015. Chad plays a key role in the regional military
counteroffensive against Boko Haram, and continues to assist the Mali government, bearing the
associated fiscal costs. In addition, Chad hosts some 750,000 refugees and displaced people, with
significant direct and indirect economic costs.
4.
The authorities’ response to those shocks over 2014-15 included a large fiscal
adjustment (with a 30 percent reduction in domestically-financed spending) and the
mobilization of additional financing. Financing flows included advances from the regional central
bank (BEAC), securities’ issuances in the regional market, an agreement on a new repayment
schedule of the oil sales’ advances, and budget support from the World Bank, the European Union,
the African Development Bank, and Saudi Arabia, complemented by disbursements from the Fund
and debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. Still, domestic payment arrears accumulated with knock-on
effects on economic activity and the health of the banking system.1
5.
Traction of previous policy advice has been broadly satisfactory as attested by the
approval of an ECF-supported program in 2014 and completion of two reviews by December
2015 (Box 1). The advice of the 2013 Article IV fed into the ECF approved in August 2014 and is
being followed up in the context of its reviews. However, the policy dialogue and advice have had to
adapt to the impacts of the sharp and sustained fall in oil prices and the deterioration of the security
situation.

1

The oil sales’ advances were rescheduled, extending the repayment period from 4 to 6-7 years, but also now calling
on other oil revenue beyond the income from the asset, for their repayment.

Box 1. Chad: Implementation of Key Recommendations from the 2013
Article IV Consultation (completed March 2014)
Key recommendations: Fiscal policy should remain anchored on a sustained reduction of the non-oil
primary deficit, supported by public management reforms and sizable increases in non-oil revenue collection
to offset the projected exhaustion of oil revenue. A more diversified and competitive economy over the
medium- and long-terms will require increased efforts to improve the business environment for the private
sector, promote agricultural activities, and expand access to basic and financial services.
Implementation: A three-year arrangement under an ECF approved in August 2014 planned a smooth
decline in the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) in the context of a doubling of oil export volumes and a
gradual decline in international oil prices. The focus of the government’s structural reform agenda under the
program was on strengthening public financial management (PFM) and on improving governance and the
business climate.
Given the sharp decline in oil prices, preserving fiscal and debt sustainability required a much more rapid
reduction in the NOPD than planned. A large expenditure compression took place in 2014-2015 combined
with the mobilization of more domestic and external (concessional) financing to smooth the adjustment and
limit adverse effects on non–oil economic activity.
Implementation of structural reforms was framed within the 2013-15 National Development Plan. The use of
emergency spending procedures (Dépenses avant Ordonnancement, DAOs) was curtailed, most CEMAC PFM
directives were transposed into domestic legislation, quarterly budget execution reports were published, and
inter-ministerial debt and oil revenue coordination units were established. However, actual progress has
been slow and uneven due to limits to institutional capacity including the capacity to absorb technical
assistance.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Macroeconomic outcomes have weakened in the face of the persistent oil price shock and regional
security problems. Acute liquidity problems in the first half of 2016 have forced the government to
severely limit spending and to continue to accrue domestic arrears with adverse impacts on private
sector activity and the banking system.
6.
Economic activity has slowed sharply. GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated
significantly to 1.8 percent in 2015 from 6.9 percent in 2014 (Text Figure 2b). This sharp slowdown
was largely due to a 2.9 percent contraction in the non–oil sector (compared to a 7.1 percent
expansion in 2014). Erratic rainfall hit food crops, while livestock and fishing activities were affected
by the weakened security situation and a difficult economic situation in Nigeria. Both the secondary
and tertiary sectors contracted significantly due to the sharp adjustment to fiscal spending and to
disruptions caused by the deterioration of security conditions.
7.
Disruptions to cross–border trade flows with Cameroon and Nigeria have led to
increased volatility of domestic prices. Due in particular to food items (46 percent of the
consumer price index), inflation reached 7.6 percent year-on-year in August 2015, then turned
negative at end-2015 (-0.3 percent year-on-year), and going further negative in 2016,

reaching -3.4 percent in March. The annual average for 2015 was 3.7 percent, slightly above the
CEMAC target of 3 percent.
8.
Despite a large fiscal adjustment, the overall fiscal deficit remained high in 2015 and
domestic arrears accrued. Total fiscal revenue fell 40 percent short of the 2015 revised budget
target. In particular, customs revenue disappointed: it fell by 16 percent relative to 2014 on account
of security disruptions to crossText Figure 2a. Chad: Evolution of non-oil

CFAF 148 billion in domestic arrears were accumulated, raising its end-2015 stock to 3.9 percent of
non-oil GDP (CFAF 200 billion). A successful expansion in the placement of Treasury bills and bonds
in the regional market (a net issuance of CFAF 188 billion) was mostly used to swap non-tradable
public debt and pay some claims that were under litigation.2 External budget support amounted to
CFAF 90 billion.3 After a temporary increase in September on account of the statutory and
exceptional advances, government deposits at the BEAC declined to CFAF 93.4 billion at the end of
2015, against CFAF 119.3 billion one year before.
9.
The sharp decline in oil revenue in early 2016 has seriously complicated fiscal
management. Oil revenues (net of oil sales advances’ repayments and cash calls contributions) were
only 0.4 percent of non-oil GDP in the first quarter, while non-oil revenue also lagged due to an
apparent deceleration of economic activity. The government paid salaries and debt service with
difficulty (even accruing some small external arrears with multilateral creditors for a few days) and
appeared to be forced to drastically restrict spending on goods and services, transfers, and
investment even in the run-up to the presidential elections. Apart from an increase in the stock of
arrears to CFAF 280 billion at end-March, available data do not allow to ascertain the success of
those restrictions in containing spending commitments.

oil GDP) decelerated sharply during the year and increased by only 0.7 percent on an annual
average basis. The health of the banking system has been impacted by the difficult economic
situation and the accumulation of arrears by the government. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose
from 11.7 to 16.5 percent of total loans over the twelve months up to December 2015 and their
provisioning was limited to 56.1 percent against 68.3 percent one year before. This could negatively
affect banks’ capacity and willingness to lend.
11.
The external accounts weakened in 2015. The external current account deficit widened
from 9 percent of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 12.4 percent of GDP in 2015 on account of the
further decline in oil prices and a corresponding fall in exports. The current account deficit was
partially financed by foreign direct investment, concentrated in the oil sector. The remainder was
financed with a rundown in the level of pooled international reserves imputed to Chad from
US$1.19 billion at end-2014 to US$390 million at end- 2015 (approximately 1 month of imports).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The short and medium-term outlooks are challenging in the context of permanent external shocks.
12.
Real GDP growth is expected to continue to slow as the non-oil sector lags. Including a
contraction of 1.1 percent in 2016, GDP growth is projected to average about 2 percent per year
over 2016–18, compared to almost 5 percent over 2013-15. Sizable planned production increases in
certain fields have been delayed until oil prices improve sufficiently. A gradual recovery of non-oil
GDP growth is expected over 2016-2018, reaching 4 percent per year over the medium term. This
would be largely driven by agriculture, commerce, and transportation and as fiscal constraints ease
with a rebound of fiscal oil revenues. In contrast, contracting bank credit to the private sector during
this period would slow the recovery of non-oil tertiary activities.

The external position is projected to remain weak, with only a gradual improvement in
the trade balance starting in 2017. Foreign direct investment in the oil sector will remain a key
source of external financing. Imputed international reserves will remain low.
14.
Risks are mostly tilted to the downside (Annex 1, Risk Assessment Matrix), reflecting
internal and external vulnerabilities. Internally, a potential deterioration in food security is a key risk
that could lead to social and political tensions in an already fragile environment and jeopardize the
government’s fiscal position as authorities respond to a crisis. Externally, a deterioration of regional
security and low (and volatile) international oil prices pose significant fiscal risks and could further
dampen economic growth prospects. The pick-up in oil production levels now envisaged for 201819 could be delayed further if oil prices do not recover as currently projected. Budgetary pressures
in Chad could spill over to other CEMAC countries through a deterioration in regional security
conditions if Chad’s military efforts weakened, or through pressures on the currency union, if Chad
presses the regional central bank for additional monetary financing.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
In addition to the outlook and risks, discussions focused on the fiscal adjustment to permanently lower
oil prices while addressing development needs, the implications of macro-financial linkages for
financial sector stability, options for diversifying the economy, and the effectiveness and transparency
of government operations.

A. Living with Low Oil Prices: Adjusting the Fiscal Stance for Long-Term
Debt Sustainability while Addressing Development Needs
15.
Chad’s fiscal strategy needs to include a sizable permanent adjustment. Prospects for
the short-term are more difficult on account of lower oil prices and export volumes and the
repayment of oil sales’ advances. While liquidity constraints are expected to be gradually loosened
over the medium-term, government spending would have to be adjusted significantly relative to the
pre-2015 levels. This adjustment is also needed to bring Chad into compliance with the regional
convergence framework over the medium-term.4
16.
Lower oil prices are negatively affecting oil production prospects and increasing the
share of revenue devoted to debt repayments. Fiscal oil revenue is expected to be significantly
lower in the medium-term than in previous

As elaborated in CEMAC--Staff Report on the Common Policies of member Countries (SM/16/99), in late 2015, the
CEMAC Commission presented a revised regional convergence framework to enter into force on January 1, 2017. The
new framework includes a new fiscal rule based on a three-year average overall budget balance excluding a share of
oil revenues.

17.
Reflecting the weaker than expected revenue performance in early 2016, the
government has submitted to parliament a revised budget for 2016 with further expenditure
adjustment. With lower revenue, and the decision to pay down CFAF 65 billion in domestic arrears
(Box 3), the 2016 budget that was approved in December 2015 is estimated to have a financing gap
of at least 3.9 percent of non-oil GDP (CFAF 204 billion). The revised budget submitted to the
National Assembly in late May addresses this with further spending cuts of 2 percent of non-oil
GDP, mostly in domestically-financed investment. It includes a slight expansion of the wage bill to
accommodate recruitment of youngsters, and protects poverty-reducing social spending. For
covering the remaining financing gap, the revised budget counts on continued borrowing from the
regional market, financing under the ECF-supported program (Box 2), and budget support from
other international partners (AfDB, E.U., and World Bank) of approximately 1.4 percent of non-oil
GDP (CFAF 70 billion).
Box 2. Chad: Status of the ECF-Supported Program
On August 1st, 2014, a three-year ECF arrangement was approved in support of the authorities’
medium-term economic program aimed at reinforcing economic growth and making it more inclusive, while
maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. The government’s structural reform agenda
focused on strengthening public financial management (PFM) and on improving governance and the business
climate. The approval of the arrangement and the completion of the first review on April 27, 2015 together
with an augmentation of access, then the second review on December 14, 2015, enabled total disbursements
of SDR 53.93 million (about US$75 million).
Despite an extremely difficult economic and financial environment, performance under the ECFsupported program was broadly satisfactory at end-2015. All but one performance criteria (PCs) for endDecember 2015 were met and progress on the structural agenda was in line with program objectives. While
the non-oil primary deficit target was met thanks to lower than programmed public investment, the ceiling on
the non-accumulation of domestic arrears was missed by a large margin on account of a further drop in oil and
non-oil revenue and domestic financing shortfalls. Key structural reforms implemented in 2015 included:
incorporating more detailed oil revenue information in budget execution reports, limiting expenditures
executed through extraordinary procedures, and updating and expansion of the taxpayers’ database were met.
However, progress in implementing the structural agenda has slowed in recent months.
Discussions with staff are continuing on policies that would allow completion of the third review. In
particular, there is a need to ensure that adequate financing assurances are in place for the implementation of
the 2016 budget (¶18). In addition, in the face of consecutive breaches to the PCs on the accumulation of
domestic arrears, staff and authorities have discussed a comprehensive strategy targeting both the clearance
of existing arrears and strengthening control over expenditure commitments to avoid a reoccurrence of this
problem.

18.
Uncertainty over the timing and magnitude of revenues from the planned sale of an
oil asset in 2016, raises concerns on the ability of the authorities to implement the revised
budget. Both the initial and revised 2016 budgets include CFAF 300 billion (5.8 percent of non-oil
GDP) from the sale of Chad’s 10 percent share in oil fields operated by the China National Petroleum
Company International (CNPCI). However, this operation has not yet materialized and negotiations
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

are still ongoing. In this context, staff recommended that the authorities elaborate a contingency
plan including: a further cut in investment spending, to be informed by a rigorous evaluation of the
status of projects under execution; slowing additional hiring; and possibly sale of other assets.. Staff
advised to align further arrears clearance operations with assurances about the required financing
from asset sales, to avoid accumulation of new arrears. In this context, staff 2016 projections assume
that the CFA 300 billion gap is covered, in broadly equal proportions, with further spending cuts,
proceeds from an asset sale, and financing sources yet to be identified.
19.
A strict cash-based budget execution for the remainder of 2016 would help limit
commitments to available financing. The liquidity situation remains precarious: net oil revenues
are small and hard to predict in part due to complex schemes to set repayments of oil sales
advances; most budget support is projected for the end of the year; and the timing and size of any
oil asset sale are uncertain. In that context, to avoid the accumulation of arrears and the breakdown
of the expenditure chain, staff recommends that spending units in sectoral ministries not be allowed
to commit to spending unless notified of the availability of resources by the Treasury. One option
would be to prepare a revise budget based on very prudent resource availability assumptions and
with pre-defined spending prioritization criteria. Over the medium term the government will have to
address the accumulated arrears, through the elaboration of a comprehensive arrears clearance
strategy with claims identified and validated by an independent audit (Box 3).
Authorities’ views
The authorities consider producing a fully-financed 2016 budget a matter of urgency and continue
to pursue the sale of their oil asset at the projected price later this year, possibly through an
international tender. Nonetheless, they are also considering further limits in budgetary
appropriations and bridge financing options on a concessional basis. In the meantime, they have
prepared a quarterly cash flow plan to calibrate spending and domestic financing in line with
available liquidity while protecting social spending as much as possible. The costs of the hiring of
additional youth were partly offset by the plan not to replace retirees. While favoring a speedier
repayment of domestic arrears, the authorities agreed it would have to be consistent with available
resources. They were optimistic that their domestic financing could be realized, considering the
relatively low volume of debt maturing in 2016 and the comfortable level of liquidity in the region’s
banks following the recent reduction in reserve requirements by the BEAC.

Box 3. Chad: Management and Prevention of Government Domestic Payments’ Arrears
Domestic arrears quadrupled in 2015. Domestic payment arrears are defined as expenditures committed,
with goods and services delivered, and approved for payment by the Treasury but which have not been paid
within 90 days after issuance of the payment order. From the relatively low level of 1 percent of non-oil GDP
at end-2014, these arrears increased to CFAF 200 billion (3.9 percent of non-oil GDP) in 2015.
Lower oil revenue and domestic financing were the main causes. Arrears accrued on account of lowerthan-expected oil fiscal revenue and a shortfall in net domestic financing (aside from BEAC financing) as a
large part of the placements of public securities in the regional market were used to swap non-tradable
public debt. In addition, the authorities unexpectedly repaid a claim of 0.9 percent of non-oil GDP that was
under litigation and hitherto unrecorded in the domestic arrears stock.
Government strategy for clearing domestic arrears. The authorities planned in 2016 to repay CFAF 65
billion in existing arrears, funded by securities issued in late-March 2016. The proceeds were transferred to a
local commercial bank which was tasked with the repayment of specific arrears identified by a government
commission.
These arrears were selected based on size and longevity, the business sector, the size of the creditor, and
the impact settlement would have on employment. They were separately validated by the Inspector General
at the Presidency. Creditors who chose to avail themselves of this facility would be repaid 93 percent of their
claims, with the 7 percent discount a benefit of the bank managing the operation.
Next steps. Based on international best practices, the following principles should guide the Chadian
authorities’ arrears clearance strategy going forward:
- The repayment of arrears has to be consistent with the availability of resources under the short- and
medium-term fiscal projections.
- An audit needs to identify and validate comprehensively all domestic payment arrears and spending
commitments which may not have been entered into the expenditure chain but have legal merit.
- A strategy needs to be developed to address the root causes. In particular, commitment controls need to
be strengthened to prevent spending (particularly investment) for which there is no budget allocation.

20.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) concludes that preserving fiscal and debt
sustainability will require targeting NOPDs of about 5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2017-18 and
6-7 percent over the medium-term.5 This could be achieved by limiting the wage bill growth,
strictly prioritizing investments, and rationalizing transfers further, while protecting priority social
spending as much as possible. In addition, fiscal space will need to be created by expanding the
non-oil tax base through a rationalization of exemptions.
21.
The DSA update indicates that Chad remains at a high risk of debt distress, with
vulnerabilities concentrated in the short term. With oil prices lower than in the previous DSA,
some external debt ratios have deteriorated. The high risk of debt distress is further explained by
large debt service payments falling due in the short- to medium-term linked to the nonconcessional oil sales’ advances from Glencore. The DSA also identifies vulnerabilities related to
5

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

domestic debt given the accumulation of domestic arrears and the increased issuances of debt
securities in the regional market. Moreover, a small amount of arrears has been recently accrued to
the WB and the AfDB. The substantial fiscal adjustment assumed in the baseline scenario would
keep debt indicators below their indicative thresholds in the medium- to long-term.
Authorities’ views
The authorities agreed on the need to target prudent NOPDs to preserve fiscal and debt
sustainability. They stressed that the composition of expenditure adjustments would need to be
synchronized with the national development plan for 2016-20. They were strongly committed to
raise non-oil revenue mobilization with reforms drawn from the recent technical assistance
recommendations. They broadly agreed with the results of the DSA exercise, in particular that a
moderate stock of debt in terms of GDP nonetheless posed risks given the vulnerability to the oil
price shocks and the heavy short-term burden of the recent oil sales advances. The authorities have
resolved the arrears to multilateral creditors that have been recently accumulated due to liquidity
shortages.

B. Enhancing Financial Sector Stability and Development6
22.
While the financial system is small, the latest available indicators suggest some
deterioration in banking sector soundness as the macroeconomic environment has weakened
(Table 7). Financial system assets represented just 16 percent of GDP as of December 2015, or only
7 percent of CEMAC banks’ assets (versus a 15 percent share of CEMAC’s total GDP). It is dominated
by a handful of commercial banks, with three banks holding close to two thirds of total assets. The
ratio of NPLs to gross bank loans rose to 16.5 percent as of end-2015, a 5 percentage point increase
from 2014. Returns on assets and on equity have also declined for two consecutive years. The capital
adequacy ratio remained moderate at 14.6 percent as of end-2015 but well below the peak of
22 percent in 2013, while liquidity ratios remained favorable, with for instance liquid assets
representing 26 percent of total assets. Going forward, with a dimmer domestic economic outlook
there are significant risks to financial stability.
23.
The link between declining oil prices and deteriorating banking soundness indicators
is critically driven by banks’ exposure to government operations. While extractive industries
accounted for only 3.9 percent of banks’ loans to the private sector in 2015, the banking system is
highly exposed to the government and to companies dependent on government operations, making
it vulnerable to the impact of the sharp fall in oil prices on public finances (Text Fig. 4). Exposures to
government are increasing: commercial banks’ credit to the public sector reached 28 percent of
total credit in 2015, up from 21 percent in 2014; and public sector deposits constituted about
21 percent of total deposit in 2015, down from 26 percent in 2014. With government spending
accounting for a large portion of economic activity in Chad (more than 30 percent of non-oil GDP

over 2009-2014), recent cuts in public spending and accumulation of domestic payment arrears can
drag private sector contractors and borrowers into financial distress, elevating risks of NPLs.

Changes in the composition of assets and liabilities have added to banks’ vulnerabilities.
High liquidity and largely deposit-based funding are traditionally key strengths of Chadian commercial
banks. Sight deposits account for 85 percent of total deposits (the highest ratio among CEMAC
members). With liquid assets representing 142 percent of short-term liabilities at end-2015, the
banking system is highly liquid. The deposit intermediation level remains prudent with a deposits-toloans ratio of 94 percent at end- 2015, however it is on a trend decline (Text Fig. 5). The following
developments have tilted risks up for Chad’s banking system:

The successful introduction of



The placement of (medium-term) government securities (¶17 and Box 3) to pay domestic arrears
can lead to increased direct exposure to the government and a reduction in short-term credit to
private companies with negative trickle-down effects on economic activity.

25.
Further increases in NPLs or declines in deposits could affect some banks’ ability to
comply with regulatory ratios, which calls for a close monitoring of the banking sector.
According to stress tests carried out in early 2016, if NPLs were to reach 20 percent of total loans,
some banks would no longer meet the capital adequacy ratio, especially banks with capital
originating in CEMAC countries. In the same vein, a further 25 percent decline in total deposits (e.g.,
through a 50 percent decline in government deposits plus a 20 percent decline in deposits from
non-financial enterprises) would bring most banks below the regulatory liquidity ratio. In the staff’s
view, this calls for enhanced monitoring of banks. Also, in line with earlier FSAP recommendations,
the COBAC (Commission Bancaire de l'Afrique Centrale) should be given the means to implement
the powers it received in April 2014 to deal with stressed banks, and the role of the BEAC as a lender
of last resort should be clarified.
26.
While recent BEAC decisions have boosted bank liquidity, the government’s needs for
additional domestic financing could crowd-out

27.
Financial inclusion in Chad has
improved but access to financial services
remains limited. The use of financial services by
households has improved along with the
geographic expansion of banks over the last
decade. Key measures such as the coverage of
ATMs and commercial banks’ branches have
increased remarkably. However, Chad still lags
behind its peers in CEMAC, LICs and Sub-Saharan
Africa (Text Fig.6). Low penetration of financial
services is prevalent across demographic groups
but particularly severe for women.

While micro-financial institutions (MFI) are growing, their impact on financial
inclusion remains limited. The number of beneficiaries served by MFIs has continued to increase,
along with the amount of outstanding savings, loans, and transfers. However, the share of MFIs in
the financial market is still limited (1.6 and 2.3 percent of total deposits and total loans by the
financial sector, respectively). Their weaknesses include poor management and the fact that they

17

CHAD

concentrate in regions where they compete with banks instead of covering areas without bank
network. Staff recommended that the regulatory/supervisory framework for the microfinance sector
be improved as COBAC’s resources permit.
Authorities’ views
The authorities agreed on the significant macro-financial implications of the fiscal policy responses
to the sharp fall in oil prices. They stressed the importance of plans to clear accumulated domestic
arrears as quickly as possible as well as the BEAC’s measures to inject liquidity into the banking
system. The latter reinforced their confidence in achieving ambitious targets for the placement of
securities. They noted the criticality of MFIs for economic development and stressed that the
microfinance sector was a priority in their national development plan, including through a dedicated
strategy.

C. Fostering Inclusive Economic Growth and Enhanced Effectiveness and
Transparency of Government Operations
29.
A challenging economic environment reinforces Chad’s need for more inclusive
growth. Poverty levels are high—particularly in rural areas—, the population is young (45 percent is
under 15 years) and expanding by 3 percent per year, and the government is the main source of
formal sector employment in urban areas. Chad needs to foster its private sector and job creation,
particularly for the young and women. The authorities’ development strategy is inspired by the overarching Vision 2030 which aims at bringing Chad’s development indicators to the level of emerging
markets. The strategy will be implemented through detailed 5-year plans. The new national
development plan for 2016-20 is expected to be finalized by September 2016, and will focus on
strategic axes: (i) diversification, with a focus on agriculture and cattle; (ii) human capital; (iii)
governance; and (iv) social protection.
30.
The external stability assessment shows that Chad faces both difficult price and
structural competitiveness challenges (Annex 2: External Sector Assessment). On price
competitiveness, results of two alternative estimation methods suggest that the real effective
exchange rate remains overvalued by 16-20 percent. On structural competitiveness, various business
environment and competitiveness indicators (e.g. Global Competitiveness and Doing Business
indicators) rank Chad among the worst performers in the world. Improving the business climate is
therefore a promising route to export diversification and to attracting foreign investment beyond
the oil sector. Given Chad’s fixed peg, bold structural reforms to tackle impediments to private
sector development are the principal means for strengthening the country’s competitiveness and
external position.
31.
The current economic downturn has created a consensus on the need to diversify the
economy and improve the business climate. It is believed that the agricultural sector has an
enormous growth potential. The government views the promotion of agribusinesses as a credible
strategy to shield the economy from the high dependence on oil. It is also keen in fostering small
and medium-sized companies through cost reduction and simplification of business procedures.
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

Those companies should join the formal sector to gain access to greater financial resources. The
government also intends to focus on judiciary reform over the next 5 years to improve the business
climate and its predictability. Private business associations are urging investment in sectors with
high value-added to create wealth and absorb labor.
Authorities’ views
The authorities acknowledge the need to further improve the business environment to help diversify
the economy, reduce the high dependence on oil, and promote more inclusive growth. They noted
that the new five-year plan 2016-2020 will include some initiatives proposed by the private sector to
improve the business climate and they intend to implement them in coordination with the private
sector.
32.
Fiscal structural reforms should continue to focus on spending control and efficiency
of spending.


Tighter and unpredictable resource envelopes make it even more critical to implement strict
budget execution procedures (including for emergency spending, DAOs) and to enhance cash
management (including through the preparation of monthly/quarterly Treasury plans).



The public investment management process needs to be strengthened substantially. Indeed,
while the impact of public investment plans financed by the 2003-14 oil windfall has been
significant—especially in terms of improvements in economic and social infrastructure, their
management framework is relatively weak.7 In particular, the expenditure chain (commitment,
validation, authorization, payment) needs to be streamlined as its current complexity
undermines budget execution controls from the ministry of finance and leads to a sub-optimal
allocation of resources. In addition, there is a need to align the allocations for goods and
services and transfers with the resources needed to ensure the proper operation and
maintenance of public investments.



Institutional reforms in debt management need to be consolidated to maintain debt
sustainability in the context of low oil prices.

33.
Enhanced transparency and integrity arrangements have the potential of improving oil
revenue collection and utilization. Chad’s oil sector has increased in complexity over the past
decade—with more producers, a new fiscal regime, a refinery, a state oil company, in kind revenue,
greater state participation, and oil collateralized debt.8 The management and regulatory challenges
to the government have increased commensurately. With very little government reporting on the oil
sector, more transparency will inform a broader public debate.9 Accurate oil revenue projections are
critical, as are proper audits of oil company tax declarations. Information from the companies
collected by the Ministry of Petroleum should flow freely to the Ministry of Finance and other

agencies. The much enhanced role of the state oil company (Société d’Hydrocarbures du TchadSHT)—marketing the government’s oil, purchasing and managing government oil assets, and
contracting debt guaranteed by the state—should be accompanied by accountability mechanisms,
with the production and publication of independently audited international standard financial
reports a first priority. Information on all oil revenues should be centralized in the Ministry of Budget
and Finance.
Authorities’ views
The authorities highlighted the recent adoption of a new regulatory framework to implement the
PFM law compliant with CEMAC directives, the adoption of a new public procurement code, the
publication of quarterly budget execution reports, and the establishment of an audit court (“Cour
des Comptes”) operational since January 2015. Debt management reports and medium-term
external borrowing plans should start to be produced this year. The authorities noted that improving
the flow of oil sector information within the administration was high on their agenda. They are
committed to invigorate the inter-ministerial structure created last year for consolidating and
reporting all oil revenue information and to put in place proper oversight procedures for SHT. The
authorities appreciated the EITI and indicated their intent to facilitate the compilation of the 2014
report during 2016. To enhance revenue collection, all oil companies plus the refinery were being
audited by an international audit firm.

OTHER ISSUES
34.
While some progress has been achieved in recent years, there is still scope to improve
the quality, coverage and timeless of statistics. Chad has been a participant in the IMF’s GDDS
since September 24, 2002, and the World Bank’s Statistical Capacity Indicator, ranks Chad as better
than the average of SSA countries.10 Statistics from all sectors (national accounts, Consumer Price
Index, government finance, monetary and balance of payments) are broadly adequate for
surveillance, though some shortcomings are identified (see details in the Informational Annex).
35.
In line with the authorities’ reform strategy, capacity development priorities will focus
on strengthening public financial management and statistical capacity. In public financial
management, priority areas will be the development of a comprehensive domestic arrears clearance
strategy and the strengthening of the public investment process. Support priorities in statistics will
continue to be in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments with the aim of facilitating
macroeconomic surveillance.
36.
Weak institutional capacity and high turnover of government officials and their
technical teams are obstacles for technical assistance absorption. While technical assistance

missions to improve the statistical capacity in various areas and fiscal management have intensified
in the recent past (see Informational Annex), staff stressed the importance of enhancing institutional
stability to maximize the impact of those activities.
37.
Staff noted progress in the implementation of the BEAC’s safeguards
recommendations. The implementation of safeguards recommendations is currently reviewed
annually and is a pre-condition for granting new IMF financial support to, and reviewing existing IMF
financial arrangements with CEMAC countries. The 2016 safeguards monitoring visit found that two
priority recommendations remain outstanding. However, in early May 2016, the BEAC Board
mandated the institution to initiate work on improving governance and transitioning to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is an important initial step toward successful completion
of safeguards reform. The authorities should maintain the momentum on the implementation of the
reforms to restore credibility on the BEAC’s ability to safeguard IMF financial resources.
Authorities’ views
The authorities appreciated the capacity development support from the Fund in various areas. In
terms of statistics, they noted recent progress in national accounts and balance of payments data
with help from AFRITAC Central, and the production of a new CPI with broader product and
geographical coverage. At the same time, they requested increased financial support to computerize
key government institutions (like the national statistical office) and processes. They expressed
interest in receiving assistance from the Fund’s Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource
Wealth given the country’s high dependence on oil exports. The authorities agreed that the high
turnover of civil service staff not only delays the production of consistent data but also weakens the
effectiveness of training and capacity development.

Chad continues to suffer from the consequences of the massive and persistent decline
in oil prices and the elevated regional security threats. Consequently, macroeconomic outcomes
have been weaker than envisaged, and acute liquidity problems have forced the government to
severely limit spending and domestic payments arrears have been accrued. In addition, risks are
tilted to the downside, reflecting internal and external vulnerabilities.
39.
Much fiscal adjustment has already been implemented but more efforts are needed.
While resource constraints are expected to gradually loosen over the medium-term, a sizable
permanent adjustment is needed now. The government is reformulating its 2016 budget, including
additional cuts in investment spending, while protecting poverty-reducing social spending as much
as possible. But uncertainty regarding the planned sale of a large oil asset highlights the need to
elaborate a contingency plan to guide budget execution in the event that receipts do not materialize
as envisaged. Even so, liquidity constraints are likely to remain severe and government spending
should be executed with the utmost caution, including by introducing cash-based commitment
controls to help reduce the risk of further accumulation of arrears, both domestic and external.

40.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to clear the large volume of accumulated
domestic arrears. It should be based on the findings of an independent audit to verify claims.
Repayments should be consistent with the availability of resources under realistic medium-term
fiscal projections.
41.
Further progress in fiscal reform, in particular PFM, is essential in ensuring budget
predictability, efficiency, and transparency. The authorities have made significant progress but
much remains to be done to implement strict budget execution procedures, including on
investment planning and execution, and to enhance cash management. Enhancing oil revenue
transparency, including the flow of information within the administration, is crucial for better budget
preparation and execution and for accountability.
42.
The banking sector is affected by the direct and indirect impacts of the deteriorating
fiscal situation, calling for close monitoring. The sharp fiscal adjustment and the government’s
growing financing are increasing bank vulnerabilities by changing the composition of assets and
liabilities. These vulnerabilities may subsequently negatively affect economic conditions in certain
economic sectors. A close monitoring of the banking system, in coordination with the regional
regulator, is warranted. In addition, the COBAC should be given the means to implement the powers
it received in April 2014 to deal with stressed banks, and the role of the BEAC as a lender of last
resort should be clarified.
43.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. There remains however scope to enhance the
quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets as well as in the compilation of
the international investment position that is not currently reported due to capacity constraints.
44.
The oil price shock has highlighted the importance of economic diversification to
economic resilience. The authorities are encouraged to rely on the priorities of the upcoming fiveyear plan 2016-2020, to improve the business environment and to strengthen financial inclusion, in
order to promote inclusive growth and economic diversification, and ultimately create the
conditions for exiting fragility.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
In 2014 an analysis of exchange rate and competitiveness suggested that the external position was
weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Since then, the current account
deficit has not improved, mainly as a result of lower oil exports. Foreign direct investment in the oil
sector remains a key source of external financing. Two model-based approaches indicate that the
current account balance is below the current account norm and the real effective exchange rate is
overvalued. Overall, Chad’s external position is projected to remain weak in 2016. Structural reforms to
improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment are necessary to strengthen the external
sector.

A. Balance of Payments and Exchange Rate Developments
1.
Chad has recorded large current account deficits since 2009. The external current
account deficit averaged 9 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2015, and is projected to remain at a
similar level in 2016. These deficits have been consistently larger than in the CEMAC as a whole,
although the regional current account balance has worsened at a fast pace in recent years (Figure
1a). The evolution of the current account in Chad was mainly driven by the goods and services
balance, which has deteriorated from -7 percent of GDP in 2011 to -17 percent of GDP in 2015,
partially as a result of the drop in oil exports (Figure 1b). The net income account also made a
negative contribution to the current account through payments on foreign investment in the oil
sector. Conversely, net current transfers positively contributed to the current account. In 2014, these
transfers include proceedings from a $400 million fine paid by China National Petroleum
Corporation for violations of environmental standards.

The continuous decline in exports in recent years is explained by the fall in oil sales. Oil
exports, which constitute the bulk of total exports, have reduced from 32 percent of GDP in 2011 to
19 of GDP in 2015, owing to a decline in oil production around 2012-2013 and the international oil
price slump since 2014 (Text Figure 2). The continued reduction in oil prices in 2016 explains the
projection of even lower oil exports for this year. Non-oil exports remain concentrated in a few
products (especially cotton and livestock) and their contribution to total exports was stable at 5
percent of GDP between 2009 and 2015. This evidence suggests that Chad is affected by the
economic dysfunction known as the “oil curse”.

3.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the oil sector has been an important source of
external financing. The current account deficits have been partially financed by FDI, which
concentrates in the oil sector and averaged 3 percent of GDP in the period 2009-2015 (Text Figure 3).
The large negative value of FDI in 2014 is associated with the debt-financed government’s purchase of
Chevron’s shares in Chad’s largest oil consortium. Although investment from oil companies is
envisaged to decline in 2016, FDI is expected to be above 5 percent of GDP in 2016 due to exceptional
receipts (estimated at CFAF 100 billion) from the government’s sale of a 10 percent equity stake in oil
sector fields. In recent years, capital transfers in the form of debt relief and investment grants also
helped to finance the current account deficit.

Despite some short-term volatility, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has
remained fairly stable over the last five years. Following a period of depreciation after the global
recession of 2008-09, the REER has fluctuated around a somewhat stable level since 2011 (Text
Figure 4). In this way, the notable depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) in 2014
did not translate into important gains in price competitiveness. This relative lack of adjustment in
the REER could be explained by structural competitiveness hurdles in the Chadian economy. The
movements in the NEER closely track the evolution of the nominal effective exchange rate of the
euro, to which Chad’s common currency is pegged. At the regional level, the observed appreciation
of the average REER reflects in part relatively high inflation in countries such as the Central African
Republic.

Reserve adequacy and debt sustainability indicators tend to confirm the perceived
weaknesses of Chad’s external position. Given the severe data limitations concerning Chad’s
balance of payments, it is important to evaluate additional information to assess the external
position.2 A recent analysis of reserve adequacy in the CEMAC (IMF Country Report No. 15/222, July
2015) concluded that although reserves were expected to decline in 2015, they remained broadly
adequate according to relevant metrics. In 2015 the level of pooled reserves imputed to Chad fell to
US$ 390 million, down from US$ 1.19 billion at end-2014. In the face of the persistent oil price
shock, a further decline of reserves in 2016 is a risk that could materialize. The debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) also suggests a weak external sector, as it concludes that Chad faces a high risk of
debt distress, based on an assessment of public external debt.
6.
On average, the current account deficit is expected to reduce to 7 percent in 20162021. The goods and services balance is expected to contribute to this result, by improving from a

deficit of almost 17 percent of GDP in 2016 to a deficit of 7 percent of GDP in 2021. The current
account deficit would be primarily financed by FDI.

B. Model-Based Real Exchange Rate Assessment
7.
Two standard approaches were used to assess the potential misalignment of the current
account and the REER. The Bems and Carvalho (2009) and the Araujo et al. (2013) methodologies rely
on the application of the permanent income hypothesis and are well suited to estimate current
account norms for resource-rich countries. The misalignment of the REER is then calculated by
comparing the projected medium-term current account with the model-based norms, and by
assuming a value for the elasticity of the current account with respect to the REER (Text Table 1).3 Both
methodologies assume that Chad’s oil reserves will be depleted in 25 years.

1/ The current account elasticity is based on the import and export elasticities reported in Tokarick (2010)
(-1.4 and 0.25, respectively) and staff’s projections for Chad’s import and export values in 2020.

8.
The Araujo et al. (2013) approach suggests a current account norm of 3.4 percent of
GDP in 2020, corresponding to a REER overvaluation of 16 percent. This model takes into
account external borrowing constraints as well as inefficiencies and absorptive capacity constraints
in investment, which are realistic features of developing countries. In simulating the model for Chad,
the values of the key parameters were the same as those reported in Araujo et al. (2013), who
calibrated the model parameters to the CEMAC region.
9.
The Bems and Carvalho’s (2009) constant real annuity approach suggests a current
account norm of 5.6 percent of GDP in 2020, corresponding to a REER overvaluation of
20 percent. The finding of a higher current account norm than in the Araujo et al. (2013) approach is
reasonable because the Bems and Carvalho (2009) model ignores the features of developing countries
mentioned in ¶ 8 above. In particular, by ignoring external borrowing constraints, the optimal response
to a natural resource windfall implies a larger current account surplus than otherwise.

3

The external stability assessment of CEMAC (IMF Country Report No. 15/222, July 2015) found that CEMAC’s REER
was broadly consistent with equilibrium under current policies, although model-based approaches indicated some
evidence of overvaluation.

C. Structural Competitiveness
11.
Several indicators show that Chad faces difficult structural competitiveness issues. In
recent years the authorities developed public investment plans in infrastructure and, with the help of
technical assistance, focused on improving public financial management. However, as illustrated
below, various business environment and competitiveness indicators rank Chad among the worst
performers in the world. The limited progress in improving the business climate represents a key
constraint to export diversification and to attracting foreign investment. Given Chad’s membership
in a currency union, bold structural reform measures are necessary to strengthening the country’s
competitiveness and external position.
12.
In the 2014-15 World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) report,
Chad ranks 143th of 144 countries. In comparison to sub-Saharan Africa, Chad remains well behind
in terms of institutions, that is, the legal and administrative framework within which individuals,
firms, and governments interact to generate wealth (Figure 5, top panel). Despite the gradual
improvement in its macroeconomic environment, the GCI report also shows that Chad significantly
lags the SSA average in implementing structural reforms in the goods, labor, and financial markets.
13.
In the Heritage Foundation’s 2015 Index of Economic Freedom ranking, Chad ranks
th
165 of 178 countries. With an overall score of 45.9, Chad is below the average of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU, 117th rank), the SSA (120th rank), and the CEMAC (154th
rank). Chad scores lower than the CEMAC average in four of the ten indicators of economic freedom
(Text Figure 5, middle panel), including ‘freedom from corruption’ and ‘business freedom’ (which
measures the efficiency of government regulation of business). Moreover, the poor performance in
‘trade freedom’ underscores the need for reducing the tariff- and non-tariff barriers to trade, which
are bound by regional CEMAC agreements, and simplifying customs procedures.
14.
In the World Bank’s Doing Business database, Chad scores lower than the SSA, the
WAEMU, and the CEMAC averages in all of the available indicators. The Doing Business
indicators show that Chad trails its peers in almost all dimensions, particularly in starting a business,
enforcing contracts, paying taxes, and getting electricity (Text Figure 5, bottom panel). 4 As it was
also emphasized in the 2013 Article IV report (IMF Country Report No. 14/100, February 2014), the
business climate and the coverage of basic infrastructure remain weak in Chad.

4

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

Safeguards Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Regional central banks are normally subject to a
safeguards assessment every four years. For the BEAC, governance challenges and control failures
that emerged in 2009 led to close engagement subsequently through annual IMF monitoring of
safeguards “rolling measures.” A safeguards staff visit to the BEAC conducted in April 2016 found
that although the BEAC’s own Reform and Modernization Plan was nearing completion, the Fund’s
two priority recommendations on governance-focused law reform and the transition to an
internationally recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) were outstanding. However,
following the April visit, the BEAC Board mandated that the institution take steps to initiate work on
the priority recommendations. Staff has now revised the road map for implementation with an
envisaged conclusion of the law reform in early 2017 and adoption of IFRS beginning with the
financial statements for 2018. Staff will maintain close engagement with the BEAC to monitor the
implementation of the remaining safeguards measures going forward, and progress on the latter
will remain a condition for new program requests and reviews for CEMAC member countries.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Chad maintains an exchange system that is free from restrictions and multiple currency practices on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The BEAC common currency is the
CFA franc which, since January 1, 1999, has been pegged to the euro at the rate of EUR 1 = CFAF
655.957.
Article IV Consultations
Chad is on a 24-month consultation cycle.

Technical Assistance
The Fund technical assistance strategy for Chad is focused on revenue administration, public
financial management (PFM), debt management, and the quality of macroeconomic data. As the
turnover of senior officials (responsible for economic management) is very high, posting long-term
experts in the field and providing training would enhance absorption capacity, notably in revenue
administration, PFM, and debt management.

JOINT WORLD BANK AND IMF WORK PROGRAM
The IMF and World Bank staff communicates and collaborates closely in their work on Chad.
Bank staff participates in IMF missions, while the Bank’s analysis and advice to the government in
key structural reform areas informs Fund surveillance. Bank and IMF staffs collaborated on assistance
related to FSAP update and financial sector deepening, and public financial management reform. In
2015, staffs of the IMF and World Bank jointly determined that Chad had made satisfactory progress
in meeting the requirements to reach the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The Boards of Directors of both institutions then decided to support a
US$1.1 billion in total debt relief for Chad.
The IMF and the World Bank Group are active members of the Financial and Technical
Partners Committee (Comité des Partenaires Techniques et Financiers CPTF), which includes all
United Nations’ agencies represented in Chad as well as the African Development Bank (AfDB), the
European Union, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and the ambassadors of
France, Germany, and the United States. This committee holds monthly meetings and has
established thematic groups that conduct studies on specific development issues relevant for Chad.
Members of the committee share information about upcoming missions and convene in order to
hold briefing sessions with visiting heads of the institutions it represents.
Exchange of information and collaboration:


World Bank requests to the Fund include periodic updates on the macroeconomic framework,
on the status of the current Fund supported economic program under the ECF, and on planned
technical assistance missions.



Fund requests include periodic updates on World Bank program in Chad.



Joint products include joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Assessments (DSA).



Other exchange of information is related to the authorities’ structural reform agenda, and to the
upcoming 2016-2020 National Development Plan. Under the new Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS) policy, the new National Development Plan should be issued to the Board along with an
assessment letter from the World Bank. A PRS implementation review (PIR) should be prepared
by Fund staff within the 4th review of the ECF.

AML/CFT FRAMEWORK
As a member of CEMAC, Chad is subject to the regional legal framework on AML/CFT and the
implementing regulations issued for banks by the Commission bancaire de l’Afrique centrale
(COBAC). The supervision of banks’ action to combat money laundering and the financing of
terrorism falls within the competence of the COBAC, assisted by the BEAC. As indicated in the April
2016 FSSA on the CEMAC, the AML/CFT framework needs to be rapidly strengthened both at the
national and regional levels. In that respect, the FSSA called for the allocation of appropriate
financial, technical and human resources to regional and national supervisors of the financial and
nonfinancial sectors, for gradual and effective implementation of AML/CFT risk-based supervision.
The FSSA identified as a key recommended action the need to better implement and enforce the
existing AML/CFT regulations. In 2014, the Groupe d’Action Contre le Blanchiment d’Argent en
Afrique Centrale (GABAC) has assessed Chad’s AML/CFT framework against the 2003 Standard set
by the Financial Action Task Force. A number of strategic deficiencies were identified and an action
plan to address the gaps was laid out.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has capacity-related shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There is
scope for improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets. The authorities
continued to dedicate resource to improve the macroeconomic database, particularly the national accounts.
The 2007 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) found that the statistical system was weak
and suffers from a shortage of both financial and human resources.
National accounts: The authorities are reviing national accounts estimates, moving from the 1968 System of
National Accounts (SNA) to the 1993 SNA and rebasing the data to 2005 as the base year. Final Annual
National Accounts are available until 2013. The new series should be disseminated by mid-2017. However,
compilation remains weak owing to inadequate funding for the Institut National de la Statistique, des Etudes
Economiques et Démographiques (INSEED) and high staff turnover. In addition, dissemination of data and
metadata to the public could be improved by more timely releases, provision of more detailed information, and
enhanced dissemination through the internet.
Price statistics: The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) is of rather good quality. However, it covers only
the capital city and is sometimes released with some delays. The regional authorities are working underway to
improve the quality of the HCPI in each of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)
countries.
Government finance statistics: Data weaknesses create uncertainty about the central government’s actual fiscal
position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Staff is compelled to prepare estimates of central government
financial operations from disparate administrative sources that may or may not fully reconcile with domestic bank
financing or changes in net indebtedness.
Monetary statistics: The Banque des Etats de L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) reports monetary and financial statistics
for the central bank and other depository corporations on a monthly basis using the standardized report forms
(SRFs). A key shortcoming of monetary and financial statistics is the lack of clear reconciliation between the
domestic banking sector’s net credit to the government and the implicit financing in the weak government
financial accounts. Meanwhile, the data for interest rates offered by financial institutions to non-financial entities
on deposits and loans is not available. In addition, the depository corporations’ survey omits the large number
of microfinance operations in the country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

Balance of payments: Weaknesses in Chad’s balance of payments data create uncertainty about its actual
external position, creating challenges for the debt sustainability analysis. Customs-based data are unreliable
and suffer from coverage problems, to the extent that they are not relied upon for balance of payments or
national income estimation. BEAC prepares balance of payments data and submit to BEAC headquarters for
validation with the long time lag. Staff must estimate current and capital flows from disparate administrative
sources, to supplement the official balance of payments. Using recently updated figures from BEAC, staff
revised some BOP historical data but there was neither a change in methodology nor a significant revision of
previous values. The IMF Statistics Department has recommended tighter coordination among the CEMAC,
INSEED, and other agencies in order to improve data coverage. BEAC headquarters is coordinating technical
reforms to improve data quality and timeliness.
II. Data Standards and Quality
A Data ROSC was published in August 2007.
Chad participates in the IMF’s Enhanced General

Data Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS).
Metadata and plans for improvement are posted on
the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB) and were last updated in July 2002
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Only international liquidity, monetary statistics, GDP, and prices are currently reported to STA for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Chad has not yet been able to resume reporting of detailed data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal data through 2001 have been reported
and are included in the IFS database. The BEAC has yet to submit test monetary and financial statistics using
the standardized report forms. Chad has yet to submit BOP and IIP data to STA.

CHAD
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 7, 2016

Approved By
David Robinson and
Catherine Pattillo (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association.

The debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) shows that Chad remains at high risk of debt
distress, based on an assessment of public external debt, reflecting vulnerabilities that
concentrate in the short term. The assessment of high risk is reinforced by vulnerabilities
related to domestic debt and by the recent accumulation of a small amount of external
arrears to multilateral creditors. A number of debt indicators exhibit temporary and small
breaches of their indicative thresholds, while the external debt service-to-revenue ratio
exhibits a relatively protracted and moderate breach. These breaches reflect low
government oil revenue and high debt service payments on external debt falling due in the
short term. Although the debt indicators remain well below their indicative thresholds in
the medium to long run, the DSA confirms that Chad is susceptible to external
macroeconomic shocks such as the ongoing oil price shock. Preserving solvency in the
current environment requires a deep fiscal adjustment supported by prudent debt
management policies and advancing structural reforms that lead to economic
diversification and sustained growth.1

1

Chad’s average CPIA over 2012-14 is estimated at 2.6. This corresponds to a weak policy performance under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC-DSA).

CHAD

BACKGROUND
Public External Debt
1.
Chad’s external public debt hovered around 20 percent of GDP over the decade after the
start of oil production in 2003. Debt owed to multilateral institutions and traditional bilateral donors
has been basically constant in nominal terms over the last few years. Chad has instead relied more on
non-traditional creditors (e.g., China, Libya) and commercial credits to address its financing needs,
including to tackle its infrastructure deficit. There is no recorded external private debt in Chad.
2.
The external public debt-to-GDP ratio increased in 2013-14 following two nonconcessional oil sales’ advance operations with Glencore Energy. In 2013, the authorities signed
two agreements for a total of US$ 600 million with Glencore Energy, in the form of oil sales’
advances to cover budget shortfalls as revenues collapsed as oil volumes fell sharply. In 2014, a new
commercial borrowing operation for US$ 1.4 billion was contracted by SHT (a state-owned oil
company) to finance the purchase of Chevron’s shares in Chad’s largest oil consortium in June of
that year. After these operations, the external public debt-to-GDP ratio rose above 27 percent of
GDP in 2014.
3.
As of end-2014, nearly half of Chad’s debt was commercial debt (Text Table 1). In
addition, around 40 percent was owed to multilateral creditors, and less than 20 percent to bilateral
creditors (the bulk of which was owed to non-Paris Club creditors).
4.
In late 2015, a rescheduling agreement with Glencore consolidated the two oil sales’
advance operations, extending their maturities. The agreement consolidated the remaining
balance of the two loans and extended its maturity from 4 to 6-7 years. The rescheduling agreement
implied an increase in the original debt’s net present value, but improved Chad’s debt service profile
over the medium term by better matching debt service to the anticipated path of oil receipts.
5.
Following the achievement of the HIPC completion point in April 2015, Chad was able
to secure at least US$756 million in debt relief. This amount includes MDRI relief from
International Development Association (IDA) and African Development Bank (AfDB), forgiveness
from the IMF, and a hundred percent cancellation from the Paris Club. Regarding non-Paris Club
members, the authorities have signed a new agreement with the Saudi authorities which reschedules
their remaining amount on IDA comparable terms.

1/ Commercial debt includes debt signed with CNPC and Glencore.
Source: World Bank, Chadian authorities, selected creditors, and staff estimates. The concept of debt used here includes both contracted and
guaranteed debt. Figures are based on historical data as of end-2014. The official external debt stock data underestimate the actual level of
external debt. For example, some project loan disbursements are recognized only after a lag. This table has discrepancies with corresponding
fiscal or balance of payments flow estimates, giving rise to residuals in the sustainability analysis.

Public Domestic Debt
6.
The stock of public domestic debt has increased in recent years, reaching 9 percent of
GDP at end-2014 (Text Table 2). This growth is the result of drawing down the statutory advances
provided by BEAC (the regional central bank), the sale of five-year savings bonds (CFAF 108 billion in
2011, and CFAF 90 billion in 2013), a CFAF 50 billion loan from Republic of Congo (in 2012), a CFAF
15 billion loan from Equatorial Guinea (in 2013), and the use of commercial bank loans (which
increased from CFAF 9 billion in 2013 to CFAF 127 billion in 2014). The stock of public domestic debt
includes a balance of CFAF 52 billion in treasury arrears at end-December 2014. Additionally, shortterm domestic obligations include the issuance of 3-month Treasury bills before the end of 2014
(CFAF 27.5 billion, at a weighted average annual interest rate of 2.8 percent).
7.
The stock of domestic debt rose to 16 percent of GDP in 2015; in part a result of the
authorities stepping up their domestic debt issuance program in the CEMAC market. Chad
issued its first ever Treasury bills in the last quarter of 2014. Treasury bills have been regularly issued
throughout 2015, with a gradual extension of maturities (up to one year) and interest rates below
3.4 percent. During 2015, the Treasury issued CFAF 156 billion (gross) in Treasury bills. The issuance
of Treasury bonds amounted to CFAF 139 billion between July and December 2015, with maturities

of two, three and five years, and an effective interest rate on average of 4.3 percent.2 Some of these
Treasury bonds were used in swap operations involving the exchange of commercial bank loans,
which explains the reduction in the stock of those loans from CFAF 127 billion in 2014 to CFAF 56
billion in 2015.

Domestic financing in 2015 included additional advances from BEAC. The 2015
statutory and extraordinary advances (CFAF 92.6 billion and CFAF 140 billion, respectively) have a
maturity of 10 years, a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate equivalent to BEAC’s rediscount
rate.
9.
As of end-2015, the government accrued a sizable amount of domestic payment
arrears. The balance of treasury arrears increased from CFAF 52 billion at end-December 2014 to
around CFAF 200 billion (3.1 percent of GDP) in 2015.

DSA ASSUMPTIONS
10.
The DSA incorporates an updated debt database. The historical information on external
debt has been updated, as of December 2014, according to the latest World Bank-DRS database.
Preliminary estimates on external debt are used for 2015.
11.
The assumptions underpinning the DSA reflect the persistent oil price shock and
security challenges, and the analysis is conducted under a baseline (current policies) scenario.
The financing gap in 2015 was covered through central bank advances, spending cuts, increased net
domestic financing, and Fund disbursements under the ECF arrangement. The projected financing
gap in 2016 is assumed to be financed through a combination of further fiscal adjustment and the
mobilization of additional domestic financing and external concessional loans. As in the previous
DSA update, the analysis incorporates the rescheduling consolidating the various non-concessional
oil sales’ advance operations, and exceptional receipts from divestments in the oil sector.
12.
Oil production and revenue: Chad’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook is
characterized by a small decline in oil production in 2016-17 followed by gradual increases when
new fields come on line, but a steady decline of oil production over the longer term.3 The baseline
projection for oil production in 2016 is fairly conservative, as prospects could somewhat improve in
the context of the recent recovery in oil prices.

Oil production is expected to rise from 144,000 bpd in 2015 to about 173,000 bpd in
2018-19. This oil production boom will likely be temporary; proven reserves in the new fields
are much smaller than that in the original Doba basin and will also likely be nearly exhausted
around 2030. Hence, oil production and exports are projected to decline steadily to
negligible levels beyond 2030. Obviously, these prospects might change with new oil
exploration activities or with the development of new oil extraction techniques.



Chad’s oil trades below the WEO reference price, reflecting a quality discount and transport
cost of US$ 6-9 per barrel. For the medium term (five-year horizon) the price of Chadian oil
is assumed to increase from US$ 34 per barrel (all discounts included) in 2016 to US$ 53 per
barrel in 2020, in line with the trend projected in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO).
From 2021 onward, the price is assumed to increase, on average, by around 3 percent per
year in U.S. dollar terms (Box 1).



At the time of the Second Review under the ECF arrangement in December 2015, staffs
worked with a Chadian oil price assumption of US$ 47 per barrel for 2016.

3

Oil production at the Doba oilfield (exploited by the Esso-led consortium) started in 2003, reached its peak of
63 million barrels in 2005 and, absent other oil developments, will decline with annual output projected to become
negligible beyond 2030. In 2011, oil production began at a second oil field, Bongor, operated by CNPC
(about one-third the size of the Doba field). Exports of crude oil from Bongor started in 2014. Oil from another
smaller operator (Caracal, formerly Griffiths) started to be produced in late 2013.

Fiscal policy: The analysis assumes a sustained fiscal adjustment throughout the entire
projection in response to the current adverse macroeconomic conditions and in transition to the
post-oil era, with the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) reduced to about 6 percent of non-oil GDP by
2020. The gradual recovery in oil prices is expected to help oil revenues increase from 3 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2016 to 7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2020. Over the longer term, it is assumed that
dwindling oil revenues will be partly offset by a stabilization of total government primary spending
at around 21 percent of GDP, while the primary balance will be adjusted gradually to reach a small
deficit of less than 3 percent of non-oil GDP by 2036. The latter is projected to be achieved mainly
by: (i) gradually increasing non-oil revenues (from about 9 percent of non-oil GDP at present to
about 18 percent of non-oil GDP by 2036);4 (ii) maintaining total investment outlays around 10
percent of non-oil GDP in the long term; and (iii) cutting recurrent spending, notably, by
streamlining transfers and subsidies to public enterprises (at present, jointly accounting for about 5
percent of non-oil GDP). The analysis also assumes a strategy for clearing domestic arrears and
avoiding further accumulation going forward.

4

This assumes that Chad improves its tax effort in line with the CEMAC average. A recent FAD mission estimated a
non-oil tax revenue gap above 5 percent of non-oil GDP, while the 2013 Article IV staff report estimated even a
larger gap.

Box 1. Chad: Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2016–2036
Real GDP growth is driven by a sharp slowdown of non-oil production in the short term and a secular decline in oil production
since 2019, with upside risk over the long run given oil exploration activities. Non-oil GDP growth is projected at 4 percent per
year over the medium to long term, driven by agriculture, commerce, and transportation.
Inflation is assumed to stabilize at 3 percent, consistent with the CEMAC convergence criterion. The disruptions to cross–border
trade flows with Cameroon and Nigeria might continue to lead to increased volatility on domestic prices in the short run.
As mentioned above, the fiscal outlook features a modest increase in oil revenues in the medium term but a decline in the long
term. The NOPD is projected at 6 percent of non-oil GDP in 2020. The medium-term outlook for non-oil revenue is relatively low
as a result of the regional security shock and a slowdown in demand from Nigeria, but a recovery is assumed in the long run. The
long-run fiscal adjustment would maintain an appropriate level of investment and social spending to ensure steady growth and
poverty reduction.
The evolution of the external current account deficit will be largely driven by oil price path. The current account deficit is
projected to fall from 9 percent of GDP in 2016 to 6 percent of GDP in 2020, thanks to an increase in oil export values. After 2020,
barring new oil discoveries, the external current account is projected to remain in deficit due to lower crude oil exports, stabilizing
at around 4 percent of GDP beyond 2030. Non-oil sector imports are assumed to evolve in line with non-oil GDP over the
projection horizon, while oil sector imports would decrease over the medium to long term as foreign direct investment declines
too.
Although investments from oil companies are envisaged to decline in the short run, foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected
to be above 5 percent of GDP in 2016 due to exceptional receipts (estimated at CFAF 100 billion) linked to divestments in the oil
sector. FDI is assumed to stabilize in 2017-20 at around 4 percent of GDP before it declines to an average of 2 percent of GDP in
2021-35 in line with the assumption of maturing oil fields and amortized investments.
External financing: The analysis incorporates the rescheduling agreement with Glencore that consolidates the remaining balance
of the loans and extended its maturity from 4 to 6-7 years. Under the ECF-supported program, external financing is assumed to
be on concessional terms over the medium to long term.
Domestic financing: Domestic financing assumptions consider a continued placement of domestic debt instruments and exclude
further utilization of BEAC advances.

EXTERNAL DSA
14.
The evolution of external debt is driven by the government’s borrowing strategy
which envisages a reasonable volume of project and budget support loans from both
traditional and non-traditional sources and no further usage of commercial loans. Under
Chad’s supported ECF program, external financing is assumed to be on concessional terms over the
medium to long term mostly financed by disbursements from multilaterals (47 percent) such as the
IMF, WB, AfDB, Islamic Development Bank, and the European Union and other non-traditional
partners (48 percent) such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. This leads to a grant element of an average of
37.3 percent over the projection period (Figure 1a).
15.
Under the baseline scenario, two of the external debt indicators are above their critical
thresholds, indicating a high risk of debt distress (Table 1, Figure 1).5 The debt-service-to exports
ratio shows a temporary and small breach of its indicative threshold. The debt service-to-revenue
ratio exhibits a more protracted and moderate breach in the 2016-2018 period. These breaches
reflect the substantial reduction in government oil revenue and the spike in debt service payments
falling due in the next few years for the non-concessional loan contracted with Glencore.
Conditional to the assumptions of the baseline scenario (including a sustained fiscal adjustment), the
external debt indicators remain well below their indicative thresholds in the medium to long run.6

Stress tests
16.
Under alternative scenarios, Chad’s external debt risk outlook remains high.7 In
particular, bounds tests highlight the susceptibility of external debt to shocks, especially in the short
term (Table 2, Figure 1). If main economic variables remain at their historical averages, all debt
indicators but two remain below their indicative thresholds. Under the historical scenario, a breach
of the debt service-to-revenue ratio occurs in 2016-20. Bounds tests reveal that Chad is most
vulnerable to an adverse shock to exports and a scenario that combines different types of
macroeconomic shocks. A one-time depreciation shock (30 percent nominal depreciation in 2017)
also generates vulnerability in some external debt indicators. These shocks have the potential to
5

Arrears vis-à-vis the WB and the AfDB, were incurred during the first half of 2016, respectively at €869,000 and
€80,000. These were cleared in early July.
6

The residuals in Table 1 are associated with the government’s purchase of shares in the country’s largest oil
consortium in 2014, which was financed with a foreign commercial loan (around CFA 690 billion); the significant debt
relief in 2015; and a substantial loss in international reserves in 2015 and 2016. The existence of historical and
projected residuals can also be explained by shortcomings in quality affecting the balance of payments’ data.
7

A comparison of the current bounds tests with those in the previous DSA reveals a better long-term performance of some

external debt indicators. This is, however, due to technical reasons: the last DSA calibrated shocks during the 10-year period
beginning in 2003 as Chad’s oil production was just beginning, and therefore gave an unusually high estimated standard
deviation for exports.

raise all debt indicators above their indicative thresholds, especially over the short term. The PV of
debt-to-exports ratio is particularly sensitive to a poor export performance, showing a moderate and
protracted breach under this stress test.

PUBLIC DSA
17.
The assessment of Chad’s overall risk of debt sustainability does not substantially
change when domestic debt is included in the analysis (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). The public debt
indicators are mostly driven by the external debt component. But as a result of the accumulation of
domestic arrears and the increased issuances of debt securities in the regional market, the PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio shows a breach in 2016 under the baseline scenario. The domestic debt
component would fall from 21 percent of GDP in 2016 to 13 percent of GDP in 2020 and will
continue a steady decline until it reaches about 8 percent of GDP in 2036. Altogether, the public
debt stock decreases from 45 percent of GDP in 2016 to 26 percent of GDP in 2020 until it stabilizes
around an average of 18 percent of GDP in 2022-36.8
18.
Standard stress tests indicate sustainability risks in the short run. In particular, a real
depreciation shock in 2016 could impair public debt sustainability in the period 2016-18 (Most
Extreme Shock in Figure 2 and Bound Tests in Table 4).

CONCLUSION
19.
Chad remains at high risk of debt distress, based on an assessment of public external
debt, with vulnerabilities concentrated in the short term. The inclusion of Chad’s domestic
debt in the analysis reinforces the conclusions of the external DSA. On account of the persistent
decline in oil prices, the baseline scenario shows breaches of some indicators at the beginning of the
projection period, while over the long term all indicators are markedly below their thresholds.
Preserving debt solvency, however, is conditional on the substantial fiscal adjustment assumed
under the baseline projection. In the event of a sustained rebound in the oil price and with
improvements in the policy environment, the assessment of the debt sustainability could improve to
moderate risk, as suggested under alternative scenarios. Furthermore, arrears on debt to the WB and
the AfDB that have been recently accumulated have been resolved shortly. In the presence of the
exhaustibility and volatility of oil revenues, it is necessary to strengthen fiscal and debt management,
maintain a prudent external and domestic borrowing policy, and make further progress in
diversifying the economy. The effective functioning of the recently revamped inter-ministerial debt
coordination units will be important for strengthening the capacity to record and monitor public
debt. In addition, the government will start issuing annual debt management reports since 2016
(with support from two Fund TA missions), and will undertake institutional improvements in the
management of spending arrears in line with Fund TA recommendations.
20.
The assumptions and conclusions of the DSA were discussed with the authorities, who
broadly concurred with the staff assessment. The authorities acknowledged potential concerns

on debt sustainability and highlighted the Glencore loans as a key factor behind the external risk
rating. They raised questions about the criteria behind the CPIA score, and expect that progress with
ongoing reforms will result in an improvement of this score and a related increase in external debt
burden thresholds. They also acknowledged the importance of technical assistance in their current
efforts to improve debt management. As for diversifying the economy, they discussed the
government’s focus on agro-pastoral activities and agreed with the need to improve the business
climate for the private sector.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief), changes in gross foreign assets, and valuation adjustments. Projections also include contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline. Grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for Chad
July 22, 2016
On behalf of my Chadian authorities, I would like to thank Management and Staff for the
continuous support provided to Chad in the face of an adverse environment brought about
by the large decline in oil price, and the security and humanitarian shocks. The support of
management was in evidence by the visit of Mr. Furusawa to Chad in February 2016, and
for which my authorities are very appreciative. This visit enabled the Deputy Managing
Director to appreciate directly the economic and social impact of the exogenous shocks in
Chad as well as the efforts of my authorities to address them. My authorities are also
thankful to bilateral partners and multilateral institutions for their financial and technical
assistance.
Indeed, the massive oil price decline since 2014, and the deterioration of the security
situation in the second half of 2015 further complicated an already difficult economic and
financial situation. The country has also seen an inflow of refugees from neighboring
countries due to the security situation, as Chad is seen as an island of stability in an
unstable region. Public finances have therefore been under extreme pressure which
increased the vulnerabilities of private and financial sectors. The authorities’ policy
responses to the worsening environment have been mainly through large additional fiscal
adjustment, absent the full realization of financial support pledges by the international
community. Nevertheless, despite these unfavorable developments, the authorities’ Fundsupported program remained on track in 2015. Maintaining this performance in 2016,
however, has proven particularly challenging.
The period ahead will be critical for Chad, as the absence of sufficient financial resources
might force my authorities to resort to second-best financing options to finance the
budget at the risk of jeopardizing debt sustainability and derailing the Fund-supported
program. Therefore, my authorities are asking the international community to follow
through on the financial support pledges as soon as possible.
I. Recent Developments
Economic activity slowed down significantly in 2015, due to a number of factors. These
include the oil price shock, lower agricultural production due to bad weather conditions
and contraction of other sectors, notably the construction sector, as a result of drastic
reduction in public demand, the difficult economic situation in Nigeria and the weakened
security situation. As a result, non-oil real growth turned negative at -2.9 percent.
Nevertheless, total real growth remained positive at 1.9 percent in 2015 against
6.9 percent in 2014, as new oil fields came on stream.

2
Inflationary pressures emerged in 2015 due to supply shocks. Lower agricultural
production and the security disruptions to the cross-border trade flows with Cameroon
and Nigeria led to a surge in food prices and inflation reached 7.6 percent year-on-year in
April 2015 before turning negative to -0.3 percent at end-December 2015. The
disinflation continued in 2016 as consumer price index declined by 3.7 percent in March
2016.
The fiscal situation deteriorated significantly as economic activity slowed down. As
indicated during the last meeting on Chad in December 2015, the 2015 budget was
revised to take into account the changing economic conditions. However, despite this
revision, only 60 percent of the projected total fiscal revenue has been realized owing to
the lower than expected oil price toward the end of the year and to continued disruption
of trade flows at the border with Nigeria and Cameroon. The authorities responded to the
situation with a combination of lower public spending and additional borrowing. Capital
spending, for example, has been reduced by more than 40 percent between 2014 and
2015 and no new projects has been started. However, social spending was preserved.
There was also an accumulation of domestic arrears due to Treasury difficulties arising
from the lower revenues. As a result, the fiscal deficit remained in line with the objective
under the ECF-supported program. The deficit was financed through exceptional
financing from the central bank in the form of higher ceiling for statutory advances,
support from some external partners and placement of Treasury bills and bonds in the
regional market.
As the DSA indicates, public debt ratios have increased with respect to GDP, revenues
and exports figures, thereby further raising debt vulnerabilities in the short to mediumterm.
Monetary sector developments have been characterized by a contraction in broad money
and a deceleration of credit to the economy together with a significant drawdown in
government deposits at the central bank. As already discussed in the Board meeting on
the regional consultations with CEMAC, the regional monetary policy has been
accommodative since late 2015 with the relaxation of the ceiling for statutory advances,
and the halving of the required reserves at the central bank. In addition, the ceiling for
refinancing at the central bank for the Chadian banks has been raised by 50 percent. This
monetary easing has enabled the provision of needed liquidity to the government and the
banking system.
Liquidity pressures in the public sector have increased vulnerabilities in the financial
sector, as the recent accumulation of arrears in the second part of 2015 and in 2016, in a
context of slow economic activity, translated in higher NPLs, thereby reflecting the

3
strong macro-financial linkages in Chad, as well described in the first chapter of the
Selected Issues Paper. Although the financial sector is overall healthy, the recent stress
tests conducted by the regional banking commission indicate increasing risks to financial
stability stemming from a bleaker economic outlook.
Progress has been made in the implementation of reforms since January 2015, notably in
the context of the Fund-supported program. Particularly noteworthy are the adoption of a
new regulatory framework to implement the PFM law compliant with CEMAC
directives, the adoption of a new procurement code, the publication of quarterly budget
execution reports, and the establishment of an audit court.
II. Policies for 2016 and beyond
Near-term economic prospects are bleak as economic activity is expected to contract
further by 1.1 percent in 2016, essentially due to a decline in oil production as many
planned investments in the oil sector have been shelved. Non-oil GDP growth will also
remain negative. However, over the medium-term growth outlook is brighter as a
gradual recovery in the non-oil sector is projected, driven by agriculture, commerce and
transportation, together with an easing of budgetary pressures with a rebound in oil
revenues. It is indeed assumed that investment in the oil sector would resume as oil prices
recover, and both developments would positively impact Chad’s external position. The
medium-term outlook is subject to significant downside risks, including a potential
deterioration of regional security, a persistent low level of oil prices and delays in the
resumption of petroleum investment.
In that difficult context, my authorities remain committed to pursue the adjustment to the
new oil price environment. To this end, they will pursue fiscal adjustment efforts to
preserve fiscal and debt sustainability, while addressing the emerging vulnerabilities in
the financial sector and advancing the structural reforms needed to diversify the economy
and improve the business environment, consistent with the national development plan for
2016-2020 which is being finalized. The five-year plan will focus on strategic axes
including economic diversification with an emphasis on agriculture and cattle, human
capital, governance, and social protection.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal adjustment will continue in 2016, as reflected in the recently adopted revised
budget for 2016, which is based on very prudent assumptions and includes pre-defined
spending prioritization criteria. The revised budget envisages a further reduction in public
expenditures but will preserve social spending. A contingency plan has been prepared in
case the envisaged receipts from oil assets sale in the budget do not materialize in 2016.

4
The Chadian authorities will pursue actively the discussions with potential buyers,
including through an international tender if the ongoing discussions are unsuccessful. The
repayment of domestic arrears will be consistent with resource availability. The
authorities will also tap the regional market to finance budget. They are optimistic that
their domestic financing could be realized, considering the relatively low volume of debt
maturing in 2016 and the comfortable level of liquidity in the region’s banks following
the recent reduction in reserve requirements by the BEAC. A quarterly cash flow has
been prepared to calibrate spending and domestic financing in line with available
liquidity. Over the medium-term, my authorities will intensify domestic revenue
mobilization with reforms drawn from the recent technical assistance recommendations.
My authorities intend to press ahead with the fiscal reforms initiated over the past year. In
particular, they will continue to improve the flow of oil sector information within the
administration through a revitalization of the inter-ministerial committee established in
that regard. They will also pursue the publication of reports on oil revenues in the context
of the EITI. They will start producing debt management reports and medium-term
borrowing plans during this year.
Financial Sector
My authorities are determined to preserve financial stability and pursue the development
of the financial sector. They recognize the central place of the government in the
economy and the significant macro-financial implications of the successive fiscal policy
responses to the oil price changes as well as the increasing risks to financial stability
stemming from a bleaker economic outlook, as evidenced by the recent stressed tests
conducted by the regional banking commission. Going forward, the Chadian authorities,
in coordination with the regional banking commission, will monitor banks closely.
Recognizing the importance of microfinance in increasing financial access and support
individual empowerment, the national development plan for 2016–2020 gives a particular
importance to the development of the microfinance sector through a dedicated strategy.
Fostering inclusive growth
My authorities will pursue reforms to improve the business climate to foster economic
diversification and promote a more inclusive growth. Specifically, policies will focus on
removing impediments to private sector development in order to increase the
competitiveness and attractiveness of the country, in coordination with the private sector
which has already identified possible actions in that regard. As already indicated, a
special emphasis will be placed on the agriculture sector which my authorities believe
presents enormous potential for the development of agribusinesses. In the same vein, the
government will proceed with the reform of the judicial system over the next five years.

5
External Assistance
Chad is going through a very difficult period brought about by the massive oil price
decline and security shocks. Policy responses to these shocks have been exceptional with
notably a strong fiscal adjustment. Going forward, given the significant downside risks to
an already bleak economic outlook and the need to pursue efforts to preserve security in
the region, there remains very limited space for additional fiscal adjustment. The country
is in desperate need of external support from all its partners to meet the additional
obligations at a time of declining revenue. In this regard the Fund’s enhanced support
will be crucial, given its catalytic role. The country also needs support in its efforts to
strengthen stability in the region, which in their view is a top priority. Regional security
is a public good that Chad cannot afford bearing alone. The authorities strongly believe
that Chad deserves more assistance than it has received so far. Absent this assistance, the
country will certainly not have the means to continue its efforts to fight terrorism and
keep its economic and financial program on track. In this regard, the authorities expect
further external assistance, including an increase in access to Fund resources as well as
more flexibility as regards program design.
