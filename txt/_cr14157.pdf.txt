STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Background. Panama’s economic performance remains buoyant. Real GDP growth slowed
to 8.4 percent in 2013, after the strong expansion in 2011–12, and is projected at above
7 percent in 2014. Inflation is declining, though it is resilient and still higher than in major
trading partners, and unemployment is at historically low levels. The 2013 fiscal deficit was
within the revised Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) ceiling despite strong public
investment. The current account deficit remains elevated, reflecting high investment, but is
financed mainly by FDI. The banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid.
Outlook and Risks. Near-term risks arise mainly from shifts in global trade and financial
conditions (such as the normalization of global monetary conditions or a protracted
economic slowdown in trading partners), domestic overheating pressures, persistent
economic and political difficulties in Venezuela, and the risk of further significant delays in
the Canal expansion. Strong domestic fundamentals and the ability to implement
countercyclical fiscal policies would, however, mitigate the impact of external shocks.
Fiscal and Financial Policies. Targeting a fiscal balance below the SFRL ceilings would help
contain overheating pressures and build policy buffers against possible adverse shocks. It is
imperative to strengthen the financial safety net and to enhance financial supervision and
integrity in line with the recommendations of the 2011 FSAP and the 2014 IMF’s Detailed
Assessment Report on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism.
Medium-term Challenges. Structural, social, and institutional reforms should continue to
boost productivity, competitiveness, and inclusiveness. This will be essential to ensure a
smooth transition towards strong and sustainable medium-term growth when large public
investment projects are completed. In particular, further investment in the quality of
education, training, and health, as well as promoting female labor force participation, should
complement capital accumulation, raise labor productivity, and improve living standards.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Panama’s economic growth remains buoyant. Growth averaged about 8.5 percent over
the past decade, the highest in Latin America. In 2011–12, real GDP grew at around 11 percent,
driven by strong private demand, the implementation of an ambitious public investment program,
and the Canal expansion project (see
Chart 1. Panama: Colon-Free Zone

continued policy reforms, broadly in line

2.
GDP figures are being revised upward.2 In March 2014 the authorities started releasing
preliminary figures for revised national accounts statistics for the period since 2007, which however
are as yet incomplete. The upward revision to nominal GDP is between 5 and 8 percent, depending
on the year. Unless otherwise noted,

Inflation is moderating, in
part due to the deceleration of food
and fuel prices, but remains higher
than in trading partners (see Chart 2).
Average headline inflation declined to

the 2012 average of 5.7 percent, while
core inflation decreased only from

PANAMA

5.1 percent to 3.5 percent over the same horizon. The contribution to inflation from components
other than those associated with food or transport has become quite resilient, and there are risks
that persistent inflationary pressures may feed into wage dynamics. Public and private wage inflation
increased to 11.6 and 9.3 percent in 2012, from 4.5 and 4 percent respectively in 2011. In
December 2013, the authorities announced an increase in the minimum wage (previously set
in December 2011) by 13 to 27 percent depending on the type of job.3 In February 2014, the
government announced a wage increase of up to 50 percent for school teachers, who comprise
about 3 percent of the labor force.
4.
The 2013 fiscal deficit was 3 percent of GDP (or 2.9 percent when using the new GDP
statistics), within the revised ceiling allowed under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law
(SFRL) (see Figure 2).4 The large increase from the 2012 deficit to GDP ratio (1.5 percent) was due to
a strong public investment program: revenue excluding grants of the Non-Financial Public Sector
increased by 9.9 percent, while current and capital expenditures grew by 9.6 percent and
30.2 percent respectively.5 The contribution from the Canal Authority declined slightly, mainly owing
to a slowdown in transit. In cyclically adjusted terms, the 2013 primary balance as a percent of GDP
is estimated to have deteriorated by 1 percentage point.
5.
Public debt is on a declining path. The ratio of public debt to GDP (including external
debt contracted for the Canal expansion) fell from about 66 percent in 2005 to about 41 percent
in 2013 (see Figure 2, Table 8, and Annex II). Sovereign spreads have been in line with other main
emerging markets in Latin America, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru over the past
few years (see Figure 3). On April 22, 2013, Panama issued a US$750 million 40-year global bond
with a coupon rate of 4.3 percent. At that time, all three rating agencies confirmed its BBB rating,
one notch above investment grade, on par with Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. Since then, the spread rose
by about 45 basis points (from April 2013 to March 2014). As part of the debt management strategy,
in order to smooth the future amortization profile, in November 2013 the authorities bought back
US$583.6 million of the US$962 million global bond maturing in March 2015 and replaced it with a
combination of global and domestic bonds with longer maturity. To encourage the development of
domestic capital market, the authorities have also increased local debt issuance: the domestic share
of new debt issuances rose from less than 10 percent in 2009 to about a quarter in 2013.
6.
The current account deficit remains elevated, reflecting high public and private
investment. The worsening of the current account deficit in 2013 (to 11.9 percent of GDP), however,
mostly reflects the slowdown in exports (particularly Canal and related services) and an increase in
3

The monthly minimum wage in Zone 1 (roughly corresponding to the urban area) was raised 27 percent from
US$490 to US$624, and in Zone 2 (rural area) by 13 percent from US$432 to US$488. The new minimum wage should
benefit about 270,000 workers, who constitute about ¼ of the working population.
4

The 2013 SFRL deficit ceiling was raised to 3.1 percent from 2.7 percent, after approval of a supplementary budget
to cover the costs of reconstruction related to the 2012 floods. For subsequent years, the ceiling then declines from
2.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.5 percent in 2018.

The 2012 deficit was revised from 2.1 to 1.5 percent of GDP, as only part of budgeted expenditures materialized in
2012.

FDI reinvested earnings. The current account deficit is projected to remain high (close to 11 percent
of GDP) in 2014 and 2015, and improve in 2016 when the Canal expansion should be completed.
Exports remain well diversified:

FDI remains the main source of financing. Buoyant FDI inflows are projected to
continue to finance most of the current account deficit. 6 The copper mining project is expected to
bring about US$6½ billion over 2013–17, of which about US$1½ billion was already invested
in 2013. Overall, the large negative international investment position (about 71 percent of GDP
in 2012) corresponds mainly to a large inward FDI position (see Table 10), while both the assets and
liabilities of the banking sector (including currency and deposits) amount to about 100 percent of
GDP.

consumers continues to be robust. In January 2014, the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) required
banks to increase their provisioning for exposures to Venezuela (through ZLC) by about
1–1.3 percent of total capital. Interest rates remain at historically low levels, while household debt (at
about 40 percent of GDP) is on the high side compared to other emerging markets (see Chart 4).
9.
The regulatory framework for financial sector supervision is being enhanced in line
with FSAP recommendations (see Annex I). The authorities are applying risk-based supervision to
most banks and expect to complete coverage by mid-2014. The SBP has adopted a regulation on
credit risk management (Acuerdo No. 4, May 18 2013) and is working to enhance the countercyclical
capacity of the dynamic provisioning component, which will become effective by end-2014. The
recently approved Insurance Law enhances the independence and enforcement capacity of the
Superintendency of Insurance (SSRP); the SSRP is making efforts to build its analytical capacity and
upgrade regulations. The controversy around the recent intervention in a brokerage company by the
respective supervisory agency revealed critical weaknesses in the enforcement of the regulatory
framework for capital markets.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Growth is expected to remain
healthy. Real GDP growth is expected to
moderate (as difficulties in the ZLC are
expected to continue and public investment
starts its normalization), but to remain
healthy at above 7 percent in 2014 owing to
robust private investment. Growth should
gradually converge to its medium-term
potential of about 6 percent, as capital
spending unwinds and fiscal consolidation
continues along the SFRL path.
11.
The economy shows some signs
of overheating. The combination of strong
domestic demand, robust credit growth,
negative structural primary balance, positive
output gap, tight labor market, an
appreciating real exchange rate (reflecting
persistently higher inflation than that of
major trading partners), and a large current
account deficit points to the risk of
overheating and loss in competitiveness.
Buoyant domestic conditions have been a
contributing factor in driving inflation since

mid-2000s, in addition to external factors (food and gasoline prices). Indeed, the typical positive
relation between inflation and the economic cycle seems quite evident since mid-2000s—when
growth and investment rose substantially—after having been dormant for more than a decade (see
Chart 5, Chart 6, and Box 2). There are risks that inflation may become entrenched in wage dynamics
(especially in light of recent increases in minimum wages and public teachers’ remuneration).

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level
of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Panama’s extensive external
linkages bring strong economic and
financial benefits, but also make the
country vulnerable to shifts in global
economic and financial conditions (see
Figure 5, Chart 7, Box 3, and Box 4).7 The
normalization of U. S. monetary policy, and
the uncertainty regarding its pace, may
expose vulnerabilities, including through

Staff’s analysis indicates that negative external real and financial shocks could have a significant impact on output
growth (see “Spillovers to Panama: Impact of Trade and International Financial Shocks”, Country Report No. 13/89).

rising interest rates and capital outflows.8 The authorities consider such risks manageable, especially
if the process happens gradually, mainly because public debt maturity is long (about 11 years for
total debt and 13 years for external debt), and domestic bank rates are not very responsive to
U.S. interest rates (see Box 5).They also indicated that an increase in interest rates would contribute
to taming the risks of overheating. A protracted economic slowdown in trading partners would
significantly affect Panama’s exports, particularly Canal revenues.9 Persistent political and economic
tensions in Venezuela would continue to have a negative effect on the ZLC, but may also induce
capital inflows. Overall, strong fundamentals and the ability to implement countercyclical fiscal
policies would mitigate the impact of possible external shocks.

the Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fondo de
Ahorro de Panama, FAP) absorbing any excess in total Canal transfers. The government will be able
to use FAP’s assets to run countercyclical fiscal policy in the event of economic downturns or natural
disasters, and to reduce debt.11 Canal transfers generally comprise a large portion of nontax
8

Panama has large gross external positions (see Tables 4 and 10), and the banking sector plays a regional banking
hub role (Figure 5). International funding risks can be significant in case of potential deleveraging in Europe, due
mainly to Panama’s large exposures—particularly of nonbank entities—to European banks (Box 3).

Panama Canal traffic reflects about 5 percent of world trade.

10

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) also indicates that debt would remain sustainable in the occurrence of a
simultaneous interest rate and growth shock similar to the one occurred in 2008–09, but more persistent. Should a
temporary shock similar to the 2008–09 be coupled with a banking crisis that required fiscal intervention of about 17
percent of GDP, debt will obviously rise, but still remain sustainable.

11

Law 38 2012 instituted the FAP and endowed it with the assets of the Fondo Fiduciario (about US$1.3bn). The
newly appointed board and management aim to align the asset allocation to the objectives of FAP. Funds can be
transferred to the National Treasury under the following conditions: (i) if a state of emergency is declared by the
Cabinet, FAP can be called to cover the associated cost exceeding 0.5 percent of GDP as long as FAP assets are above
2 percent of GDP; (ii) in the occurrence of an economic slowdown (from 2015 onwards), defined as growth less than
2 percent for two consecutive quarters, FAP can be asked to contribute as long as FAP assets are above 2 percent of
GDP; (iii) the government may decide to use FAP assets to repay sovereign debt for up to 0.5 percent of GDP per

revenue, historically have been fairly stable (see Chart 8), and are expected to increase significantly
in 2016.
14.
The Canal expansion presents some downside risks in the short term and upside risks
in the medium term. In December 2013, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) and the Grupo Unidos
por el Canal (GUPC)—the consortium handling a US$3.2 billion contract in the Canal expansion—
entered into a dispute, over a cost overrun of US$1.6 billion claimed by GUPC. As a consequence,
the expansion activity slowed down and then halted completely for two weeks in February 2014. An
agreement was reached in late February 2014, and the project completion is now expected by
end-2015. Should additional tensions arise, the ACP is confident that work can be completed with
small additional delays and costs. Once the expansion is finished, Canal traffic should increase
significantly due to the transit of larger (New-Panamax) ships, and in particular the transportation of
Liquefied Natural Gas. Over the long term, the possible construction of a canal in Nicaragua could
increase competition for ACP.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the appropriate fiscal stance to reduce risks of overheating and build
policy space, policies to bolster financial system’s resilience and transparency, as well as mediumterm growth efforts to boost productivity, competitiveness, and inclusiveness. The beginning of
the new political cycle in the second half of 2014 may be a propitious time to push ahead with
reforms.

A. Fiscal Policy
15.
Staff recommended targeting a fiscal deficit below the revised SFRL ceiling. First,
tighter fiscal policy in the near term will help rein in domestic inflationary pressures and prevent
them from becoming entrenched in

targeting a fiscal deficit below the

the transfer of overall investment returns to the Treasury on an annual basis.

ceiling would reduce the risk of revising or exceeding the ceiling, which would erode the credibility
of the fiscal rules and investors’ confidence (see Chart 9). In this regard, the significant revision of
nominal GDP in 2014 offers an opportunity to remain below the SFRL ceiling, by maintaining the
moderate fiscal tightening imbedded in the nominal deficit path that would have otherwise been
envisaged with the unrevised GDP. However, the 2014 fiscal deficit presented in the budget
corresponds to about 3 percent of the 2014 unrevised GDP projection (see Table 1) and may require
small adjustments in order to remain within the SFRL ceiling (2.7 percent) on the basis of revised
GDP. The authorities indicated that they managed to keep the fiscal balance below the SFRL ceilings
in recent years (in part due to lower than budgeted expenditures, but also to improvements in tax
collection), that they expect substantial underspending in 2014 vis-à-vis the budget due to the
election and the transition between administrations (as in 2009), and that they are committed to
adjusting expenditures if necessary to keep the 2014 fiscal deficit within the ceiling. Regarding the
potential overheating risks, the authorities expect inflation to come down, due in part to the effect
of the ongoing U.S. monetary policy normalization.
16.
Staff and authorities agreed on the fiscal reform agenda to strengthen the capacity
in budgeting and public financial management. Authorities are confident that tax evasion has
been declining owing to the strengthening of fiscal institutions, including the recently created
independent revenue agency (Autoridad Nacional de Ingresos Publicos, ANIP). The Large Taxpayers’
Unit is operational and being enhanced. The authorities plan to make public the first debt strategy
plan in the spring of 2014. The authorities should press ahead with the creation of a Single Treasury
Account and the establishment of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. Staff also highlighted
the importance of enhancing the strategy for a joint management of public assets and liabilities: a
consistent vision should jointly guide the government decisions related to the management of the
sovereign wealth fund, public debt management, the path for fiscal tightening, the funding of the
financial liquidity facility, the management of public enterprises’ liabilities, and the use of contingent
instruments (such as catastrophic insurance).

B. Bolstering Financial System Resilience
17.
The mission called for enhanced monitoring of risks to financial stability stemming
from large gross external positions, rapidly rising real estate prices, and the leverage and
liquidity positions of both banks and enterprises. As of end-2013, onshore banks reported about
US$32 billion in foreign assets (79 percent of GDP), mainly in the form of loans to Latin American
countries, and US$26 billion in foreign liabilities (64 percent of GDP). Most of these exposures
belong to foreign-owned banks operating in Panama.12 Banks’ foreign lending and foreign deposits
have increased less than GDP in recent years, owing in part to the strong growth record of Panama
(see Table 4). Information on corporate foreign borrowing and on leverage of corporate and
household sectors is limited. While no data are available on real estate prices, anecdotal evidence

12

Foreign-owned (Panamanian) banks account for about 80 percent of foreign deposits and about 85 percent of
foreign lending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PANAMA

suggests that housing prices may have doubled in the last five years, with some signs of oversupply
in the tourism and high-end real estate segments.
18.
The authorities see no tangible systemic financial sector risks at present. While
acknowledging that more information on foreign exposures is needed, the authorities pointed out
that the SBP coordinates closely with other banking supervisors within the region. They claimed that
most Panamanian firms have limited foreign borrowing and that most of the nonbank private sector
foreign liabilities relate to foreign companies with limited operations in Panama. The authorities
indicated that they intend to start collecting data on real estate prices but argued that the presumed
doubling of real estate prices in five years is consistent with fundamentals, as nominal GDP grew by
about 76 percent during the same period, prices were previously suppressed due to the withdrawal
of U.S. troops, and mortgage credit has been growing in line with GDP. Banks claimed that their
exposures to the tourism and high-end real estate segments are limited, and their mortgage-related
risks are kept low by the practice of automatic payroll deductions. The authorities explained that
they are closely monitoring banks’ exposures to Venezuela and may take further measures if
needed.
19.
The mission urged the authorities to swiftly implement the remaining
recommendations of the 2011 FSAP (Annex I) and of the 2014 IMF Detailed Assessment
Report on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). The
authorities indicated that implementation of key FSAP recommendations is ongoing, with priority
being placed on the liquidity facility for banks and the issuance of an AML law. While concurring
with the priorities, staff encouraged the authorities to make progress also on other financial sector
reforms.


Introducing a formal financial safety net. Staff and the authorities agreed that creating an
adequately financed and well designed liquidity facility would help absorb liquidity shocks (at
present, Panama has neither a lender of last resort facility nor a deposit insurance scheme,
inducing banks to be conservative in lending and to hold more liquidity than required by
regulation).13 The current proposal for the facility envisages the possibility that Banco Nacional
de Panama (BNP), a public bank, is in the board of the facility. Staff argued that it is important
that (i) the facility has a tangible and explicit funding plan, such as a gradual build up of assets
from public and ideally private sources; (ii) the choice of the fiduciary and management of the
facility avoids generating potential conflicts of interest and ensures a level playing field for all
banks; and (iii) adequate liquidity and solvency standards for eligibility are carefully specified.
The authorities argued that the potential conflict of interest related to the possible BNP
involvement in the board of the facility is limited, because the BNP undertakes also public
functions, has never abused the private information it has on commercial banks’ operations, and
has provided liquidity to the banking system in the past.

13

The authorities are receiving technical assistance from CAPTAC in this area, and details of the operational
framework would need to be elaborated.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA



Maintaining momentum in financial sector reforms to enhance financial and corporate
transparency. The law issued in 2013 providing for the custody of bearer shares and the
publication of the 2014 IMF AML/CFT assessment report are positive steps towards improving
the transparency of the corporate and financial sectors.14 Staff discussed with the authorities the
possible economic impact of the FATF and Global Forum initiatives to increase compliance with
their respective standards, particularly given Panama’s role as a financial and business services
center. The economic impact is likely to be limited if authorities step up their efforts. Foreign
deposits and insurance premiums are at risk of decline, and a decrease in activities related to
legal and accounting services may, at least temporarily, affect output and employment.
Otherwise, in a highly unlikely scenario, limited progress in this area might lead to international
sanctions that could hinder broad access to international capital markets. In this context, staff
encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to comply with the FATF and Global Forum
standards, including through technical assistance. The authorities argued that banks are required
to know the beneficial owner of bank deposits and have generally not been accepting bearer
shares accounts for several years, but acknowledged the need to improve Panama’s compliance
with the FATF standards in line with the AML/CFT assessment’s key recommendations. They have
requested technical assistance from the IADB, the Fund, and the U.S. Treasury, to support with
the assessment of the economic impact, the implementation of the recommendations, and the
enhancement of the Financial Intelligence Unit.



Building the capacity to monitor systemic risks and conduct macroprudential policies, as well as
enhancing supervision. The SBP has identified systemically important banks and initiated a
Financial Stability Report series. Coordination among the supervisory agencies has been
improved through the establishment of a council of supervisors (FCC), which has taken measures
against emerging risks, and cross-membership in supervisory boards. Nevertheless, no
institution in Panama has the overall mandate to monitor systemic risks, and capacity constraints
as well as data gaps (e.g. on real estate prices, loan-to-value ratios, and corporate sector
financial conditions) prevent adequate monitoring of systemic risks. Staff welcomed the
introduction of dynamic provisioning and urged the authorities to enhance its countercyclical
capacity. The authorities should continue to improve the capacity for supervising nonbank
financial institutions. Draft legislation and regulations on cooperatives, conglomerates, trust
funds, public accountants, as well as capital adequacy and regulatory reporting standards for
holding companies should be finalized and adopted. Efforts to enhance banking supervision
should continue. The authorities should also promote the development of the interbank market.



A deposit insurance scheme could complement social policies. Deposit insurance capped at
US$10,000 would offer protection to the majority of depositors (estimated at about 90 percent
in the 2011 FSAP) while entailing a relatively small potential loss (5 percent of deposits). The cap
would ensure that this scheme would particularly benefit the middle and poorer segments of the

transition period for compliance ending in 2018.

population. The authorities are adverse to deposit insurance as they fear that it may generate
moral hazard and limit market monitoring of banks’ behavior.

C. Ensuring a Smooth Transition to Medium-term Growth
20.
Staff analysis suggests that there are moderate signs of an excessive current account
deficit. The current account has recently been wider than consistent with the current policies and
fundamentals, but there is no compelling evidence of a significant real exchange rate misalignment
(see Box 6). Staff and authorities agreed that the widening of the current account deficit is
associated with the strong-but-temporary investment agenda and is expected to continue being
financed mainly by FDI, while external debt remains sustainable (see Annex II).15 The authorities
indicated that the dollarization served them well for over a century and that the Panamanian
economy has strong self-adjusting mechanisms; staff argued that the recent strong domestic
demand may induce risks of unusual persistence in inflation and strain the self-adjusting
mechanism. Hence, going forward staff recommended containing inflationary pressures to prevent
further appreciation of the real exchange rate, monitoring the buildup of external liabilities, and
continuing improving external sector statistics, thus allowing a more informed assessment of the
external position.
21.
Staff and the authorities agreed that emphasis on social and institutional reforms
should continue. Reduction in poverty and income inequality has been sizable in recent years,
thanks not only to strong growth, but also to social reforms.16 The authorities highlighted that they
are continuously enhancing social protection. For example, they recently increased the cash transfer
to the elderly from 100 to 120 dollars a month (120 a los 70) and launched a program for citizens
with severe disabilities (Angel Guardian).17 The effectiveness of social programs has been favorably
assessed on the basis of opinion surveys answered by program beneficiaries, and the authorities are
working on additional (and more neutral) assessment tools. Nonetheless, poverty still affects about
one-quarter of the population, and incidence is higher in rural areas. Institutional reforms (such as to
enhance the judicial system and reduce corruption) would be necessary to address shortcomings
often highlighted in international comparison statistics (see charts in Box 6).
22.
Staff and the authorities concurred that, with the large infrastructure projects
nearing completion, further improvements in training, education, and health will be necessary
to facilitate job reallocation, complement capital investment, raise productivity, and improve
living standards. In the high-growth period of 2007–13, capital accumulation contributed to more
than a third of GDP growth, with the remaining contribution resulting equally from labor and total
15

Net of gross foreign asset accumulations, external debt to GDP would decline in all the risk scenarios envisaged.

16

The poverty rate fell from 36.8 percent in 2003 to 27.6 percent in 2011. Between 2003 and 2011, income growth of
households in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution reached 8.9 percent, compared with an average for
Latin American countries of 4.8 percent, and with Panama’s average household income growth of 6.6 percent. The
Gini coefficient dropped from 0.56 in 2003 to 0.53 in 2011.

Other social programs aim at addressing poverty and adult illiteracy, or at promoting community empowerment,
crime prevention, child development, and job training.

and youth unemployment. Staff
highlighted that stimulating female labor force participation—for example by providing wider access
to childcare and flexible working hours—may not only relax labor market capacity constraints, but
also enhance the average productivity of the labor force, given the comparatively high level of
education attained by women (see Box 7). The authorities emphasized that there are no legal
restrictions to female labor force participation. They also recently promoted several enhancements
in the education programs (aiming at the acquisition of soft skills and the knowledge of foreign
languages), improved training programs for teachers, and deepened the dialogue between teachers
and firms to address skill mismatches. School dropouts declined from 5.1 percent in 2009 to
3.1 percent in 2012, and school enrollment (especially for middle and high school) increased.

D. Data Reporting Standards
23.
Staff urged the authorities to swiftly progress with efforts towards the SDDS
subscription and to close data gaps that hinder effective macroeconomic policy management.
Improvements in timeliness, coverage, and quality of macro-statistics data would help improve the
capacity of policy-making and boost investor confidence.19 Since the 2011 SDDS TA mission from
the Fund, partial progress has been made towards SDDS subscription. The main remaining obstacles
relate to the lack of budgetary allocations and inadequate coordination among the relevant
18

There is recent compelling evidence that enhancing the quality of the teachers strongly and significantly raises the
likelihood that students will obtain better test scores, reach higher education, and earn higher income in their lifetime
(see NBER working papers 19423 and 19424, as well as Eric Hanushek’s contributions (http://hanushek.stanford.edu/).
Overall, the quality of the education seems to be at least as important as—if not more than—spending per pupil.
19

Recent studies suggest that subscription to SDDS may lower sovereign spreads by up to 20 to 50 basis points
(Cady, J., 2005, “Does SDDS Subscription Reduce Borrowing Costs for Emerging Market Economies?” IMF Staff
Papers, Vol. 52, No.3, pp. 503–17; and J. Cady and A. Pellechio, 2006, “Sovereign Borrowing Cost and the IMF’s Data
Standards Initiatives,” IMF Working Paper 06/78).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA

government agencies. Improving data reporting is particularly important for series relevant for
macroeconomic monitoring such as the breakdown of quarterly GDP, Government Finance Statistics,
outward FDI flows and stocks, and portfolio equity flows and stocks. The authorities indicated that
they prioritize the revision of national account statistics and the enhancement of foreign direct
investment data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The baseline outlook is favorable, with moderate risks. Panama’s economic growth
started to moderate in 2013, but is expected to remain strong over the medium term as it continues
to enhance its regional and global logistics role for the movement of goods, capital, and people.
Inflation is moderating due to the deceleration of international food and oil prices, but remains
higher than in major trading partners owing in part to strong domestic demand. The 2014 fiscal
deficit is expected to remain within the revised SFRL ceilings, taking into account the expected
upward revision to GDP. The current account deficit is expected to remain elevated, reflecting high
public and private investment, but buoyant FDI inflows are projected to continue to finance most of
the deficit.
25.
Near-term risks arise mainly from overheating pressures and shifts in global trade
and financial conditions. Strong domestic demand contributes to the risk of overheating: resilient
inflationary pressures may feed into wage dynamics, possibly reducing competitiveness. With regard
to external risks, the normalization—and the surrounding uncertainty—of U.S. monetary policy may
expose vulnerabilities, including through higher interest rates and capital outflows. Other external
risks relate to a protracted economic slowdown in trading partners and persistent payment
difficulties in Venezuela. Additional significant delays in the Canal expansion would have an adverse
impact on output and employment in the short term, and on exports and fiscal revenues in the
medium term. Strong fundamentals and the ability to implement countercyclical fiscal policies
would, however, help mitigate the impact of these external shocks.
26.
Keeping the fiscal deficits below the SFRL ceilings would help contain overheating
pressures and build fiscal policy buffers. Tighter fiscal policy than envisaged will help rein in
domestic inflationary pressures (and prevent them from becoming entrenched in wage dynamics),
leave room for policy maneuver to cope with shocks, and build public savings that could help
finance the liquidity facility. Furthermore, targeting a fiscal deficit below the ceiling would reduce the
risk of exceeding or revising the ceiling. Indeed, authorities should avoid further revision to the
ceilings, which erode the credibility of the SFRL and investors’ confidence. The significant revision of
nominal GDP offers an opportunity to remain well below the ceiling in 2014, by maintaining the
moderate fiscal tightening imbedded in the nominal deficit path that would have otherwise been
targeted.
27.
The fiscal reform agenda should continue to strengthen the capacity in budgeting
and public financial management. Completing the Single Treasury Account and the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework would help in this area. A comprehensive strategy for public assets and
liabilities management should jointly guide decisions related to public debt management, the role

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA

of the sovereign wealth fund, the path for fiscal tightening, the funding of the financial liquidity
facility, the management of public enterprises’ liabilities, and the use of contingent instruments
(such as catastrophic insurance).
28.
The banking system remains generally healthy, but the remaining recommendations
of the 2011 FSAP should be swiftly implemented. Bank performance indicators are sound. The
authorities have moved proactively to contain risks related to exposures to Venezuela, but they
should continue to monitor closely credit growth, leverage, and external positions, and take
additional measures if needed. Creating an adequately financed and well designed liquidity facility
would help absorb liquidity shocks. The authorities should continue to improve their capacity for
(i) monitoring systemic risks (including through collecting necessary data and frequently updating
stress tests), (ii) conducting macroprudential policies, and (iii) supervising both banks and nonbank
financial institutions.
29.
Intensifying efforts towards enhancing financial transparency is imperative. The law
providing for custody of bearer shares and the publication of the IMF AML/CFT reports are
important steps toward increased transparency of the corporate and financial sectors, but the
authorities should accelerate the implementation of the recommendations in the AML/CFT
assessment.
30.
Medium-term reforms and policies should focus on maintaining external stability,
promoting inclusiveness and fairness, and enhancing human capital and productivity. In order
to maintain external sustainability and competitiveness, it is important to contain inflationary
pressures, prevent further appreciation of the real exchange rate, and monitor the buildup of
external liabilities. The authorities should continue to undertake social and institutional reforms, in
order to enhance poverty reduction and improve the distribution of income and of economic
opportunities. Emphasis should be placed on further improving the quality of public education,
stimulating female labor force participation and enhancing the availability of vocational training. An
important priority will be the implementation of measures to support the rapid reallocation of labor
from construction to other economic sectors (such as logistics services), once the large infrastructure
projects, including the Canal expansion, are completed. These measures should also include skills
upgrading as well as the deployment of social safety nets to accommodate the transition.
31.
The authorities should resume efforts towards the subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and close gaps in data that are critical for conducting sound
macroeconomic policy.
32.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 1. Panama: Implementation of Past IMF Policy Advice
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies over the last year have been broadly in line with past Fund advice. During
the 2012 Article IV consultation, Directors encouraged the authorities to build up fiscal space and enhance crisis
prevention tools. In particular, the Directors saw merit in a tighter fiscal stance, further improvements in tax
administration and expenditure management, and avoiding further revision of the SFRL ceilings. Directors also
emphasized the importance of further strengthening the financial safety net. Directors underscored the importance of
continued efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, and to tackle youth unemployment.
Fiscal policy. The 2013 deficit (at 3 percent of GDP) was within the ceiling, when accounting for the
supplementary budget to cover the costs of reconstruction associated with the October 2012 floods. The fiscal
deficit ceilings under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law remain on a declining path. Revenue collection has
been improved, including via the recent creation of the independent revenue agency and the Large Tax Payers’
Unit. Efforts have also been made to smooth the medium-term amortization profile, and the authorities plan to
publish a Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy in 2014. Progress is being made in the implementation of the
Single Treasury Account and the establishment of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.
Financial sector reforms. Further progress has been made in implementing the 2011 FSAP recommendations
since 2012. The plan to establish a liquidity facility (PALET) is being finalized. Progress has also been made in
improving the transparency of the financial and corporate sector (Law 47 of August 6, 2013 adopted a custody
regime applicable to bearer shares). The IMF Detailed Assessment Report on Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating Financing of Terrorism was published in February 2014. The Financial Coordination Committee has
been established and has taken measures against emerging risks. The regulation on credit risks issued in May 2013
incorporated a dynamic provisioning mechanism. Laws on Trust Funds, Cooperatives, and on Certified Public
Accountants have been drafted.
More inclusive growth. The authorities are enhancing social protection programs and evaluating how to better
target them. Cash transfers to the elderly have been increased. Reforms to the education system include
modernizing the curriculum, enhancing the training of teachers, and involving the private sector in the reforms to
address skill mismatches and youth unemployment.

Box 2. Panama: Inflation Is Not Just An Imported Phenomenon
The resilience of inflation is likely to reflect exuberant growth. Inflation has traditionally been low in Panama
(about 1 percent from 1990 to mid-2000s), even lower than in the U.S. In the mid-2000s, a significant increase in
inflation (up to about 10 percent, yoy) was mainly associated with the large increase in the international prices of
energy and food. However, the role of international prices in the resurgence of inflation since 2009 is less clearcut; it seems that the economic boom may be contributing to the resilience of inflation. First, international prices
moderated towards end-2011, while inflation remains substantially higher (see charts below). Second, core
inflation has been very close to overall inflation (more than in the past). Third, a typical Phillips curve relation
between output growth (or unemployment) and inflation seems to have emerged in mid-2000s (see also text
Chart 6); and over the past three decades the relation between inflation and unemployment has been evident
when unemployment has been below 10 percent, which has been the case since mid-2000s.1/ The effect of a
booming economy on inflation seems to result more from the demand than the supply side, given that tradable
and non-tradable inflation are very similar (if a Balassa-Samuelson effect were at work, we would observe lower
tradable than non-tradable inflation). Indeed, wage inflation recently picked up along with inflation (Figure 1).
Overall, strong demand seems to be contributing to inflation resilience.

Box 3. Panama: Financial Stability Map1
The high reliance of the Panamanian economy on international trade, as well as its role as a financial center,
potentially makes the country vulnerable to turbulence in international trade and global financial markets.
This box applies the Country Financial Stability Map methodology to Panama and compares six aggregate
indicators of risks and macroeconomic conditions in the third quarter of either 2013 or 2008, with the 2003–08
average for these indicators. It also compares changes in financial stability for Panama versus other emerging
markets.
Panama macro-financial risks are close to their pre-crisis level. As of the third quarter of 2013, credit risks are
low in Panama (as they were in 2008) compared to mid-2000s, owing in part to the effect of the decline in
unemployment on bank portfolio risk. Market and liquidity risks declined moderately since 2008, but remain high
with respect to mid-2000s, mainly due to movements in large foreign exposures of the banking sector.
Macroeconomic risks have slightly increased since 2008 mainly due to a slowdown in investment and trade growth.
Notably, both credit risk and market and liquidity risk in Panama experienced a very different pattern than in other
emerging markets, where these risks were very high at the onset of the crisis compared to mid-2000s (not
surprisingly, the economic and financial impact of the recent global crisis was smaller in Panama than in numerous
emerging markets).
Panama now faces somewhat tighter monetary and financial conditions in the domestic market (in contrast
to the global environment), but foreign investors show improved risk appetite towards Panamanian assets.
The tighter monetary and financial conditions are mainly attributable to declining inflationary pressures which
contributed to the increase in domestic short-term real interest rates. Encouragingly, the strong FDI inflows point
to Panama’s attractiveness as an investment destination for foreign investors, supported by the improving stability
of its domestic financial environment; the reliance on stable FDI flows makes the risk appetite for Panamanian
assets quite stable compared to other emerging markets.

Box 4. Panama: External Financial Linkages of the Banking System1
Being a regional financial center, the Panamanian banks are relatively more exposed to international
financial risks, both downstream and upstream, than banks from other major countries in the region.
Downstream exposure highlights the potential credit risk, i.e. the possibility of losing money on foreign assets if a
financial crisis occurs in borrowing countries. Panamanian banks’ lending to foreigners (excluding subsidiaries’
claims, except for the parent bank’s equity and any non-equity intra-group claims) is about
40 percent of GDP as of 2013 Q3,

deposits) were about 95 percent of GDP as of 2013 Q3, much higher than in the LA5 countries.
Potential downstream losses can exceed 4 percent of GDP. This figure is estimated using inputs from the IMF’s
Vulnerabilities Exercises for Advanced and Emerging Economies and assuming standard loss-given default ratios
(75 percent for the sovereign and 60 percent for the private sector). This potential loss for Panama is seven times
larger than the highest level among LA5 countries with available data.
Negative shocks to foreign banks’ balance sheets could cause a severe credit crunch in Panama, if a
malicious deleveraging cycle is triggered. The experiment was done assuming that a shock forced banks in a
specified region to default on a given percent of their domestic on-sheet claims, and banks would restore the
capital adequacy ratio (e.g. 9 percent of Core Tier 1 capital in the case of European banks) by uniform deleveraging
across domestic and external claims. Two shocks were considered: (case I) a 3 percent default rate; and (case II)
2
default rates varying across countries. Several rounds of deleveraging process were considered until no further
deleveraging occurred in the simulation.3 When European countries get hit by the shock, Panama’s credit
contraction would be large (about 9 and 16 percent of GDP in case I and II respectively; see chart below). It is
however possible that part of the inflows may be more immune to global financing conditions, as a large part of
domestic borrowing from BIS-reporting foreign banks was undertaken by the nonbank sector, and these flows
have been fairly stable during the global crisis (especially compared to bank borrowing).

To capture the effect on the domestic economy, the results are adjusted by the exposure of BIS banks to Panama’s off-shore
banks and corporations with limited domestic activity (about half).,The analysis does not take into account the effect of bank
recapitalizations and other remedial policy actions—ring fencing, monetary policy, etc.—in the host and/or home country.

Panama’s EMBI spread can be explained by country-specific financial and political risks, as well as the
U.S. 10-year nominal yield and the volatility of U.S. market. As illustrated by the panel to the right, a simple OLS
regression delivers a reasonable fit. In Case I, the Merrill Option

In the medium term, the model predicts an increase
in the spread, consistently with the general
expectation for emerging market, as a result of the
normalization of the U.S. monetary policy and the
uncertainty related to its pace. In the medium term,
Panama’ spread is expected to increase by about 125 to
175 bps to around 325 or 375 bps (in case I or II,
respectively). In the projection, both domestic financial
risks and political risks are assumed to remain at their
current level. The projection for the U.S. 10-year nominal
yield is based on the IMF WEO database and increases
by about 250 bps from end December 2013 to Q4 2019.
Both MOVE and VIX are assumed to gradually increase,
converging to their respective long run mean according
to an estimated mean-reverting process, thus
contributing to an increase in spread.

Domestic banks deposit and lending rates are less responsive than sovereign rates to changes in U.S. rates. As
shown in the panel to the right (which relates domestic rates to U.S. rates of the same maturity), a 100 bps increase
in U.S. one-month nominal treasury bill rate is

The model is based on the analysis in the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), April 2014, and uses monthly data from
January 2000 to December 2013. Both the financial and the political risks are measured by index numbers from the International
Country Risk Guide (ICRG).

Box 6. Panama: External Balance Assessment
A number of methodologies suggest that there are moderate signs of an excessive current account deficit, but no
indication of a real exchange rate misalignment (see Box table). Further real appreciation would undermine
competitiveness, thus macroeconomic policies should aim at containing demand.

1/ The MB approach calculates the norm in the current account to GDP ratio (CA/Y), based on an approach similar to the IMF
External Balance Assessment methodology (EBA), adding Panama to the EBA sample. The ES approach calculates the difference
between the underlying CA to GDP ratio (2013, adjusted for output gap) and the CA to GDP ratio stabilizing the 2012 NFA to
GDP ratio. The first REER approach uses EBA-like regressions to explain the INS REER; the second REER approach explains an
REER index whose set of trading partners is based on the EBA set of countries, hence it excludes Venezuela. CA/Y and NFA/Y are
measured in percent of GDP. REER is measured in percent.

Panama’s current account deficit has been worsening significantly in recent years, from about 4 percent
in 2000–06 to about 10 percent in 2007–13. Indeed the CA deficit has been larger than the value explained by
fundamentals and current policies since mid-2000s—apart from the sharp adjustment during the global crisis—
and the gap is now about 6 percent (see the Box table and charts, which report results based on an approach
similar to EBA, adding Panama to the EBA sample). However, the MB gap is overestimated as the EBA-like
regressions cannot adequately capture the impact on the current account of temporarily high investment, which is
expected to increase productivity capacity. Indeed, if one were to base the underlying current account on the
medium-term projections (as in CGER) the gap would be much smaller (less than 2 percent of GDP). The ES
methodology also points to a smaller CA imbalance. Moreover, a large component of the current account deficit
comes from the income payment associated with reinvested earnings from direct investment, strong and fairly
stable FDI inflows are expected to continue to finance the bulk of external CA deficits in the coming years
(Table 6), external debt is deemed sustainable and fairly resilient to shocks (see Annex II), and the net international
investment position has remained fairly stable and mainly financed by inward FDI (Table 10).
The REER does not appear misaligned. The REER (as measured by the INS) depreciated substantially in the
early 2000s and has only recently started appreciating with the surge in inflation. When using a methodology
similar to EBA, the misalignment appears very small (see the Box table and charts). However, the INS REER index
may underestimate the extent of the appreciation in Panama, by assigning an excessive trade weight to Venezuela
(10 percent), which has high inflation. When we calculate the REER relative to the set of EBA countries as trading
partners (thus excluding Venezuela) and apply a similar methodology, the misalignment remains very small. While
a misalignment is not obvious at present, going forward, further real appreciation driven by inflation above trading
partners could erode competitiveness.
Survey-based competitiveness rankings improved in recent years, owing in part to ongoing reforms (see
the Box charts). Overall, Panama ranks better than most of its peers in South America, except Chile. In terms of
competitiveness areas, Panama ranks well on market efficiency, financial development, technological readiness,
and infrastructure. However, its rankings in terms of labor market efficiency, access to health care, primary
education, and governance are less competitive.

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care should
be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small
number of informants, which tend to overstate the indicators’ coverage and explanatory power.

Box 7. Panama: Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP)
Panamanian women make up a little more than half of the population and are relatively better educated, but
seem to be under-represented in the labor market. Only around one-third of labor market participants are
women. Furthermore, the probability of longer-than-one-year unemployment is 30 percent for females
versus 19 percent for males. However, over 40 percent of the working females have university degrees, while the
corresponding ratio for male is only 24 percent. Moreover, the most recent internationally standard PISA test scores,
averaged among math, reading, and science tests, indicate that compared to peer countries Panamanian girls enjoy
higher test scores than boys, largely in contrast to the fact that Panama is the country that has the fewest women in
the labor market. Overall, these numbers suggest that women’s limited participation in the labor market is not a
reflection of weaker qualifications and lack of education.

That said, female labor force participation (FLFP) has been rising, and further increases would yield economic
and social benefits. FLFP rose from 35.4 in 2001 to 39.7 in 2013. Going forward, more working females could help
relieve the capacity constraint of the Panamanian economy (with unemployment at historically low levels) by
enlarging the total labor force. In addition, in light of the discussion above, introducing relatively well educated
women into the existing pool of workers may also raise the average labor productivity, which is one of the key
factors for sustainable long run growth. Regional studies done by the World Bank also find evidence that higher FLFP
1
significantly helps reducing poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean.
There are no legal barriers to FLFP, but obstacles common to other countries seem to present.2 Child and
elderly care tends to keep women from seeking formal employment; indeed female employment in Panama is
relatively higher in the public sector which provides more access to child care. Also, over half of the economically
inactive females are classified as housewives or working for the household, compared to only 4 percent for inactive
males. Other countries’ experience also shows that policies aiming at increasing the flexibility of the working
arrangement (like flexible hours), and removing labor market distortions in general, often end up boosting female
labor market participation.

1/ Public sector debt and financing needs includes those of the Non-Financial Public Sector and the external finacing needs of the Panama Canal expansion. .
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Panama Public DSA Stress Test
Two additional stress tests are conducted—a near-term financial contingent liability shock and a
medium-term output and financial shock.

Nominal Debt-to-GDP
60
amount of 10 percent of banking system’s assets in 2015; at

1/ Derived as [r - g - g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt;  = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency, equal to zero for Panama), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-gr1+g++g) times previous period debt stock.  increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator). Given ε = 0 for Panama, this term becomes -ρ(1+g)/(1+g+ρ+gρ).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

Annex III. Investment and Growth
A growth decomposition exercise suggests that the recent growth spur was due to capital
accumulation and improvements in productivity. 1 While until early 2000s Panama’s growth
performance was mainly driven by labor and private investment, the last decade witnessed a surge in
public investment and various structural reforms aimed at improving efficiency and competitiveness.

Labor contribution to output growth has been relatively stable. 2 Employment increased steadily over
the past decades. At the same time, education indicators improved substantially, and enrollment rates
now compare favorably with peers in the region. Average years of schooling of the population of 15
years and older increased from 7.6 in 1990 to 9.6 years in 2010. Also, enrollment in tertiary education
accelerated from the 1990s and doubled from 22.7 percent in 1991 to 45.7 percent in 2010. As
unemployment reduction reached its limits, labor contribution slowed down in recent years.
Total factor productivity (TFP) did not contribute to growth until 2004. TFP registered negative
contribution in 1980 and 1990s. Beginning in the 1990s, and especially in the 2000s, the authorities
adopted an economic strategy aiming at reducing public sector indebtedness, removing impediments to
productivity growth, stimulating private sector investment, and enhancing public sector capacity. These
reforms include significant efforts in privatization, trade and market liberalization, and financial regulation
and supervision, and they helped improve the competitiveness of the economy.3 As a consequence, in
the last decade, TFP’s contribution accounted for almost one quarter of growth.
Capital contribution to growth increased over time. The evolution of capital stock reflected the lack of
investor confidence in the 1980s, its recovery in the 1990s, and the acceleration of investment growth
1

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function:
, where Yt is the level of output, Kt is capital input; Lt is labor
input, At is the technology or total factor productivity (TFP), and α denotes the capital output ratio and is estimated at 0.37 (via an
OLS regression over the 1991-2012 period). See also C. Johnson, Potential Output and Output Gap in Central America, Panama and
Dominican Republic, IMF working paper 13/145.

When calculating labor input, the number of employees in the economy is adjusted by the education attainment represented by
the average years of schooling obtained from Barro and Lee Education Attainment Dataset.

Panama ranked 40 out of 144 countries in the 2012/13 World Economic Forum Global Competitive Index, and ranked second in
Latin America (after Chile). It also improved its ranking in the Ease of Doing Business index from 65 in 2008 to 61 in 2013.

since mid-2000s. The corresponding share of contribution to growth was about 40 percent in 1980–2013.
Public investment increased from an average of 2.4 percent of GDP in the 1980s to 3.4 percent in
the 1990s, and to more than 9 percent in 2007–13. Indeed, public investment plans for 2009–14 include
new highways, airports, roads, ports, urban infrastructure, sewage systems, healthcare facilities and new
subway system. In addition, a third set of locks are being built to enable the transit of post-Panamax
containerships through the Canal, which would double the transit capacity, boosting growth also in
logistics and other trade-related activities. Contribution to growth from private sector investment also
rose in recent years: private sector confidence was encouraged by the improvements in economic
efficiency and business climate, better public finances, privatizations, and the repossession of the Canal.
Public investment had a significant impact on output as well as on private investments. Staff
estimated a structural VAR model with real GDP as well as real private and public investments over
the 1992–2012 period. The results indicate that an increase in public investment by 1 percent would raise
GDP by 0.1 percent on impact and by about 0.2 percent after two years.4

Responses to a one-percent shock in real public investment. Dashed lines correspond to 95 percent confidence intervals.

There is evidence of complementarities between public investment and private investment. Public
investment in large transportation projects has improved connectivity between logistics centers, and
fostered private investment in tourism and in higher value-added agricultural exports. Public investment
was also aimed at developing new industries and services around the logistics hubs, such as light
manufacturing and value-added warehousing. Investment in education and hospitals should help
improve social condition and human capital over the medium term. The structural VAR model confirms
the complementarity of public and private investment: a 1 percent increase of public investment raises
private investment by about 0.4 percent on impact and by about 0.6 percent after one to two years (thus
“crowding-in” private investment).

4

Our results are consistent with the average output elasticity of public capital reported by Bom and Lighart (2013) based on 578
estimates collected from 68 studies: 0.1 for public investment and 0.2 for core public investment, which includes roads, railways,
airports, and utilities (What Have We Learned from Three Decades of Research on the Productivity of Public Capital? Journal of
Economic Surveys, forthcoming).

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Panama (NBP) was subject to
the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on June
30, 2000, and expired on March 29, 2002. The transitional procedures required a review of the NBP’s
external audit mechanism only. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that
NBP’s external audit mechanism was at the time adequate.

Non-financial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy. Its national
currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit of account. The exchange
rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 25, 2013. Panama is on the standard 12
month consultation cycle.
FSAP: A first-time FSAP was concluded in September 2011. It confirmed the banking sector’s
strength and resilience to potential shocks, noting nonetheless that data gaps prevent a full analysis
of macro-financial linkages. It concluded that the regulatory framework for banks was broadly
adequate, but the regulation of nonbanks had important shortcomings. It recommended to build
the capacity to monitor systemic risks and introduce a financial safety net, including a facility aimed
at addressing temporary liquidity shortfalls and a limited deposit insurance fund.
Technical Assistance
Panama is a large recipient of technical assistance (TA) directly through the Fund or CAPTACDR.
Latest assistance concentrated in the area of the national accounts, both on output compilation and
producer price and export and import prices. Assistance in the fiscal area included the practical
application of the accounting policies established in the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS), implementation of the single treasury account and medium-term expenditure
framework. CAPTAC is delivering TA support in the areas of customs and tax administration
consistent with its operational plans and requests by country authorities. Assistance was also
provided in improving the external sector statistics. In the financial area, TA concentrated mostly on
improving macroprudential policies, the design of liquidity facility and on IFRS adoption.
Resident Representative: None.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 28, 2014)

ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE (continued)
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The accuracy, timeliness, and publication of economic statistics has improved, but weaknesses in
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payment statistics need to be addressed.
Real Sector: Although the timeliness of real sector data provision has improved, the data are often
subject to sizable revisions. The authorities plan to change the base year of the national accounts to
2007. Preparation started in the second half of 2010 and rebased data should be published in the first
quarter of 2014. The IMF national accounts technical assistance mission conducted in 2010-11 noted
slow progress in expanding coverage of financial activity as well as the overestimation of the deflator
used to calculate the financial services output at constant prices. During 2011-2012, progress was made
in compiling financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) on a monthly basis following
the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), as well as in broadening the coverage of household
output, employment, compensation of employees, and mixed income in informal activities for 2007-2008
due to the progress in the compilation of employment matrices. Quarterly GDP data and the monthly
economic activity index have benefited from the use of monthly VAT records as source data, and from
the correct application of the proportional Denton method for aligning quarterly data to annual data
(reducing further revisions) and ARIMA X-12 for seasonally-adjusting the quarterly series. In addition,
IMF technical assistance has been provided to develop updated producer, export, and import price
indices.
Government finance statistics: Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of fiscal data. Apart
from timeliness, consistency of data related to the transfers between public sector units should be
improved; and the coverage of the public enterprises should be made universal. Since September 2004,
the operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) was excluded from the official definition of
the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on the ACP is only
available in the Annual Report posted in its website (www.pancanal.com) on a fiscal year basis. There is a
need to ensure a consistent and timely flow of ACP statistics on a calendar year basis. Moreover, in 2011,
three public enterprises have been excluded from the NFPS accounts and public debt (Tocumen
International Airport, ETESA, an electricity distribution company, and ENA, the National Highway
company). It would also be necessary to compile and disseminate information on these entities in a
timely fashion. The 2012 decree establishing the Savings Fund of Panama (Fundo Ahorro de Panama, or
FAP) mandated reporting of deferred payment schemes (e.g. turnkey projects) in budget documentation.
The authorities are receiving technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department (STA) to implement
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
conducted a mission on observance of fiscal standards and codes (ROSC) in October 2005. The
authorities, however, cannot elaborate fiscal statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 without a priori
reforming public accounting. The August 2012 CAPTAC report on fiscal statistics for financial
programming also emphasized the need to increase the information and analysis of turnkey projects’
impact on fiscal sustainability. In 2011 through 2013, FAD provided technical assistance in the area of
public accounting, including implementation of government accounting reforms and the practical
application of the accounting policies established in the International Public Sector Accounting

ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE (concluded)
Standards (IPSAS), an important step toward improving fiscal transparency. The financial accouting
system is not prepared to support the recording of transactions and economic events under the accrual
method. The authorities have taken important steps in improving these areas, further work would be
needed to achieve compliance with international best practices. Panama does not report fiscal data to
STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics or the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Panama regularly reports monetary data for depository corporations
using the standardized report forms (SRFs) for publication in the International Financial Statistics.
Panama participated in a regional project for harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in Central
America and the Dominican Republic, supported by CAPTAC. The aim was to facilitate cross-country
comparison and regional analysis. The second stage of the harmonization project developed a work
program to expand the institutional coverage to include other depository corporations and all other
financial corporations (OFCs). The authorities have recently submitted test SRF data for the OFCs, which
are being reviewed by STA. In February 2014, Panama started to report Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) to STA on a regular (quarterly) basis with data beginning on 2005. Data gaps prevent a deeper
analysis of systemic risks as the authorities do not collect adequate data on real estate prices, loan writeoffs, loan-to-value ratios, and leverage indicators for households and corporate.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in foreign trade flows calculations, particularly those involving the
Colon Free Zone, need to be addressed. Substantial changes in the composition of trade flows over the
last decade render the current methodology to estimate volume indices obsolete. Quarterly data are
available with a delay of about one quarter, and are subject to revisions thereafter. Revised estimates in
key trade and investment data may result in substantial revisions of the current account of the balance of
payments. These revisions may reflect improvements in coverage, but they also suggest that there is
room for improvement in quality control procedures. Data on outward FDI and repatriation of profit and
dividends from these investments are only collected from the financial private sector, implying that the
current account deficit and the International Investment Position (IIP) are likely being overestimated, due
to the lack of coverage of outward FDI of the nonfinancial private sector. A survey is being conducted to
collect data on outward FDI of nonfinancial private sector. Quarterly IIP data have been compiled since
2002, and annual data are available since 1998. The definition of international reserves is currently being
revised with TA support from STA, to ensure that the reserve assets reported by the National Bank of
Panama are consistent with those published by the Contraloria, and that they meet the criteria defined in
the international reserves template. STA also recommends that Contraloria should be the only agency in
charge of compiling and disseminating international reserves data. The authorities are conducting
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with a
view to improve external sector data quality in the context of CAPTAC Regional Harmonization Project of
External Sector Statistics (RHPESS).
DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Panama has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2000,
but the metadata need to be updated. Following an SDDS assessment mission conducted by STA in April
2011, and in November 2013, the authorities have a work program aimed at meeting the requirements
for Panama’s subscription to the SDDS. An action plan has been prepared and followed up by
subsequent CAPTAC missions. A data ROSC was published in October 2006.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Panama
On May 9, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Panama.
Panama’s economic performance remains buoyant. Real GDP growth averaged about 8.5 percent
over the past decade, the highest in Latin America, supported by an ambitious public investment
program, and accompanied by strong reduction in unemployment, poverty, and income
inequality. After exceeding 10 percent in 2011–12, growth slowed to 8.4 percent in 2013
reflecting mainly a decline in Colon Free Zone activity and in Canal traffic. Growth is expected
to remain strong over the medium term, as the economy continues to enhance its regional and
global logistics role for the movement of goods, capital, and people. Inflation is moderating, due
to the deceleration of international food and oil prices, but remains resilient and higher than in
major trading partners, owing in part to strong domestic demand. The authorities are in the
process of revising national accounts statistics (the Staff Report is based on the 1996-base
national account statistics, the data available at the time of the staff mission).
The 2013 fiscal deficit was 3 percent of GDP, below the ceiling allowed under the Social and
Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) despite strong public investment. The 2014 fiscal deficit is
expected to remain within the SFRL ceiling (2.7 percent of GDP), taking into account the
expected upward revision to GDP. Strong growth and fiscal discipline contributed to a declining
path of public debt. Efforts have been made to smooth the amortization profile and develop the
domestic capital market. The banking system is generally healthy, with sound performance
indicators, and the authorities have moved proactively to contain risks related to exposures to
Venezuela. The current account deficit remains elevated, reflecting high public and private
investment as well as temporarily weak exports, but is financed mainly by buoyant foreign direct
investment.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The baseline outlook is favorable, with moderate risks. Panama’s extensive external linkages
bring strong economic and financial benefits, but also make the country sensitive to shifts in
global economic and financial conditions. The normalization—and the surrounding
uncertainty—of U.S. monetary policy may expose vulnerabilities, including through higher
interest rates and capital outflows, while other external risks relate to a protracted economic
slowdown in trading partners and persistent payment difficulties in Venezuela. Strong domestic
demand contributes to the risk of overheating: resilient inflationary pressures may feed into wage
dynamics, possibly reducing competitiveness. Additional significant delays in the Canal
expansion would have an adverse impact on output and employment in the short term, and on
exports and fiscal revenues in the medium term. However, strong fundamentals and the ability to
implement countercyclical fiscal policies would help mitigate the impact of these shocks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Panama’s continued robust macroeconomic performance,
underpinned by sustained policy reforms, strong public investment, and private demand.
Directors noted that although the outlook for growth is healthy, there are some signs of domestic
overheating and the current account deficit is elevated. Changes in global economic and financial
conditions could also pose risks. Directors emphasized that continued commitment to strong
macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms will be important to safeguard
against external and domestic shocks, and to support strong and sustainable growth.
Directors welcomed the prudent fiscal policy stance. However, they underscored that fiscal
policy could be tightened to rein in inflationary pressures, and provide a cushion against external
shocks. Furthermore, targeting a fiscal deficit below the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law
(SFRL) ceiling would help reduce the risk of exceeding or revising the deficit ceilings, thereby
strengthening the credibility of the SFRL framework and investors’ confidence. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal reforms to strengthen capacity in budgeting
and public financial management. Completing the implementation of the Single Treasury
Account and establishing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework will be important going
forward.
Directors noted that Panama’s financial sector is generally healthy. Looking ahead, they advised
close monitoring of external positions, credit growth, and the leverage and liquidity positions of
banks. To safeguard financial stability, Directors encouraged swift implementation of the
remaining 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations. They called for further
progress on a well designed liquidity facility for banks to help absorb liquidity shocks, and for
building capacity to monitor systemic risks and to conduct macroprudential policies. Priority
should also be given to further enhancing supervision of banks and non bank financial
institutions.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors highlighted the importance of further enhancing corporate and financial transparency.
They encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to strengthen the anti money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, including implementation of the
recommendations of the AML/CFT assessment report.
Directors agreed that continued structural reforms are necessary to maintain external stability and
competitiveness, reduce poverty, address income inequality, and enhance human capital and
productivity. They encouraged the authorities to further enhance the quality of public education,
increase the availability of vocational training, upgrade skills, and stimulate female labor force
participation. Consideration should also be given to measures to support reallocation of labor
from construction to other economic sectors, once the large infrastructure projects, including the
canal expansion, are completed.
Directors encouraged the authorities to resume efforts toward subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which would help close gaps in data that are critical for
conducting sound macroeconomic policy.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Panama,
Ivan Luis Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director,
and Alfredo Maciá, Advisor to Executive Director
May 7, 2014
1.
The Panamanian authorities thank the IMF staff for their assistance and advice.
Panama’s economic activity remained robust in 2013. Real GDP growth at 8.4 percent1
continued to be one of the highest in Latin America, driven by the Panama Canal
expansion works, large public infrastructure investments, high foreign direct investments
(FDI), and strong domestic demand. Growth is projected to moderate somewhat in 2014,
to around 7.0 percent of GDP, according to the national budget. Total unemployment
remained low at 4.1 percent in August 2013, as estimated by the National Statistics
Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo – INEC).
2.
CPI inflation declined from 4.6 percent at end-2012 to 3.7 percent at end-2013,
favored by lower import prices of fuel and commodities. The current account deficit
reached almost 11.3 percent of GDP in 2013, over a percentage point higher than in 2012.
This reflects mainly imports of capital goods associated to the execution of large public
and private investment projects, as well as the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal.
Large FDI inflows continued to finance the bulk of the current account deficit.
3.
Cautious fiscal policy management took centre stage in the implementation of the
sizable 2013 public investments program. The end-2013 non-financial public sector
(NFPS) fiscal deficit stood at 3 percent of GDP, below the 3.1 percent ceiling established
in the fiscal responsibility law (Ley de Responsabilidad Social Fiscal – LRSF). In mid2013 the fiscal deficit ceiling was changed from 2.8 percent to 3.1 percent of GDP, to
create room for covering costs arising from the floods of end-2012, a natural disaster that
led to the declaration of a state of national emergency. For 2014, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) projects a fiscal deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP, in line with
the limit established in the LRSF. The downward trend of the public debt to GDP ratio
results from Panama’s prudent fiscal policies. The public debt to GDP ratio (excluding
the external debt of the Panama Canal Authority) fell to 36.8 percent at end-2013, from
37.6 percent in 2012 and 42.3 percent in 2009. This trend also reflects Panama’s strong
fundamentals as an investment grade country and the authorities’ commitment to
sustained economic development.
4.
The National Authority for Public Revenue (Autoridad Nacional de Ingresos
Públicos – ANIP) was created in April 2013. Its setting up as an independent tax
administration unit – replacing the General Revenue Office (Dirección General de
Ingresos – DGI) that used to be under the MEF’s structure – brought about strengthened

GDP-related data used in this Buff statement take into account the change in the base year from 1996 to
2007, in accordance with the 2013 Report of the Comptroller General of the Republic released in March 27,
2014.

oversight, enhanced tax collection and a reduction in tax evasion. Based on MEF’s yearend estimates, the NFPS total revenue increased 9.9 percent in 2013 compared to 2012.
5.
Expenditures went up 16.4 percent within the same period, mostly to support
large public infrastructure investments. This has led to a further improvement in the
composition of the overall public expenditure, with the share of capital expenditure
maintaining its upward trend from 31.8 percent in 2009 to 44.4 percent in 2013.
6.
The banking system shows strong performance and stability, according to the
indicators reported by the Superintendence of Banks (Superintendencia de Bancos de
Panamá – SBP). It is well capitalized and liquid, with a capital adequacy ratio for the
system as a whole at 14.8 percent. This is comparable to the 15.6 percent ratio recorded
in the LA5 (Brazil, Chile Colombia, Mexico and Peru), and reflects solid fundamentals
that will help mitigate possible external shocks to the banking system. Non-performing
loans are minimal, slightly above one percent of total loans. Private credit continues to
strongly support real estate, construction, consumption and mining activities.
7.
The authorities have made steadfast progress on the implementation of the 2011
FSAP recommendations. The SBP is implementing risk-based supervision and
strengthening offsite supervision. The Financial Coordination Council (FCC), comprised
of Panama’s financial regulators, is coordinating efforts with financial market institutions
to monitor any potential systemic risks. The authorities have also given priority to the
drafting of a new law on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT), strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and
developing the framework for a liquidity facility. Technical assistance (TA) from the
Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is underway to review the
AML/CFT legislation. In addition, the US Treasury Department is assisting Panama in
strengthening the FIU, with the aim of matching best practices of transparency for
financial services. All legislation related to the above actions should be in place by end2015.
8.
The authorities are committed to improving corporate and financial transparency.
There is significant support in the country to move forward with the amendments to law
47 of August, 2013 to accelerate implementation of bearer-shares registration. The
network of double taxation agreements (DTA) has been expanded and now encompasses
18 countries with which Panama has signed a DTA to date. Negotiations are in progress
with Taiwan and Vietnam and about to start with Hong Kong. Treaties for the exchange
of fiscal information have been finalized with Germany and are in progress with Japan
and Australia.
9.
We are of the view that the staff report does not to fully recognize the progress
that Panama has made and places undue emphasis on AML/CFT issues. This emphasis
may not be in accordance with the Fund’s policy on the treatment of AML/CFT in

surveillance. According to this year’s review of the Fund’s strategy, these issues “should
be discussed in the context of surveillance when they undermine a member’s balance of
payments and domestic stability, or the effective operation of the international monetary
system”. The second does not apply, given the size of Panama’s economy. There is also
no evidence that AML/CFT issues undermine the country’s balance of payments and
domestic stability, as can be inferred from the rather convoluted discussion of risks in
paragraph 19. In any case, what matters is that the authorities have reaffirmed and
confirmed by actions their commitment to prevent money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Panama has undergone a comprehensive evaluation on AML/CFT and has
authorized publication of the Detailed Assessment Report (DAR) and the Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) in February.
