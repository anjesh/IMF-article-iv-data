IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Niger
On January 23, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Niger. The Board also approved a new three-year Extended
Credit Facility Arrangement for Niger; a press release on this was issued separately.
Niger’s macroeconomic outcomes continue to be impacted by security and humanitarian
shocks, weak commodity prices, and the reduction of trade flows to neighboring countries.
For 2016, growth is projected at 4.6 percent, slightly higher than the 3.5 percent recorded in
2015, but still only just above the rate of population growth. Growth was driven by a strong
harvest that also resulted in lower domestic food prices with consumer price inflation remaining
subdued at around 1 percent a year, well below the West African Economic Monetary Union
(WAEMU) convergence criterion.
Fiscal revenues have underperformed in 2016, reflecting weaknesses in tax and customs
administrations, and difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunications sectors, as well as
lower trade flows with Nigeria. Consequently, expenditures have been held below budget
levels, while protecting priority spending.
The medium-term economic outlook is favorable, but remains subject to substantial external
and domestic risks. Growth is projected to increase to 5.2 percent in 2017, and further to
average 6.0 percent during 2018-21, mainly as a result of the expansion of the extractive
industries sector and an increase in public and private investments. Key risks include
negative externalities of regional conflicts, vulnerability to natural disasters, and the
economic downturn in the sub-region.
Executive Board Assessment2
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Executive Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
advancing the reform agenda despite persistent security concerns, the regional economic
slowdown, and weak commodity prices. Directors noted the progress made in strengthening
debt management, the business climate, and key social indicators. While the medium term
outlook is favorable, challenges and risks remain. Going forward, Directors highlighted the
need for strong commitment to the Fund supported program which supports the authorities’
Economic Development Document aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic framework,
while creating fiscal space for the needed infrastructure and social spending. Progress on
structural reforms will be key to reducing poverty and creating jobs.
Directors welcomed the approval of the 2017 budget which appropriately takes into account
capacity constraints and sets a realistic basis for fiscal consolidation over the medium term.
They highlighted the importance of improving revenue mobilization by broadening the tax
base, including by reducing tax exemptions, and strengthening the efficiency of tax and
customs administration. Directors also emphasized the importance of prioritizing public
spending and enhancing expenditure control and liquidity management, while strengthening
resilience to natural disasters.
Directors considered it important to strengthen capital project and debt management
framework. They welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to undertake a prudent
debt policy, while improving project evaluation based on cost effectiveness, and encouraged
them to exercise caution with regard to scaling up debt financed investments. Strengthening
the transparent management of natural resources and the public private partnership
framework will also be vital.
Directors underscored that financial sector deepening will play an important role in making
growth more inclusive. They encouraged the authorities to step up the implementation of
their Financial Inclusion Strategy and the National Financial Sector Development Strategy.
At the same time, banking supervision should be strengthened in line with regional
agreements.
Directors emphasized that giving priority to gender equity, disaster risk management, and
harnessing the demographic dividend is critical for achieving Niger’s medium term growth
potential, creating jobs, and reducing poverty. They welcomed recent initiatives in these
areas and urged further actions, especially by passing swiftly the law on gender.

Press Release No. 17/18
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 24, 2017

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$134.04 Million under the ECF Arrangement for
Niger
On January 23, 2017 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
approved a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)1 for Niger for
an amount equivalent to SDR 98.7 million (about US$134.04 million, or 75 percent of
Niger’s quota) in support of the authorities’ national plan for economic development.
The new program aims to enhance macroeconomic stability and foster high and equitable
growth, boost incomes and create jobs, while strengthening the foundations for sustainable
development. The program will build on the lessons from the previous ECF arrangements.
The Executive Board’s decision will enable an immediate disbursement of SDR 14.1 million
(about US$19.15 million). The remaining amounts will be phased over the duration of the
program, subject to semi-annual reviews.
During the same meeting, the Board also concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation. A
separate press release will be issued shortly.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Niger, Deputy Managing Director Mr.
Mitsuhiro Furusawa, and Acting Chair, said:
“Niger has been able to maintain macroeconomic stability despite major security challenges,
continued low oil and uranium prices, and regional economic slowdown. Growth has
improved and inflation remains subdued, well below the WAEMU convergence criterion.
Significant progress was made under the 2012-16 Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
Arrangement, including in strengthening public financial management, debt management and
deepening the financial sector, but the impact of the adverse shocks, policy slippages and
weak capacity limited the improvement in broader development indicators. Niger remains
one of the least developed countries with numerous social and development challenges.
1

The ECF is a lending arrangement that provides sustained program engagement over the medium to long term
in case of protracted balance of payments problems.

2

“The new Arrangement under the ECF aims to sustain macroeconomic stability, make
growth more inclusive, and reduce poverty, in line with the government’s strategy as laid out
in the Economic Development Document. Specific focus is given to enhancing fiscal space
and further improving public financial management and the efficiency of spending to
facilitate the attainment of Niger’s development goals, in particular to finance infrastructure
and social spending.
“The medium-term economic outlook is favorable, underpinned by improved agricultural
production and a pick-up in natural resource exports. Nevertheless, to address the persisting
challenges and risks, policy priorities ahead need to focus on preserving fiscal and debt
sustainability. A strong reform agenda anchored on more efficient investment, improved
business climate, more inclusive financial development, and a comprehensive strategy for
addressing gender issues as well as harnessing the demographic dividend will be critical.”
Annex
Recent Economic Developments
Niger’s overall macroeconomic performance has remained satisfactory in 2016, despite the
security and humanitarian shocks, the unfavorable commodity prices, and the reduction of
trade flows to neighboring countries. Growth is projected to increase to 4.6 percent in 2016
from 3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a strong 2016-17 crop year and despite continued
weakness in the oil and mining sectors. Inflation would be contained at 1.1 percent in 2016.
Budget execution has been impacted by lower-than-targeted revenue collection partly due to
unfavorable developments in commodity sectors and continued economic problems in
neighboring countries. At end-June 2016, most fiscal targets other than for government
revenue were however met. Progress was made in implementing structural reforms, albeit
with delays.
In response to a larger shortfall of revenue collection in the second half of 2016, the
authorities curtailed commitments on nonpriority expenditures for the last quarter of 2016.
This measure enacted by the inter-ministerial budget regulation committee will help avoid
the accumulation of payments arrears and the resort to domestic financing.
The economic outlook for the medium-term is favorable, but remains subject to substantial
external and domestic risks. Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 5.2 percent in 2017,
driven by agriculture and an expected pick-up in oil production. Inflation is expected to
remain contained below 2 percent. Real GDP growth is expected to average 6.1 percent
during 2018-21, mainly as a result of the expansion of the extractive industries sector and an
increase in public and private investments. Inflation is expected to remain below the 3

3
percent West African Economic Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criterion. Key
risks include negative externalities of regional conflicts, vulnerability to natural disasters, and
the economic turmoil in the sub-region
Program Summary
Building on progress made under previous arrangements (see Press Release No. 12/90), the
new three-year program will support the broad objectives of the Economic Development
Document and address impediments to enhanced macroeconomic stability, higher growth
and job creation. The main objectives of the ECF-supported program are to maintain
macroeconomic stability while creating fiscal space for infrastructure, accommodating
permanently elevated security spending, and enhancing social spending. Preserving
macroeconomic stability remains essential for attaining policy objectives aimed at reducing
poverty, together with an improved business climate and enhanced financial access, all of
which would contribute to the diversification of the economy and its enhanced resilience.
Fiscal policies will aim at broadening the tax base—to reduce dependence on volatile natural
resource revenues—strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration, and
improving tax collection. Expenditure management will focus on prioritizing public spending
and enhancing expenditure control, including through the full implementation of the Treasury
Single Account (TSA) helped by a strong framework for liquidity management to prevent
domestic arrears accumulation and contain rising debt levels.
Background
Niger, which became a member of the IMF on April 14, 1963, has an IMF quota of SDR
131.6 million.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic growth is estimated to have increased to 4.6 percent in 2016 from
3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a strong 2016-17 crop year and despite continued
weakness in the oil and mining sectors, adverse spillovers from the economic downturn
in Nigeria and continued elevated security threats. Inflation remains subdued.
Notwithstanding recent macroeconomic gains, Niger still ranks last on the UN’s Human
Development Index with growth barely above the estimated rate of population growth
(4.1 percent a year). President Issoufou secured a second term in the presidential and
legislative elections held in February-March 2016, with the new administration
reaffirming a focus on reinvigorating growth to create more employment opportunities,
including by addressing infrastructure gaps, while strengthening food security.
Article IV Consultation. Discussions focused on the key components of Niger’s
inclusive growth agenda, in particular: (i) reducing gender inequality; (ii) improving
prevention and response to natural disasters; and (iii) harnessing the demographic
dividend.
Request for an Extended Credit Facility arrangement. In the attached letter of intent,
the authorities request a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
in the amount of SDR 98.7 million (75 percent of quota) in support of their medium-term
economic program as described in the government’s Economic Development Document
(EDD). While preserving macroeconomic stability remains a key objective, the program
design acknowledges the protracted balance of payment needs and the likely continued
elevated security spending and therefore the need to enhance fiscal space to ensure that
development objectives can be attained. Fiscal space is to be enhanced by broadening the
tax base and strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Expenditure
management focuses on prioritizing public spending and enhancing expenditure control
and liquidity management. A strong reform agenda buttresses the program, with the
growth agenda anchored on more efficient investment, as well as an improved business
climate and more inclusive financial development.

NIGER

Outlook and risks. The medium-term outlook remains favorable despite uncertainty as
to when major new projects in the uranium and crude oil sectors will come on-stream.
There also remain significant regional security risks, as well as risks of adverse economic
contagion from neighboring Nigeria. New borrowing will need to be managed
prudently, as the DSA indicates that Niger is already at a moderate risk of debt distress.
Staff views. Staff supports the conclusion of the Article IV Consultation and the
authorities’ request for a new ECF-supported program. Approval by the Executive Board
will result in a disbursement of SDR 14.1 million.

CONTEXT
1.
Niger faces major development and security challenges, but the political situation is
stable. Despite significant improvements in social indicators over the last two decades, more than
half of the population lives below the poverty line of less than US$1.90 (PPP-adjusted) a day
(Text Figure 1a). The economy is still dominated by subsistence agriculture, which is hampered by
frequent floods and droughts, and the prevalence of rudimentary techniques that hold back
productivity. Since 2012, heightened armed hostilities across Niger’s borders have caused major
humanitarian and economic crises. Such hostilities periodically claim lives, destroy property and
infrastructure, disrupt domestic production and trade flows, and have resulted in an estimated
350,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (Text Figure 1b). As a result, security-related
spending rose from 1.5 to 5.2 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2015, leading to higher budget
deficits and diversion of spending from social priorities.

2.
The authorities have advanced their reform agenda, drawing on recommendations
from the 2014 Article IV Consultation and in the context of the ECF Arrangement that expires
at end-December 2016. In line with staff’s advice to adhere to a prudent debt management policy,
the authorities launched the process of strengthening the debt management framework including
by establishing an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Debt Management. This Committee is headed by
a permanent secretariat which coordinates debt policy across all ministries and ensures that every
debt contracted is consistent with debt sustainability. Progress has also been made on improving
the business climate, as Niger moved up from a rank of 176th out of 189 countries in the 2014 World
Bank Doing Business Report to 150th out of 190 countries on the 2017 Report. However, headway

has been slow in customs and tax administration reforms, controlling spending and improving
budget management.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
3.
Growth increased in 2016, but barely above population growth (Table 1). Economic
growth is estimated to have risen to 4.6 percent in 2016 (below the earlier projection of 5.2 percent),
compared with 3.5 percent in 2015, helped by a good agricultural season and an expansion of crop
irrigation that boosted agricultural production by nearly 8 percent. However, the resumption of oil
production was slower than expected and government spending was constrained by lower revenue,
in addition to adverse security developments, and the economic slowdown in neighboring countries
affecting the services sector.
4.
Inflation remains well below the West African Economic Monetary Union’s (WAEMU)
“three percent” convergence criterion (Table 2). Reflecting the good 2016-17 harvest and the
government’s food security programs that play a stabilizing role, domestic food prices declined and thus
consumer price inflation remained subdued in 2015 and through October 2016 at around 1 percent
annualized. Weak oil prices further contributed to price stability (Figure 2).
5.
The overall fiscal balance improved in the first half of 2016, with all end-June
performance criteria (PC) met. But deepening revenue shortfalls at end-September 2016 have
forced a scaling back in expenditures (Tables 2 and 3).

difficulties in the mining, oil, and
telecommunication sectors, as well
as lower trade flows with Nigeria
(30 percent decline in total trade
compared to end-September 2015)
driven mostly by security threats,
lower commodity prices and
regional spillovers. While revenue
underperformance was minor up to
end-June 2016 (total revenue was
short of the program target by
0.3 percent of GDP), by
end-September 2016, the shortfall
had widened to 2 percent of GDP, with revenues 14.5 percent below the level of end-September
2015 (Text Figure 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER



Revenue mobilization also suffered from weak non-agriculture activities in 2015 and lower-thanexpected recovery in 2016, partly due to the impact of the 2016 elections and lower consumer
confidence. The shortfall in corporate taxes was estimated at CFAF 20.5 billion in 2016 because
advances paid in 2015 were higher than assessed taxes in 2016, permitting more deductions
than projected. In addition, the depreciation of the Naira induced a diversion to the domestic
parallel market of refined petroleum products.1 This diversion and depreciation contributed also
to the overall decline of exports and re-exports to Nigeria, and to higher imports from Nigeria.
As a result, at end-September 2016, VAT collections fell short by CFAF 30 billion, the special tax
on petroleum products by CFAF 5.4 billion, and customs taxes by CFAF 26.2 billion.



At end-June, domestically financed spending was under-executed relative to program targets,
resulting in a basic balance in line with the program target. The government also cleared all
end-2014 arrears. But at end-September, security and social spending pressures led to a
deterioration of fiscal outcomes.



End-September outcomes suggested the need for a downward revision of the end-2016 revenue
target to reflect a projected shortfall estimated at CFAF 114.5 billion (2.6 percent of GDP). To offset
it, the government took strong measures to contain spending by freezing planned non-priorityexpenditures (including CFAF 48.2 billion in current spending), while safeguarding salaries, debt
service payments, and security spending.2 The increase in the basic balance deficit was limited to
CFAF 24.3 billion and to be financed domestically by CFAF 14.3 billion and by a slightly slower
pace of reduction of domestic arrears.

6.
Broad money in the nine months through September 2016 increased by 9 percent,
which is in line with estimates of economic activity (Table 4). Official net foreign assets decreased
by 20 percent compared to end 2015, as the external budget support envisaged for the second half
of the year will only be disbursed at the end of the year. Credit to the private sector also increased
by 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2016, a deceleration relative to the previous year. Credit to
the government increased by CFAF 98 billion from end 2015 as the government, faced with lower
foreign support, turned to domestic financing.
7.
The current account deficit is projected to decrease from 18.1 percent of GDP in 2015
to 15.4 percent in 2016 (Table 5). This reflects a reduction in imports that more than offsets the fall
in goods exports due to low international prices for uranium and petroleum products, and the
economic slowdown in Nigeria. At end-2015, gross official reserves remained at a comfortable level
of 4.6 months of import of goods and services projected for 2016.

Spending cuts were mostly related to office supplies, mission travel, maintenance, renovations, and infrastructure

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Niger’s overall economic outlook remains positive. Growth is projected to rise to
5.2 percent in 2017, and to average 5.4 percent during 2017-19, driven by the expansion of irrigated
agriculture under the national food security program (3N Initiative). The main natural resource
projects—an oil pipeline through Chad and the Imouraren uranium mine—are now expected to be
completed in 2020 and 2021, respectively, providing for a boost to growth beginning in 2020. The
current account deficit is projected to rise to about an average of 18.6 percent of GDP in 2017-19
driven by capital and intermediate goods imports associated with FDI and the government’s
investment program. Exports are expected to improve from higher gold production and agricultural
products boosted by investments under the recently signed compact between Niger and the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Inflation is expected to remain subdued at about 2 percent.
Gross official reserves are projected to remain stable at 4 months of import of goods and services.
9.
The exchange rate remains broadly in line with model-based estimates of fundamentals,
but broader competitiveness indicators point to major challenges (Text Table 1). Consistent with
the regional 2016 WAEMU external stability assessment, the EBA-lite methodology suggests that the
real effective exchange rate (REER) during 2015 was broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals.
But the recent Naira’s depreciation could lead to a weakening of Niger’s competitiveness. In addition,
broader competitiveness indicators, such as the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators, highlight
significant structural gaps in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes
(Background note on External Stability Assessment).

The current account elasticity used (-0.63) is based on the median trade elasticity for small countries reported in Tokarick (2010).
In the initial estimates, the underlying-CA is the CA in 2015 for the CA-model and the underlying-CA is the CA in 2020 for the ESmodel with the objective of stabilizing the NIIP at -79.6 percent of GDP consistent with the CA-norm of -9.4 percent of GDP
obtained in the CA-model.



The alternative scenario uses a lower current account that discounts for FDI driven investments and the large public investments.

10.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside (Table 13). Lingering security concerns
could discourage foreign investment, disrupt domestic production, and force a further
reprioritization of expenditures towards security. Persistent weak commodity prices could lead to

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

further delays in implementing the resource projects underpinning growth prospects. On the upside,
a rebound in uranium and oil prices or a pickup in the Nigerian economy would boost Niger’s fiscal
space and growth.
11.
To illustrate some of these risks, staff developed two alternative scenarios. The
scenarios simulate security and terms of trade shocks (Figure 5).3 In both scenarios, staff assume that
exports from the new resource projects will be delayed by one year as a result of the shock. The
simulation results show, in 2017, a decline in GDP growth of 0.3 to 0.8 percentage points, and a
deterioration of the current account of 0.8 to 1.7 percent of GDP, and a fall in reserves. The fiscal
stance would also deteriorate as revenue would fall and security spending expand. From a DSA
perspective, while under the security shock the debt ratios would remain under their respective
thresholds, the large impact of the terms of trade shock on exports would cause the debt-to-export
ratio to exceed the 150 percent threshold by 15.4 percent in 2017. In addition, based on earlier work,
staff found that climatic shocks4 have a large and persistent impact on Niger’s economic activity, but
with limited impact on consumer prices, inter alia due to the government’s mitigating policies in
place (IMF, 2012). Also, staff estimates that a natural disaster causing losses of 0.5 percent of GDP
would have a weak fiscal impact but could be magnified in terms of economic growth and the
current account deficit.
12.
Niger has been adversely impacted by spillovers from its main trading partner, Nigeria
(Box 1). The spread of terrorist attacks into Niger remains a key risk. The economic downturn in Nigeria,
together with the sharp exchange rate depreciation and restrictions on access to foreign exchange since
late 2014, have contributed to Niger’s conventional exports to Nigeria falling by 16 percent in 2015, and
re-exports by 17 percent resulting in significant customs revenue losses. Also, at end-June 2016 exports
to Nigeria had fallen by 45.4 percent compared to end-June 2015.5 Niger’s growth prospects are also
vulnerable to spillovers from neighboring Chad, as the construction of the crude oil pipeline connection
depends on security conditions there.

In the security shock scenario, staff consider an increase of security-related spending equivalent to 1 percent of GDP
that affects trade and other economic activities. In the terms of trade shock scenario, staff envisage a 25 percent
decrease of the baseline oil and uranium prices in 2017 and going forward.

informal trade in agriculture products, livestock,
and fuel products.
The economic slowdown in Nigeria following the collapse in international oil prices in late 2014 has resulted in a
sharp reduction in incomes and a large exchange rate depreciation (coupled with a shortage of foreign exchange)
that have greatly reduced Nigeria’s demand for Niger’s products. In value terms, Niger’s conventional exports to
Nigeria fell by 16 percent in 2015, while the much larger volume of transit merchandises and re-exports fell by
17 percent. This trend continued during 2016 with re-exports falling by a further 15 percent, and export falling by
45.4 percent on an annual basis, at end-June, leading to a large loss in customs revenue. In the case of livestock,
trade flows have reversed with Niger periodically importing from Nigeria. Total imports from Nigeria have
increased by 36.6 percent in 2016, mostly primary and locally manufactured goods that generate little tax due to
regional agreements.

ARTICLE IV POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ADVANCING THE
GROWTH AGENDA
Discussions focused on some key aspects of Niger’s inclusive growth agenda, in particular: (i) reducing
gender inequality; (ii) managing the impact of natural disasters; and (iii) harnessing Niger’s
demographic dividend. There was full agreement on the need to address these issues within a timebound strategic agenda and from a long-term perspective buttressed on scaling up investment in
education and capacity development.

A. Reducing Gender Inequality
13.
Gender inequality in Niger is among the highest in the world and policies to improve
women’s conditions are lagging (Background Paper on Gender Inequality in Niger). Some progress
in women’s welfare indicators has been achieved during the implementation of the Programme de
Développement Economique et Social (PDES), that sought to attain the Millennium Development Goals

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

(Text Figure 2). However, Niger has the seventh lowest score in the world on the United Nation’s
Gender Inequality Index (GII) and also ranks at the bottom of the OECD’s Social Institutions and
Gender Index (SIGI). Poverty and social norms contribute to establish patterns of early marriage and a
high fertility rate that take many women away from school and limits their participation in the
workforce. Creating equal opportunities for women could contribute to boost development and
growth outcomes, as gender inequality in Niger entails substantial economic costs6 (Text Figure 3).

The authorities consider gender inequality a major policy issue, and noted several
affirmative action policies in recent years and plans going forward. The adoption of a National
Gender Policy in 2008 laid out a four-pronged strategy: (i) supporting teenagers’ school enrolment to
discourage early marriages; (ii) providing guidance and maternal support to teenagers; (iii) expanding
opportunities for revenue generating activities and improved access to finance; and (iv) promoting
public awareness by strengthening partnership with non-governmental organizations and opinion
leaders. The authorities also highlighted Niger’s gender promoting institutions: the Ministry of Women
Promotion, dedicated to providing vocational education and finance to women, and the National
Gender Observatory. Also, through regional collaboration with neighboring countries (Burkina Faso,
Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Mali, and Mauritania), the authorities are implementing programs aimed at
empowering women and adolescent girls and at providing better access to quality reproductive health
services.
15.
Staff agreed on the relevance of these policies and urged the authorities to continue
to address gender-based legal restrictions. Staff acknowledged Niger’s socio-cultural context,
while stressing the economic opportunity costs of not enabling women to fully participate in the

labor force because of legal gender-based restrictions. Staff noted that removing restrictions on
ownership and inheritance of assets would provide women with access to collateral, as well as
removing restrictions on women opening bank accounts would promote women’s inclusion in the
financial system and support small business entrepreneurship. Thus, drawing on other country
experiences, staff urged the authorities to pursue proven economic, legal, and institutional reforms
such as improved access to finance and revenue generating activities that improve income
opportunities for women. Also staff called for increased opportunities for women to enter the formal
sector through enhanced training programs.

B. Preventing and Managing Natural Disasters
16.
More frequent natural disasters periodically inflict substantial economic and social
losses in Niger (Background Paper on Managing and Preventing Natural Disasters, Text Figure 4).
Such disasters are linked to geographical conditions, climate change and high population growth.
Dependence on rain-fed agriculture based on rudimentary technology has left Niger vulnerable to
droughts and locust plagues that result in periodic food shortages. Floods also continue to cause
significant damage in riverside communities, claiming lives and properties. Recent food crises (2005
and 2010) showed that a timely response coordinated through monitoring system (Early Warning
System-EWS) could mitigate the impact of basic cereal shortages.

donors highlighted the effectiveness of the framework, indicating that it was strengthened by
lessons from the 2005 and 2010 food crises.7
18.
Staff concurred that existing contingent plans and the 3N Initiative were
commendable achievements, but urged the authorities to improve institutional coordination.
The disaster prevention and related risk management framework and the recent investments in
agricultural irrigation and access, helped to reduce significantly the impact of natural disasters and
thus improved food security. Staff urged building on the policies under the 3N Initiative’s
investment plan for 2016-20 and the recently signed Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC). Staff
stressed that the information system under the early warning system could be expanded and the
geographical coverage of the disaster management framework extended. Furthermore, staff
highlighted the importance of coordination of all agencies involved in the framework to improve the
response system.8

C. Harnessing the Demographic Dividend
19.
Niger has the world’s fastest growing population, offering a prospective demographic
dividend that can be captured with well-designed policies (Background Note on Harnessing the
Demographic Dividend in Niger: Opportunities and Challenges). The significant decline in the mortality
rate indicates that Niger has started its demographic transition. However, with the highest fertility rate
in the world of 7.6 children per woman, Niger’s population growth rate has accelerated to 4.1 percent
a year. The resulting young and growing labor force bodes well for economic growth, but adequate
policies are needed to provide education and jobs for the youth to capture potential demographic
dividend expected from 2020. Current projections suggest that the dividend could be low in terms of
income per capita gains, but would last beyond 2100. Until then, the share of the working age
population will be lower and the dependency ratio higher than the average levels reached by other
regions that have already enjoyed large demographic dividends (Text Figure 5).
20.
The authorities showed strong commitment to seizing the demographic transition
opportunities, but foresee pressing and long-term challenges. To that end, they have been
implementing policies to reduce the fertility rate, promote vocational education, and create more
job opportunities. To reduce fertility, they have adopted a bottom-up approach (focusing on local
communities) which, they noted, has proven effective in overcoming to some extent the resistance
of religious leaders. Specific actions include: (i) launching in 2012 of informal education venues
(“école des maris”), intended to promote and facilitate family planning through increased
involvement of husbands; and (ii) initiating in November 2015 the Sahel Women's Empowerment
and Demographic Dividend project (SWEDD), supported by the World Bank and the United Nations
The authorities informed that Niger subscribed to Africa Risk Capacity (ARC), a sovereign drought insurance for
African Union member countries.
7

In addition to the DNPGCCA and 3N Initiative, ad hoc structures were set up for specific missions; a Ministry in
charge of Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management was created in May 2016. The authorities indicated that
coordination issues will be addressed under the 2014-18 National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy (SNRRC) currently
being revised with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

Population Fund. The priorities of enhancing vocational education and expanding job creation are
identified in the EDD through the implementation of the Sectoral Program for Education and
Training Development project (PSEF 2014-24). Another key challenge is ensuring quality universal
education for all Nigeriens as education indicators remain low. To speed up job creation for
graduates of vocational schools, the business environment is being improved to stimulate private
sector initiative (see ¶ 39).

21.
Staff welcomed the measures taken so far to harness the expected demographic
dividend, but called for better coordination and greater priority to vocational education and
economic diversification. Staff noted that the existence of multiple institutions mandated to
address demographic challenges, could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources and stressed
the need for better coordination. Staff also urged for enhanced prioritization of investment in
human capital, with the goal of improving women education and enhancing vocational education to
ensure the development of a more gender balanced and skilled workforce. Also, based on other
countries’ experience, staff showed that strong policies to curb population growth could shorten the
duration of the demographic dividend window, and increase its size. With the goal of creating the
needed jobs for the more than 250,000 young expected to join the labor force each year, staff called
for the improvement of the business environment, sustained modernization of agriculture through
the 3N Initiative, and leveraging resource revenues to promote economic diversification.

THE NEW ECF ARRANGEMENT: PRESERVING
SUSTAINABILITY WHILE ENHANCING INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
The ECF-supported program is anchored on the government’s development strategy as set out in its
Economic Development Document (EDD). With fiscal space likely to remain constrained over the medium
term and security- and refugee-related spending likely to remain elevated, a successor ECF-supported
policy framework is considered critical for sound policy implementation by both the government and its
international partners who provide 60 percent of total budget financing.
22.
The new ECF program seeks to build on lessons from previous arrangements (Annex 1 on
Niger: Ex-Post Peer-Reviewed Assessment). Previous programs have, despite substantial adverse
exogenous shocks, preserved macroeconomic stability while enabling progress with social and
development indicators. There were, however, frequent slippages in performance resulting in delayed
reviews. This was in part due to the government’s inability to respond promptly to the shocks that
often resulted in revenue shortfalls and, given weak public financial management, the incurrence of
domestic arrears. There were also delays in implementing structural reforms.
23.
The new program would support progress towards the broad objectives of the EDD,
while building on progress and challenges in reducing poverty under the PDES:


Achievements and challenges. Niger’s development strategy under the ECF 2012-16—as laid out
in the government’s PDES—helped to preserve macro-economic stability and to sustain an
inclusive growth process. Under the PDES, the poverty rate declined from 48.2 percent in 2011 to
45.4 percent in 2014. Food security indicators improved noticeably as a result of the 3N Initiative.
Niger’s educational system and health indicators showed significant strides, with primary school
enrollment rising and under-five mortality falling. Remaining challenges revolve around:
(i) improving the income level of households; (ii) boosting resilience of the communities faced with
frequent disasters through appropriate food policies and strategies; (iii) financing of agriculture
and infrastructure; and (iv) reinforcing best practices, with the aim of consolidating the proper
functioning of public administration and delivery of public goods.



The PDES’ successor, the EDD, laid out its objectives for 2016-19 building on the
government’s long-term economic and social programs (Renaissance II, and Niger Vision 2035)
and on the achievements and challenges of Niger’s PDES. The EDD aims first at further
enhancing the macroeconomic environment to achieve accelerated growth and meet the dual
objectives of improving incomes and job creation, while strengthening the foundations for
sustainable development. The EDD estimates that annual growth of 7 percent is needed to
achieve a significant sustained reduction in poverty and unemployment; and while the average
rate of growth during the PDES 2012-15 was 6.6 percent, it was highly volatile, limiting its impact
on reducing poverty.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NIGER

24.
The main objectives of the ECF-supported program are to maintain macroeconomic
stability while creating fiscal space for infrastructure, for permanently elevated security
spending, and for enhanced social spending:


Preserving macroeconomic stability remains essential for attaining policy objectives aimed at
reducing poverty and enhancing inclusive growth, while preserving debt sustainability by
undertaking a prudent debt policy which limits non-concessional borrowing.



Broadening the tax base—to reduce dependence on volatile natural resource revenues—while
strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration, and improving tax collection.
This will go hand in hand with improving governance in revenue generating agencies and with
enhancing capacity through training supported by technical assistance.



Prioritizing public spending and improving expenditure control, including through the full
implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) helped by a strong framework for liquidity
management to prevent domestic arrears accumulation.



Diversifying the economy away from uranium and oil by promoting private sector,
entrepreneurship, with an improved business climate and enhanced financial access to create
jobs for Niger’s fast growing population.

A. Fiscal Policy
25.
The 2017 fiscal program envisages a modest expansion in the expenditure envelope,
compared to 2016, to provide space for priority spending. This would entail an increased deficit
of the basic balance to 4.9 percent of GDP, compared to a projected 4.4 percent of GDP in 2016
(MEFP, ¶ 30 to 35),9 (Text Table 2).10


Total revenues would increase by 0.8 percent of GDP, driven by a rise of 0.6 percent of GDP in tax
revenue from a higher VAT taxes (0.5 percent of GDP) which have significant scope for efficiency gains
both at the tax and customs administration, where personnel changes were recently made.



Spending will reflect social priorities in the EDD11 in the health, education, and public infrastructure
sectors. Domestically financed expenditures will increase by 1.5 percent of GDP, relative to the
projected 2016 outcome, driven by interest payments and priority sector investments.

The expenditure envelope already reached a high level under the 2015 budget execution with spending slippages
as most investment planned were executed in advance and heightened security spending as the military personnel
was strengthened.
9

Large domestically funded capital spending in the draft 2017 budget priorities: infrastructure (54 percent); security
(22 percent); and rural development and reconstruction of major cities, including school and health facilities (18 percent).
10

The priorities established in the new development strategy contained in the EDD are: (i) security of properties and
persons; (ii) urban, village, and farming water supply; (iii) continuation of the 3N Initiative and food security;
(iv) infrastructure and energy; and (v) education and health.
11

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Financing would be sourced from donors and additional regional borrowing. Budget support is
projected at CFAF 92.4 billion comprising both grants and highly concessional loans (MEFP, ¶ 36).

3

The financing gap is calculated after accounting for budget support from traditional donors and the IMF ECF financing.

26.

Over the medium term, the authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation to
achieve the WAEMU convergence criterion of a deficit on the overall balance of no more
than 3 percent of GDP:



Revenues. Significant receipts from natural resource projects are expected to materialize once
the projects come on stream from 2020 and these will enable large-scale investments to address
Niger’s massive social and development needs. In the interim, and given the regular adverse
shocks, the authorities agreed that greater emphasis needed to be placed on non-resource
sector revenues.



Fiscal space and program targets. Assuming only a modest pickup in revenues during the
program period, and with security spending likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future,
the program will accommodate continuing high fiscal deficits in 2017-18. Subsequently, as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NIGER

revenues expand, it was agreed that fiscal consolidation be stepped up as to converge toward
the 3 percent of GDP overall deficit anchor for WAEMU member countries that would be
consistent with placing debt on a declining path. Staff encouraged the authorities to reach
understandings with the WAEMU Commission on a slight deferment of the budgetary
convergence criterion.
27.
Streamlining tax exemptions will be important to limit medium-term revenues losses
(MEFP, ¶ 37 to 40). Over the last five years, tax exemptions have become sizeable, reaching about
CFAF 80 billion in 2015 (1.7 percent of GDP) and CFAF 150 billion in 2015 (4.5 percent of GDP) for
tax and customs revenues respectively. Thus going forward, the authorities are committed to bring
tax exemptions currently under the Investment Code in line with best practices by reducing their
number and streamlining their scope. To that end, a comprehensive review of the different
allowances will lay out the necessary steps to combine overlapping fiscal advantages in sectorspecific codes into the customs and tax codes.
28.
Under the program, part of the fiscal space would be used to advance the inclusive
growth agenda. In line with the broader strategy defined in the EDD, the authorities are committed
to using part of the increased fiscal space under the new program to strengthen resilience to
disasters and address issues in the areas of gender and demographics. Indeed, disasters affect
longer term development through the damage of physical and human capital. On gender, while
there has been strides in empowering women through education during the implementation of the
PDES, gender inequality continues to lag. Accordingly, pro-poor spending is planned to increase by
36 percent in 2017 (Table 7).

B.

Structural Reforms

29.
A strong reform agenda would support the achievement of program objectives. A set
of priority reform measures has been identified, drawing on recent FAD technical assistance. These
measures would address past slippages in revenue and spending, and the broader issues with
implementation of PFM and revenue administration reforms during the previous program.

Tax and Customs Administration
30.
The program steps up efforts to strengthen revenue collection agencies (MEFP, ¶ 41 to
52). It targets an increase in revenues to 17.5 percent of GDP by 2019, after which the anticipated
increases in natural resource revenues would materialize. A comprehensive reform program is
already underway, drawing on technical assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
and AFTRIAC-West to address capacity constraints (Box 2).

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Box 2. Niger: Revenue Mobilization and Liquidity Management
A strategy is in place to modernize customs administration while strengthening transparency and
governance, with a view to enhancing performance (MEFP, ¶ 42-45). Some operations are being
contracted out to enhance efficiency. The finalization of the electronic inter-connection of all the customs
offices will be key to combat fraud. The deployment of ASYCUDA World Software supported by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to all main offices not covered so far will pave the way for
electronic customs transit, helping to broaden the tax base. With the introduction of tax identification numbers
for all importers, the customs office will be able to perform risk based tax audits. Also the customs office is
deepening its collaboration with the customs of Benin and Togo.
Tax administration reforms aim at broadening the tax base and strengthening staff capacity through
training. Reforms are supported by FAD technical assistance as well AFRITAC-West and focus mainly on
continuing modernizing the management of tax administration’s operations through the improvement of
tax collection, and the decentralization of the tax audit and control functions (MEFP, ¶ 46-51). To that end,
the tax office will expand the competency of the large enterprises Directorate (DGE) to all the companies
that meet the threshold (CFAF 500 million annual cash flow) regardless of their location. Thus, 120
companies that were previously under the jurisdiction of regional tax offices will be transferred to the DGE
before end-2016. In addition, to further improve the coverage of the rapidly expending city of Niamey, the
tax office will establish two tax assessment centers and two tax payment centers by June 2017 in Niamey.
The tax office will also: (i) strengthen the tax audit function by joint customs and tax administration staff and
decentralize the tax control unit to the regions; (ii) continue the ongoing project to provide a full information
system that will improve transparency and reduce the risk of fraud; and (iii) finalize the measures to
strengthen the reimbursement of VAT credit initiated in 2016, to strengthen VAT effectiveness.
Enhanced management of tax exemptions will broaden the tax base. Improved monitoring and control
of tax exemptions will be undertaken by revisiting existing exemption legislation and reinforcing the
management of public enterprises (MEFP, ¶ 37-40). In that regard, the PPP framework will be reviewed and
the government will consider transferring the tax provisions in the sector codes to the general tax and
custom codes. Also, to limit the fiscal risks from public enterprises, an audit will be undertaken to clarify
financial relations between the state and the main public enterprises.
The Treasury office will strengthen accounting procedures, and improve non-tax revenue collection
and liquidity management (MEFP, ¶ 52). Further modernization of accounting procedures will facilitate
TSA implementation, with expected financing support from the European Union and technical support from
FAD, this process will be supported by a long term IMF resident expert funded by the European Union. By
end-March 2017, the government will sign the account management agreements with the BCEAO and the
selected commercial banks and close all inactive accounts (compte dormants) (MEFP, ¶ 52 and 56).

Public Financial Management and Liquidity Management
31.
Public expenditure management and budget execution are being enhanced. The InterMinisterial Budgetary Committee that was created in Mid-2016 provides an effective mechanism for
aligning expenditure commitments with resource availability, thereby preventing the incurrence of
arrears. To strengthen planning and spending control, the preparation of annual budgets, starting
from the 2018 budget, will be in line with the budget program framework under the 2012 budget
law (MEFP, ¶ 56). On the basis of this framework, budget execution will be subject to commitment
authorizations and payments credits, further enhancing investment efficiency. Full implementation
of the TSA is expected during the program period (MEFP, ¶ 52).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

NIGER

State-owned enterprises reform
32.
A comprehensive evaluation of state-owned enterprises will be launched to limit fiscal
risks and generate cost savings (MEFP, ¶ 40). On the basis of that evaluation, an action plan will be
established to audit the financial relations between the government and the main companies, to
quantify implicit government subsidies, and inform policies for reducing exemptions.

C. Debt Management
33.
Niger’s risk of debt distress remains moderate (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Recently
contracted loans, though concessional, have raised public debt levels from 25.6 percent of GDP in
2013 to 41.9 percent of GDP in 2015,12 due in part to public investment in the natural resources
sector and in infrastructure, and to the securitization of domestic arrears.
34.
In light of the DSA results, staff and the authorities concurred on the need to preserve
debt sustainability. With limited fiscal space, the government is exploring options for public private
partnership (PPP) investments as an alternative means to address infrastructure financing gaps. In this
regard, staff noted the importance of strengthening the PPP framework, while continuing to
strengthen the overall debt management framework by enhancing the capacity of the inter-ministerial
committee on debt management. Staff urged the authorities to carefully assess the fiscal impact of the
PPP contracts to ensure consistency with the external borrowing plan under the Debt Limits Policy,
while reconsidering debt agreements signed but not yet become operational.
35.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the broader debt policy assessment and identified
specific measures to strengthen debt management. The authorities agreed to suspend the
conclusions of new PPP until the PPP framework is fully reviewed. To that end, they have requested
FAD Technical Assistance. A mission is expected in early 2017 to help design a new framework based
on an assessment of current risks. In updating the recent external borrowing plan prepared with the
IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department and the World Bank support (Table 11), the
authorities are planning to restructure the debt portfolio by reconsidering pending conventions that
are yet to become operational.

D. Natural Resource Management
36.
The decline in commodity prices has placed Niger’s resource sector under considerable
pressure. The government and its partners, the China National Petroleum Corporation and the state
of Chad, have put on hold the construction of the pipeline to transport crude oil through the
Chad-Cameroon pipeline, delaying its completion to around 2020 while considering other
alternatives. Niger’s third largest uranium producer (SOMINA) was not able to finance its expansion,
and has now suspended production. Imouraren, the largest uranium project, has been delayed
12

Niger owes a small amount of pre-HIPC Initiative arrears to non-Paris Club creditors which continue to be deemed
away under the revised arrears policy for official creditors, as the underlying Paris Club agreement was adequately
representative and the authorities have made best efforts to resolve remaining arrears to Iraq and Libya.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

pending a recovery in uranium prices. Also, the financial situation of the public mine-holding
company (SOPAMIN) has not improved, with most of its commercial contracts expiring this year and
the company barely exporting its quota of uranium production. In the meantime, structural reforms
in the oil sector are progressing with exports gradually liberalized, which is expected to better align
incentives in the sector and improve its financial standing.
37.
The government has taken steps to improve the financial status of the national
refinery, SORAZ. It lowered the crude oil price from Niger’s oil fields to US$45 per barrel from
US$47, and increased the contractually determined price to the government-owned fuel distributor
(SONIDEP) by CFAF 10 per liter. These measures are expected to restore a comfortable operating
margin for the refinery.
38.
Despite the decline in commodity prices, staff noted that natural resource
endowments will remain the major source to finance Niger’s development. Accordingly, staff
urged the authorities to enhance natural resource revenue mobilization by strengthening revenue
evaluation, forecasting, and audit capacities. Drawing on peer country experiences and based on
recent FAD technical assistance, staff advised pursuing a stronger institutional framework for natural
resource management. To continue strengthening the existing overall framework, the authorities
expressed interest in resuming the FAD Technical Assistance initiated two years ago. More
specifically, in the energy sector, staff welcomed the recently created Agence de Régulation du
Secteur de l’Energie, which the authorities agreed to operationalize promptly.

E. Business Environment
39.
Niger’s business environment remains difficult despite recent improvements. The
World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Index ranked Niger 150th out of 190 countries, up from 176th out
of 189 countries in 2014, but still below other WAEMU members and SSA averages for some
indicators (Figure 1). While the business environment in most WAEMU countries is weak in many
aspects, dealing with construction regulations, and paying taxes were identified as particularly
problematic in Niger. Other specific concerns identified by the local business community include:
declining activity in the telecommunications sector following the introduction of a tax on incoming
calls in 2014 and delays in processing reimbursements of VAT credits and of tax exemptions refunds.
Staff commended the authorities for shortening the time and procedures required to start a
business, improving access to credit information by establishing a credit bureau, and making
contracts enforcement easier by creating a specialized commercial court. However, staff urged an
acceleration of efforts, in particular improvements in tax administration. To sustain the improvement
of competitiveness, the authorities will speed up measures aimed at overcoming barriers identified
in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and paying taxes.

The banking system
appears adequately capitalized
and efficient relative to other
countries in the region. At endSeptember 2016, prudential
indicators (Table 6) suggest that
capital adequacy ratios for most
banks remain above the regulatory
threshold of 8 percent. Although
gross non-performing loans are at
reasonable levels (18.5 percent of
total loans at end-September
2016), they have risen slightly and
are a source of concern for two
banks (Text Figure 6).

41.
A shallow financial
system and increased exposure to the public sector could constrain growth and generate
financial risks. Despite a significant improvement in the regional financial market, the domestic
banking sector remains shallow, with limited financial instruments and four commercial banks
controlling about 90 percent of total banking sector assets. The sectoral distribution of credit is
skewed towards trade, services, and mining sectors, and Niger’s underdeveloped capital market is
dominated by banks and the government. Agriculture, the largest contributor to economic growth,
benefits marginally from bank financing. Key risks stem from growing exposures to the public sector,
both through holding of government bonds and the incurrence of domestic arrears. Such arrears
also hamper banks’ clients’ capacity to repay their loans. The authorities and staff concurred on the
need to establish a consultative platform with the banking association.
42.
Staff highlighted the importance of strengthening Niger’s microfinance network to
foster financial inclusion. Following the adoption in July 2015 of the National Strategy for Financial
Inclusion, CFAF 300 million were earmarked in the 2016 budget for its implementation and another
CFAF 300 million for the National Financial Sector Development Strategy (NFSDS) that was approved
in late 2014. The objective is to make available through 2021, CFAF 35 billion in credits to small
businesses, in particular those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The government plans to
ask for donor assistance with this microfinance program at a forthcoming Round Table to be held in
2017. Staff highlighted the role of microfinance as a means to deepening financial inclusion and
therefore reducing poverty. The authorities and staff concurred on the need for the quick
establishment of the steering committee in charge of implementing the NFSDS.

PROGRAM MODALITIES, RISKS, AND SAFEGUARDS
43.
The authorities have requested a three-year arrangement under the ECF in an amount
of SDR 98.7 million (75 percent of quota). The proposed access is above the norm for countries
with Niger’s level of outstanding drawings from the PRGT but it is in line with established limits and
commensurate with the proposed program strength and identified financing needs. The program
will comprise six reviews, with disbursements phased evenly throughout the arrangement (Table 12).
The program will include semi-annual performance criteria (PC) and an agenda of structural reforms
(Tables 9, 10, and 11). PC will be established for end-June and end-December 2017 and Indicative
Targets (IT) for end-March and September-2017. As a prior action, an amended 2017 budget
consistent with the program was approved on November 4, 2016.
44.
Niger’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate, but subject to risks which
program measures will mitigate. Given the strength of the program, the favorable medium-term
outlook, and the results of the DSA, Niger denotes sufficient capacity to repay the Fund (Table 10),
with repayment obligations to the Fund peaking at 1.2 percent of export revenue in 2023-24. Key
risks remain security developments, adverse spillovers from neighboring countries, climatic shocks,
and capacity constraints, all of which could impair program implementation. These risks would be
mitigated under the program, including through building fiscal space, strengthening key institutions,
and boosting growth’s resilience. Continued debt accumulation due to weak policy implementation
and debt management capacity would have a major impact on debt sustainability.
45.
Safeguard assessments are conducted at the level of the regional central bank (BCEAO).
The most recent assessment was completed in December 2013 and found a continuing strong control
environment. All recommendations from the assessment have been implemented. These include
strengthening audit arrangements by appointing an international firm with international accounting
standard experience for the audits of FY 2015-17, reinforcing the capacity of the audit committee with
external expertise to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, and adopting the
International Financial Reporting System starting with financial year 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Economic growth has been sustained despite major security, natural disaster, and
terms of trade shocks. Niger recorded significant income per capita gains during the 2012-16 ECF
and made progress toward the MDGs. Economic growth averaged 6.6 percent annually over the last
five years, driven by agriculture, services, and the oil sector. Inflation remains under control and the
external position has been stable with official reserves at comfortable levels. Social indicators show
some improvement, but Niger remains one of the least developed countries in the world.
47.
Niger’s overall macroeconomic outlook remains positive, and the exchange rate
remains broadly in line with fundamentals. Over the medium term, growth is projected at
5.9 percent, driven by agriculture and the resource sector. Inflation is expected to remain subdued,
anchored on the regional exchange rate arrangement. The external stability assessment suggests

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

that the exchange rate remained broadly in line with fundamentals, but the recent depreciation of
the Naira could further affect Niger’s competitiveness. Also, broader competitiveness indicators
point to major challenges, though significant improvement has been recorded in the 2017 World
Bank’s Doing Business Indicators.
48.
Achieving Niger’s medium-term growth potential and ensuring inclusiveness will
require enhancing the management of natural disasters, creating jobs to harness the
demographic dividend, and continuing efforts to address gender issues. The government’s
natural disasters’ risk management framework is sound, but more can be done to mitigate the impact
of food insecurity through broadened implementation of the 3N Initiative. Staff welcome the policies
being contemplated for harnessing the demographic dividend, but this will require a more
comprehensive strategy to create jobs as an increasing number of youth enters the job market. Recent
policies for alleviating gender inequality are welcomed but public resources for girls’ education should
be scaled up to discourage underage marriages, reduce birth rate, and improve future employment
opportunities.
49.
Creating fiscal space and enhancing the efficiency of public spending are critical to
enable Niger to achieve its development objectives. With security spending likely to remain
elevated for the foreseeable future, it is important that such spending does not crowd out other
development priorities such as investment in the social sectors, agriculture, mining, and
infrastructure. Public expenditure efficiency and control are being enhanced and other specific
measures will aim at improving public finance management in line with Fund technical assistance
recommendations. Budget processes will be more closely aligned with the WAEMU guidelines. The
necessary steps are already being taken to prepare the 2018 budget in line with the 2012 budget
law that aims at longer term planning of spending so as to increase its efficiency. On the revenue
front, resource revenues are only anticipated to rise over the medium term, so that greater efforts
will be needed to mobilize domestic revenues, including through strengthened tax administration
and broadening the tax base.
50.
Institutional capacity building will support the implementation of the authorities’ reform
agenda. Progress has been achieved in enhancing government accountability and transparency in some
areas such as recording of natural resource revenues and debt management. However, there is room for
improvement in some areas such as assessing the efficiency of investments, tax and customs
administration, liquidity management, financial sector development, and national accounting.
Prioritization of social expenditures could also be enhanced. Efforts will be sustained to strengthen policy
implementation capacity, including in debt and PPP assessment and management.
51.
Deepening financial access will play an important role in making growth more
inclusive. The government’s Financial Inclusion Strategy approved in 2015 and targeted at Nigeriens
marginalized by banks appropriately identifies key reforms, but the focus needs to be stepped on
implementation. Banking supervision should be strengthened in line with regional protocols,
including as regards concluding the recapitalization of the two banks that do not meet some of the
prudential criteria.

52.
Niger’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Niger participates
in the harmonization of WAEMU statistical methodologies and other regional processes to strengthen
national statistics supported by the WAEMU Commission and AFRITAC-West. Data adequacy and
timely provision lag for debt stocks and flows, and for financial flows, due to lack of capacity.
53.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a three-year ECF arrangement with access
equivalent to SDR 98.7 million (75 percent of quota). The Letter of Intent (LOI) and
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) set out appropriate policies to achieve the
program’s objectives.

Annex. Niger: Ex-Post Peer Reviewed Assessment1
Introduction
1.
Over the last decade, two arrangements under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
supported Niger’s medium-term objectives of maintaining macroeconomic stability,
promoting growth, and reducing poverty. The first three reviews under the first ECF
arrangement (2008-11; SDR 23.03 million) were completed, but a military coup in early 2010
interrupted the policy dialogue with the Fund pending international recognition of the transitional
government. The second ECF arrangement (2012-16, SDR 120.09 million) was approved in March
2012 and was initially scheduled through the first quarter of 2015. It was twice extended, first to
end-December 2015, and then to end-December 2016, because of delays in implementing the
structural reform program and larger BOP needs from security and humanitarian situation. The
second extension was accompanied by an augmentation of access of 62.5 percent of quota.
2.
This annex reviews progress during the 2012-16 ECF-supported program,2 and draws
lessons for future program design and Fund engagement. The assessment is made from a staff
perspective, and reflects the authorities’ views collected during the 2016 Article IV discussions and
negotiations of a new program supported by the ECF.

Program Objectives
3.
Niger’s development strategy under the ECF 2012-16—as laid out in the government’s
Plan de Development Economique et Social (PDES)—envisaged leveraging its natural resource
wealth into a sustained and inclusive growth process. Implementation of the strategy required
large-scale investments in two natural resource projects, Imouraren (uranium mine) and the oil
pipeline Niger-Chad-Cameroon, were scheduled to be completed during this period, but were
delayed as the international market prices fell. Challenges under the program were numerous and
diverse, but four stand out: (i) food security; (ii) security and governance; (iii) development of human
capital; and (iv) infrastructure development.
4.
The main objectives of the 2012-16 program were maintaining macroeconomic
stability, promoting growth, and reducing poverty. The 2012-16 program sought to consolidate
the macroeconomic stability restored during the previous arrangement, while increasing Niger’s
resilience to shocks, strengthening public finances and debt management, establishing a transparent
1

The 2008-11 program was reviewed in SM/11/300. The following summarizes the key findings from that review:
Macroeconomic performance under the 2008-11 program was satisfactory, although conditions deteriorated in
2009-10 following political instability and drought. The authorities maintained macro stability and average annual
real GDP grew by 5.7 percent, above program projections. Both tax and non-tax revenues exceeded projections,
thanks mainly to improvements in customs and revenue administration. Quantitative performance criteria and
structural benchmarks were mostly met.

legal and supervisory framework for the mining and petroleum sectors, and supporting private and
financial sector development. Fiscal policy aimed at supporting the growth strategy by creating fiscal
space for increasing development spending, while preserving external debt sustainability. To that
end, emphasis was placed on improving tax administration and expenditure control with the Fund
technical assistance.

Program Performance
5.
Performance under the 2012-16 program was adversely impacted by a deterioration in
security starting in 2012, a collapse of export prices starting in 2013, droughts, floods, and negative
spillovers from the economic slowdown in neighboring Nigeria starting in 2015. Due to domestic
policy slippages, fiscal performance fell short of program targets, and the implementation of the
structural reform agenda was delayed. This, in turn, led to delays in completing several reviews.


Economic growth was generally lower than the initial projections. Average growth rate was
6.6 percent in 2012-16, compared with a projection of 8.2 percent. The economic growth
under-performance was due to the above-mentioned external shocks, volatility in
agricultural production which accounts for 35-40 percent of GDP, and delays in the
implementation of the resource projects.



Inflation in 2012-16 averaged 1.3 percent a year, well below the 3 percent WAEMU
convergence criteria, in part due to the government’s timely food and price stabilization
programs for the years when harvests were not good.



The current account deficit averaged 15.7 percent of GDP in 2012-16, compared with a
projection of 16.7 percent. International reserves were kept at comfortable levels in excess of
4 months of imports of goods and services.



The fiscal stance deteriorated as the budget deficits were higher than programmed. The
overall balance averaged 5.5 percent of GDP over 2012-16 compared with projections of
4.5 percent, due to the exogenous shocks, repeated underperformance of revenue,
shortfalls in external financing, and the failure to adjust spending in response to shocks.
The deficits were financed by domestic arrears and external debt accumulation– with the
external debt-to-GDP ratio rising from 21.3 to 34.1 percent of GDP between 2012 and
2016. Quantitative performance criteria on net domestic financing and net reduction in
domestic arrears were missed for most of the reviews.

6.
Progress on structural reforms was uneven with delays in implementing the structural
reform agenda. The following key reforms have been effected:


Revenue mobilization: Progress was recorded in modernizing customs administration with
the migration to ASYCUDA World and interconnecting the main customs offices which
collect more than 90 percent of customs revenue.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

NIGER



Public financial management: An action plan for the 2012 organic budget law was adopted in
2013 that will lead to the full WAEMU-harmonized budget law in the preparation of the 2018
budget. Spending executed through exceptional procedures was kept below the benchmark
5 percent of total expenditures since the first quarter of 2013. An Inter-Ministerial Budgetary
Committee was established in 2016 to provide a mechanism to align expenditure
commitments with resource availability and thereby reduce the incurrence of arrears.



Business environment: a new investment code was adopted and a one-stop-shop for
investors was set up in 2015, after a one-stop-shop for starting business was operationalized
in early-2014.



Debt management: The Secretariat of the inter-ministerial committee on debt management
was established in 2015, and has since produced regular reports on debt management.



Financial sector reform and inclusion: a financial sector development strategy was adopted
in November 2014 and was reinforced in 2015 with a financial inclusion strategy targeting
Nigerien with limited access to financial services.

7.

The following are the main outstanding reforms envisaged under the 2017 program:


The establishment of a treasury single account (TSA), initially envisaged by end-December 2013,
has not been completed and is now expected to be in place at end 2017. Implementation has
been broken down into a number of well-defined steps that have been used as structural
benchmarks and which have secured progress.



Operationalization of customs electronic transit system.



Preparation of the documents required for the establishment of 2018 budget in line with the
2012 budget law.



Curtailing widespread fiscal exonerations.

Lessons from the 2012-16 ECF-Program
8.

46

Four key lessons can be drawn from the ECF supported program:


Some targets may have been too ambitious in contrast to capacity and incidence of shocks.
Revenue targets were overly ambitious, especially after the good performance in 2013.
These targets, which were missed by large margins, were in turn used to justify ambitious
levels of spending, leading to breaches in performance criteria and missed targets. Staff
assessment of domestic absorptive capacity for investment also turned out to be optimistic.



More flexibility in adjusting macroeconomic targets and policies in response to shocks may
have been warranted. The shocks rendered the ambitious spending plans incompatible with

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

program objectives but adjustments were not made in good time. The failure to adjust
timely highlighted the need for fiscal discipline and effective oversight over the expenditure
chain, and for flexibility in the design of macroeconomic and development plans.


Capacity building and strong ownership of TA recommendations are essential to make
progress with reforms. Certain reform measures –such as customs administration and the
TSA– were initiated without ensuring that the capacity to implement them existed or the
political will was in place.



Institutional stability and coordination are vital for program success. A high managerial
turnover rate at the Ministry of Finance slowed reform implementation. The co-management
of debt by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning created difficulties in
coordinating and monitoring debt operations.

9.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment of the Fund-supported
program. The authorities were gratified to hear that staff shared their views on the adverse impacts
of exogenous shocks on program performance and of the importance of flexibility in government
policy to respond to such shocks. They stressed that they looked forward to incorporating the
lessons learned in the proposed new program.

Annex Box 1. Niger: Capacity Building
IMF capacity building efforts supported effectively the authorities’ macro-critical objectives.
Technical assistance has focused on customs and tax administration and public financial management
(PFM). Also, technical assistance aimed at enhancing capacity of the National Institute of Statistics and
improve debt management for coverage and completeness. Fund technical assistance and training to Niger
has however been moderate relative to the median for fragile states or LICs. IMF technical assistance
increased significantly in 2012-13 (Figure), in support of the implementation of the 2009 WAEMU PFM
directives, the taxation of natural resources, and the conduct of the 2012 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment.
Coordination with other
capacity building providers was
a critical part of Niger capacity
building strategy. Under the
2012-15 PFM reform program,
Niger received support from
other technical assistance
providers, namely the UNDP, the
WB, the AfDB, and the EU.
However, coordination has been
weak in donors’ support for the
introduction of the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF
and the investment budgeting in
commitment authorization and
payment credit).

revenue administration were implemented loosely, while treasury management reforms have repeatedly
been postponed, especially those related to the Treasury Single Account (TSA), reflecting mainly low
capacity and a lack of clear strategy. A project for a FAD long-term resident advisor is being set up—this
expert will be tasked to speed up treasury management reform, in particular the TSA implementation.
Technical assistance should continue to be in line with macro-critical objectives, but be more
demand-driven and reflect implementation capacity. To support capacity building, resident advisors in a
few key PFM reform areas could assist in the coordination of technical assistance, the transfer of knowledge,
and the ownership of reforms. Also donor coordination in the PFM reform area, through the use of a donor
technical assistance coordination matrix, would be helpful.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Niamey, December 21, 2016
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C., 20431

Madame Managing Director,
1.
Over the past five years, the government of Niger has been implementing economic
and social policies that have made it possible to maintain macroeconomic stability coupled
with sustained growth in economic activity. These policies are based on the 2012-15 Economic
and Social Development Plan (PDES), reflected in the 2012–16 economic and financial program
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).
Program implementation was affected by government spending pressures driven partly by the
impact of security and climatic shocks, a decline in trade flows with neighboring countries, and the
price-depressed oil and mining sectors. The impact of these shocks undermined the achievement of
the objectives of our development program. The ensuing fiscal deficits were financed largely by the
accumulation of domestic payments arrears and the increased use of borrowing on the regional
financial market.
2.
The new economic and financial program (2017-20), which we are requesting, takes into
account the achievements and lessons learned from the previous program to establish
sustainable objectives. Its primary objective is the preservation of a sound macroeconomic
framework, in particular through a prudent debt policy. The program also seeks to broaden the tax
base, strengthen public financial and debt management, enhance the monitoring of developments in
the natural resources sector, consolidate the financial sector, and improve the business environment.
Given the severity of the exogenous shocks, special emphasis is placed on domestic revenue
mobilization, the streamlining of spending, and diversification of the production base, with a view to
increase the resilience of the economy and to create a sustainable basis for financing our development
programs, while maintaining a sustainable debt level.
3.
To achieve these objectives, we are determined to implement new reforms, while
continuing those in progress. The new reforms will mainly aim at raising tax revenues and
controlling spending, but also at facilitating the development objectives outlined in the 2016-19
Economic Policy Paper, which draws on the Renaissance Act II Program for 2016-19. Consequently, our
actions will aim at strengthening the performance of the revenue agencies so as to increase revenues
while controlling and improving the quality of public spending.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

4.
Tax policy will also play an important role. Over the years, the advantages granted by our
various codes (investment codes, mining code, and petroleum code) have steadily increased in
terms of revenue opportunity costs. The same applies to our public enterprises, some of which are a
source of revenues losses for the government. In order to increase revenue and better manage
spending, the government is committed to rationalizing the tax exemptions policy currently in effect
while also introducing bold reforms in the management of public enterprises by taking a closer look
at the concessions granted.
5.
Economic diversification will be stepped up. To that end we will pursue economic
diversification policies conducive to a strong, inclusive growth and a more resilient economy capable
of providing employment to a fast-growing youth population, thereby helping to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including through policies to reduce gender inequality and
to reap the potential of the demographic dividend of Niger’s fast growing population.
6.
The government remains firmly committed to pursuing a prudent debt policy that will
enable the financing of investment plans while maintaining debt sustainability. The
government will, therefore, limit loans contracted or guaranteed on non-concessional terms as
prescribed in the Fund’s Debt Limits policy.
7.
In regard to the program objectives, we are convinced that the policies contained in
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) should help achieve the
program objectives. The government stands ready to take any additional measures that prove
necessary to this end. The government will consult with Fund staff on the adoption of such
measures, on its own initiative or at the request of the IMF Managing Director, before adopting such
measures or before any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with Fund
policies on such consultations. In particular, the government will discuss with Fund staff (including in
the context of program reviews) any unforeseen circumstances that could affect the program, so as
to conduct a joint analysis of their impact and identify appropriate actions to be taken without
jeopardizing the achievement of program objectives. Lastly, the government is committed to
provide the IMF with any information that may be necessary for monitoring the implementation of
the measures and the achievement of program objectives, as agreed in the annexed Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
8.
The government requests IMF support for its three-year economic and financial program
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It is requesting financial assistance of SDR 98.7 million,
equivalent to 75 percent of quota, and an initial disbursement of SDR 14.1 million (10.7 percent of quota)
following approval of the arrangement by the Executive Board.
9.
The government consents to the publication of this Letter of Intent, the Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding
attached hereto, as well as the IMF staff report on the Article IV Consultation and the request
for an arrangement under the ECF. The government hereby authorizes their publication and
posting on the IMF website, after the adoption of the three-year ECF arrangement by the IMF
Executive Board.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of
the Government of Niger
Niamey, December 21, 2016

A. Introduction
1.
During the period from 2012 to 2016, the government of Niger implemented the
economic and financial program supported by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).
Despite many shocks, this program helped maintain macroeconomic stability, made progress possible
within the structural reforms and helped achieve the objectives in the 2012-15 Economic and Social
Development Plan (PDES), thanks also to support from our economic and financial partners. To
consolidate the positive results and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the
government prepared a new economic and financial program for the period 2017-20. The program
reflects the aspirations of the government’s Renaissance II Program for the period 2016-21 subject to
new security, climatic, and economic environment constraints. The purpose of this program, for which
we are requesting IMF support under a new ECF arrangement, is to lay the groundwork for faster
poverty reduction by mobilizing more revenue from the non-natural resource sector and a rapid
diversification of our economy to make it stronger and more resilient to shocks.
2.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes recent
developments and the economic and structural policies. It presents the results of implementing
the previous program, describes recent economic developments, the state of implementation of
structural reforms, the short and medium-term economic outlook, and the macroeconomic policies,
and structural reforms planned for the period 2017-20. The priorities and objectives of the program
supported by the ECF are consistent with the thrust of the government’s Economic Policy Paper
(EDD) for the period 2016-20 and the guidance note for preparing the Sustainable Development and
Inclusive Growth Strategy (SDDCI, Niger 2035). These priorities focus on: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving public financial management with the priority to increasing
tax revenue by expanding the tax base and strengthening tax supervision, better controlling public
expenditures, and strengthening cash management; (iii) improving debt management; (iv) increasing
transparency in the management of the mining and oil sectors; and (v) supporting the development
of the private and financial sectors.

B. Results of Implementing the 2012-16 Extended Credit Facility
3.
The performance of the program supported by the previous ECF arrangement were
broadly not in line as expected. Therefore, following delays in completing some reviews, in part
due of the impact of exogenous shocks, the three-year arrangement concluded in March 16, 2012,
for a period of three years, was extended to 2016. Indeed, in recent years, Niger has undergone
repeated terrorist attacks by the Boko-Haram group. While causing problems in production and
slowdowns in border trade, these attacks resulted in additional military expenditures and
humanitarian spending related to the massive inflows of refugees and displaced persons.
4.
Moreover, the ongoing drop in uranium prices and the fall in international oil prices
since end 2014 have impacted adversely program performance. The development strategy was
based on windfalls from increase in exports of natural resources. But, the decline in exports of several
products that are re-exported to Nigeria and fewer exports of traditional products due to the recent
economic difficulties in Nigeria led to substantial revenue losses. These revenue losses due to these
shocks affected budget execution and the achievement of some fiscal targets, in particular those
related to domestic payment arrears and domestic financing. Therefore, various reviews’ conclusions
required waivers, changes in performance criteria or extensions of the period covered by the program.
Also, there were delays in implementing structural reforms, in particular the process of setting-up the
Treasury Single Account (TSA).
5.
However, results were encouraging. Niger was able to maintain macroeconomic stability,
growth was sustained and inflation was contained. The coverage of foreign reserves remained at a
satisfactory level and the program indicative target for poverty reduction spending was observed in
some reviews. The incidence of poverty was continuously falling and estimated to 45.4 percent in 2014
versus 48.2 percent in 2011. Child mortality declined as well. Progress was also noted, though slow, in
implementing the structural reforms, particularly with regards to the modernization of tax and customs
administrations, the management of public expenditure, especially with the adoption of regulations
required to implement the program budget, the framework for inclusive finance development, the
supervision of the natural resources sectors, and the improvement of the business climate.
6.
But more efforts remain to be done. The different shocks pointed out the vulnerability of
the economy. Budget deficits led to a rising debt, though the debt risk rating remains moderate. It
has become critical to strengthen the economy’s resilience by diversifying the production base and
to improve on fiscal management. It is also imperative to improve the mobilization of domestic
revenue to reduce the dependence on natural resources. All of the above should go hand-in-hand
with better management of public expenditure. Finally, despite the improved poverty situation,
many MDG targets were not met, and the Human Development Index remains at a very low level.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

C. Recent Economic Trends
7.
Growth increased in 2016 and inflation remained moderate. Agriculture production was
up by nearly 8 percent, reflecting a good yield for irrigated crops. At the same time, the positive
results expected from the 2016 raining season could trigger a rise in this growth rate. However, the
recovery in the oil production was slower and government spending was constrained by low
revenue. Thus, the growth rate is expected to rise from 3.5 percent in 2015 to 4.6 percent in 2016. At
end-September, inflation was contained at an annual average of 1 percent, reflecting the good
results of the last two crop seasons and the various measures taken by the government took to
control price increases including the free distribution of food and the sale of grains at moderate
prices. The average inflation rate for 2016 is expected to be around 1.1 percent.
8.
Broad money in the nine months through September 2016 increased by 9 percent,
which is in line with estimates of economic activity. Official net foreign assets decreased by
20 percent, as the external budget support envisaged for the second half of the year will only be
disbursed at the end of the year. Credit to the private sector also increased by 9 percent in the first
three quarters of 2016, a deceleration relative to the previous year. Credit to the government
increased by FCFA 98 billion in the same period as the government turned to domestic financing in
the absence of foreign support.
9.
The external accounts in 2016 were negatively affected by lower exports and re-exports.
The deficit of the current account of the balance of payments, which amounted to 18.1 percent of GDP
in 2015, should however decrease to 15.4 percent of GDP in 2016. This improvement reflects lower
imports, which more than offset the drop in uranium exports, and the downturn in exports and reexports to Nigeria, despite higher food imports due to the security shocks. Thus, the overall balance of
the balance of payments is projected to be positive with a slight increase in international reserves of
CFAF 40 billion in 2016. Niger’s external position would remain comfortable and covers 4.2 months of
next year imports of goods and services.
10.
Budget execution in 2016 was characterized by weak revenue mobilization. At end-June
2016, budget execution was lower than programmed, resulting into a basic deficit and a domestic
financing below program targets. However, at end-September 2016, strong pressures on security and
social spending led to a basic deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP higher than projected. The deficit was
financed by more domestic resources (by 1 percent of GDP) a larger accumulation of domestic
payment arrears (by 0.2 percent of GDP). The difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunications
sectors and lower trade flows (exports and re-exports values were down by 30.1 percent) led to
significant revenue losses. At end-September, the shortfall in revenue compared to the program
amounted to CFAF 87 billion (2 percent of GDP), and revenue was down by CFAF 79.1 billion
compared to 2015. The government responded to the revenue shock by freezing planned spending in
accordance with the new mechanism put in place, through the Inter-Ministerial Budgetary Regulation
Committee.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

NIGER

11.
Tax revenue recorded significant shortfall. Tax revenue declined substantially at endSeptember 2016. The shortfall, valued at CFAF 11.9 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) at end-June 2016,
reached CFAF 87 billion (2 percent of GDP) in end-September 2016. Revenue mobilization suffered
from weakening economic activity in Niger and Nigeria, and from the depreciation of the Naira,
which leads to considerable informal parallel market in oil products and drastic decline in exports
and re-exports to Nigeria. In the Tax Administration (DGI), the shortfalls are explained by
weaknesses in the collection of taxes on goods and services (CFAF 32.9 billion) due to low collection
of VAT, mining royalty, superficial royalty, the domestic tax on petroleum products, excise taxes, and
the income tax (CFAF 20.5 billion), due to low corporate income tax in nearly all sectors that are
suffering from weak economic activities. The shortfall in the customs (DGD) (CFAF 26.2 billion) arises
from the decline of VAT and other customs duties. Non-tax revenue was in line with projections.
12.
Despite security pressures, spending was contained at end-June 2016. Current
expenditures were lower than projected by CFAF 13.8 billion, with savings recorded in all spending
categories except wages. Despite the streamlining measures, there was a CFAF 3.2 billion overrun in
the wage bill, due to new hiring in the priority sectors, security and back pay. The streamlining
measures that were taken included eliminating fictitious employees and dualism identified by the
audit conducted by the High Authority to Combat Corruption and Similar Violations (HALCIA),
streamlining back pay and stopping unsubstantiated payments of allowances (responsibility, family,
desert area, etc.). Capital expenditures executed on domestic resources were also lower than
projections by CFAF 13.4 billion.
13.
At end-September 2016, despite the strengthening of budget execution leading to an
improvement in the government financing situation, there was spending pressures. During the
first and second quarters, the government was able to contain spending to make less use of
domestic financing and lower accumulation of domestic arrears. However, with the impact of
pressures due to intensified terrorist attacks and social and humanitarian needs, the decrease in
spending only partially offset the revenue shortfall. Thus, the level of domestic financing was higher
by CFAF 35.3 billion at end-September. The government paid off the outstanding balance of arrears
accumulated before end-2014 (CFAF 17.4 billion) that it was not possible to pay by end-2015 as
required in the program, but it accumulated about CFAF 10 billion more in arrears. Budget support
mobilization amounted to roughly CFAF 28.6 billion at end-September, CFAF 7.4 billion lower than
projected. This amount includes grants of CFAF 17.6 billion from Saudi Arabia and CFAF 1.8 billion
from Nigeria, as well as loans of CFAF 9.2 billion from the French Development Agency (AFD). Most
of the scheduled financing will be disbursed in the last quarter of 2016.

D. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
14.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to increase to
5.2 percent in 2017. Average growth over the 2017-20 period is expected to reach 5.9 percent,
supported mainly by investments in the agriculture sector (increase in irrigated areas, upgraded crops,
mini-dams, hydro-agricultural facilities, hydraulic structures, and increase in livestock), the start of other
major road infrastructure projects, including the third bridge over the Niger River, the construction of the

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Cotonou-Niamey-Ouagadougou-Abidjan railway loop, the construction work on the oil pipeline for
exporting crude oil, scheduled in 2020, the Salkadamna energy project, the Garadawa and Kao cement
plants, the resumption in 2017 of construction work on the Kandadji hydroelectric and agricultural dam,
and the upgrades of the Diori Hamani International Airport. Niger is expected to benefit also from the
gradual improvement of the economic situation in Nigeria. Inflation should remain contained below the
WAEMU convergence criterion, at less than 3 percent annual average. The current account is projected
to deteriorate slightly in 2017-19 and then improve gradually. The current account deficit would increase
to 18.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and remain high until 2019 because exports would remain low in the
absence of higher prices for uranium, oil, and gold.
15.
However, this outlook is subject to various risks. While this outlook would benefit from
expected more peaceful environment and socio-political stability, it remains subject to risks linked to
climate shocks, shocks on crude oil export price and possible delays in the oil pipeline construction
project, as well as deteriorating security tensions in the sub-region.

E. Medium-Term Objectives and Policies
16.
Government policies aim at maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieve the
objectives of the Economic Development Document (EDD, 2016-20). Those objectives aim at
fostering strong and inclusive economic growth that could create jobs and income and strengthen
the foundations of sustainable development. They pertain to: (i) strengthening spending
management and domestic revenue mobilization in order to make the financing of development
projects secure and safeguard the viability of the debt position; (ii) sustaining investment as part of
the 3N Initiative to increase and diversify agriculture production and make it resilient to natural
disasters, while ensuring food security and promoting export development; (iii) investing in priority
infrastructure such as energy and transportation in order to overcome our landlocked situation and
improve competitiveness; (iv) diversifying production, mainly by enhancing the business
environment; and (v) boosting technical skills as well as strengthening institutional and
administrative capacities.
17.
The execution of realistic budgets will prevent the problems observed over the last
years, characterized by the accumulation of arrears and resorting more to domestic financing.
Spending will remain elevated in the medium term due to security and humanitarian needs. Because
revenue is not expected to improve in the mining and oil sectors, the government will strengthen
policies aimed at domestic revenue mobilization and improved budget management, based on the
reforms from the 2017-19 fiscal management reform plan. Budgetary revenue must be based on
realistic projections, with increases justified by well-defined tax measures or yields resulting from
administrative reforms of revenue agencies. In the event of shocks, the government will have recourse
to budgetary regulation and cash flow management mechanisms to meet budgetary targets. Owing to
ongoing difficulties in the mining and oil sectors, budgetary revenue is expected to level from
15.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 2019. However, as crude oil exports begin, a
sizable increase in domestic revenue is expected starting in 2020 (19.1 percent of GDP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

NIGER

18.
The government is determined to continue streamlining spending launched in 2016
and would enhance further the effectiveness of investment. Therefore, current spending would
stabilize at an average of 14 percent of GDP in the period 2017-20. By contrast, investment spending
using domestic resources should rise from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to an average of 6.5 percent
of GDP over the period 2017-20. Fiscal projections reflect the EDD’s development spending
priorities, including security expenditures and those of the Plan to Support Persons Vulnerable to
Disasters and Food and Nutritional Crises. After the basic deficit widened to 4.9 percent of GDP in
2017, it should decrease gradually to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2020. Over the same period, the overall
balance, including grants, will decline from 7.4 to 2.9 percent of GDP, so that the WAEMU
convergence criteria can be observed and financial viability can be safeguarded. The government’s
financial position is expected to improve significantly thereafter.

F. Program Performance in 2016
19.
All program performance criteria were met at end-June 2016, including the continuous
performance criteria for non-accumulation of external arrears and nonrecourse to non-concessional
external loans or guarantees, and the quantitative performance criteria on net domestic government
financing, and net reductions in domestic arrears. However, the indicative target for domestic
revenue was not achieved at end-June 2016. The indicative target for the basic balance was
observed. Because spending was curtailed, it was impossible to fully meet the poverty reduction
targets at end-June 2016.
20.
Some of the structural benchmarks for the period under review were observed. The
Directorate General of Budget (DGB) regularly produced quarterly budget execution reports and
quarterly debt management reports were prepared and submitted to the Inter-Ministerial
Committee for Monitoring Debt Policy and Negotiating Budgetary Aid. The level of payments by
anticipation remained below the target of 5 percent, at 2.9 percent of spending authorized at endMarch 2016, 2 percent at end-June, and 2.9 percent at end-September 2016. The government also
prepared the borrowing plan for 2017-20.
21.
Some structural benchmarks were delayed. Measures planned under the implementation
of the Treasury Single Account were delayed. In fact, the statutory framework for closing the
government accounts to be consolidated in the TSA was not finalized as scheduled in late-June
2016, but the preparation of the required documents has advanced. The draft convention for
managing the TSA has not been signed, but the comments from the BCEAO have already been
incorporated, and the selection by the Procurement Directorate of banks to serve as government
cashier offering banking services in areas not covered by the BCEAO is in progress. Although the
terms of reference were drafted, the impact assessment study on commercial banks for transferring
government accounts from the private banks to the TSA has not yet been started. The annual
benchmark for preparing the procurement plan to be consistent with the commitment and cash
plans was not observed due to weak capacity, but commitment and cash plans for the third and
fourth quarters were elaborated.

22.
In addition, the benchmark for end-2016 on the preparation of a biometric database
for all civil servants with the support of the World Bank was delayed as well. The expert who
was supposed to assist in this effort was hired on October 15, 2016 and began working in November
by preparing a roadmap along with specifications for the consultants to be hired.
23.
The reforms to modernize the customs (DGD) are ongoing. The migration to ASYCUDA
World, effective since April 2016 for the first six interconnected offices (four in Niamey, one in
Torody and one in Gaya), was expanded to all other fully operational offices, except for the offices in
Agadez and Arlit, where there is no fiber optic coverage. Discussions are under way with SONITEL to
cover localities that are not yet served. The offices covered by ASYCUDA World, which collect 90 to
95 percent of customs revenue, are now interconnected and electronic transit is operational.
Customs also began transferring the management of bonded warehouses to the private sector,
beginning with the transfer of the Niamey Rive Droite office to Bolloré in July 2016. The contract for
transferring management of other warehouses to the Chamber of Commerce was also signed.
Measures to speed up other reforms are being taken, in particular those that pertain to the tracking
systems (a PPP contract was signed and the equipment was ordered), the interconnection with the
customs systems of the region (Togo and Benin), and the implementation of the one-stop shop for
customs clearance for vehicles.
24.
Steps are taken to improve relations between tax administration and taxpayers and to
improve revenues collection. The Arbitration Committee for Tax Appeals (CARFI) became operational
in August 2016, following its launch on May 31, 2016. Communication with taxpayers is being
strengthened, mainly by holding the Third National Taxpayer Day and publishing the newsletter
entitled Le Fisc, which provides practical information on tax obligations. Also, measures are being
taken to make operational the VAT credit reimbursement system in line with the May 6, 2016 order
taken by the Minister of Finance. A “refundable VAT” escrow account was opened at the BCEAO, and
funds should be added each month by withholding 5-10 percent of VAT revenue collected by the
office of the large enterprises (DGE). On this basis, the DGI will review requests for reimbursement of
VAT credit and design a reimbursement plan after consulting with creditors. Finally, the DGI is
strengthening the audit of tax declarations in some sectors such as banking and telecommunications.
25.
The General Directorate of Treasury and Public Accounting (DGTCP) continues to
enhance measures for more efficient collection of non-tax revenue. The survey of non-tax
revenue collection potentials has identified 134 niches, 37 of which were already established as
collection agencies. The managers of these collection agencies were appointed, and with funding
from the French cooperation, training on the legal framework, the operation and the auditing of the
collection agencies will take place in November 2016. Tamper-proof booklets were made available,
and this will increase the revenue collected by the police, gendarmes, and water and forests.
Inspections of the revenue agencies were also strengthened. Finally, the DGTCP is strengthening the
monitoring of domestic payments arrears and other outstanding due payments. In this regard, the
second phase of the securitization operation of the 2014 arrears, which consisted in converting
short-term securities with local banks in the amount of CFAF 38.8 billion into five-year Treasury

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

NIGER

notes, was completed in early November 2016. Also, discussions with local banks to securitize a
portion of the 2015 domestic payment arrears (CFAF 40 billion) are under way.
26.
Public financial management reforms are continuing. The Government is pursuing the
implementation of the terms of the 2009 WAEMU public financial management directives and the
2012 organic law on budget. In particular, are in progress preparations for introducing the program
budget starting in 2018 in accordance with the roadmap prepared by the Directorate General of the
Budget (DGB). The government is backed by the European Union to acquire the information
technology hardware and software needed. Moreover, in April 2016, the National Assembly adopted
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 budget review laws and the 2015 budget review law was submitted to the
National Assembly for adoption. Finally, with a European Union financing, a review of government
finances according to the new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology
was carried out. The PEFA report, which was finalized in December 2016, serves as a basis for the
ongoing development of a new public financial management reform strategy.
27.
To break the vicious cycle of arrears accumulation, the government is strengthening the
budget regulation and cash management framework. The government prepared realistic
commitment and cash plans for third and fourth quarters of 2016. Also, the Inter-Ministerial Budget
Regulation Committee was established by Order No. 0094/PM of the Prime Minister of June 15, 2016
backed by a Technical Committee for Budget Regulation and Cash Management. These committees
are in charge of regulating the pace at which appropriations, commitments, and payment
authorizations are released in a manner consistent with available cash and revenue projections, in line
with government priorities.

G. Fiscal Policy for 2016 and 2017
Fiscal policy for the rest of 2016
28.
The government has taken steps to contain the basic deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP in
2016. Based on the performance at end-September, the revenue level for 2016 was considerably
reduced to CFAF 676.6 billion (15.3 percent of GDP). This corresponds to a decline of CFAF 92.1 billion
compared to 2015 and CFAF 114.5 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) compared to the initial projections.
Because of these revenue losses, the government held a Cabinet meeting bringing together all the
ministers for a budgetary regulation, which resulted to the signing, on November 1, 2016, of an order
to freeze budgetary credits amounting in a net CFAF 89.6 billion, including CFAF 48.2 billion in current
expenditures. Thus, the basic deficit at end-2016 would deteriorate only by CFAF 24.3 billion
(0.6 percent of GDP), financed by an increase of domestic financing by CFAF 14.3 billion and an
additional accumulation of domestic payment arrears of CFAF 10 billion.
29.
The arrears clearance program will continue in 2017. The program projected that the stock
of domestic payment arrears accumulated in 2015 (CFAF 71.7 billion) should be cleared in 2016
through securitization with local banks (CFAF 40 billion) and by bond in the regional financial market.
The securitization process was delayed, and the arrears will only be cleared in the first half of 2017.
Consequently, the net reduction in domestic arrears at end-2016 is projected at about CFAF 8.4 billion.
64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Fiscal Policy for 2017
30.
The fiscal framework for 2017 takes into account the weak performance of domestic
revenue and the necessity to meet priority spending. The fiscal framework for 2017 takes into
account the poor revenue performance observed in 2015 and 2016, new expenses that cannot be
compressed (security and humanitarian) and the priorities in the Economic Development Document
(EDD). A 2017 draft budget law coherent with the macroeconomic framework was submitted to the
National Assembly for adoption on November 4, 2016 (prior action).
31.
The agreed macroeconomic framework provides for a basic deficit of CFAF 235.9 billion
(4.9 percent of GDP). This deficit level is consistent with debt sustainability. Domestic revenue is
projected at CFAF 770.8 billion (16.1 percent of GDP) and domestically financed spending projected at
CFAF 1,006.7 billion (21.1 percent of GDP). Thus total revenue would increase by 0.8 percent of GDP
compared to 2016, with an increase in tax revenue that is 0.6 percent of GDP. Tax revenue would
represent CFAF 721.3 billion (15.1 percent of GDP), an increase of 12.4 percent over 2016 (up
0.6 percent of GDP). This increase reflects the result of measures to strengthen tax and customs
administrations, the revival of economic activities with a recovery in Nigeria and the unwavering fight
against fraud:


For the Directorate General of Customs, the requirement to certify value for the admissibility of
customs declarations will help limit fraud, whereas the requirement for a Tax Identification
Number (NIF) for all importers will limit fraud related to so-called occasional imports. The recent
transfer of the management of bonded warehouses to the private sector would also reduce
fraud and broaden the revenue base. Other activities are in progress: the start of the single
automobile window (GUAN) with SONILOGA and the tracking system with GEOTRACK,
combined with the interconnections with the customs in Benin and Togo. These measures would
help limit revenue losses resulting from the misrepresentation of imported used cars as well as
cargo losses.



For the General Directorate of Tax: the finalization of measures to strengthen the reimbursement
of VAT credit initiated in 2016, would allow the involved companies to apply the deduction
system and strengthen VAT effectiveness. Moreover, the measures taken by the DGI to
streamline taxpayer management in the Directorate of Large Enterprises (DGE), and improve
collection, are expected to increase tax collection efficiency and improve yields.



For the General Directorate of the Treasury and Public Accounting, non-tax revenue would
increase by CFAF 11.3 billion (0.2 percentage of GDP) compared to 2016, mainly because of the
steps the DGTCP has taken to strengthen inspections, expand revenue collection agencies and
put in place Treasury prepayment facility managers in the registry offices.

32.
The 2017 draft budget law introduces other measures to strengthen the tax
administration in the area of control and fight against fraud. In particular, it requires branches
of foreign companies to prepare their accounts, and like all other companies, to be subject to the
income tax (ISB). To demonstrate the government’s resolve to strengthen revenue collection,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

NIGER

revenue targets will be assigned to the revenue agencies. In the event the revenue collected exceeds
the projected amount, the government will discuss with the IMF staff the possibility to take into
account the higher revenue into a revised budget.
33.
Domestically financed spending is set to increase by 1.5 percentage of GDP. This level of
increase reflects in large part interest charges and investment expenses in the priority sectors. Current
expenditures are projected to increase by 0.2 percentage of GDP, to 14.6 percent of GDP compared to
2016, reflecting mostly the increase in interest on the domestic debt (0.1 percentage of GDP) issued in
the regional financial market in recent years. Current primary expenditures are expected to stabilize
with a 0.3 percent of GDP increase in spending on goods and services to take into account some items
related to security spending. Wages and salaries are expected to decline by 0.3 percent following
measures to control the wage bill.
34.
There are other measures taken to further stabilize expenditures. These include
curtailing the water and electricity supplies and telephone consumption, eliminating ghost workers,
as well as unjustified allowances and streamlining the back pay that cost CFAF 9 billion at
end-October 2016.
35.
Investment spending is expected to increase substantially. Domestically financed capital
spending is projected at 6.5 percent of GDP. This represents an increase of 1.2 percent of GDP over 2016.
This increase reflects current investments in the infrastructure and social sectors. Investments using
external financing is projected to increase by 0.1 percent of GDP due to efforts to collect external
resources and improve absorption capacity. The priorities are those reaffirmed in the new development
strategy contained in the EDD, namely: (i) the security of goods and persons; (ii) urban, village and rural
water systems; (iii) continuation of the 3N initiative and food security; (iv) infrastructure and energy; and
(v) education and health.
36.
The budget framework for 2017 is fully funded. The basic budget deficit (CFAF 235.9 billion)
and the net decrease in arrears (CFAF 43.4 billion) projected in 2017 will be fully financed through
budget support and the issuance of securities in the regional market. Budget support, projected to be
CFAF 92.4 billion, includes grants from the European Union (CFAF 43.1 billion), France (CFAF 6.5 billion),
and other donors (CFAF 5 billion) as well as concessional loans from the World Bank (CFAF 29.1 billion)
and the African Development Bank (CFAF 8.7 billion). Net Treasury bond issuances would be limited to
CFAF 116.7 billion and CFAF 40 billion in bonds will be issued with local banks to absorb the arrears from
2015. In addition, CFAF 60 billion resulting from the implementation of PPP contracts are included in
non-banking domestic financing. IMF resources under the ECF should cover the residual financing gap.

H. Medium-Term Tax Policy
37.
The level of exemptions has increased significantly in recent years. The level of
exemptions granted by the tax administration and customs climbed from CFAF 194 billion in 2012 to
CFAF 300 billion in 2015, an increase of around 50 percent. While between 2012 and 2015, on
average, a high level of CFAF 86 billion was observed at the DGI, their level has more than doubled
at the customs, going from CFAF 85 billion to CFAF 222 billion, including exemptions granted in
66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

connection with the security operations. Also, with the advent of public-private partnership
contracts, the scope of exemptions broadened markedly, leading to even higher revenue losses for
the government. Moreover, although there has been considerable progress in monitoring
exemptions, management of exemptions is still highly problematic: imputations and flows are
difficult to trace.
38.
Different frameworks regulate exemptions and beneficiaries are diverse, including
public enterprises. The investment code is the most common framework. In addition, there are the
2006 mining code and the petroleum code, agreements signed by the government in the natural
resources sector, and others such as those with NGOs. The various frameworks make it difficult to
manage exemptions and makes the evaluation of tax expenditure and revenue losses more complex.
Public enterprises are among the beneficiaries of tax advantages. In general, they are in sectors in
which private initiative is still undeveloped given the absence of a competitive market. These
enterprises are in the energy, water, and distribution sectors.
39.
To broaden the tax base, the government is committed to reviewing the tax policy on
exemptions. First the government is committed to take stock of the situation through an effective
assessment of tax expenditures. The tax policy should be geared toward repatriating tax provisions
in the sectoral codes in the General Tax Code and General Customs Code for better consistency and
interpretation. For public enterprises, more transparent management is necessary, which would help
improve liquidity management. The government is committed to improving the availability and
quality of their financial information and their governance. In that context, the government is
committed to conducting a full audit of the situation of some large public enterprises. To that end, it
intends to request support from its partners.
40.
Other activities could be planned to strengthen the management of public enterprises.
For 2017, the following activities will be carried out:


Prepare a list of all public enterprises by end-March 2017.



Evaluate the direct and indirect subsidies given to public enterprises by end-June 2017.



Prepare an action plan for the financial and operational audits of key public enterprises by
end-July 2017(structural benchmark).



Finalize the study on electricity pricing and proposals to the government by June 2017.

I. Structural Reforms
The structural reforms under the new program aimed at: improving domestic tax collection; strengthen
public financial management, debt and natural resources management; strengthen the financial
sector; and improve the business climate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

NIGER

Domestic revenue mobilization
41.
The government will take steps to strengthen governance and secure revenue. As tax
payment in cash entails significant risk, the government agrees to take steps so that taxpayers can
meet their obligations using more secure instruments, for instance through the banking system.
Given the limited access to those instruments, the measure will be applied first to large taxpayers
before being expanded gradually. The DGI will prepare a roadmap to extend the measure to the
other taxpayers (February 2017).
42.
For customs, the reforms will aim at further strengthening the governance and control
of customs operations, including:


Reducing the time needed for customs tax operations clearance. The recent migration to
ASYCUDA World and the ensuing expansion of the interconnection between the main customs
posts would be helpful in that regard. The practice to delay the clearance of customs cases is
incompatible with the functionality of ASYCUDA World and will therefore be outlawed as it may
perpetuate dualism, IT procedures/manual procedures and the maintenance of various and
sundry registers whose importance seems much less obvious.



Strengthening customs cooperation and regular information exchange between customs
administrations in the sub-region. Given the delay in the interconnection between Nigerien
customs and the partner ports, the customs administration agrees to conduct a monthly check
of selected operations based on risk, using the possibility offered to it of obtaining customs
information on goods headed to Niger under international customs cooperation arrangements.
The DGD will take the steps necessary to operationalize the interconnections with Togo and
Benin customs by end-July 2017 (structural benchmark).



The requirement for all importers to have a tax identification number (NIF). Some importers clear
their merchandises through the occasional importer status. This minimizes their turnover, and
thus limits the tax administration’s ability to manage them. The DGD will take measures to
restrict occasional imports to importers who have no relationship to commercial or industrial
activities (such as personal belongings).

43.
Meanwhile customs administration will continue to implement its strategic reform
plan, through the development of institutional and organizational capacities. Some of the
reforms have already been initiated, in particular: (i) the revision of the General Customs Code, which
is awaiting validation and adoption by the National Assembly; (ii) the drafting, now in progress, of a
manual of procedures to be finalized after the adoption of the General Customs Code by parliament
during its second regular session, scheduled from September to December 2017; (iii) the adoption in
April 2016 of the draft law amending and supplementing the Law No. 2013-31 of July 4, 2013 on the
Autonomous Status of Customs Employees; and (iv) the restructuring order, signed in August 2015,
was revised after the new cabinet reshuffling.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

44.
The upgrade of the information processing capacities will be sustained. The objective of
the reforms is to speed up the implementation of an automated information system, in particular:
(i) the implementation of the IT development plan, for which were already awarded the contracts for
the interconnection and the acquisition of the systems (hardware and software) to be completed by
end-March 2017; (ii) the interconnection of all customs units to the single server beginning July 2017;
(iii) the extension of electronic customs transit to all main full-service customs posts by end-July 2017
(structural benchmark) once interconnection is completed; (iv) the full migration from ASYCUDA++
to ASYCUDA World is in progress and will be completed at end-December 2017 with the financial
support of the World Bank to acquire software and with the technical support from the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); and with hardware financing provided by the
government of Niger through its computer royalty funds; and (v) the strengthening of the computer
monitoring of exemption management and other economic regimes that contain exemptions from the
government budget, offered by the migration to ASYCUDA World.
45.
The Directorate General of Customs will also continue its customs facilitation and antifraud program. The DGD plans to carry out the following measures: (i) resumption of the study on
release with the support of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to reduce customs
clearance delays; (ii) advance customs clearance of goods following the migration to ASYCUDA
World; (iii) strengthening administrative assistance with Benin and Togo, through interconnection;
(iv) adopting a risk-based approach in scheduling inspections and strengthening inspection teams,
to be implemented by end-March 2017; (v) starting up operations of the single customs clearance
window for vehicles (GUAN) starting in November 2016 in Niamey; (vi) better monitoring of cargo
made possible by tracking system, in particular as part of operations of selling oil to prevent
products intended for export from returning to the domestic market and to prevent fraud;
(vii) expanding the activities of Bolloré to the management of the Dosso’s bonded warehouses
and implementing the convention signed with the Chamber of Commerce for managing the other
bonded warehouses starting January 2017; and (viii) improving the monitoring of re-exports to
Nigeria by constructing a 49-hectare parking space in Maradi near the Nigeria border to
accommodate all the trucks in transit.
46.
The DGI will implement the following major reforms to quickly improve the collection
of tax revenue:


Enhancing capacity-building through ongoing training of staff.



Strengthening territorial coverage by setting up tax services, mainly by establishing two new tax
centers and two tax revenue facilities in Niamey by end-June 2017.



Expanding the authority of the DGE and to some extent the Directorate of the Medium-sized
Enterprises (DME) to all businesses eligible for their control, regardless of where they are located in
Niamey, by end-March 2017. It was found that the DGE manages only mining companies located
in the interior of Niamey; all others, regardless of their size, except those covered by the Maradi
office, are managed at the regional office level with limited capacities. Starting in September 2016,
the DGI has been assessing the tax records of companies operating in the regions and to gradually

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

NIGER

transfer to the DGE all taxpayers who have reached the threshold of CFAF 500 million yearly
turnover, estimated at about 120 companies. Those companies will be transferred to the DGE by
end-January 2017 (structural benchmark). Subsequently, the other companies of the size of the
companies managed at the DME level will be transferred to the DGE. The DGI will also transfer the
management of NGOs to the DME from the DGE to ease its workload.


Implementing the VAT credit refund mechanism. For a VAT payment system to run smoothly, a
good framework is required to process applications for VAT refunds and to actually pay the
refunds. Pursuant to the May 6, 2016 order of the Minister of Finance on the procedures for
reimbursing VAT credits, an escrow account for reimbursing VAT credits was opened at the
BCEAO, and it should be funded by withholding 5-10 percent of the VAT paid to the DGE. The
DGI took steps to fund the account and to begin to clear the stock of VAT credits, estimated at
CFAF 22.1 billion at end-October 2016. The stock of VAT credit at end-2016 will be prepared and
the reimbursement mechanism of made operational by end-march 2017 by end-January 2017
(structural benchmark). Also, in consultation with the VAT creditor companies, a schedule for
quarterly reimbursements will be prepared.



The implementation of SISIC (Computerized Tax and Taxpayer Monitoring System) will continue.
In September 2015, the DGI hired a company to computerize its operations and develop the
information system, and another company was hired in March 2016 to train staff in the use of
the upcoming system. The DGI will also receive support from the World Bank through the
Project to Support Competitiveness and Growth (PRAAC) to clean up the NIF file.



Revitalize the DGI-DGD inspection teams and decentralize tax auditing.

47.
The DGI will also continue the reforms to simplify and adapt the tax law framework and
expand the tax base. Several measures are under way, including: (i) full computerization of the
services through the installation of the Computerized System for Monitoring Taxes and Taxpayers
(SISIC); (ii) monitoring the activities of the Tax Appeal Arbitration Committee (CARFI), launched
officially in May 2016 and made operational in August 2016; (iii) carrying out the study to strengthen
the statistical framework and administrative circuit of the tax base; (iv) improving the taxpayer file and
strengthening monitoring; (v) strengthening research and investigations and regularly updating the
NIF; (vi) making more use of ASYCUDA World information on taxpayers imports; and (vii) publishing
the results of the DGI/DGD joint control team.
48.
The DGI will also accelerate organizational reforms. On April 29, 2015, the Minister of
Finance issued an order (No. 0157) defining the organization scheme of the central and local DGI
offices, and in November 2015, 117 staff were also assigned to the DGI. The reorganization will
smooth the segmentation of the files processed by the various DGI services. The objective is to
improve the targeting and monitoring of different categories of taxpayers, in accordance with the
provisions establishing the thresholds for large, medium-sized, and small businesses, and the
threshold at which payment of the VAT is required, established under the 2013 Budget Law.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

49.
The new organizational architecture is being implemented. The managers of the entities
that were established have already been appointed. The improved management of the enterprises
database is already starting to produce appreciable results, with a tangible decline in the default rate
for all tax categories and a rise in the spontaneous tax declaration rate, in particular with regard to
the VAT. The default rate in the DGE remains at about 2 percent, after declining from 17.5 percent in
2014 to 12.1 percent in 2015 in the DME. Nevertheless, despite these results, the rate of following up
with taxpayers in default is still low, as well as yields from spontaneous reporting, since returns with
payment amount to just 18 percent for the DGE and 4 percent for the DME. Thus, there is still room
for improvement to further lower the default rate and control exemptions in order to raise the share
of revenue from medium-sized enterprises in total DGI revenue. In order to do this, the DME will
continue to improve the taxpayer file, strengthen the monitoring of taxpayers and send more
reminders to taxpayers, in order to further reduce the average default rate to a standard of around
10 percent compared to 12 percent at end-2016 and 20 percent at end-2015. Inspections will be
conducted to identify issues for significant default payments.
50.
The government will continue to reorganize the tax audit processes and operations.
A new organization chart of the services has been put in place with the aim of making the various
units more dynamic, in particular for those responsible for investigations, and establishing the
principle of risk-based auditing. A joint customs and the tax administration team has been put in
place, which has begun to audit 40 files, the results of which are expected very soon. The creation of
regional investigation and research teams at eight (8) regional directorates will allow for better
territorial coverage of audit activities. Tax audits will be gradually decentralized to management
units, with the Directorate of Tax Audit (DCF) taking on a strategic management role going forward,
establishing the risk areas and the timeline for audits. A pilot experiment initiated at the DME was
conclusive, and it will be widely rolled out by end-December 2017.
51.
Finally, we will strengthen the internal control and audit functions. The government is
reinforcing staff resources to improve internal control and audit. The strengthening of the
partnership between the DGTCP and Court of Auditors (with a view to better monitoring the activity
of revenue collectors and to publish procedural manuals) should bring about a higher level of
professionalism among the inspection units. With regard to internal audit, pilot projects aimed at
improving the operational efficiency have been put in place at the DGE, Niamey 2 center, and
Niamey 3 revenue office, which will be gradually extended to all DGI offices.
52.
The DGTCP will improve accounting procedures for better revenue collection. The DGTCP
will regularly monitor the newly established revenue collection agencies in order to increase the
collection of non-tax revenue for the government budget. The DGTCP will update dormant and/or
inactive accounts and will accelerate prior actions for establishing the Treasury Single Account. The
DGTCP will also strengthen activities for reducing the balance of the provisional accounts for
budgetary operations, catch up on the delays in producing government annual financial statements
(management accounts of the senior Treasury accounting officials) and monitor domestic payment
arrears and outstanding balances. For 2017, the DGTCP intends to take the following actions:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

NIGER



Regularly monitor and update dormant or inactive accounts. Close dormant accounts and
transfer credit balances to the TSA.



Regularly monitor and update the balances of government accounts in commercial banks.



Implement the legal framework for putting in place the TSA, including: (i) signing the account
management agreement with the BCEAO by end-June 2017; (ii) signing the three-party convention
with the government’s cashier bank(s) selected to offer services in areas not covered by the BCEAO
by end-June 2017; (iii) close all the accounts in the commercial bank that are covered by the TSA;
(structural benchmark) and (iv) acquire hardware for the interconnection BCEAO-DGTCP (SICA
and TSAR).



Finalize the securitization operation for arrears accumulated in 2015 (CFAF 40 billion) by endSeptember 2017.



Put in place Treasury payment facilities managers in the registry offices to improve the collection
of non-tax revenue.

Public financial management, and control of government spending
53.
Budget execution regulation and cash management will be enhanced. To eliminate
recurrent slippages in managing public spending and the accumulation of arrears, the budgetary
regulation and cash management system was strengthened in June 2016 by establishing the InterMinisterial Budgetary Regulation Committee and the Technical Budgetary Regulation Committee
and Monitoring of the Government Treasury. This arrangement is aimed to tackle the thorny matter
of matching the immense spending needs with limited and often very uncertain resources. The goal
is to provide the system with a sound decision-making base by establishing realistic commitment
and cash plans that the different stakeholders involved in the execution of government spending
would concur. The government will continue to ensure that the procurement plan is prepared in
sufficient time for the budget to be put in place at the beginning of the year. The government will
make the preparation of these plans systematic, as they are essential tools for regulating the
expenditure chain.
54.
This system will be strengthened with the availability of better information on the
expenditure chain. From now on, an integrated table on the execution of budgetary expenditures
will show in quantitative terms the movement of the credits voted by the Parliament, by nature,
between the DGB and the DGTCP. It should ultimately ensure consistency and facilitate the
reconciliation of the information produced by the two entities. The DGB will prepare this table in
conjunction with the DGTCP.

The following measures will be implemented as a matter of priority in 2017.
Adopt the 2017 draft budget law in accordance with the budgetary program for 2017 described
in paragraphs 30 and 31 (prior action). The government has adopted and send to the National

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Assembly the amendments necessary for aligning to the program the draft budget law
submitted to the National Assembly in October 2017 (prior action).


Validate by the Directorate General of Procurement Supervision and Financial Commitments the
procurement plan for 2017.



Produce the commitment plans and quarterly cash plans for the Inter-Ministerial Budgetary
Regulation Committee and send it to the IMF staff (structural benchmark).



Eliminate the duplicates and fictitious employees identified by HALCIA and eliminate unjustified
allowances.



Select two firms to assist with the civil service reform by June 2017. Both firms will carry out the
following activities: (i) reform of the statutory framework for managing the public service; and
(ii) develop integrated Pay-Civil Service databases based on a comprehensive biometric census
of civil servants. The final reports will be produced by end-December 2017.



Identify procedures of paying wages through the financial system in agreement with the bank
and microfinance institutions by end-June 2017.

56.
The government will continue to implement the action plan for public financial
management:


Continue implementing the 2009 WAEMU public financial management directives. In this
context, the DGB has prepared a roadmap to implement the program budget that is expected
to be implemented with the 2018 budget law. The preparatory stages for implementing the
program budget include: (i) the preparation in 2017 of the 2018 budget in program format;
and (ii) implementing the 2018 budget in program format. To this end, the Multiyear
Budgetary and Economic Programming Paper (2018-20 DPBEP) (structural benchmark) will be
prepared by end-May 2017 and submitted to the National Assembly by end-June 2017,
supplemented by the Multiyear Expenditures Programming Papers (2018-20 DPPD) (structural
benchmark). The other measures will follow as part of the new fiscal reform program. A
dedicated unit for implementing the public finance reform was established in the DGB in
December 2016.



Strengthen budgetary procedures in the public expenditure chain. Traditionally, the budget has
been executed in a centralized system in which the Minister of Finance is the main payment
authorization officer for the budget. Nonetheless, recently efforts to deconcentrate the budget
have been made in many ministries and institutions, in line with the March 2012 organic law.
Within this framework, the public expenditure chain was deployed in the main ministries that
execute about 80 percent of public expenditures, thus helping to reduce spending delays and
the to enhance budget deconcentration. Several regulations were enacted to allow the effective
implementation of the organic law.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

NIGER



Budgetary transparency will be strengthened, mainly through the regular publication of the
budgetary execution report. Quarterly budgetary execution reports will continue to be produced
regularly (structural benchmark) as well as the implementation status of the pro-poor
expenditures. Moreover, the budget review laws will continue to be produced on time so that
they provide information on the implementation of the budget laws.



Limit expenditures with no prior authorization to a maximum of 5 percent of total authorized
expenditures (indicative target for each quarter). These expenditures are in large part
expenditures for missions and health evacuations.



The government will avoid overlap between fiscal years. It will continue to make every effort to
ensure: (i) the implementation of the provisions for stopping commitments in relation with the
complementary period; (ii) the shortening of the complementary period from three months to
one, in line with the WAEMU directives; and (iii) the preparation by line ministries of
procurement plans and flexible credit commitment plans so that the Ministry of Finance can
prepare comprehensive procurement and commitment plans and a government cash plan in
order to prevent the concentration of expenditures toward the end of the year.



Control the wage bill and improve government human resources management will increase
productivity. From 2010 to 2015, the number of civil servants rose from 48,237 to 75,597, for a
56.7 percent increase. This reflects the need to provide basic services for an ever-growing
population. These enrollments were essentially allocated to the education, security and health
services. However, the government is aware of the necessity to streamline hiring in the civil
service in order to control the impact on the wage bill.



Implement a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The government is continuing to implement the TSA
in accordance with the conceptual blueprint it adopted in September 2015 to establish the TSA by
end-September 2016, but with some capacity constraints. In this regards, an IMF expert, using
European Union funding, will be hired to support the unit in charge of implementing the TSA.



Computerize the expenditure chain. In implementing the WAEMU directives, the government
initiated a program to adapt the computer systems for the budget preparation, management
and execution as well as for the public accounting. In this respect, the government receives a
technical assistance funded by the European Union to update or revamp the public finance
computer system managed by the Financial Data Processing Directorate in the Ministry of
Finance. In the first phase, this project foresees 8 major deliverables (in budget programming,
sectoral program budgets, and public accounting). The budget execution aspects will be covered
after a detailed analysis of the issue of deconcentrating authorization. In this context, the
government will set up an interface between the DGTCP and the DGB, which will improve the
monitoring of payment arrears.

Debt management
57.
Recognizing the pace at which Niger’s public debt is increasing, the government is
strengthening the institutional measures to its better management. Steps have been taken
to improve coordination in the preparation of loan agreements to eliminate the risks of
over-indebtedness. In this case, the government put in place the institutional framework for
implementing the June 18, 2015 decree on procedures for monitoring public debt policy and
negotiating budgetary aid to strengthen procedures for managing the public debt, eliminate the
risks of noncompliance with the criterion on new non-concessional loan agreements and
contain the impact of new loans on the sustainability of the public debt. In accordance with the
reform debt limits policy in the programs supported by the IMF, the government will update the
medium-term external borrowing plan after the adoption of the action plan of the PDES 201721. This plan will include: (i) the investment strategy and a list of investment projects; (ii) sources
of funding; (iii) uses of financing; and (iv) the debt management strategy, taking into account
considerations of debt, fiscal, and external sustainability. Borrowing plans will continue to be
prepared, in line with the national debt policy established with the technical assistance from the
World Bank and the IMF.
58.
To preserve debt sustainability, the government is in the process of restructuring the
debt stock portfolio. For monitoring the stock and debt flows, the Inter-Ministerial Committee for
Monitoring Debt Policy and Budgetary Support Negotiation will continue to express its opinion on
all new loan agreements or guarantees by the government, including financing in the natural
resources sector and all PPP agreements to ensure a detailed analysis of the sustainability of the
public debt. The Committee's review of loan agreements and CPPPs is a prerequisite for the Council
of Ministers to approve them. The government plans to continue to provide to the IMF staff a
detailed quarterly reports on the outstanding public debt, new commitments and borrowing
(including disbursements) and public debt service (structural measure).
59.
Rigorous actions will be undertaken to clear the stock of debt. The government is
planning to restructure certain contracted debts that have not yet been used. This action will be based
on the results of the AFRITAC West report showing that a significant stock of debt has been
contracted, while the terms for its mobilization have not been met. Accordingly, the government is
planning to review the US$1 billion loan contracted with the Export-Import Bank of China. The
National Assembly approved this loan in June 2014. This line of credit is expected to finance major
infrastructure projects and high-yield industrial projects. However, there are continuing delays in
implementing the conditions for its entry into force. Steps have been taken to restructure the debt.
Meanwhile, the government will present the procedures required for these restructuring by June 2017.
60.
The government remains committed to conduct a prudent debt policy that will allow
the financing of investment plans while ensuring debt sustainability. In this context, the
government will continue to limit government guarantees and will carefully assess the impact of any
new borrowing on debt sustainability. It intends to finance investment projects with concessional
resources. Borrowing will continue to be limited to high-yield, properly evaluated projects. In the
event that concessional resources will not be sufficient to finance the high-yield projects, the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

NIGER

government will consult with IMF staff to examine the possibility of modifying the financial program
so as to include non-concessional borrowing, on the understanding that this borrowing would be
compatible with debt sustainability.
61.
In this context, the government requested technical assistance from the IMF to
strengthen the institutional framework that governs PPPs, while ensuring that this framework is
consistent with the other laws and regulations, in particular the investment code. Meanwhile, the
government will refrain from engaging into new PPPs that require fiscal contributions.
62.
The government is aware that debt obligations continue to grow very rapidly with
significant borrowing costs. This pace of borrowing could pose major risks to the banking system,
with the important current program for issuing Treasury bills and bonds.
Natural resources management
63.
The implementation of measures aimed at expanding the export base for mining
products and at strengthening the transparent management of the natural resources sector
will continue. The policy of expanding the mining export base consists of encouraging operators to
orient towards the exploration of mines other than oil and uranium. In this context, the government
is in the process of granting exploration permits not only for the traditional uranium and oil sectors,
but also for other materials such as coal, limestone, and gold; with the aim of both allowing for the
diversification of partners in these sectors, and also promoting expansion of the country’s mineral
export base. In order to secure signing bonus payments when mining permits are granted, all of the
operators who wish to obtain a permit must now arrange a security deposit with a local bank. This
security deposit, which covers a certain number of financial obligations, including the signing bonus,
will be called as soon as the permit is published in the official journal.
64.
The government took steps to strengthen the contribution of the mining and oil
sectors country’s development effort. Activity in the uranium sector continues to be depressed by
low price levels. The principal mines of the AREVA group decided to maintain a low production level
pending the implementation of the Imouraren Project that has been delayed until 2021, while one of
the mining companies shut down production in 2015 pending decisions on the full liberation and
increase of the company’s capital. New mining agreements based on the new mining code have
been signed. However, due to low levels of uranium prices, the tax benefits of the new conventions
will only be marginal. The government is benefitting from a technical assistance of France to
strengthening capacities for evaluation, projection, and control of mining revenue.
65.
The government is now bolstering the means of regulation, negotiation and
implementation of contracts. In this regard, steps were taken to ensure that the Inter-Ministerial
Committee seeks to make the large projects efficient and to maximize competition. This is especially
important since the contractual price of uranium, which will expire this year (2016), must be
renegotiated. To better defend Niger’s interests in mining projects, the role of Société du Patrimoine
des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN), which manages the public investment portfolio in the mining
companies, is being strengthened, primarily with World Bank support through the Project to

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Support Competitiveness and Growth (PRAAC), which is also supporting the refurbishing of the
national laboratory.
66.
The government plans to strengthen the organization of gold production. In the last
four years, there has been renewed interest in small-scale gold production, not only in the Liptako
region in the southwest, but also in northern Niger. A governmental committee was set up to
implement a system to supervise producers, collect information on the activities, provide better
security, minimize the impact on the environment, and increase the sector’s contribution to
government revenue. In April 2016, SOPAMIN transferred 75 percent of the capital of Société des
Mines du Liptako (SML) to a private operator.
67.
The drop in oil prices and the impact of the depreciation of the CFAF against the dollar
are affecting the oil industry. In particular, the cost of the inputs necessary for refining has risen
significantly due to the sharp depreciation of the CFAF against the dollar and the relative decline in
prices of crude oil and its derivatives in the international market. Moreover, the drop in export price is
causing additional losses to SORAZ. This is why the government and partners in the sector have made
regular price adjustments by lowering the selling price from CNPC to SORAZ: from US$70 per barrel to
US$57 per barrel in March 2015, to US$50 per barrel in January 2015, to US$47 in January 2016, and
finally to $US45 in July 2016.
68.
In addition to the impact of low international prices, the oil industry continues to face
technical constraints. In 2016, the Agadem-Zinder pipeline that supplied SORAZ was plugged,
hindering SORAZ production for ten days. After the production resume, the level has reached
20,000-21,000 barrels per days since September 2016. In order to limit the degradation of the road
network and secure the distribution of refined products, a project to build a pipeline to ship refined
oil products to inland Niger and the Burkina Faso and Mali markets, will be implemented as a PPP,
of BOOT type, with no government guarantee, at a cost of about US$800 million. The government
has asked the private developer to conduct a feasibility study to better assess its impact on the
profitability of companies in the sector. The government will share the results of the study with the
IMF staff and keep them informed about the negotiation process.
69.
Efforts to improve the management of the oil industry will continue. The technical
committee in charge of looking into the current situation of the oil industry, in particular the impact
of price developments in the international market has made proposals to the government. These
proposals converge on a review of output prices at each stage of the industry to make the refinery
more efficient while minimizing revenue losses for the government and keeping the pump price
steady. The government also negotiated with CNPC the terms that govern exports of refined
products. Thus, on May 11, 2016, the government decided: (i) to increase the SORAZ selling price to
the government-owned distribution company, Société Nigérienne de Distribution des Produits
Pétroliers (SONIDEP), for domestic consumption; and (ii) that SORAZ and SONIDEP would be
authorized to export refined products jointly, equitably sharing the production on excess to local
consumption needs, based on an export floor price set monthly. The 2008 Production Sharing
Agreement (PSA) addendum taking into account these new terms, was signed on August 15, 2016,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

NIGER

and SORAZ began the export operations immediately. The government is also open to proposals
from SORAZ for measures to lower the refinery’s costs.
70.
In view of the level of finalization of the negotiations for the construction of the oil
pipeline, crude oil exports are only expected to begin in 2020. The discovery of additional oil
reserves in the Agadem oil field, allowing for the production of 80,000 barrels per day, of which
60,000 barrels per day for export, over an estimated time horizon of 25 years. This has made crude
oil export project viable for Niger. The studies performed by the Chinese partner, CNPC, led to the
selection of a crude oil transport route via a pipeline running from Niger to connect to the existing
Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The negotiations with Chad are expected to result in the establishment of
NOTCO, responsible for the construction and management of the pipeline. The arrangements for
Niger’s participation in the project are currently being worked out in accordance with the aim of
ensuring the country’s external sustainability. Work could begin in 2017. Discussions are also under
way with regard to the Chad Cameroon section of the pipeline.
71.
The government is determined to continue strengthening the institutional framework
and to ensure transparency in the energy and extractive industries. In April 2015, the
government approved the electricity code that was adopted in May 2016 by the National Assembly.
The code opens access to the power transmission grids. In September 2016 the government
adopted the implementing regulations, including the decree on the attributions, organization, and
functioning of the regulatory agency for the energy sector (ARSE) and the decree that establishes
the requirements for third parties to access the power transmission grid. Projects to build solar
power plants are now being financed through the French Development Agency, the EU, and India,
which is expected to increase substantially the supply of electricity throughout Niger and ease
supply problems from Nigeria that provide 65 percent of Niger’s consumption. With a capacity of
100 MW, the Gourou-Banda thermal power plant is expected to be up and running in early 2017.
Tests are being performed on the four generators of this standby power plant. To increase the
efficiency of the electricity sector, an audit of the national electricity company, NIGELEC, was
conducted in 2015 with the assistance of the World Bank, and a study on the pricing mechanism will
be finalized by June 2017. In 2011, Niger was declared “compliant country” under the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The latest report on royalties and tax revenue generated by
the extractive industries for fiscal year 2014 was published in 2016. The two ministries have mining
and petroleum registries that are regularly updated and accessible to the public.
Financial sector
72.
In spite of the progress that has been made in recent years, the development of the
financial sector remains weak compared to other countries in the region. In 2015, the financial
penetration calculated by the ratio of money supply to GDP is among the lowest in the world. It was
27 percent in 2015 compared to 37 percent for the average of the Sub-Saharan Africa countries.
Overall, the banking sector is well capitalized, with 11 of Niger’s 12 banks fulfilling the minimum
capital requirement. The Banking Commission placed the bank that failed to observe this criterion
under close monitoring, with restriction on its credit operations until the recovery of outstanding
loans, and an order to increase its capital.
78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

73.
Implementation of the financial sector development strategy could strengthen the
sector’s contribution to economic development. This is why the government is committed to
pursuing the implementation of the strategy with the support from the technical and financial
partners on priority interventions already identified. On the basis of the action plan defined in the
2014-19 financial sector development strategy document, in March 2016 the government
established a steering committee in charge of the reform that will be extended to the various
entities concerned (the Ministry of Finance, BCEAO, and the Professional Association of Banks,
among others). The Committee is attached to the Ministry of Finance.
74.
In July 2015, the government adopted the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion
(SNFI). This document represents an important step in the implementation of the financial inclusion
policy and it could help consolidate the results of the 2012 National Strategy for the Microfinance
Sector (SNMF). The overall cost for the five years (2016-20) implementation of the program is CFAF 34
billion, to be covered in part by donors. In terms of the potential beneficiaries, priority will be given to
small economic operators who are currently excluded from the traditional banking system, in
particular women, young people, and other poor classes that do not have access to basic financing to
start up income-generating activities.
75.
Finally, the government will continue its withdrawal from the banking system. The
process of the government’s withdrawal from the capital of banks is ongoing. The West African
Development Bank (BOAD) acquired 44 percent of BRS and the Raban Group (ORAGROUP) acquired
56 percent. The restructuring of BIA will be completed with the acquisition of the government shares
by the Banque Centrale Populaire du Maroc (BCP). However, the takeover of the bank by the strategic
shareholder was delayed by the negotiation under way with a one of the private minority shareholder.
As for BAGRI (the agricultural bank), the temporary administration was lifted on April 1, 2014 after a
period of nine months. A new board of directors was put into place and a new executive director was
appointed. The government has made significant headway in its contacts with the BOAD and some
domestic and foreign private investors regarding the transfer of the 65 percent stake that it holds in a
portage operation.
Business climate
76.
The government is committed to promote the development of a vibrant private sector.
The aim is to make the private sector the driver behind diversification of the economy and
sustainable economic growth. The government is firmly committed to improving the business
climate, which is a key to private sector development. To this end, the government created an
institutional framework to facilitate the dialogue between the administration and the private sector.
To this end, it created the National Private Investors Board (CNIP) under the authority of the Prime
Minister, and the Permanent Consultative Committee (CPC) between the Ministry of Commerce and
Private Sector Development and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Also, the government has
created an institutional design to improve the business climate indicators that consists of a technical
committee and thematic groups. Each one is in charge of improving a doing business indicator.
Thanks to the reforms implemented in 2015 and 2016, Niger moved up 10 positions in the 2017
Doing Business ranking, going from 160th in 2016 to 150th out of 190 countries assessed.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

NIGER

77.
The government is implementing measures to improve the business climate. Measures
already taken include: (i) the opening of the Business Center—Maison de l’Entreprise— to make it
easier to start a business and the implementation of an online governance system (e-Regulations);
(ii) the reduction of procedures, time, and cost of business creation through the implementation of
several reforms, including the decree of July 2014 establishing a standard model of corporate bylaws
for limited liability companies (LLCs) and another decree of the same date on the implementation of
the provisions of the Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law
(OHADA) related to Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups; (iii) the adoption of the
law regulating credit information bureaus (BICs) and set up Niger’s first BIC in March 2016; (iv) the
facilitation of cross-border trade by signing two orders in December 2014. One for the documents
required for import and export of goods, and the other for the public transportation of goods, the
types of roadside inspections, checkpoints and redress mechanism to minimize abnormal practices
in transportation of goods in Niger; and (v) the strengthening of the legal framework for settling
commercial disputes through the creation and operationalization of the Niamey Commercial Court
and the Niamey Mediation and Arbitration Center, led by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
78.
In this context, the government is continuing to put in place reforms aim at improving
Niger’s ranking in the 10 “doing business” indicators. This is done in accordance with the action
plan adopted by the CNIP to improve the business climate. For 2017, particular importance will be
placed on the following activities: (i) the government domestic arrears payment program; (ii) the
clearance of the stock of VAT credits and the improvement of the VAT credits reimbursement
mechanism to avoid accumulating new credits; (iii) the access and pricing of electricity; (iv) the
adoption by end-March 2017, with World Bank assistance, the implementing regulations for the law
on land tenure to streamline the establishment of real estate titles and transfers of ownership; and
(v) the study on para-fiscal and other taxes in the telecommunications and information and
communication technologies sector in Niger, with the World Bank support.
Demographic dividend and gender
79.
Action was taken to maximize the demographic dividend of a rapidly growing young
population. The government took steps to curtail early marriage by increasing the enrollment rate
of girls and lengthening the number of years they attend school. In 2013, during a visit by officials
from the United Nations, the World Bank, the AFDB, the AU and the AEC, the Head of State called
for a coordinated solution to the demographic challenges in the Sahel. In response to this call,
known as the “Niamey Appeal,” a regional project, “Sahel Women's Empowerment and
Demographic Dividend (SWEDD),” covering six countries (Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger and Chad), was set up with World Bank financing and UNFPA technical support.
The prime minister launched the project in Niamey in November 2015. It aims to empower girls and
women in decision-making (including through education), and to improve the demand for family
planning and quality medical services for mothers and children. The project coordination team will
be put in place by end-December 2016. Activities are also being carried out to promote gender in
line with the 2008 national gender policy (now being revised with UNFPA assistance). The

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

government will elaborate a new national gender policy to be shared with staff by end-December
2017 (structural benchmark).

J. Program Monitoring
80.
The government is committed to implement all the program measures outlined in
this memorandum. The IMF Executive Board will monitor the program every six months based on
the quantitative monitoring indicators (Table 1) and structural benchmarks (Table 2 and 3). The
first and the second reviews of the program will be based on the PCs and ITs of end-June 2017
and end-December 2017 respectively, and are expected to be completed by end-December 2017
and end-June 2018 respectively. These indicators are defined in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The semi-annual reviews will be based on the
performance criteria at end-June and end-December, and the indicative targets at end-March and
end-September. The authorities will submit to the IMF the statistical data and information in the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding, and all other information they deem necessary or that
IMF requests for monitoring purposes. During the program period, the government will refrain
from introducing or increasing any restrictions on payments and transfers related to current
international transactions without prior approval of the IMF. It will also refrain from introducing
any multiple exchange rate practices whatsoever, entering into bilateral agreements that do not
comply with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, or from introducing or strengthening
restrictions on imports for balance of payments reasons. The first semi-annual review of the
program will be based on the performance criteria at end-June 2017.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Niamey, December 21, 2016
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
indicative targets of Niger’s program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement
for the period Q1-2017 to Q1-2020. The performance criteria and indicative targets for 2017 are
set out in Table 3 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) attached to the
Letter of Intent of December 2016. This technical memorandum of understanding also sets out datareporting requirements for program monitoring.

Definitions
2.
For the purposes of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of
“government,” “debt,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:
a) Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger; it does not include
any political subdivision, public entity, or central bank with separate legal personality.
b) As specified in paragraph 8 of the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in Fund
Arrangements, adopted by the Decision No. 15688-(14/107) of the Executive Board of the
IMF of December 5, 2014, debt will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form
of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a specific
schedule; these payments will discharge the obligor of the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets, that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one
or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service
life of the property , while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments
necessary for the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the definition of
debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the
failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition
(e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
c) Domestic payments arrears are domestic payments owed by the government but not paid.
They include committed and authorized fiscal year expenditures that are not paid within 90
days. External payments arrears are payments due but not paid.
d) Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as such by
the government (including any government debt).

A. Quantitative Performance Criteria
Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definition
3.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to
the government; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the government, including government
securities issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not held by resident
commercial banks, proceeds from the sale of government assets, and privatization receipts.
4.
Net bank credit to the government is equal to the balance of government claims and
debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash holdings of the
Nigerien Treasury, secured obligations, deposits with the central bank, and deposits of the Treasury
(including regional offices) with commercial banks. Government deposits with commercial banks are
excluded from government claims insofar as they are used solely to finance externally financed
capital expenditure.
5.
Government debt to the banking system includes assistance from the central bank
(excluding net IMF financing under the ECF), the CFAF counterpart of the 2009 General SDR
Allocation, assistance from commercial banks (including government securities held by the
central bank and commercial banks) and deposits with the CCP (postal checking system).
6.
The scope of net bank credit to the government, as defined by the BCEAO, includes all
central government administrations. Net bank credit to the government and the amount of
Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market are calculated by
the BCEAO.
7.
Net nonbank domestic financing includes: (i) the change in the stock of government
securities (Treasury bills and bonds) issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market and not
held by resident commercial banks; (ii) the change in the balance of Treasury correspondents’
deposit accounts; (iii) the change in the balance of various deposit accounts at the Treasury; and (iv)
the change in the stock of claims on the government forgiven by the private sector. Net nonbank
financing of the government is calculated by the Nigerien Treasury.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

NIGER

8.
The 2017 quarterly targets are based on the change between the end-December 2016
level and the date selected for the performance criterion or indicative target.
Adjustment
9.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government will be subject to adjustment
if disbursements of external budgetary support net of external debt service and external
arrears payments, including disbursements under the ECF, fall short of program projections.
10.
If, at the end of each quarter of 2017, disbursements of external budgetary support
fall short of the projected amounts at the end of each quarter, the corresponding quarterly
ceilings will be raised pro tanto, up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion.
Reporting requirement
11.
Detailed data on domestic financing of the government will be provided monthly,
within six weeks after the end of each month.
Reduction of Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
12.
The reduction of domestic payments arrears is equal to the difference between the
stock of arrears at end-2016 and the stock of arrears on the reference date.
13.
The Centre d’amortissement de la dette intérieure de l’Etat (CAADIE) and the Treasury
are responsible for calculating the stock of domestic payments arrears on government
obligations and recording their repayment.
14.
Data on the stock, accumulation (including the change in Treasury balances
outstanding), and repayment of domestic arrears on government obligations will be provided
monthly, within six weeks after the end of each month.
External Payments Arrears
Definition
15.
Government debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the government. For the
program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments arrears on its debt
(including Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the WAEMU regional financial market), with
the exception of external payments arrears arising from debt being renegotiated with external
creditors, including Paris Club creditors.

88

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

Reporting requirement
16.
Data on the stock, accumulation, and repayment of external payments arrears will be
provided monthly, within six weeks after the end of each month.

External Nonconcessional Loans Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government
Definition
17.
The government and the public enterprises listed in paragraph 21 undertake not to
contract or guarantee external debt with an original maturity of one year or more, and having
a grant element of less than 35 percent. For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it
includes a grant element of at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element (the
difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value) expressed as a percentage
of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used
for that purpose is 5 percent.1
18.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt, as defined in paragraph 8 of the
Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements, adopted by the Decision
No. 15688-(14/107) of the Executive Board of the IMF of December 5, 2014, but also to any
obligation contracted or guaranteed for which no value has been received. However, this
performance criterion does not apply to financing provided by the IMF and to debt rescheduling in
the form of new loans.
19.
For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, the guarantee of a debt arises
from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of
nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in cash or kind).
20.
For the purposes of the relevant performance criterion, external debt is defined as
debt denominated, or requiring repayment, in a currency other than the CFA franc. This
definition also applies to debt contracted among WAEMU member countries and with WAEMU
financial institutions.
21.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, the public sector includes the government,
as defined in paragraph 2 above, and the following public enterprises: (i) Société Nigérienne
d’Electricité (Nigelec); (ii) Société de Construction et de Gestion des Marchés (Socogem); (iii) Société
Nigérienne des Produits Pétroliers (Sonidep) ; (iv) Société Nigérienne des Télécommunications (Sonitel);
(v) Société de Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (Sopamin); and (vi) Société propriétaire et exploitante de
l’Hotel Gaweye (SPEG).

1

On October 11, 2013, the Executive Boards of the IMF and of the World Bank adopted a new methodology setting a
single, unified rate to calculate the grant element of individual loans. The new unified rate is set at
5 percent (see http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator/gecalcf.aspx).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

NIGER

Reporting requirement
22.
Details on all external public sector debt will be provided monthly, within six weeks
after the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees granted by the
central government. The Ministry of Finance will regularly forward to Fund staff a list of loans in
process of negotiation. It will also prepare semiannual reports on any external debt contracted or in
process of negotiation and the terms thereof, as well as on the borrowing program for the next six
months including the terms thereof, and will forward them to Fund staff.
Short-Term External Debt of the Central Government
Definition
23.
The government will not accumulate or guarantee new external debt with an original
maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in
paragraph 8 of the Guidelines Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements, adopted by the
Decision No. 15688-(14/107) of the Executive Board of the IMF of December 5, 2014, but also to any
obligation contracted or guaranteed for which no value has been received. Short-term loans related
to imports are excluded from this performance criterion, as are short-term securities issued in CFAF
on the regional financial market.
Reporting requirement
24.
Details on all external government debt will be provided monthly, within six weeks
after the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees granted by the
government.

B. Quantitative Targets
Definitions
25.
Total revenue is an indicative target for the program. It includes tax, nontax, and special
accounts revenue, but excludes proceeds from the settlement of reciprocal debts between the
government and enterprises.
26.
The basic fiscal deficit is defined as the difference between (i) total tax revenue, as
defined in paragraph 25; and (ii) total fiscal expenditure excluding externally financed investment
expenditure but including HIPC-financed expenditure.
27.
According to the WAEMU definition, the basic fiscal deficit is defined as the basic
balance described under paragraph 26 plus budgetary grants.
28.
The floor on poverty-reducing expenditure is an indicative target for the program. This
expenditure comprises all budget lines included in the Unified Priority List (UPL) of poverty-reducing
and HIPC-financed expenditures.

90

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER

29.
A limit is set on the amount of expenditures paid through exceptional procedures
(without prior commitment) excluding debt service payments and expenditures linked to tax
exemptions. The limit is 5 percent of total authorized expenditures during the quarter for which the
target is assessed.
Reporting requirement
30.
Information on basic budget revenue and expenditures will be provided to the IMF
monthly, within six weeks after the end of each month.
31.
Information on UPL expenditures will be provided to the IMF quarterly, within six
weeks after the end of each quarter.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a
country qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of
assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the
assistance committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in
exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating

Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). In accordance with safeguards policy
requirements for regional central banks, a quadrennial safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of
West African States (BCEAO) was completed in December 2013. The assessment found that the bank
continued to have a strong control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010
Institutional Reform, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was
established to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with
more timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation by end-2014. The assessment
also identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken
to ensure its adequacy.
Exchange Arrangement
Niger is a member of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official
conversions rate of the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the
French franc of CFAF 100= F 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on
the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a
separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not
based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members. Niger, which is part of WAEMU, maintains an

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Real sector statistics: The economic accounts are compiled on an annual basis by the National
Institute of Statistics (INS), in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93) and
with 2006 as base year. Although the national accounts compilation follows best methodological
practice, the ROSC assessment found that national accounts data originate mainly from
administrative sources and the household and informal sector surveys are not up-to-date. With the
assistance of AFRITAC West, the INS has been trying to in catch up on the production of up-to-date
national accounts using the ERETES software. Progress has been slow due to staff mobility and the
project, scheduled for completion in 2016, is behind schedule. The latest available final national
accounts figures relate to 2013. The INS has started working on quarterly national accounts and has
set up a strategy to rebase its national accounts using the SNA 2008.
The INS has been compiling and publishing a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) for Niamey on a
monthly basis since early 1998 with 2008 as the base year. In concert with other WAEMU member
countries, work is under way to update the base year to 2014 and extend the coverage to other cities.
Government finance statistics: Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) with a one- to four-month lag, based on information provided by the
budget, customs, tax, and treasury directorates. The MOF reconciles the monthly spending
commitments made by the budget directorate with the payments made by the treasury, but the
results are not disseminated to the general public. Data are limited to the operation of the
budgetary central government that covers the general budget, special funds, and operations of
the treasury special accounts, but not the social security administration. Niger currently produces
the 1998 TOFE (the harmonized table of government financial operations) based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986) with some inconsistencies between
above and below the line data. However, the authorities are working toward implementing the
Directive nº10/2009/CM/UEMOA on the TOFE, which will imply migrating to the GFSM 2001.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) are compiled and
reported to the Fund on a monthly basis by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). In
August 2016, BCEAO completed the migration of Niger’s MFS to the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for the central bank and other depository corporations. These SRF-based data are being
processed by the IMF Statistics Department for publication in the November 2016 issue of IFS.
Niger does not report financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to the IMF. A technical assistance
mission on FSIs is scheduled to visit the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar, Senegal in 2017. This
mission will assist the authorities in their efforts to develop a set of core and encouraged FSIs for
deposit taking institutions for WAEMU member countries, including Niger.

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (concluded)
External Sector Statistics: Since 2011, the balance of payments and international investment
positions (IIP) statistics are compiled in conformity with the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6). The national agency of the BCEAO is
responsible for compiling and disseminating these statistics, and the BCEAO headquarters for
delineating the methodology and calculating the international reserves managed on behalf of the
participating countries. Since balance and payments and IIP statistics are published with a
significant lag—the latest data published in IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
(BOPSY) are for 2013— the quantitative analysis in this sector should be taken with caution. Niger
participates in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) since 2012.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Niger participates in e-GDDS/GDDS since 2002.
A data ROSC was published in 2006.

THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS

Paloma Anos-Casero (IDA)

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.

Risk of external debt distress:
Augmented by significant risks
stemming from domestic public debt?

Moderate
yes

Niger’s risk of external debt distress continues to be assessed as moderate, but the
heightened risk of overall debt distress requires close monitoring. This assessment is
unchanged from the previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted during the
2014 Article IV Consultation and updated during the sixth and seventh review of the
2012-16 ECF program. Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to shocks on exports
stemming from fluctuations in commodity prices (oil and uranium) and severe drought. It
is also vulnerable to a large reduction in combined FDI and project grants, and tightening
of borrowing conditions. Niger’s overall public debt dynamic also highlights
vulnerabilities, with the rapid increase in domestic debt and debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding
the benchmark under unchanged policies and larger deterioration of the fiscal balance
due to significant loss in revenue or spending pressure. This result calls for continued
efforts to improve debt management and macroeconomic policies to contain the recent
increase in public debt while strengthening fiscal revenues and for infrastructure gaps to
be filled through highly concessional funding and private sector involvement.

BACKGROUND
1.
This joint International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) DSA, updates the DSA
conducted in 2015 for the sixth and seventh reviews under the ECF. The DSA is based on end-2015
data and the baseline scenario of the 2016 Article IV consultation and the new arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility. It uses the standard debt dynamics template for low-income countries. The debt
data cover external and domestic debt of the central government, debt of public enterprises and
parastatals, state guarantees and private external debts. Domestic debt includes government arrears, debt
to the regional central bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest-BCEAO) resulting from
statutory advances, Niger’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation, government issued securities, and
government public-private-partnership contracts (PPP) to finance capital projects.

Niger reaches the HIPC completion in April 2004 and benefitted from the MDRI in 2006.

2.
The previous DSA assessed Niger’s risk of debt distress as moderate, largely on account of
government debts contracted to support the development of the natural resource sector and to
finance large infrastructure projects. The ratio of nominal external debt to GDP declined from around
54 percent in 2005 to 23 percent in 2010. Niger reached the completion point under the Enhanced Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in April 2004 and in 2006 benefited from Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) assistance from the African Development Fund, the International Development Association
(IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Niger’s public external debt has increased significantly
since 2010, as Niger has participated in developing natural resource projects1 and launched an ambitious

In 2011, the government contracted a Yuan 650 million loan for the financing of its share in the construction of the
new Azelik uranium mine, adding to the state guarantee of 40 percent of a US$880 million loan to the SORAZ refinery.

public investment program largely financed by borrowing from multilaterals and domestic resources. Public
external debt has since reached 30.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and is projected to reach 34 percent of GDP in
2016, partly due to government financing of public infrastructure. The composition of debt has also started
to shift with the share of external debt declining slightly to 73 percent of total public debt in 2015, from
about 76 percent in 2010, but with a significant increase in the share of obligations to multilateral creditors
and a decline in the share of the government guarantee extended to the refinery.
3.
Large issuance of securities has increased public domestic debt which had declined in
2013 after arrears were cleared in the context of the previous ECF (Text Table 1). The
domestic-debt-to-GDP ratio had declined from 7.4 percent in 2010 to 4.5 percent in 2013, but
leapt to 11.5 percent in 2015 as the government issued CFAF 119.8 billion in regional bonds
(CFAF 18.2 billion taken by local banks) and CFAF 38.8 billion (entirely issued to local banks) to
repay domestic arears.2 Consequently, the stock of government securities on the regional market
has increased from 1.3 percent of GDP to 8.3 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2015. Domestic
debt is expected to rise further over the medium-term reflecting the expected signing with
domestic resident investors, of public-private-partnership contracts (PPP) amounting to around
6.5 percent of GDP mainly in the area of road construction to be implemented in the next 4 years.
4.
Debt management still faces low capacity, but efforts are being made to improve its
framework. A June 18, 2015 Prime-Ministerial decree elevates the profile of the Inter-Ministerial Debt
Management Committee, which is now chaired by the Prime Minister and also, oversees overall
budget support. The committee is supported by a permanent secretary which ensures the
coordination of debt management across ministries and that contracted debts are in line with fiscal
and debt sustainability. In addition, a quarterly report on debt management is now regularly
published, along with the three year borrowing plan that defines the debt strategy and identifies the
investment projects and the sources of financing.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The medium-and long-term projections were updated to take into account recent
developments. In addition to the financing under the proposed successor ECF program, these
developments include lower oil prices, the impact of the regional security situation, delays in the
implementation of major natural resource projects, and the economic slowdown in Nigeria. The
aforementioned shocks materialized during the current ECF (2012–16) program, and contributed to
recurrent fiscal slippages. The proposed successor ECF 2017–19 program comes with a maximum access of
75 percent of quota. In the framework for the proposed program, the fiscal situation is expected to
improve only gradually in the medium-term as, relative to the previous DSA, revenue projections have
been revised down reflecting the delay in completing the large natural resource projects and with a slightly
higher expenditure envelope (on top of the already anticipated elevated spending of 2016) to preserve
room for development spending despite the anticipated continued elevated security spending (including
assistance to refugees). The increase in resource revenue is projected only in 2020 because of delays in the
implementation of the crude oil export project which is expected to be operational in 2020, while the
completion date for the Imouraren uranium project is still kept at 2021. The basic fiscal balance will
gradually improve during the course of the new program, turning to a surplus when revenue from crude oil
exports becomes significant.3
7.
Growth and exports will be mainly affected by developments in the resource sector and
spillovers from the economic downturn in Nigeria. The GDP growth path has been revised downward
to reflect the slightly weaker than expected growth outcomes and the delay in implementing the resource
projects; but longer-term growth is expected to be marginally higher once those projects come on stream.
The DSA assumes a more conservative growth in export of goods and services compared to the previous
DSA, reflecting the economic difficulties in Nigeria, Niger’s main regional trading partner; and low
commodity prices that are adversely affecting the resources sector mainly uranium exports. This scenario
results into a lower export-to-GDP ratio throughout the medium and long-term. However, public
investment in agriculture and infrastructure are expected to help promote export-oriented growth and
efficiency gains that could ultimately improve exports (Text Table 2).
8.
Reliance on external grants and loans to finance the current account deficit is projected to
decline gradually as natural resource revenues increase. Besides debt-creating flows and Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI), the current account deficit is expected to be financed by substantial inflows of project
grants and private capital.

This expenditure rationalization objective will require stepping-up the implementation of the recommendations of
the multiple technical assistance missions the country has benefitted recently including the completed 2016-public
expenditure and financial assessment. The authorities have recently put in place a budget regulation committee
under the aegis of the Prime minister to ensure spending is in line with revenue mobilization. Also the preparation of
the implementation of the 2012 budget law is progressing with the 2018 budget law expected to be prepared in the
form of program budgeting. The recruitment in the near future of a long-term technical assistant, will accelerate the
implementation of Treasury single account that has been delayed due to lack of capacity. Finally, on the basis of the
recommendation of the 2016-PEFA report, the government will elaborate a new medium-term public finance reform
program supported by the donors to ensure budget execution is in line with best practices and compatible with the
long-term fiscal sustainability objectives.

The macroeconomic outlook remains subject to numerous risks mostly tilted to the
downside. The country remains vulnerable to the effects of exogenous shocks, including political tensions,
fluctuations in commodity prices, and frequent weather-related shocks (drought and flooding) on
economic activity and on food security. The continued low oil and uranium prices may cause further delays
in implementing the natural resource projects. Also, the persistence or intensification of violent conflicts
could divert resources from social needs and development projects. On the upside, a rebound in uranium
and oil prices, and recovery in the Nigerian economy would substantially increase Niger’s exports, and also
improve fiscal space.

EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
10.
The baseline scenario assumes that the US$1 billion credit line from EximBank of China4 will
be disbursed progressively over the period of 2020-27, when the export of crude oil starts. The
baseline scenario assumes that US$50 million of the Chinese master facility is disbursed in 2020, US$100

4

This line of credit, considered as a facility in total of US$1 billion, was signed in September 2013 and several loan
agreements could be negotiated under the facility between the governments of Niger and China. Under the master
facility agreement, individual loans are subject to 2 percent interest rate, 25 years, maturity, and 5 years, grace period.
Any contracts under the facility should be tied to a Chinese contractor and are earmarked for infrastructure projects
with high economic rates of return. Any potential projects need the preliminary approval of Eximbank of China about
their eligibility.

million in 2021 and the same amount in 2022, and the disbursement of the remaining US$750 million will
be spread over the following years.5
11.
In the baseline scenario, external debt ratios remain below their policy-dependent
thresholds throughout the projection period (2016−36). The present values (PV) of debt-to-GDP,
debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios are expected to remain below the relevant thresholds over
the medium term. Those ratios will slightly increase in the next 3 years, should the government borrow
to finance its infrastructure investment plans. The debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios will
decline starting 2020 when the export of crude oil is expected to start, boosting both exports and
growth (Figure 1). However, further delay in the resource projects could lead the debt-to-exports ratio
to breach the threshold putting significant pressures on debt and fiscal sustainability. As the baseline
debt-to-exports ratio increases to less than 5 percent of breaching the threshold, the probability
approach was applied, which highlighted all debt ratios remain well below their relevant thresholds
during the entire projection period (Figure 3).
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
12.
Under the most extreme shock scenarios, only the present values (PV) of debt-to-export
ratio breach the relevant thresholds; the other debt ratios and the debt service ratios remain under
their relevant thresholds (Figure 1). Under the historical scenario, which sets key macroeconomic
parameters at their historical values, the debt ratios increase in the long term leading the debt-to-GDP ratio
to breach the threshold in 2032 and the debt-to-export ratio to breach the threshold in 2028 and stays
above the threshold. The stress tests’ results suggest:


The most extreme shock that affects the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio (Figure 1, Table 1b)
is a 30 percent depreciation of the national currency in 2017. Under that shock, the ratio of
debt-to-GDP will rise to almost reach the policy dependent threshold of 40 percent in 2014-25
before declining progressively to 31.7 percent at the end of the projection period.



The most extreme shock that affects the PV of external debt-to-export ratio (Figure 1, Table 1c)
is an export shock−that assumes export values grow at their historical average minus one
standard deviation in 2017 and 2018, stemming from disruption in the oil industry, low uranium and
oil prices, and severe drought, lowering the country’s exports. In this case, the ratio breaches the
threshold in 2017 and increases to a maximum of 230.5 in 2018 before starting to decline as crude oil
exports boost aggregate exports. The debt-to-export ratio breaches also the threshold in case of:
(i) a shock on non-debt creating flows; (ii) a combined shock on growth and non-debt creating flows;
and (iii) a tightening of new borrowing terms.

5

The refinancing loan for the construction of the SORAZ refinery (US$880 million), that was reflected in the previous
DSA is not taken into account in this current DSA as negotiations have stalled over the last two years; the old debt is
assumed to continue to be serviced normally.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGER



Finally, under the most extreme shocks, the PV of external debt-to-revenue and the debt service
ratios6 remain under their policy relevant thresholds. (Figure 1, Table 1d, 1e, and 1f).

13.
Based on Niger’s high vulnerability to shocks, staff developed two alternative
scenarios. The scenarios simulate security and terms of trade shocks.7 In both scenarios, staff
assume also a one-year delay of the crude oil export project completion. The simulation results
show a significant macroeconomic impact, with GDP growth declining by 0.3 to 0.8 percentage
points, and the current account widening by 0.8 to 1.7 percent of GDP, causing reserves to fall. The
fiscal stance would also deteriorate as revenue would fall and security spending expand. From a DSA
perspective, while under the security shock the debt ratios would remain under their respective
thresholds, the large impact of the terms of trade shock on exports would cause the debt-to-export
ratio to exceed the threshold by 15.4 percent in 2017 (Figure 4).

PUBLIC DSA
Baseline
14.
The baseline scenario assumes that the government will continue to rollover the
outstanding stock of treasury bills, issuing on annual average CFAF 130 million in treasury bonds
over the medium term and around CFAF 70 billion in the long-term, as revenue collection improves.
Niger’s domestic debt, 11.5 percent of GDP in 2015, is projected to peak at 15.9 percent of GDP in 2018 as
the government implements the 6.5 percent of GDP of PPP contracts. The 2016 budget includes a planned
bond issuance of CFAF 170 billion of which CFAF 40 billion to be issued to local banks to repay domestic
arears. However, due to delays in making the arrangement with the banks, the CFAF 40 billion security
issuance will only be completed in 2017. The domestic public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall over the
long-term, reaching 1.7 percent of GDP in 2036. However, this rapid buildup in domestic borrowing,
expected to generate debt service equivalent to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2017, could engender significant
risks to the government’s financial position if regional liquidity conditions deteriorate.
15.
The inclusion of Niger’s domestic public debt in the analysis highlights the
vulnerability of the baseline scenario, as the public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the benchmark
under the extreme shock scenario. Under the extreme shock with the primary balance set at the
historical average minus one standard deviation in 2017-18, the public debt to GDP ratio will exceed
the benchmark between 2018 and 2021 and decline in the long term. Also with an assumption of no
improvement in the fiscal situation—the primary fiscal balance remaining at the 2016 level, a deficit
of 5.3 percent of GDP—public debt will rise continuously. Consequently, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
will exceed the benchmark in 2025 and reach 79.6 percent in 2036, significantly above the threshold
of 56 percent of GDP (Figure 2, Table 2b).

The spike in debt service ratios in 2016 in the previous DSA was due to the SORAZ refinancing loan, which is now
excluded for reasons provided in Footnote 5.
7

The security shock considers a security situation that generates 1 percent of GDP security spending and affects
trade and some economic activities. The terms of trade shock considers a 25 percent decrease of the baseline oil and
uranium price in 2017.

PRIVATE EXTERNAL DEBT DYNAMICS
16.
The current DSA includes identified private debt flows, linked to the large oil and uranium
projects. It incorporates the contracts of a loan by the SORAZ refinery (60 percent privately owned), part of
the FDI that will finance the Niamey-Cotonou railroad and the Imouraren uranium mine project. The stock
of external private debt is estimated at 27.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and is projected to stabilize at just
above 9 percent of GDP over the long run. This is lower than in the previous DSA, reflecting a downward
revision in FDI due to persistent security challenges and lower commodity prices.

CONCLUSION
17.
Niger continues to be assessed as being at moderate risk of external debt distress —
unchanged from the previous DSA conducted during the 2014 Article IV and updated during the sixth and
seventh reviews of the ECF 2012-16 program. Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to shocks on exports
stemming from the collapse of commodity prices (oil and uranium) and severe drought. It is also vulnerable
to a large reduction in the combined FDI and donor project supports and tightening of borrowing
conditions. Niger’s overall public debt dynamics also highlights vulnerabilities, with the rapid increase in
domestic debt and total public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the benchmark under an assumption of
unchanged policies and larger deterioration of the fiscal balance due to significant loss in revenue or
spending pressures. In addition, further delay in the implementation of the resource projects could add
significant pressures on debt and fiscal sustainability.
18.
Niger’s continued moderate risk of debt distress calls for the authorities’ sustained
commitment to strengthen debt management and moderate the amount of new borrowing.
The Inter-Ministerial Debt Committee should play an active role in strengthening institutional
coordination and streamlining debt approval processes. In addition, the committee should continue
to be actively involved in the evaluation of PPP contracts to ensure they are in line with procurement
standards, the government borrowing plan, and debt sustainability. Staff advises the government to
refrain from signing new PPP contracts until a new legal framework for PPP is established.
Furthermore, staff recommends restricting external financing to grants and concessional borrowing.
Also, staff encourages the authorities to review the debt portfolio on the basis of the Afritac-West
technical assistance’s recommendations to address the large amount of debt signed but not yet
disbursed including the Chinese master facility agreement signed in 2013. For the latter it is
important to ensure that loans contracted under the facility finance self-sustaining development
projects. The authorities are also encouraged to build buffers to cope with exogenous shocks,
strengthen revenue administration, and prioritize spending needs. Finally, continued technical
assistance in debt management is recommended to help build capacity in developing
comprehensive borrowing plans on a regular basis, that are consistent with medium-term debt
sustainability and aligned with development priorities.
19.
Finally, containing government’s borrowing to local banks could help to reinforce the
stability of the banking system and limit crowding out of the private sector. Like in other
WAEMU countries, banks’ exposure to government debt raises concern over systemic financial risks
from sovereign default as fiscal positions become tight. Reducing government debt will reduce risks

to the banking system and free resources to finance private sector development, which is essential
for strong and sustained long-term growth.
20.
The Nigerien authorities welcomed the conclusions of the DSA that are broadly
consistent with the previous DSA and also with their own assessment. The authorities reiterated
their commitment to finance development projects primarily through grants and concessional loans.
They also noted their intention to streamline the debt portfolio to ensure that contracted loans that
have not been disbursed for many years are canceled to provide room for other priority projects.
They also agreed to strengthen revenue mobilization and reinforce spending control to minimize
the need for borrowing (including through bonds) to preserve fiscal sustainability. The authorities
also noted the need to reinforce the debt management framework and to design a PPP framework
that will minimize the budgetary risks from PPP implementation.

Box 1. Niger: Baseline Scenario Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2016−36 is based on the following assumptions:

10



Real GDP growth is projected to maintain 5.2 percent average growth over the medium-term, lower
than assumed in the previous DSA, as the growth rebound expected from the resource sector is now
expected only from 2020 due to the delays in completing the major uranium and crude oil projects.
Consequently, average annual growth rate in the longer-run is higher at 5.4 percent. Continuation of
steady agricultural production and of government food security program will help maintain inflation
fairly stable at about 2 percent over the projection period in line with the WAEMU target. The export
price for Niger’s crude oil is assumed to be on average 85 percent of the international oil price
projected in the current World Economic Outlook.



Total revenue-to-GDP ratio (excluding grants) will decline from about 18.1 percent in 2015 (including
1.2 percent of GDP of exceptional revenue) to 15.3 percent in 2016 as a consequence of weak commodity
prices and the slowdown in the Nigerian economy. This ratio will rise to average 21.8 percent in 2036
about the same level assumed in the previous DSA, reflecting the improvements expected from the
ongoing tax administration reforms and the expected revenue boost from the natural resource sector.



Primary fiscal expenditure was 32.4 percent of GDP in 2015 driven by large spending needs for security,
humanitarian assistance and health, education, and transport infrastructure priorities envisaged in the
Plan de Developpement Economique et Social (PDES) 2012–15. Current expenditure is expected to decline
gradually from 15.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 12 percent of GDP in 2036, while capital expenditure is
expected to decline only gradually reflecting the large infrastructure needs of the country, and as a result,
primary fiscal expenditure is projected at 24.1 percent of GDP in 2036. The basic balance (the fiscal
balance net of grants and externally-financed capital expenditure) will gradually converge to zero and
remain positive in the long run. The overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis excluding grants) will also
decline from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 3 percent of GDP in 2036.



The non-interest current account deficit is projected to gradually decline to 10.4 percent of GDP at the
end of the projection period, from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2015. Export volumes would increase, mainly
driven by much larger export growth of crude oil and uranium (after oil production comes on stream in
2020 and the Imouraren mine in 2021). The exports volume of non-resource products is also expected to
grow as a result of the expected impact of gradual economic diversification and implementation of the
second phase of the 3N (Nigériens Nourissent les Nigériens) initiative. Imports of goods and services,
representing 41.1 percent of GDP in 2015, would slowdown initially, in line with the decline of FDI-related
imports, before stabilizing at 35.6 percent of GDP in 2036.



Net FDI is projected to increase in the medium-term from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to above 10 percent
of GDP in 2018-19 with the construction of the new oil pipeline. As assumed in the previous DSA, it is
expected to decrease afterward as large investment projects come to completion, and earlier FDI loans
are reimbursed. FDI is projected to average 7 percent of GDP in the long term.



The average interest rate on external debt is projected to be around 2.1 percent. The rate of external debt
accumulation is expected to decrease after the major resources projects are completed and the Chinese
master facility is fully disbursed by 2026. The concessionality of new borrowing will decline from an
average of 33.5 percent in 2016 to about 30.2 percent in 2036 as the share of commercial loans increases
gradually to 10 percent of total loans. The analysis assumes continued inflow of grants and loans of about
on average 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The discount rate remains at 5 percent.



The domestic debt profile assumes no net accumulation of domestic arrears and that securitized
domestic arrears will be repaid over the next 5 years. The baseline includes an average bond issuance
of about CFAF 90 billion a year after 2017 under the present terms of regional bonds for Niger (i.e.,
6.3 percent interest rate, 5 years’ maturity and 1-year grace period) and 6.5 percent of GDP of PPP
contracts to be implemented in the next four years starting 2017.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by Mr. Sembene, Executive Director for Niger and Mr. Alle,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director for Niger
January 23, 2017
1.
Our Nigerien authorities greatly appreciate Fund’s continuous support to the
implementation of their economic and financial policies. They welcome the constructive
policy dialogue that Management and staff continue to maintain with them as well as the
Board’s constant support.
2.
Fund program engagement has been instrumental in helping Niger to maintain
macroeconomic stability and advance the authorities’ reform agenda amidst a challenging
environment characterized by a succession of disruptive shocks, including security and
climatic shocks, the fall in prices of oil and minerals, and a sharp drop in trade with
neighboring countries. While delays in implementing some elements of the previous ECF
arrangement were subsequently noted, major inroads were made in achieving the broad
objectives of the Fund-supported program.

Recent Developments and Outlook
3.
The recent period has been characterized by a benign macroeconomic environment
challenged by exogenous shocks of different nature. Despite the authorities’ efforts in
maintaining macroeconomic stability, the economy was adversely affected both by low
international prices for uranium and petroleum products, by security issues and the economic
downturn in Nigeria, the main trading partner. As a result, real GDP improved markedly in
2016 compared to the previous year although the pace of growth was slower-than-anticipated
pace. Inflation remains subdued and well below the regional target.
4.
The fiscal stance in 2016 suffered from the revenue shortfalls induced by the
difficulties in the mining, oil, and telecommunication sectors, lower trade flows with Nigeria,
(exports and re-exports were down by 30.1 percent) as well as weakness in tax and customs
administration. The authorities responded to the revenue shock by freezing planned nonpriority-expenditures while safeguarding salaries, debt service payments, and security
spending.
5.
Our Nigerien authorities also implemented a number of structural reform measures. In
the fiscal sector, they undertook important reforms to strengthen tax and customs
administration. A major step was made in terms of revenue mobilization, with the
interconnection of the main customs offices which collect more than 90 percent of customs
revenue. In public financial management, budget procedures were enhanced; exceptional
spending procedures have been reduced significantly and “an Inter-Ministerial Budgetary
Committee was established in 2016 to provide a mechanism to align expenditure
commitments with resource availability and thereby reduce the incurrence of arrears.” A
similar committee was created to oversee debt management and has been producing reports
regularly. In the financial sector, a strategy has been adopted with an emphasis on financial
inclusion for targeting populations with limited access to financial services. Progress was

2
also made in enhancing the business environment with the adoption of a new investment
code and the operationalization of a one-stop-shop for starting a business.
6.
Our authorities concur with staff on the overall positive outlook despite challenges
and risks. Growth is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2017, and to average 5.4 percent
during 2017-19. The expansion of irrigated agriculture under the national food security
program (3N Initiative) should be the main driver of growth. Security issues and persistent
weak commodity prices are downside risks while a rebound in uranium and oil prices or a
recovery in the Nigerian economy would boost Niger’s fiscal space and growth. The
authorities are committed to conduct policies aimed at strengthening economic fundamentals
and to continue their efforts of minimizing the impact of adverse developments.
Article IV Policy Consultation
7. Going forward, the authorities are determined to pursue steadfastly the reforms already
initiated in the context of their new 2016-2019 development plan. The 2016 Article IV policy
discussions provided a valuable opportunity for the authorities to discuss with Fund staff
some of the key growth-promoting features of this plan, notably those aimed at increasing
income-earning opportunities for women, mitigating the adverse impact of natural disasters,
and reaping the potential demographic dividend.
8.
It is the authorities’ intention to continue to make progress in addressing gender
inequality, notably by providing vocational education and finance to women with a view to
making them become more economically active actors. The government will also scale up its
investment in human capital with the aim at fully reaping the demographic dividend. In
addition, the authorities’ efforts to strengthen their disaster risk management framework will
greatly benefit from the useful recommendations formulated by staff in their well-written
report and Selected Issues paper.
Policies and Reforms under the New ECF Arrangement
9.
The new ECF-supported program (2017-20) seeks to maintain macroeconomic
stability while creating fiscal space for infrastructure development, meeting the new elevated
security risks, and for enhancing social spending. The program will build on progress
achieved over the past period in many areas, including in budget management, debt
management, customs and tax administrations and the business climate. For the period ahead,
our authorities are committed to further making progress in enhancing macroeconomic
management, bolstering structural reforms, accelerating diversification for enhancing
economic resilience, improving social indicators and reducing poverty. To this end, reforms
envisaged under the new program are anchored on the authorities’ overarching development
goals as laid out in their Economic Development Document (EDD).
10.
Under their new economic and financial program, our authorities will strengthen
reforms underway and embark on new ones as well. The broad areas identified in this regard
include the fiscal and financial sectors, debt management, natural resource management,
business environment and economic diversification. For 2017 as well as the medium term,

3
the authorities have planned reforms which are based on the EDD’s broad objectives of
“enhancing the macroeconomic environment to achieve accelerated growth and meet the dual
objectives of improving incomes and job creation, while strengthening the foundations for
sustainable development.” The authorities are confident that sustained reform efforts will
lead to accelerating growth so as to significantly reduce poverty and curb unemployment.
Fiscal policy and debt management
11.
Fiscal policy will emphasize broadening the tax base to enhance revenue
mobilization, in line with the overarching program objective of creating fiscal space for
infrastructure and security and social spending. To this end, the authorities are committed to
strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administrations, and improving tax
collection, with the view to reducing dependence on volatile natural resource revenue. An
increase in indirect tax revenues together with measures to improve governance in revenue
generating agencies is expected to help boost revenue. Measures to modernize the customs
administration and enhance transparency and governance include the finalization of the
electronic inter-connection of all the customs offices; the deployment of ASYCUDA World
Software to all main offices and the introduction of tax identification numbers for all
importers.
12.
With Fund technical assistance, the tax base will also be broadened by including more
enterprises into the large enterprises Directorate. In the same vein, tax exemptions will be
streamlined through improved monitoring and control and aligned with best practices.
Overlapping fiscal advantages in sector-specific codes will also be brought into the customs
and tax codes. A similar effort will be made to limit exemptions in the sector of SOEs; a
thorough evaluation and an audit are planned to help clarify financial linkages of the state
and SOEs to limit fiscal risks and reduce exemptions.
13.
On the expenditure side, outlays will reflect priorities in the EDD, notably public
infrastructure, health and education. Current primary expenditures are expected to stabilize
while better control measures would help to reduce the wage bill by 0.3 percent owing to
control measures. Other measures to contain spending, include curtailing the water,
electricity and telephone consumption and eliminating ghost workers. Arrears clearance will
also be continued. These efforts will make room for investment spending which is expected
to increase substantially. Indeed, domestically financed capital spending is projected at 6.5
percent of GDP, which is 1.2 percent of GDP higher compared to 2016.
14.
The authorities remain committed to maintaining debt sustainability going forward.
They will continue to strengthen the debt management framework and implement prudent
debt management policies. In this connection, they are cognizant that their efforts to contain
the fiscal deficit will be key. On the basis of the fiscal measures being implemented, the
deficit of the basic balance is projected at 4.9 percent of GDP in 2017. However, the
authorities are confident that, with the major reforms they are undertaking, over the medium
term the deficit will converge to the 3 percent of GDP convergence criterion.

4
Moreover, the authorities will work on a new framework for PPPs with the view to
addressing fiscal risks and safeguarding debt sustainability. In this endeavor, Fund technical
assistance will be of paramount importance.
Financial sector policy
15.
Though the overall financial system is still shallow, the banking system is well
capitalized. The authorities are committed to implement both the National Financial Sector
Development Strategy (NFSDS) and the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion. Under
these strategies, “the government’s objective is to make available through 2021, CFAF 35
billion in credits to small businesses, in particular those run by women and young
entrepreneurs.” Donor assistance will also be mobilized for this microfinance program at a
forthcoming Round Table to be held in 2017. The government will also continue its divesture
from the banking system. In this regard, discussions are underway with private entities
interested in the government’s stakes that remain in banks.
Natural resource management
16.
The authorities are committed to enhancing the management of natural resource
endowments and bolster the contribution of the sector to the country’s overall development.
In this regard, efforts are being pursued in three directions. First, the government has
strengthened the ties of investors with local banks to ensure that contract signing bonuses are
paid when mining permits are granted. Second, the government is diversifying the mineral
export base away from uranium and oil and investors as well. It is also taking steps to attract
new investors and is in the process of granting exploration permits not only for the traditional
uranium and oil but also for other minerals such as coal, limestone, and gold. Third, with
technical assistance from France, the authorities are enhancing capacities for evaluation,
projection, and control of mining revenue. In the same vein, the government is now
revamping institutions for regulation, negotiation and implementation of contracts.
Business environment and economic diversification
17.
Steady efforts have contributed to improve the business environment as evidenced by
Niger’s moving from the 176th place in 2014 to 150th in the World Bank 2017 Doing
Business report. Achievements include the shortening of the time and procedures required
to start a business, improved access to credit information with the establishment of a credit
bureau, and the creation of a specialized commercial court which makes contracts
enforcement easier. The authorities will continue their efforts to strengthen an enabling
environment for business, with the aim of buttressing economic diversification. In this
regard, their actions to further improve competitiveness, will encompass measures aimed at
overcoming barriers identified in dealing with construction permits, getting credit, and
paying taxes.

5

Conclusion
18.
Notwithstanding the variety of severe shocks that hit Niger in recent years, the
authorities’ policy implementation has played a key role in maintaining macroeconomic
stability. In this context, the predecessor ECF arrangement has helped the country cope
successfully with the decline in international mineral prices, security challenges and the
negative spillovers of the economic downturn in the main trading partner. These adverse
developments are far from fading away and add to the structural bottlenecks facing the
Nigerien economy, notably the infrastructure gap, narrow export base, gender inequality and
high poverty.
19.
Against this backdrop, Fund continued engagement under the ECF will provide an
appropriate anchor for the policies set forth in the government’s Economic Policy Paper for
2016-20. In this regard, the fiscal program aims to create the needed room for key
infrastructure outlays and social spending. Moreover, implementation of the set of structural
reforms envisaged in the program context will contribute to further improving
macroeconomic stability and resilience and paving the way for economic diversification,
sustained growth, and poverty reduction.
20.
In this light, we would appreciate Directors’ support to the authorities’ request for a
new arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility.
