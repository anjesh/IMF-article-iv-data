STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 24, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook. The economy is slowing against the backdrop of a deteriorating
external environment and softening exports. While the outlook is extraordinarily
uncertain, growth is expected to slow significantly in 2012 as weaker external demand
and global risk aversion weigh on exports, investment and consumption. Inflation is
also expected to ease.
Risks and spillovers. The main near-term risks are a protracted slowdown in advanced
economies and a sharp increase in global financial stress. Given Singapore’s openness,
these shocks would hit the economy severely through weaker exports, reduced capital
inflows, slower credit, and a fall in financial market activity. The authorities have
sufficient policy space to deploy a decisive response in case these risks materialize.
Credit growth. The brisk expansion in credit after the 2008−09 recession merits close
monitoring. Although partly reflecting the economic recovery and now moderating,
fast credit growth could lead to deteriorating credit quality if the cycle turns abruptly. A
rapid increase in foreign currency lending may also raise the risk of funding strains.
Housing market. Housing prices rebounded strongly after the crisis. The authorities
have responded actively through several measures aimed at containing demand and
boosting supply, and prices are now easing and likely to moderate further. Even in the
event of sharp price movements, risks for growth and financial stability seem
contained.
Rebalancing. Given Singapore’s large external and fiscal reserves, a looser fiscal stance
and continued real exchange appreciation over the medium term would help boost
domestic demand.
Making growth more inclusive. Inequality has been rising and is among the highest
in Asia. The authorities’ strong focus on addressing this issue could be complemented
with additional policies to strengthen the existing safety nets.

exports and investment are partly offset by
robust consumption. International financial
markets have experienced significant
turbulence since the second half of 2011. This
has prompted sell­offs of emerging market
(EM) assets and portfolio outflows. Singapore
has not been spared (see paragraph 6).

3.

Domestic economic activity. The

Singaporean economy rebounded sharply
from the 2008−09 global downturn, posting
growth of 14.5 percent in 2010 (Figure 1).
However, activity is slowing markedly, dragged
down first by supply-chain disruptions from
Japan’s March 2011 natural disaster and more
recently by weaker global demand and
negative confidence effects. Trade-related
sectors, particularly electronics, have been
especially affected. The weaker environment
has subdued private investment. Consumption,
however, has been supported by a strong
labor market (exacerbated by the
government’s tightening of foreign worker
levies), with unemployment falling to 2 percent
in September 2011.

2.

Political context. Singapore’s ruling

People’s Action Party (PAP) was returned to
power after the May 2011 general elections,

Box 1. Singapore: Policies to Address Rising Housing Prices
Background. Singapore’s housing market is dominated by public housing, which covers more than
80 percent of the population. Public housing is run by a dedicated government agency: the Housing
Development Board (HDB). There is a secondary resale

Policies. The authorities have introduced several policy
measures in a number of steps since 2009.



September 2009: The interest absorption scheme
(which allowed some deferment of principal payments) and interest-only housing loans were disallowed.



February 2010: Loan-to-value (LTV) ceilings were lowered from 90 percent to 80 percent for all private
property loans. A seller’s stamp duty (SSD) was introduced on all private properties sold within one year
of purchase at the rate of 1 percent for the first S$180,000, 2 percent for the next S$180,000, and
3 percent for the remaining balance.



August 2010: The SSD was extended to sales within three years of purchase, with one-third, two-thirds, or
full SSD rates depending on the length of the holding period. LTVs ceilings were lowered from 80 percent
to 70 percent for buyers with one or more outstanding housing loans.



January 2011: The SSD was extended to sales
within four years and rates raised to 16 percent for
sales within a year, decreasing gradually thereafter
to a minimum of 4 percent in the fourth year. LTVs
were lowered to 60 percent for individuals with
one or more outstanding loans and to 50 percent
for nonindividuals.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Singapore: CPF-Related Benefits and Workfare Schemes
Singapore’s social security framework is based on the principles of self reliance, a strong work
ethic and family support. In addition to tax funded subsidies for healthcare and housing, the
framework consists of two main components:
1. Central Provident Fund (CPF)-Related Benefits
The main safety nets are associated with the CPF. This is a defined contribution plan with
mandatory contributions from both employees and employers, and covers around 90 percent
of the resident population. It has various accounts and associated benefits:


Housing. Around 60 percent of employer and employee contributions to the CPF are
directed to the Ordinary Account. Members have used these savings mainly to buy
subsidized homes from the Housing Development Board, as reflected in a home ownership
rate of about 90 percent amongst residents.



Pensions. Retirement income comes from the Special Account, which receives
around 20 percent of CPF contributions, and the remaining balance in the Ordinary
Account. According to OECD estimates, net replacement rates (that is, retirement incomes
relative to incomes during working life) are between 10−20 percent, which are lower than
virtually all countries in the Asia Pacific region and well below the average for OECD
countries (around 70 percent).



Health. The remaining share of CPF contributions go to the Medisave Account, under
which savings can be used to pay for medical expenses and medical insurance. There are
also subsidies of up to 80 percent for medical care at public hospitals, which all
Singaporeans can access.

2. Workfare
In addition to the CPF, there is a system of workfare, which comprises an income supplement
and a training subsidy for workers who earn less than S$1,700 per month. Job placement and
training services are also available for the unemployed. Singaporeans can also approach the
Community Development Councils, which have access to other government funds, to help
address their financial and medical needs.

VI. Projected Payments to the Fund: None.
VII. Exchange Arrangement:
Singapore’s exchange rate is classified as
“other managed.” The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) monitors its value against an
undisclosed basket of currencies and
intervenes in the market to maintain this value
within an undisclosed target band. The
U.S. dollar is the intervention currency.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains
an exchange rate system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Singapore maintains restrictions on
Singapore˗dollar credit facilities to, and bond
and equity issuance by, nonresident financial
institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds
obtained by nonresident financial entities
(such as banks, merchant banks, finance
companies, and hedge funds) from loans
exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for
equity listings or bond issuance to finance
activities outside Singapore have to be
swapped or converted into foreign currency
upon draw-down. Financial institutions are
prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar
credit facilities in excess of S$5 million to
nonresident financial entities if there is reason
to believe that the Singapore-dollar proceeds
may be used for Singapore-dollar currency
speculation.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Singapore is on the 12˗month consultation
cycle. The 2010 Article IV consultation
discussions were held during
May 11−17, 2010; the Executive Board
discussed the staff report (IMF Country Report
No. 10/226) and concluded the consultation
on July 16, 2010.
IX. FSAP Participation:
The FSAP was undertaken in conjunction with
the 2003 Article IV consultation. The FSSA was
published as IMF Country Report No. 04/104.
An FSAP update is scheduled for 2013.
X. Technical Assistance: None
XI. Resident Representative:
Mr. Ravi Balakrishnan

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II: SINGAPORE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to
improve the quality of data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would enhance the basis for
macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data
sources and methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted
in 2006, resulting in lower statistical discrepancies. (DOS) has completed the rebasing of the
Singapore’s national accounts to reference year 2005.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base
year 2009. The CPI is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and
composition of goods and services consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published
nor provided to the Fund. Interest and dividends on these assets and debt service payments on
domestic debt made from the extra budgetary Government Securities Fund are published on an
annual basis. Data on the financial position of the consolidated public sector are not published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report
forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data
to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: Data on the international investment position (IIP) are not provided on a
disaggregated level as suggested by the Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition). Also, the
IIP position does not include all the net foreign assets held by Singapore’s Government Investment
Corporation, although the associated flows are included in the balance of payments data. The
authorities are improving over time the reporting of the international investment position to the IMF.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These include
the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the
data; and the dissemination of advance release
calendars; quarterly certification of the metadata
posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board; and provision of information to
allow users to assess data quality.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Singapore
On February 8, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Singapore. 1
Background
The Singaporean economy emerged strongly from the 2008−09 global financial crisis, with real
GDP growth reaching 14½ percent in 2010. However, the transition from recovery to sustained
growth was disrupted by an abrupt deterioration in the external environment from the second
quarter of 2011. This has dragged down exports, particularly of electronics, and weighed down
on investment, leading to slower economic growth. Consumption has remained resilient,
however, on the back of a robust labor market.
Headline inflation rose steadily through mid˗2011 and has remained elevated thereafter, driven
up by accommodation and transport costs. Core inflation—which excludes those two
components—remained low and relatively stable from mid˗2010, but has risen slightly in recent
months reflecting higher food and service prices.
Bouts of global financial market turbulence in the second half of 2011 led to a decline in
Singapore’s stock market index, a depreciation of the Singapore dollar, and episodes of
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

heightened volatility in equity and currency markets. Domestic credit, however, has been
expanding rapidly, particularly business loans, reflecting in part the strong economic recovery
but also low interest rates and rising credit demand from the Asia region. Public and private
residential property prices have also been growing rapidly, leading to a decline in house
affordability, although housing prices and transaction volumes have moderated recently.
Despite these developments, the financial system has remained sound, with domestic banks
maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, and non-performing loans remaining low. The
aggregate balance sheets of the corporate and household sectors are also strong.
The near-term outlook is clouded by an extraordinary degree of uncertainty. Growth is expected
to slow significantly in 2012, driven down by softening external demand and global financial
volatility. Against the backdrop of a weaker external and domestic outlook, headline inflation is
also expected to ease sharply in 2012.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for proactive macroeconomic and financial
policies, which have underpinned a strong rebound in activity. Directors noted that Singapore’s
economic growth is likely to slow in the near term amidst an unsettled global environment, and
that significant downside risks weigh on the outlook. Nevertheless, they agreed that Singapore
has sufficient policy room and tools to cushion the impact of external shocks and preserve
macroeconomic stability.
Against this background, Directors agreed that the current stance of monetary policy
appropriately balances the risks to inflation and growth. With price pressures expected to ease
and inflation expectations well anchored, there is scope for cautiously easing monetary policy
further in the event of a sharper than expected deterioration of the growth outlook. In such a
scenario, the authorities could also use available fiscal space to boost aggregate demand,
support employment, and protect low˗income families.
Directors commended the authorities for their proactive supervision of banks and welcomed the
measures adopted to safeguard financial stability, including capital requirements for Singapore
incorporated banks that are more prudent than the Basel III norms. In light of the rapid growth in
credit and house prices, Directors encouraged continued close monitoring of developments to
mitigate risks to credit quality, including in the corporate sector. They also recommended that
the authorities maintain close coordination among different government agencies overseeing
the housing market, and stand ready to implement additional measures if necessary.
Directors noted that a loosening of the fiscal stance and a continued appreciation of the real
exchange rate would help reduce the current account surplus and facilitate a rebalancing of the

3
economy over time. In this regard, they welcomed the government’s medium term plan to
increase public spending on housing, infrastructure, and education.
Directors supported the authorities’ approach to promoting inclusive growth, centered on
keeping unemployment low and preserving incentives to work. They agreed that complementing
these efforts with enhanced and targeted social safety nets could help reduce inequality. More
broadly, Directors looked forward to further progress in improving labor productivity across the
economy.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for the 2011 Article IV
Consultation. The Consultation, which focused on policy responses to cushion the domestic
economy from the current global downturn and on Singapore’s medium-term challenges, was
timely and constructive.
2

Near Term Economic Outlook

2.1
Economic growth in Singapore’s key export markets weakened discernibly in the
second half of 2011. Against this backdrop, activity in the Singapore economy also slowed.
Excluding the volatile pharmaceutical segment, the Singapore economy slipped 0.9%1 on a
seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter annualised basis in Q4, following declines of 9.3%
and 4.4% in Q3 and Q2 2011 respectively, led by a contraction in the manufacturing sector.
Activity in the financial services was also dampened by the deterioration in global business
and consumer confidence. For the year as a whole, the Singapore economy expanded by
4.8% in 2011, lower than the 14.5% recorded in 2010.
2.2
For 2012, the Singapore economy is expected to grow at a modest pace, as turbulent
financial markets, subdued global economic conditions and the ongoing weakness in the
global IT industry weigh on activity in the immediate quarters. In H2 2012, activity could
pick up moderately if cyclical headwinds in the external environment subside. Support for
the recovery will come mainly from services, particularly those that are more exposed to
regional demand, as well as a stabilisation in global IT markets. However, the authorities are
anticipating generally subdued demand conditions in the G3 for some time, given the
continued stresses in the global financial system and sluggishness in labour markets. As such,
Singapore’s GDP growth is expected to be about 1-3% this year, below its medium-term
potential rate of 3-5%.
2.3
Domestic CPI inflation rose from 5.0% in H1 2011 to 5.5% in H2, mainly reflecting
higher car prices and imputed rentals on owner-occupied accommodation arising from tight
supply-side constraints. These two items accounted for about two-thirds of CPI inflation in
2011. MAS Core Inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road
transport, and is the more important measure for monetary policy, was much lower at 2.3% in
H2. Nevertheless, it edged up from 2.0% in H1, due to the continued pass-through of earlier
increases in global commodity prices and business costs.
2.4
Over the next few months, these same factors will keep CPI inflation and MAS Core
Inflation elevated before price pressures moderate more significantly in the second half of the

year. External price pressures will ease given the subdued global growth prospects while the
sluggishness in domestic economic activity will reduce the tightness in the labour market and
alleviate cost pressures in the coming months. For the whole of 2012, CPI inflation and MAS
Core Inflation are forecast to be 2.5-3.5% and 1.5-2.0% respectively, compared to 5.2% and
2.2% in 2011.
2.5
Singapore’s overall macroeconomic policy stance is calibrated to support the
transition to slower economic growth, even as the output gap remains slightly positive
through 20122. In October 2011, the MAS kept the S$NEER policy band on a modest and
gradual appreciation path but reduced the slope of the band in line with expectations of
easing core inflationary pressures and sub-trend growth in 2012. The next policy review will
take place as scheduled in April when the need for further adjustments to the policy stance
will be carefully weighed. On the fiscal front, the FY2011 Budget that was announced in
February last year focused on measures to raise skills and productivity, and strengthen the
society. Building on that, the coming FY2012 Budget will look at stepping up efforts to
generate sustainable and inclusive growth.
2.6
Singapore’s financial system has remained resilient and markets have been
functioning normally thus far. Nonetheless, the authorities are monitoring closely the US$
funding of the banks and their overall liquidity risk management. The anticipated slowdown
in the world economy is expected to temper domestic credit growth, which has already
moderated to 3.7% q-o-q in Q4 2011 after growing by 8.3% q-o-q in Q3 2011. The nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio has remained low at 1.3% as at end Q4 2011.

Medium Term Issues

3.1
Beyond the short term cyclical issues, the authorities are focused on the medium term
challenges facing Singapore. The Government is focused on promoting inclusive growth, and
has undertaken significant initiatives to enhance the progressivity of the fiscal system over
the last five years. These include the introduction of Workfare, which tops up the wages
of lower-income workers, and significantly enhanced grants to help them own their homes.
3.2
Singapore’s basic approach however remains one of strengthening opportunities for
lower income citizens to develop skills and capabilities so as to secure quality jobs. Social
mobility remains significant through the education system, which provides for multiple
pathways for advancement and is recognised internationally as providing relatively strong
educational outcomes for a broad spectrum of students. Continuous education and training of
adult workers is now a major priority and an area of investment, as is the effort to upgrade
productivity across the economy and especially in service industries, as the basis for
improved wages.

2

The authorities estimate that the output gap as a percentage of potential GDP will narrow from 3.5% in 2011
to 1.4% in 2012.

3
3.3
The returns on savings in the Central Provident Fund (CPF), Singapore’s definedcontribution retirement scheme, have been enhanced in recent years. The authorities estimate
net replacement rates to be around 60%, taking members’ full CPF savings into account.
Further, this does not include the value of equity in citizens’ homes, which are funded in
significant part from their CPF accounts and can be monetised in their retirement years.
3.4
Taken as a whole, the Government’s approach to promoting an inclusive society
through education and skills training, work and home ownership, is a working model.
Unemployment rates remain amongst the world’s lowest. Real median incomes have grown
faster over the last decade than in most economies at a similar level of advancement. Home
ownership is close to 90%, even for those in the lowest quintile of incomes. Social spending
will increase in future years especially as the population gets older. However, the
Government intends to continue targeting subsidies at the poor through means-tested
programmes, and avoid a build-up of broad-based entitlements, so as to preserve fiscal
sustainability.

Final Remarks

4.1
The external environment remains challenging with a myriad of risks on the horizon.
The authorities will continue to monitor the economic situation closely and stand ready to
ensure that macroeconomic and financial stability are maintained. They are prepared to
introduce additional cyclical supports should external conditions deteriorate and significantly
worsen the prospects for the domestic economy. At the same time, the authorities are well
placed to focus on medium term policies to raise productivity and workers’ real incomes.
4.2
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable to
the publication of the Staff Report associated with the 2011 Article IV consultation and will
be releasing the Buff Statement at the same time.
