EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Danish economy has been doing very well lately but is now faced with the risk of
overheating. Economic activity in 2005 and early 2006 was strong, driven in part by rapidly
appreciating house prices, and unemployment has reached record low levels. The
macroeconomic policy options to cool the economy are limited given ERM2 participation
and the already strong fiscal position. A combination of continued public expenditure
restraint, a rapid implementation of measures to increase labor supply, wage moderation, and
actions to avoid unbalanced housing market developments will be required to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability.
Key issues
Short-term outlook. Growth is expected to continue at a strong but slower pace in 2006,
followed by a further moderation in 2007-08, assuming a gradual slowdown in private
consumption and investment. This forecast is based on continued prudent fiscal policies and
wage moderation.
Fiscal policy. Tight control over public expenditures is required to avoid contributing to
demand pressures. The authorities’ intention to abstain from further tax cuts in 2007 is
welcome for cyclical reasons, but the current tax freeze is unnecessarily rigid. A revenueneutral combination of a decrease in personal income taxation and an increase in real estate
taxes would support labor supply and financial stability, but lacks political support.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. The fixed exchange rate system—the peg of the krone
to the euro—continues to serve Denmark well by anchoring inflationary expectations and
imposing discipline on fiscal and structural policies.
Structural policies. The welfare agreement reached on June 20, 2006 marks an important
step toward preparing Denmark for the implications of an aging population. However, the
measures in the agreement aimed at increasing labor supply in the short run could have been
stronger. Initiatives to enhance competitiveness appear generally well placed, although their
costs will need to be contained.
Financial sector. The financial sector assessment conducted in the context of the FSAP
indicated an overall resilient and well-supervised financial system, but close monitoring of
the housing market and continued strict adherence to supervisory rules will be required.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.
The Danish economy underwent major changes over the last two decades. In the
early 1980s, the economy suffered from chronically high inflation and unemployment rates,
unsustainable budget deficits, and large current account deficits. A macroeconomic
stabilization program was adopted in the mid-1980s, followed by structural reforms in the
early 1990s. As a result, economic performance has since been much more favorable with
significant growth during the late 1990s, sustained by labor market reforms that reduced
structural unemployment. Fiscal consolidation and the buoyant economy turned large fiscal
deficits into sizable surpluses, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio fell sharply. As Denmark
registered current account surpluses, the foreign debt position improved markedly.
2.
Memories of bad times and the payoffs of reforms cemented a strong nationwide
consensus on the need for prudent economic policies. In addition, a strong sense of equity
allowed for a combination of labor market flexibility, an extensive social safety net, and
active labor market policies: the so-called flexicurity model, now part of the public debate on
labor market reform in several other European countries.
3.
Since 2001, Denmark has oriented its economic policies further toward fiscal
consolidation and augmenting labor supply. A key objective of the current coalition
government is to achieve long-term sustainability of public finances and an increase in the
labor supply in response to the pressures from an aging population. Key elements of the
framework include real public expenditure norms and a tax freeze. This framework and the
underlying objectives have been supported by the Fund (Box 1).
Difficult times in the past provided the basis for reforms, and a clear turn for the better

Box 1. Key Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
During previous consultations, the Executive Board has commended the authorities for their record of sustained
structural reform and strong fiscal policy, based on a medium-term framework that resulted in fiscal surpluses
and a sizable reduction in public debt.1 Overall, policy implementation in the past period has been consistent
with Fund policy advice.
Fiscal policy. The Fund has recommended that improving spending discipline be given priority. The
government has made efforts to this end and public consumption growth has been low, although spending
ceilings were exceeded.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. The Fund has viewed the peg of the krone to the euro as a central pillar of
Denmark’s macroeconomic stability strategy. Although overall competitiveness has been considered healthy,
the Fund has cautioned against the risk that labor costs outstrip productivity growth. In the event, social partners
have agreed on relatively modest wage increases in recent years.
Structural policies. The Fund has commended the strong performance of the Danish labor market, while
encouraging the authorities to prepare additional reforms, including a reduction in incentives for early
retirement, to alleviate labor supply constraints and lower structural unemployment. Recently, an important
welfare reform agreement was reached, which includes adjustments in the retirement schemes and labor supply
measures.
Financial sector. The Fund has welcomed Denmark’s participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) in 2005-06.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy expanded rapidly in 2005, propelled by strong domestic demand
(Figure 1). Real GDP rose by 3.2 percent, well above the growth rate of the euro area
(1.3 percent). Private consumption was boosted by high real disposable income, owing to tax
reductions in 2004, low interest rates, new types of loans (e.g., interest-only loans), and
house price developments. Rising house prices also spurred double-digit residential
investment growth. Real public consumption growth decelerated slightly in 2005, but
remained well above the 0.5 percent target in the fiscal framework. Exports and imports grew
sharply, with the external sector contributing negatively to growth.

Inflation remains contained, but is catching up with that in the euro area. With
relatively low wage growth over the last two years, inflation has been lower than the euro
area average since the beginning of 2004. However, with both core and headline inflation
showing an upward trend, this gap almost disappeared in 2005 (Figure 3). The recent rise in
harmonized inflation to 2.1 percent in June resulted mainly from some transitory factors,
including large increases in energy and food prices.

its key trading partners (Germany, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom) in 2004-05—largely due to
cyclical factors—the increase in labor costs has come down as well, in line with Germany but
more than in Sweden and the United Kingdom (Figure 4). Overall, unit labor costs in Denmark
rose more than those in Germany and Sweden,

The current account has been in surplus since 1998, although net of sea trade and oil exports it has shown small
deficits in recent years. The boycott of Danish goods by the population of certain Islamic countries in early 2006
had a limited macroeconomic impact, as exports to these countries account for only about 3 percent of total Danish
exports.

reversed at the beginning of 2005, and the REER has depreciated slightly since then.

A large fiscal surplus was achieved in 2005 (3.9 percent of GDP), much higher
than budgeted and than the 2004 surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP. This was due to strong
revenue growth (6.4 percent), largely attributable to high revenues from pension return and
corporate income taxation, including

Policy interest rates follow those of the ECB and monetary conditions are
accommodative (Figure 6). Denmark is a long-standing member of ERM2, and the small
spreads in interest rates vis-à-vis the euro area and the narrow movements of the krone
around the parity underline the credibility of the peg. The DNB follows official interest rate
changes by the ECB closely and intervenes only to smooth exchange rate movements. The
lending rate and the rate of interest for certificates of deposit were raised by 10 basis points
in February due to an outflow of foreign exchange, inter alia as a result of Danish
institutional investors’ purchases of foreign shares and securities. The monetary conditions
index (MCI) has recently bottomed out. Low interest rates have stimulated credit growth,
which reached 14.6 percent in April 2006. More than 60 percent of credit is extended to
households, underpinning a significant appreciation of house prices. The increase in
household indebtedness and the wider use of adjustable rate mortgages have raised
households’ exposure to changes in short-term interest rates. While household debt (at more
than 200 percent of disposable income) is high by international standards, debt-servicing
costs remain contained due to low interest rates, and net debt is low.
10.
Asset prices rose rapidly and the profitability of financial institutions is at record
high. The Danish stock market index went up by 37 percent in 2005, with one third of the
growth attributable to the rising shares of the large container shipping company Maersk.2 House
prices appreciated by 21.6 percent following an increase of 10 percent in 2004 (Box 2). Banks
and mortgage credit institutions posted record profits with a substantial contribution from fee
income due to securities trading and refinancing of mortgage loans and supported by low
provisions. Insurance companies and pension funds also did well due to higher returns from
equities, bonds, and real estate holdings.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

11.
The Danish economy performed very well in 2005 and early 2006, and the
discussions focused on the risks of overheating and possible policy responses. Although
recent indicators point to modest inflation, current account and fiscal surpluses, and moderate
wage increases, the authorities and mission agreed that there are signs of cyclical pressures
building up. There are labor shortages in certain sectors, rapid credit growth is fueling strong
increases in house prices and boosting private consumption and imports, and inflation has
been increasing from low levels to the euro area average. Policy options are limited given the
exchange arrangement, the tax freeze, and structural conditions that cannot be changed
overnight. The discussions were aimed at identifying appropriate policy responses, both to
short-term macroeconomic risks and long-term structural challenges.

During the first half of 2006, the Danish stock price index came down by about 5 percent.

Box 2. Developments in the Danish Housing Market 1/
House prices in Denmark have appreciated rapidly in recent years. After a prolonged period of
rather moderate price increases—during which house prices in many other European countries
increased more rapidly—there was a sharp acceleration of Danish house prices in recent years. In
2005, house prices in Denmark rose by more than 20 percent, which was one of the highest rates of
increase worldwide.
The process is driven by both general and Denmark-specific factors. The accompanying
background study shows that a variety of factors have contributed to the increase in Danish house
prices. Until recently, the pace of appreciation could largely be explained by general factors, such as
increases in real disposable income and declines in interest rates. These, however, fail to explain the
most recent acceleration of house prices. But there are two additional, Denmark-specific factors at
play: the housing finance market and the taxation system.
The Danish mortgage-financing system is very efficient and has developed an array of new
products. The system, which shares certain characteristics with the U.S. system in terms of easy
refinancing options and an active mortgage-linked securities market, is very efficient, resulting in low
transaction costs. In addition, a number of new products were launched in recent years, including
flexible-interest and interest-only loans. These products, because of their (initially) lower debt
servicing obligations, have increased the amounts borrowed.
The tax regime for housing has provided additional support for the housing market in recent
years. Under the general tax freeze, not only the tax rates applicable to housing are frozen, but also
the underlying values to be applied. For the real estate tax, these values are essentially set at the 2002
levels. Thus, the recent sharp increase in house prices has not resulted in a nominal increase in the
real estate taxes due.
...cannot be fully explained by income and interest rates.

15
A. Outlook and Risks
12.
In both the authorities’ and staff’s projections, growth is estimated to continue
at a strong but slower pace in 2006, followed by a further moderation in 2007–08.
Economic activity is likely to moderate in 2006 because of high capacity utilization and
rising interest rates, while the effects of the 2004 tax cuts are petering out. Growth is
expected to gradually return to its potential (around 2 percent) in 2007–08, but this is
conditional upon continued wage moderation and prudent fiscal policies. Inflation is
projected to remain around 2 percent, supported by the exchange rate peg. Helped by
continued high oil prices, the current account and government balances are expected to
remain in surplus, albeit less so than in 2005.
13.
The short-term risks to this benign outlook are generally considered on the
upside. A further reduction in the already low unemployment rate may give rise to tensions in
the labor market. Upward wage pressures are already evident in the construction and financial
sectors; social partners noted that these pressures had resulted in increases in fringe benefits.
In addition, the housing market has yet to show clear signs of a slowdown, although the
authorities indicated that supply has recently increased somewhat. Furthermore, there are
pressures to loosen the fiscal policy stance in light of the large 2005 surplus.
14.
At the same time, there are downside risks, in particular with regard to the
housing market. With household debt at internationally high levels, most of which covered
by real estate collateral, any significant slowdown in the Danish housing market would have
a substantial effect on growth in domestic demand, both directly through wealth effects on
consumption, and indirectly through its impact on consumer confidence.
15.
On the external side, the Danish economy is sensitive to the exchange rate, the oil
price, and its position in international sea trade. A further appreciation of the euro might
negatively affect the trade balance. As a net exporter of oil, Denmark has benefited from the
recent sharp increases in oil prices: in 2005, high oil prices significantly contributed to the
budget and current account surpluses. In addition, the economy—and in particular the export
sector—is strongly affected by the performance of the shipping industry, which has benefited
from the rapid growth in international trade, but similarly is vulnerable to changing market
conditions.
16.
There was broad agreement on the importance of continued wage moderation to
reduce overheating risks and maintain Denmark’s competitiveness. The authorities noted
that Denmark scores highly on most indicators for external competitiveness, but were well
aware that the margins in international trade are small and that significant wage increases
would erode Denmark’s external position. Social partners noted that they have so far been
able to agree on relatively moderate wage increases with an eye on international trends and

16

the impact of globalization. They agreed that wage moderation would help reduce the risk of
overheating and wage-price spirals, but also noted strong upward pressures.
B. Fiscal Policy
17.
The mission emphasized that fiscal policy should continue to be guided by
prudent medium-term objectives. The current framework—based on the Plan 2010 agreed
in 2001—aims at reaching a structural surplus over the medium-term of ½–1½ percent of
GDP to ensure fiscal sustainability in an environment of aging (Appendix III). This could
create room for a reduction in the (high) tax rates, some of which were already effected in
2004, when the personal income tax was reduced by adjusting brackets and deductions. The
medium-term framework has enabled an impressive decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio and
related interest expenditures. The authorities are planning to update the fiscal projections
(Plan 2010) toward the end of this year and issue a new fiscal framework (Plan 2015) in the
course of 2007; the mission emphasized the importance of maintaining the current strong
focus on the sustainability of public finances in the medium to long term.
18.
So far, it has proved difficult to adhere to the agreed expenditure norms, with
public consumption growth exceeding the targets in 2004 and 2005. The authorities noted
that expenditure pressures stem largely from local governments exceeding their spending
limits. Furthermore, in line with the new welfare proposals, real public expenditure growth
targets are likely to be revised upward to about 1 percent per year. The mission expressed
concern that, under the current cyclical circumstances, additional expenditures risk adding to
the already strong demand pressures. The authorities noted that there would be no proposals
for tax cuts in 2007—an intention welcomed by the mission.
19.
The authorities emphasized that the current tax freeze serves its purposes. As
part of the medium-term framework, the authorities have committed themselves to a tax
freeze since 2002 to contain the overall level of taxation, and also as an instrument to control
expenditure, in particular at the local level. While these arguments are valid, the mission
argued that the current system whereby not a single tax rate can be increased—even where it
would allow other, more harmful tax rates to come down—is overly rigid. The authorities
felt that any relaxation of the freeze would risk further hikes in taxation, which would be
more harmful to the economy.
20.
The mission proposed increasing real estate taxation and reducing income
taxation correspondingly to support both labor supply and financial stability. The
current real estate taxation, based in part on fixed tax rates applied to below-market, frozen
real estate values, provides an unnecessary and potentially even damaging stimulus to the
housing market. At the same time, high marginal personal income tax rates that kick in at
relatively low levels constrain labor supply.

17

21.
The authorities saw several drawbacks. Increases in real estate taxation would put
downward pressure on the housing market, and might result in liquidity problems among
certain taxpayers. The mission noted that the process would have to be predictable and
carried out responsibly, and that past experiences in other countries such as the United
Kingdom had shown that gradually tightening the tax treatment of housing would not
necessarily result in significant price pressures. More generally, the authorities reiterated
their political economy concerns about “opening the box” with regard to tax rates.
22.
An important local government reform operation is under way. It aims at
improving the quality of service through a more efficient use of resources by merging local
governments into larger entities, and by more clearly assigning responsibilities among
different levels of government. The reform could also help the central government in the
medium term to keep a tighter control over local expenditures. The mission welcomed the
streamlining operation, but pointed to upward pressures on expenditures in the short run. The
authorities noted that measures were in place to control these costs.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
There was agreement that the fixed exchange rate system continues to serve
Denmark well. The authorities noted that the peg to the euro, which helps anchor
inflationary expectations, is a primary element in their stability-oriented policies. The
margins around the central rate are small, as are interest rate differentials with the euro area,
reflecting market confidence in the peg. The authorities expressed their continued strong
commitment to the peg, a key role of which lies in the discipline it imposes on
macroeconomic and structural policies, thereby contributing to the strong fiscal performance.
The mission noted the key importance of this disciplinary impact for the success of the peg.
24.
The DNB has closely followed official interest rate movements by the ECB. The
mission noted that raising the rates in line with possible future rate increases by the ECB
would be suitable in light of cyclical circumstances in Denmark. It was also noted that the
pass-through of changes in interest rates on the economy has become quicker with the
enhanced availability of adjustable rate products, in particular in housing finance.
D. Welfare Reform and Structural Issues
25.
During the mission’s visit, the main political parties reached an important
agreement on welfare reform (Box 3). The mission welcomed the agreement, which aims
at preparing Denmark for the implications of an aging population. In particular, the agreed
gradual increase in the retirement and early retirement ages to 67 and 62 years respectively,
while linking retirement ages to life expectancy over the longer term, will help Denmark in
maintaining sustainable public finances in the medium to long term.

18

Box 3. Key Elements of the Welfare Agreement 1/
The agreement includes a variety of measures aimed at later retirement:
• Gradually higher age thresholds in early retirement and public pension schemes:
(i) Early retirement age raised from 60 to 62 years during 2019-22;
(ii) Public pension age raised from 65 to 67 years during 2024-27;
(iii) Retirement ages indexed to the mean life expectancy of 60 year olds as of 2025.
• More flexible early retirement scheme, e.g., through opt-in until 15 years before the early
retirement age;
• Adjustments in age limits, etc., related to higher retirement ages;
• Improved job opportunities for older workers;
• Strengthened prevention and workplace health and safety standards;
• Abolition of age-discriminating barriers in the labor market.
In addition, the package includes:
• Efforts to reduce unemployment, including among immigrants and descendants;
• Measures focused on earlier study completion;
• Other measures, including the promotion of secondary education, life-long learning, research,
innovation, and entrepreneurship.

26.
The agreement also included some measures aimed at increasing labor supply in
the short run. This involves measures to shorten the educational track, reduce the extended
length of unemployment benefits for older workers, increase participation of immigrants in
the workforce, and reduce restrictions on foreign workers. The authorities noted that the
agreed steps aimed at increasing labor supply in the short term will be helpful. The mission
agreed, but also found that, due to a weakening in order to reach a compromise, the measures
would not be sufficient to remove bottlenecks. In addition, the mission commented that
adoption of a number of recommendations of the Welfare Commission3 on taxation and the
introduction of user fees in the health sector would have been welcome. The authorities
noted that the introduction of new user fees is a circumvention of the overall tax freeze
unless matched by corresponding tax reductions.

27.
The Globalization Council recently issued its report, which reflects an open and
positive approach toward globalization.4 It includes a large number of recommendations to
strengthen Denmark’s competitiveness, mostly through increased spending on education,
research and development (R&D), and by improving the business climate. The welfare
agreement builds on these recommendations. However, the mission noted that, when
unfocused and rushed, additional public spending on R&D could be inefficient and would be
unhelpful from a cyclical perspective, and therefore expenditures should be linked to clear
targets and phased in carefully. In addition, there would be an important role for the private
sector in contributing to the efforts.
28.
Product market deregulation in Denmark is well underway. While it compares
favorably to other European countries, and is almost on a par with the United States, the
authorities are aware of the need to further increase competition in the infrastructure and
public service sectors. Product market reforms proceeded during the past two years, with
further liberalization of the energy market and partial privatization of the public postal
services. Consumers can now choose gas and electricity suppliers, and prices are more
market-based. Competition in the public service sector has been enhanced by allowing the
entry of private companies in certain sectors. The mission advised the authorities to use the
opportunity of the strong economy to move ahead forcefully with remaining reforms in
product and service markets.
29.
The mission participated in a seminar on the merits of the Danish flexicurity
model. This model has attracted international attention for its ability to generate employment
and a high level of social security (Box 4). It combines a flexible labor market, generous
unemployment benefits, and active labor market policies (Figure 7). Labor market flexibility
and active labor market policies have indeed contributed to a significant reduction in
unemployment, but the mission noted that high spending on the unemployed has been
financed inter alia through a large tax wedge on labor income. However, high costs and
moral hazard problems may impede the effective implementation of the flexicurity model.
The authorities were well aware of both the advantages and drawbacks of the system, and
emphasized that in particular the easy hiring and firing rules have strong historical roots and
acceptance in the Danish society.

20

Box 4. The Danish Flexicurity Model:
Can it be emulated by other European countries?1
The Danish labor market model, the so-called flexicurity model, has been widely praised for its
association with a low unemployment rate and a high standard of social security for the
unemployed. Within this model, a high degree of labor market flexibility coexists with a high level
of social protection that is engendered by generous unemployment benefits and active labor market
policies. With most European countries facing chronically high unemployment rates but the needed
labor market reforms often encountering strong political opposition, the flexicurity model looks
increasingly attractive to policymakers in Europe.
Should and can the Danish model be adopted by other European countries to reduce
unemployment? The answer is not obvious. First, Denmark has traditionally had a combination of a
flexible labor market and a high level of income protection. Nevertheless, in the early 1980s Denmark
experienced high and rising unemployment and inflation, chronic current account deficits, and
mounting public deficits. Only after unemployment benefits and labor market policies were tightened,
did unemployment come down. Furthermore, other countries have been able to reduce their high
unemployment rates to low levels with rather different social models (e.g., Sweden, Ireland, and the
United Kingdom).
Often overlooked is the high cost of implementing the Danish model. The tax burden in Denmark
is high, and the country has one of the largest tax wedges on labor income among European countries;
this is, inter alia, necessary to finance its high spending on labor market programs and unemployment
benefits (more than 5 percent of GDP per year). As most countries that are tempted to adopt the
Danish model will typically start from a high unemployment level, a move toward the Danish model
will, in the short run, trigger a sharp increase in the cost of unemployment benefits and active labor
market policies, thereby widening the tax wedge, with an adverse impact on labor demand and
supply. Using a calibrated model for France as an example, the selected issues paper finds that
implementation of the flexicurity model could be costly, and reduction in structural unemployment
during the first few years may be limited.
Nonetheless, certain elements of the Danish model could usefully be studied and considered by
other countries. Among others, they include the trade-off between the population’s willingness to
accept labor market flexibility and the presence of a well-functioning social safety net, and the
accompanying need to develop effective labor market policies in order to avoid high costs and
perverse incentives. The Danish government’s constant awareness and analysis of the challenges
facing the flexicurity model, and its ability to respond to them with policy actions are noteworthy in
this regard. For instance, since the economic crisis in the early 1980s, reforms have been implemented
to shorten the maximum period for participation in active labor market programs and tighten the
eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits.

E. Financial Sector Issues
30.
The FSAP judged the financial system to be generally sound, resilient, and well
supervised, but noted the risks associated with an overheating of the economy and the
housing market (Box 5). The mission noted that the booming housing sector warranted
close monitoring, strict application of supervisory regulations, and continued campaigns to
raise public awareness of the risks involved in overborrowing. It recommended that any
easing of capital requirements be done gradually, and that supervisors make use of their
authority to require additional capital in individual cases. It also called for further
strengthening of the autonomy of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA)—by
giving it a statutory basis and granting it greater control over its supervisory budget—and for
strengthening of some aspects of governance in financial institutions and cross-border
supervision.

22

Box 5. Denmark FSAP—Main Findings
The Fund conducted an assessment of the Danish financial system under the Financial Sector
Assessment Program. The exercise spanned two missions, in November 2005 and May 2006. The
results were discussed in the Article IV mission, and are summarized in the accompanying Financial
System Stability Assessment paper, which also includes five financial sector ROSCs.
The financial system is generally resilient and well supervised, underpinned by an effective legal
and financial infrastructure. In 2005, banks and mortgage credit institutions posted record profits,
reflecting substantial fee income from securities trading and refinancing of mortgage loans and low
provisions. Insurance companies and pension funds also did well due to higher returns from equities,
bonds, and real estate holdings. The life insurance and pension fund segments have addressed the
recent problems stemming from issuance in the past of contracts with high guaranteed returns in a
low-yield environment. However, they continue to sell products with guaranteed returns that later
may cause problems, which requires continued diligence by the DFSA. To forestall any potential
problems in the financial sector, the FSAP mission recommended that
•

any easing of capital requirements allowing for further expansion of credit be done gradually, and
supervisors make greater use of their regulatory authority to require additional capital as
appropriate in individual cases; and

•

efforts to better monitor, compile information, and model the impact of various shocks be
intensified through a buildup of the stress testing capacity at the DFSA.

The mission found a high degree of compliance with international supervisory standards. Going
forward, smaller capital cushions of many supervised institutions, new supervisory techniques (Basel
II), and international coordination poses challenges for the DFSA. Against this backdrop, the FSAP
mission noted that:
•

The autonomy and accountability of the DFSA could be entrenched by providing a statutory basis
and granting the agency greater budgetary autonomy. With respect to the latter, separation of its
regulatory and supervisory budget could be considered.

•

The resources available to the DFSA should be considered in light of the need to expand the
agency’s capacity to verify banks’ internal models to calculate liable capital, undertake stress
testing, and combat money laundering, which could entail reputational risk for the financial
sector.

•

While the regulatory framework has worked well in the current environment, it could benefit
from certain refinements by upgrading the guideline on internal controls to an Executive Order
and broadening the coverage of fit-and-proper requirements.

31.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the FSAP and noted that they were
already following up on some of its recommendations. In particular, they indicated that, in
line with the mission’s recommendations, they had cautioned banks to carefully review their
internal capital allocation plans to take into account emerging risks. This is to be followed up
in the normal supervisory process. In addition, the DFSA had sent a letter to the financial
institutions cautioning them about the risks related to the housing market, including those
pertaining to new financing instruments.

23

32.
The authorities indicated that they were planning to formalize the DFSA’s role
in a statutory provision, as recommended by the mission. They noted, however, that
prospects for the agency’s formal budgetary autonomy were not promising since there were
few precedents for it in Denmark and a mechanism to provide the agency with additional
resources, as warranted, was already in place. They observed that they were evaluating the
mission’s other recommendations concerning the governance of financial institutions and
planned to respond after a careful consideration of the related costs and benefits. The
authorities and the financial institutions appeared well aware of the need for contingency
planning to address potential threats to business continuity.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

33.
The Danish economy has been doing very well lately but is now faced with the
risk of overheating. Economic activity in 2005 and early 2006 was strong, driven in part by
rapidly appreciating house prices, and unemployment has reached record low levels. The
macroeconomic policy options to cool the economy are limited given ERM2 participation
and the already strong fiscal position. A combination of continued public expenditure
restraint, a rapid implementation of measures to increase labor supply, wage moderation, and
actions to avoid unbalanced housing market developments will be required to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability.
34.
Growth rates are expected to come down gradually during 2006–08, but there
are risks. High capacity utilization and rising interest rates will slow economic activity, and
growth is estimated to return to its potential (around 2 percent) in 2008, but this is
conditional upon prudent fiscal policies and wage moderation. Risks to this outlook are both
on the upside and downside. A further reduction in the already low unemployment rate may
give rise to tensions in the labor market and overheating. At the same time, a significant
slowdown in the housing market could have a substantial negative effect on growth in
domestic demand. On the external side, the economy is sensitive to the exchange rate, the oil
price, and the country’s position in international sea trade.
35.
Continued wage moderation will be key to moderate demand pressures and
maintain international competitiveness. Upward wage pressures are already evident in the
construction and financial sectors. There seems to be a willingness among social partners, at
least for now, to agree on relatively modest wage increases, with an eye on international
trends and competitiveness. It is important that this consensus be maintained during the
upcoming round of wage negotiations.
36.
Fiscal policy should continue to be guided by prudent medium-term objectives.
The current framework aims at reaching structural surpluses of ½-1½ percent of GDP. This
framework has enabled an impressive decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio and related interest
expenditures. With the recent favorable economic developments and the agreement on
welfare reform, there is a risk that the framework will be weakened when it is updated in the

24

period ahead. A continued strong focus on the medium-term sustainability of public finances,
based on realistic assumptions about the economy and the impact of structural reforms, will
be required.
37.
Containing expenditure growth will be essential in the current cyclical
circumstances. It has proved difficult, in particular for local authorities, to adhere to the
agreed expenditure norms, with public consumption growth exceeding the targets in 2004
and 2005. In line with the new welfare proposals, real public expenditure growth targets are
likely to be revised upward. Additional expenditures would add to the already strong demand
pressures in the short run. In the same vein, the intention not to introduce tax cuts in 2007 is
appropriate and welcome.
38.
The tax freeze has been effective but is unnecessarily rigid. It has helped control
upward pressures on taxes and expenditures. However, its lack of flexibility has resulted in
real estate taxation—based on frozen real estate values—that provides an unnecessary
stimulus to the housing market. At the same time, high marginal personal income tax rates
that become effective at relatively low income levels constrain labor supply. Increasing real
estate taxation and reducing personal income taxes correspondingly would augur well for
sustainable economic growth and financial stability.
39.
Denmark’s exchange regime continues to serve the country well. The euro peg
anchors inflationary expectations and has a strong disciplinary effect on other economic
policies, while the resulting level of competitiveness appears appropriate. Recent monetary
tightening in line with the ECB will help counter cyclical pressures.
40.
The welfare agreement, reached by major political parties in June, marks an
important step toward preparing Denmark for aging. The agreement will help Denmark
maintain sustainable public finances in the long term. Regrettably, the measures aimed at
increasing labor supply in the short run were weakened to achieve consensus, thereby leaving
cyclical pressures partly unaddressed. Nonetheless, the agreed measures should be
implemented promptly.
41.
The Danish flexicurity model deserves praise but comes with a price. The model
has attracted international attention for its ability to combine a flexible labor market, high
unemployment benefits, and low unemployment. However, it should be noted that it involves
costly active labor market policies and generous benefits, which makes it less applicable to
countries with high unemployment and weak public finances.
42.
The FSAP has found the Danish financial system to be generally healthy and
well supervised. In view of the risk of overheating, the authorities are advised to heighten
supervisory vigilance and adopt a cautious approach toward any reduction in capital buffers.
It would also be important to strengthen the DFSA’s statutory and budgetary autonomy, to

25

further build up its stress testing capacity, and to focus on governance in financial institutions
and cross-border supervision.
43.
Close monitoring of the housing market is required. The sharp increase in house
prices in recent years cannot be fully explained by developments in income and interest rates.
Favorable tax treatment and the introduction of new financial instruments are likely to have
contributed to the rise in prices. The situation warrants close monitoring, strict application of
supervisory regulations, and effective consumer information about risks.
44.
Denmark’s generous provision of foreign aid is welcome. Denmark is committed
to maintaining development assistance at the internationally high level of 0.8 percent of gross
national income.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the 24-month
cycle.

Appendix II: Denmark—Statistical Issues
The quality and timeliness of the economic database are very good and adequate for
surveillance purposes. Denmark has a full range of statistical publications, all of which are
on the Internet. Denmark subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS). Metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
The authorities have introduced new data on monetary financial institutions that conform to
the ESA95 and expanded the set of financial institutions covered in the National Bank’s
statistical bulletin. This permits monitoring of some categories of financial institutions not
previously covered (e.g. money market funds, small banks, and cooperative banks), allowing
a more thorough assessment of the financial sector. Some of the financial account data come
from this enhanced source. Data for the central bank and other depository corporations are
reported to STA on a timely and regular basis. The ECB framework, which is used by the
authorities for reporting monetary data to STA, provides comparable detail as the
Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.

Appendix III: Denmark—Debt Sustainability Analysis
This Appendix analyses the medium-term (2006–11) sustainability of general government debt
and external debt of the overall economy.
External debt sustainability. Denmark’s external position is strong reflecting a series of current
account surpluses since 1990 (with the exception of a small deficit in 1998). The net investment
position turned positive in 2005 (see Table 4), while net external debt declined from 34 percent
of GDP in 2001 to 21 percent in 2005 (see Table A1). Under the baseline scenario it will decline
further, reaching 12 percent in 2011. The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that this
result is rather robust, rising only by two percentage points of GDP under the worst scenario (a
shock to the non-interest current account).
Public sector debt sustainability. In a similar vein, a history of fiscal surpluses has reduced the
public sector debt to 36 percent of GDP from 49 percent in 2001 (Table A2). Under the baseline
scenario, which assumes that the tax freeze remains in effect, it will decline further to 19 percent
in 2011. Under the relevant stress test scenarios the level of debt reaches at most 24 percent of
GDP in 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 5, 2006

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Denmark
On September 29, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Denmark.1
Background
The Danish economy underwent major changes over the last two decades. A macroeconomic
stabilization program adopted in the mid-1980s was followed by structural reforms in the 1990s.
The fixed exchange rate regime helped anchoring inflation expectations and imposed discipline
on macroeconomic and structural policies, contributing to the strong fiscal performance.
In recent years, fiscal policy, guided by prudent medium-term objectives, resulted in budget
surpluses and a significant decline in public debt as a share of GDP. Following a decade of
current account surpluses, foreign debt also fell markedly.
After a period of slow growth, the Danish economy accelerated in 2004–05, driven by domestic
demand, and registered a growth rate of 3.2 percent in 2005, more than twice that of the Euro
area. Private consumption was boosted by high real disposable income owing to tax reductions
in 2004, low interest rates, and house price developments. Sharply rising house prices also
spurred double-digit residential investment growth. Real public consumption growth decelerated
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
slightly in 2005, but remained well above the 0.5 percent target. Exports and imports grew
sharply, and the current account reached a surplus of 3 percent. Staff forecast growth of around
2¾ percent in 2006, slowing down to about 2¼ in 2007.
Inflation remains contained, but is catching up with that in the euro area. The unemployment
rate fell to 4.5 percent in June 2006, the lowest level in 30 years. Strong growth and a flexible
labor market contributed to a notable pickup in employment. Labor market conditions have
consequently tightened, and in both the construction industry and the financial sector labor
shortages appear to have emerged. Despite the decline in unemployment, the number of
participants in labor market programs remains high. In June, agreement was reached on a
reform of the welfare system, including future increases in retirement ages and labor supply
measures.
In 2005 the fiscal surplus reached 3.9 percent, much higher than budgeted and than the surplus
in 2004. This was due to strong revenue growth, largely attributable to high revenues from
pension return and corporate income taxation, including revenues from the oil-and-gas related
activities in the North Sea. In addition, government expenditures declined as a percentage of
GDP. Given that revenue developments were mainly cyclical, the structural balance shows a
smaller improvement. General government debt came down further from about 44 percent of
GDP at end-2004 to 36 percent of GDP at end-2005.
Policy interest rates have followed the recent increases by the ECB. Asset prices rose rapidly in
2005 and the profitability of financial institutions is at record high. Banks and mortgage credit
institutions posted record profits with a substantial contribution from fee income due to
securities trading and refinancing of mortgage loans. Denmark participated in the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in the course of 2005–06.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities’ record of stability-oriented policies and
welcomed the economy’s recent strong performance, with high growth rates and low
unemployment. Directors viewed that recent interest rate increases and capacity utilization
constraints should contribute to a gradual slowing in growth rates in the period ahead.
Continued public expenditure restraint, and measures to increase labor supply and moderate
wages will reduce the risk of overheating associated with tensions in the labor market and
domestic demand pressures. Directors observed that developments in the housing market
should be closely monitored.
Directors emphasized that fiscal policy should continue to be guided by prudent medium-term
objectives. They noted that the current framework, which aims at reaching structural surpluses
of ½–1½ percent of GDP, has enabled an impressive decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Directors
cautioned against a weakening of the framework when it is updated in the period ahead,

3
and stressed the need for a continued strong focus on the medium-term sustainability of public
finances, based on realistic assumptions about the economy and the impact of structural
reforms.
Directors expressed concern that an upward revision in real public expenditure growth targets,
in line with the new welfare proposals, would add to the demand pressures in the short run.
They supported the authorities’ intention not to introduce tax cuts in 2007, noting that the tax
freeze has helped control upward pressures on taxes and expenditures, and has been a useful
disciplinary device. Directors observed, however, that constrained tax flexibility has resulted in
property taxation that is partially frozen in nominal terms, which has provided an unnecessary
stimulus to the housing market. At the same time, high marginal personal income tax rates,
which become effective at relatively low income levels, constrain labor supply. A gradual and
predictable elimination of the partial nominal property tax freeze, aimed at avoiding a shock to
the market, and a corresponding reduction in personal income taxes would be supportive of
sustainable economic growth.
Directors agreed that Denmark’s exchange regime continues to serve the country well by
anchoring inflationary expectations and imposing discipline in other economic policy areas.
They considered the overall level of competitiveness appropriate, and noted that the recent
monetary tightening in line with the ECB would help counter cyclical pressures.
Directors emphasized the importance of continued wage moderation to temper demand
pressures and maintain international competitiveness. They welcomed the willingness of social
partners in recent years to agree to responsible wage increases, with an eye on international
trends and competitiveness, and encouraged them to maintain this consensus during the
upcoming round of wage negotiations.
Directors welcomed the welfare agreement, reached by major political parties in June,
which marks an important step toward preparing Denmark for aging, and maintaining
sustainable public finances in the long term. They urged the authorities to implement forcefully
the agreed measures.
Directors noted that the Danish flexicurity model has worked well, contributing to Denmark’s low
unemployment. At the same time, they observed that it involves costly benefits and active labor
market policies, which may make it less applicable to countries with high unemployment and
weak public finances. Nonetheless, the model merits study by other countries, as a possible
way to increase labor market flexibility.
Directors welcomed the outcome of the FSAP, which found the Danish financial system to be
generally healthy and well supervised. In an environment of rapid credit growth, the authorities
were advised to heighten supervisory vigilance and adopt a cautious approach toward any
reduction in capital buffers. Directors underscored the importance of strengthening the

4
supervisor’s statutory and budgetary autonomy, its stress testing capacity, and efforts regarding
governance in financial institutions and cross-border supervision.
Directors noted that the recent sharp increase in house prices cannot be fully explained by
developments in income and interest rates. They noted that favorable tax treatment and the
introduction of new financial instruments are likely to have contributed to the rise in prices.
Directors recommended close monitoring of the housing market, strict application of supervisory
regulations, and effective consumer information about the risks of overborrowing.
Directors commended Denmark’s generous official development assistance, which amounts to
the internationally impressive level of 0.8 percent of gross national income in 2006.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV
Consultation with Denmark is also available.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Denmark
and Ole Hollensen, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 29, 2006

On behalf of our Danish authorities, we would like to thank the Fund’s staff team for candid
and constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV and FSAP missions.
They appreciated the circulated set of high quality papers addressing topical issues for the
Danish economy. Our authorities broadly concur with staff's analysis and assessment and
will carefully consider the recommendations.
Outlook and Risks
The Danish economy has performed quite well for some time and is presently experiencing a
strong recovery with buoyant employment growth, record low unemployment and significant
surpluses on both the fiscal and external balance. Our authorities expect—as does staff—a
continued strong GDP growth of 2.7 percent in 2006, down from 3.6 percent in 2005 against
the backdrop of increasing interest rates and high capacity utilization. In 2007, GDP growth
is assumed to moderate further in line with a soft landing.
As stated by staff, risks to the outlook are mainly related to factors that enhance the risk of
overheating. Hence, one concern is that labor shortages become more pronounced. The
unemployment rate is now at the lowest level in more than 30 years and further reductions
would tend to imply stronger wage pressure. In the 2nd quarter of 2006, wage increases
accelerated slightly, exceeding 3 percent (y/y) for the first time in 2 years. The strongest
wage increase, 4.4 percent y/y, was reported for wages in the construction sector. The
authorities are aware of the possible implications of labor shortages, and the recently agreed
welfare reforms include elements to increase labor supply also in the short run. Another
important risk relates to developments in the housing market, where the last two years have
been characterized by large increases in real estate prices. The accompanying activity boost
in the construction sector and the rise in household demand—induced by wealth effects—
have to a large extent contributed to the increase in domestic demand. However, a significant
increase in the supply of dwellings for sale and a slower pace of sales during this summer
indicates that the interest rate increases since the fall of 2005 have now had a more visible
effect on the housing market. In the official forecast a pronounced deceleration in the growth
of housing prices is anticipated. Overall, our authorities concur with staff’s assessment that
continued wage moderation is very important in reducing overheating risks and that close
monitoring of the housing market is required.
Fiscal Policy
Staff shows concern about pressures to loosen fiscal policy given the large general
government surplus reaching a record high of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2005. The Danish
authorities fully understand this concern and the government’s proposal for the 2007 fiscal
bill, submitted in late August, points to a slight tightening of fiscal policy if the present plans
for a significant decline in public investments materialize. Furthermore, the authorities have

2
stressed the need for public expenditure control, referring to the present situation with GDP
growth rates exceeding potential growth and taking into consideration long-term fiscal
sustainability and the need to reduce public debt. Indeed, the large fiscal surpluses are to be
used to bring down the public debt consistent with the Plan 2010. This is important
considering the business cycle conditions and the long-term challenges that are related to
ageing of the population. In this context it is important to note also that the current Plan 2010
leaves no scope for new tax reductions that are not fully financed.
Our authorities welcome staff’s support for the medium term fiscal framework based on the
Plan 2010. The Plan 2010 contains guidelines for economic policy in order to ensure longterm fiscal sustainability in light of an ageing population (including a shrinking work force),
and requires yearly structural surpluses of ½-1½ percent of GDP on average. Achieving
structural surpluses in this range ensures the necessary reduction of public debt. Due to the
strength of the Danish economy, public debt is brought down faster than in the path set out in
the original Plan 2010. The authorities have announced an intention to update the fiscal
framework in 2007 covering the period up to at least 2015 and reflecting the recently agreed
welfare reforms. In line with the Plan 2010, long-term fiscal sustainability will also be the
main focus of the new medium-term plan.
Together with the rapid repayment of public debt, the historical June 2006 ”Agreement on
future prosperity and welfare and investments in the future” (Welfare Agreement) helps to
ensure fiscal sustainability. In light of globalization and the efforts required to ensure
continued growth and prosperity in the future, the Welfare Agreement includes an earmarked
amount of DKK 2 billion in 2007 increasing to DKK 10 billion in 2012 (approximately
0.5 percent of GDP) to be invested in research, education, innovation and entrepreneurship.
Staff worries about the timing of this increased expenditure in a situation with considerable
domestic demand and high capacity utilization. As such, the welfare reforms should be seen
as a package of different initiatives aiming at increasing the labor force in the short and long
run. As a consequence of the increased expenditures, real public consumption growth will
exceed the assumed growth rate in the Plan 2010 by 0.5 percentage point and amount to
1.0 percent in the years 2007-2010. A real growth rate of 1 percent corresponds to slightly
less than the average public consumption growth in the period 2001-2005 and is half the
average growth rates of public consumption of 2 percent per year in the 1990’s.
The Danish tax freeze, which is also a part of the medium term fiscal framework, serves as a
means to control the tax burden and to dampen public expenditure growth. Staff considers
the tax freeze effective but unnecessarily rigid, referring to the inability to carry out revenue
neutral tax adjustments. In the present situation with large wealth accumulation in the
housing market and potential gains from a larger labor supply, staff favors a reduction of
labor income taxation financed by increased real estate taxation. The Danish authorities find
that the advantages of the tax freeze in its current form exceed the drawbacks and attach
weight to the simple and widely understood purpose of the tax freeze making it a credible
and strong commitment device.
The authorities welcome staff’s support for the ongoing local government reform that is
implemented in order to ensure a more efficient public sector structure. The issue of

3
transformation costs related to the reform has been dealt with in the yearly budget
negotiations with municipalities and counties. It is agreed that most expenses can be kept
within the current expenditure ceiling. However, in 2006 there has been a one-off increase in
local government expenditure level of approximately DKK 0.5 billion due to certain
transformation costs. In 2006-2007 a special lending pool has been set aside for
municipalities and counties to meet the necessary costs of new investments.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Our authorities welcome the assessment that the Danish fixed-exchange rate policy continues
to serve Denmark well. The peg to the Euro helps anchoring inflationary expectations and is
thus a cornerstone of the stability oriented economic policy. In this respect it is important to
note that inflation has been very stable around a level corresponding to ECB’s definition of
price stability for many years. At the same time competitiveness is sound as witnessed by the
combination of a low level of unemployment and a healthy surplus on the current account.
The advantages of the discipline that the peg imposes on social partners and on fiscal and
structural policies seem to outweigh the theoretical disadvantage that interest rates do not
correspond fully to cyclical conditions in Denmark.
DNB closely follows interest rate movements by the ECB. We agree with staff that any
future rate increases by the ECB would be welcome in light of cyclical circumstances in
Denmark. The pass-through of changes in interest rates on the economy has become quicker
with the more widespread use of adjustable rate products, in particular in housing finance.
Welfare Reform and Structural issues
The Welfare Agreement represents a historical response to the long-term challenges due to
ageing of the population and our authorities welcome staff’s support for the reform. The
introduction of a variety of measures to enlarge the labor force has given a significant
contribution to ensure long term fiscal sustainability for many decades ahead. The Welfare
Agreement includes, among other things, measures to increase the retirement age. The early
retirement age will be raised from 60 to 62 years during 2019–2022 and the statutory public
pension age will be raised from 65 to 67 during 2024–2027. In addition to this, a mechanism
to adjust retirement ages in line with the increase in life expectancy is introduced. This
mechanism will be introduced in 2015 with effect from 2025. At the same time, the
Agreement includes measures to increase labor supply in the short run. These measures
include efforts to reduce unemployment among older workers and immigrants, earlier
completion of education and easier access for foreign workers to the Danish labor market etc.
The Welfare Agreement is not as far reaching as proposed by the Danish Welfare
Commission, but the Danish authorities consider the reform an important step in the right
direction and well composed. With the Welfare Agreement the Danish economy seems well
prepared to meet the challenges of the future.

Financial Sector Issues
The FSAP exercise confirms that the Danish financial system appears resilient and is well
supervised, underpinned by an effective legal and financial infrastructure. There is good
coordination between the various domestic institutions responsible for financial sector
stability.
The Danish government will thoroughly consider the recommendation concerning the
institutional set up of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. However, decisions
concerning the budget of an agency such as the DFSA are a matter for the Parliament as part
of the annual revision of the Danish National Budget. The DFSA is allocated increased
resources when given new assignments.
On the basis of analyses and stress tests, the DNB’s most recent Financial Stability Report
concluded—in line with the Fund—that the financial institutions are still robust and that
there are currently no black clouds on the horizon that could threaten financial stability in
Denmark. Stress tests will in the future be given higher priority in the DNB’s assessment of
financial stability. It should also be noted that the DFSA is developing the use of stress tests
for monitoring the soundness of financial institutions.
The new Basel II capital requirements could, for institutions which apply for the use of the
internal rating based approaches for credit risk and advanced measurement approach for
operational risk, imply potentially large decreases in the minimum capital requirements. To
ensure that any large potential decrease in capital requirement will be gradual, the Danish
regulation has included floors that set the maximum decrease in capital requirements for
institutions using the advanced methods in 2007, 2008 and 2009, in accordance with the EU
Capital Requirement Directive. Furthermore the DFSA will have the possibility of setting
additional capital requirements in individual cases.
The DFSA will consider issuing executive orders instead of guidelines. The benefits of such
executive orders will have to be viewed against the increased costs that these may imply for
the supervised entities. However, there are definitely supervisory benefits in upgrading the
guidelines to legislation. Specifically, regarding the recommendation to extend the field of
the “fit-and-proper” regulation to all key staff, and not just board members, our authorities
generally concur that it could be useful if the DFSA had the possibility to take action towards
unfit staff members. However, it also seems an unnecessary burden on the financial
institutions if such key staff members should have a “fit-and-proper” approval in advance.
Such measures would also claim a considerable part of resources from the DFSA, and it is in
the opinion of the DFSA doubtful whether the benefits will exceed the costs.
It must be stressed that Denmark is at an advanced stage in the implementation of the
3rd Money Laundering Directive. The implementing act has been adopted by the Parliament.
Parts of the act have already entered into force. The remaining parts enter into force on
January 1, 2007. The necessary implementing measures will enter into force on this date as
well. The examination has thrown light on some shortcomings and the examination has,

5
therefore, been very helpful for the implementation and the work related to formulating the
administrative provisions.
The FSAP confirms that the Danish payment and securities settlement systems are safe and
efficient. The DNB and the DFSA will thoroughly analyze the recommendations for
improvements.
Other Issues
The flexicurity model analyzed in the selected issues paper combines a flexible labor market,
high unemployment benefits and active labor market policies. It has been very successful in
reducing unemployment in Denmark. As noted by staff though, the model is costly and
sensitive to moral hazard problems. Still, the Danish authorities find that the flexicurity
model can serve as inspiration for countries struggling with high unemployment.
When considering the public spending on labor market programs in figure 7 in the main
report and in figure 4 of the selected issues paper, we find that the diagram may overstate the
size of the tax wedge in Denmark compared to other countries. While income taxes are high
in Denmark compared to most other Western European countries, social security
contributions are relatively low. Hence a diagram that included employers’ social security
contributions would increase the tax wedge for all countries, but more so for countries other
than Denmark. The data also deducts cash benefits from the tax burden of a wage earner.
This is highly questionable since such cash benefits are means tested and, therefore, cannot
be considered a negative tax. Comparisons across countries of such data are, therefore,
particularly difficult.
As staff’s analysis in the other selected issues paper shows, Danish house prices have
increased considerably during the last couple of years, with nominal growth rates of
9 percent in 2004 and 17 percent in 2005. Staff’s analysis suggests that the acceleration of
house prices is not fully explained by high income growth and falling interest rates. Both an
effectively functioning mortgage market with a number of new products and the tax system
and the tax freeze have contributed to the increase in house prices. The Danish authorities are
aware of the risks of over borrowing in the housing market and are monitoring the
development closely in order to prevent possible imbalances.
Since 1978, Denmark has consistently provided development assistance of more than
0.7 percent of GNI, among the highest of any country. For the coming years, the Government
will ensure that Denmark’s ODA does not fall below 0.8 percent of GNI.
