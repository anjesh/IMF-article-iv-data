Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2007 Consultation with Guinea-Bissau
Approved by Robert Sharer and Michael T. Hadjimichael
August 28, 2007

Objectives: A mission visited Guinea-Bissau on May 23–June 6, 2007, for the 2007
Article IV consultation discussions and discussions on possible Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance (EPCA). Among key requirements to reach agreement on EPCA, the
authorities need to secure financing assurances for the 2007 budget. If agreement is
reached, a separate staff report will be issued covering EPCA discussions.
Mission Team: The team comprised C. McAuliffe (head), L. Ocampos, C. Fernandez,
M. Sáenz, and L. Leony (all AFR). World Bank staff joined the mission.
Article IV consultation: The discussions focused on three challenges: (i) achieving
macroeconomic stability, (ii) improving fiscal governance and transparency, and
(iii) addressing key structural issues to encourage sustainable economic growth. The
program for possible EPCA will be an essential first step in addressing these challenges.
A low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared with World Bank
staff (Supplement 1). Data weaknesses continued to hamper surveillance (Supplement 2).
Exchange arrangements: Guinea-Bissau has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. It shares a common currency (CFA franc), pegged to the euro, with
other WAEMU members. The BCEAO conducts monetary and exchange rate policies for
the region. Banks are supervised by the WAEMU Banking Commission.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•
Guinea-Bissau remains a fragile post-conflict country with a severely
deteriorated fiscal stance. The conflict and ensuing political instability have taken a toll on
growth and economic policies, and most macroeconomic indicators have worsened in the
post-conflict period.
•
Guinea-Bissau depends heavily on aid. However, frequent changes in government,
combined with lack of accountability and ownership of government policies, have in recent
years eroded international support.
•
The discussions focused on the near-term challenge of halting fiscal
deterioration. Lack of fiscal controls has resulted in large deficits, domestic arrears, and
unsustainable financing gaps. The recently appointed government has adopted an emergency
program to address the main sources of fiscal slippages that have gained broad support both
domestically and internationally, but significant donor support is still needed to fill the
financing gap.
•
The authorities’ emergency program formed the basis for initiating discussions,
which are ongoing, on EPCA. Among the key requirements to reach agreement, the
authorities need to secure financing assurances for the 2007 budget. If agreement is reached,
a separate staff report on EPCA discussions will be issued to the Board.
•
The authorities agreed that achieving fiscal sustainability depends critically on
reining in nonpriority current spending and intensifying revenue mobilization. The
authorities intend to further strengthen budgetary controls, public expenditure management,
and cash management systems.
•
Guinea-Bissau’s overriding economic challenge in the medium term is to revive
growth and achieve fiscal and external sustainability. As agreed, policies to enhance
growth and external competitiveness should focus on improving macroeconomic
management and alleviating structural weaknesses within the existing exchange rate regime.
•
Guinea-Bissau is in severe debt distress. Even after possible HIPC debt relief,
Guinea-Bissau will need substantial external assistance, preferably in the form of grants, to
support reforms and make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Further donor support will depend on the authorities’ commitment to improve governance,
strengthen institutional capacity, and implement key structural reforms.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Guinea-Bissau remains a fragile post-conflict country. Despite attempts to rebuild
the government’s administration and address economic problems, continued tensions among
the major political parties, frequent changes in government, and lack of accountability and
ownership of policies have worsened economic conditions.
2.
Since April 2007, in a clear break from the recent past, a newly appointed
government has initiated steps to stem the economic deterioration. A new prime minister
and cabinet of ministers were appointed under pressure from a new coalition of political
parties within parliament. In its first months, the new government adopted an emergency
program to help restore fiscal stability.
3.
The new government has also taken steps to re-engage the donor community,
and donors, signaling their support for the government’s recent initiatives, have begun
to disburse pledges made at the November 2006 donors’ conference. Discussions with
the Fund have been ongoing since the new government requested early purchases under the
Fund’s EPCA. Among the key requirements for concluding these discussions, the authorities
need to secure donor assurances to finance the 2007 budget. Satisfactory performance under
EPCA could pave the way for a PRGF arrangement and, eventually, debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI).
II. POST-CONFLICT CHALLENGES

Guinea-Bissau faces enormous challenges after nearly a decade of conflict,
political instability, and withdrawal of donor support. Real GDP growth in recent years

health and education remained lower than the regional average. Progress toward meeting the
MDGs has been slow, and some indicators have worsened (Table 1).

6.
Guinea-Bissau depends heavily on external assistance (Box 1), though aid levels
have been lower and more erratic in the post-conflict period. A number of earlier
attempts to initiate EPCA discussions stalled. Performance under staff-monitored programs
(SMP) for 2005 and 2006 was mixed, and the timing and magnitude of donor support were
lower than expected.2 At a donors’ conference in November 2006, the first since 1999, a
broad group of donors pledged financial assistance to support the authorities’ economic and
reform agenda. Disbursements at end 2006 and early 2007, however, were delayed when
governance issues in the energy sector emerged.3 These issues have since been resolved, and
donors are cautiously beginning to disburse pledged assistance.

1

A preliminary DSA and its underlying assumptions were discussed with the authorities. The mission advised
the authorities to contact their creditors and start conversations on rescheduling that will allow them to clear
arrears by 2010, before a possible PRGF-supported program.
2

See IMF Country Report No. 06/312 for a discussion of performance under the 2005 SMP. See ¶9 for details
of the 2006 SMP.

3

The previous government entered into a nontransparent, noncompetitive, and costly electricity supply contract,
contradicting the terms of its agreements with the World Bank. The World Bank and other donors suspended
their support pending resolution of the issue, which was finally resolved at the end of March 2007.

III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
7.
Economic activity in 2006 was weaker than expected, but is projected to recover
in 2007 (Figure 2 and Table 2). The economy weakened as the terms of trade deteriorated
because of lower world prices for cashew nuts—Guinea-Bissau’s main export—and rising
international oil prices. Government intervention in price-setting in the cashew market,
which disrupted the export supply chain, also hurt economic growth and cashew exports.4
Cashew marketing arrangements are expected to normalize in 2007 and should help
economic activity rebound. The external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened
significantly in 2006 even though private remittances surged (Table 3).

4

The government set reference prices both for producers and for calculating taxes on cashew exports at levels
higher than traders were willing to pay given world prices. Initially farmers held out for the reference price and
refused to sell. An excess supply of cashew eventually drove down the domestic price, discouraging farmers
from marketing the nuts. Given the country’s precarious storage capacity, part of the 2006 production was
eventually ruined.

8

The fiscal stance deteriorated sharply in 2006, reflecting a severe breakdown in
fiscal controls, and the government fell short of targets agreed under the 2006 SMP
(Tables 5 and 6).6 Weak management led to expenditure overruns, particularly in travel and
representation costs, as well as large unbudgeted expenditures, including payment of
(unaudited) domestic arrears of previous years, and excessive incentives paid to tax
collectors. The wage bill shrunk by almost 1 percent of GDP, but was higher than
programmed because of delays in implementing planned civil service reforms. Shortfalls in
expected donor support exacerbated cash flow difficulties, and the government resorted to
short-term borrowing from commercial banks and issuing treasury bills.7 These borrowings
were insufficient, however, and large additional domestic arrears were accumulated by the
year’s end.

5

Banco Regional de Solidaridade and Banco da União opened in 2006 and Ecobank opened in 2007.

6

Five out of seven quantitative SMP targets were not met for 2006 (revenue, wage bill, domestic primary
balance, domestic financing of the budget, and accumulation of domestic arrears). Most structural benchmarks
were met, albeit with delay.
7

The treasury bills ($13 million or 4 percent of GDP)—backed by expected disbursements from the EU and the
World Bank—were placed through the BCEAO in August, mostly with financial institutions in other WAEMU
countries, at a rate of 5 percent. Short-term (uncollateralized) borrowing ($5.4 million) from banks within
WAEMU was obtained at much higher effective interest rates.

10
10.
The government’s cash flow difficulties worsened in the first half of 2007, as
fiscal controls weakened further and donors continued to delay much-needed
assistance. Tax revenues were lower than expected in the first four months of 2007: they
dropped 15 percent from the same period a year ago, as revenue administration weakened
and imports fell in the wake of political uncertainties. Nonetheless, the government
continued to pay large arrears from previous years, and to make unbudgeted expenditures;
meanwhile, substantial arrears, including four months of civil service salaries, accumulated
for the current year.
11.
For 2007 as a whole, the fiscal stance is expected to deteriorate sharply; the
overall balance (including grants) is projected to widen to 17 percent of GDP (Text
Table 2 and Table 7). Because of delays in concluding a new fishing agreement, the EU will
not disburse annual compensation to Guinea-Bissau before early 2008 and government
revenues are now projected to decline to 15 percent of GDP, some 4 percent of GDP lower
than in 2006. The revenue shortfall will be partly offset by a decline in current primary
expenditures (to 24 percent in 2007 from 26 percent in 2006), reflecting a slight decline in
the wage bill as a share of GDP and better control of nonwage discretionary spending,
including travel and representation costs and off-budget items.

The new government adopted, in April, an emergency fiscal program to help
contain the 2007 fiscal stance. Among the measures to control discretionary spending, the
government immediately stopped paying incentives to tax collectors until the amounts
remitted earlier are investigated. The authorities also took action to re-instate and strengthen
the Treasury Committee, charged with regularly monitoring cash flow. The program also
includes intensified revenue collection measures, including collection of tax arrears.
13.
Debt service due in 2007 on the treasury bills and (uncollateralized) commercial
borrowing contracted in 2006 add financing pressures. Budget support of
CFAF 19.4 billion (11 percent of GDP)8 in outstanding pledges from the November 2006
donors’ conference should help cover 2007 financing needs. The government has recently
concluded an agreement with a regional commercial bank to borrow (CFAF 4.8 billion) until
the EU disburses the 2007 fishing compensation (expected in early 2008), leaving a residual
financing gap of CFAF 16.7 billion ($33 million or, 9.7 percent of GDP).
14.
The government has taken measures to close the residual financing gap,
including rescheduling CFAF 3 billion in debt service owed in 2007 to commercial
banks, as well as CFAF 1.5 billion in debt payments owed to the BCEAO.9 In addition,
the authorities are discussing with regional partners additional budget support for 2007 and
have separately identified some CFAF 1 billion in budgetary savings (expenditure and
revenue). The discussions with regional partners are ongoing.
15.
Additional budgetary savings would be difficult to achieve in the short term.
Much of the fiscal deterioration was from unbudgeted expenditures earlier in the year, which
would be difficult to offset with cuts elsewhere because of the heavy wage burden (more than
half of current primary expenditures). Revenue projections reflect intensified efforts to
redress the shortfalls.
16.
The fiscal stance is expected to improve in 2008 as the government’s emergency
fiscal program takes effect. Government revenues are projected to increase by 6 percent of
GDP to about 21 percent of GDP. Nontax revenues are expected to be above the norm in
2008, reflecting two disbursements from the EU for fishing compensation (corresponding to
the 2008 and the delayed 2007 annual compensations). Tax revenues are projected to be
roughly constant as a share of GDP. As discussed with the authorities, current expenditures
are expected to decline by about 2 percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting a nominal freeze of the
wage bill and strict control of nonwage discretionary outlays. With the increase in revenues,
the domestic primary deficit should decline to just 1.2 percent of GDP, much lower than in
previous years.

The authorities are submitting to Parliament, for approval, a revised 2007 draft budget which includes the
expected financing.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.

Discussions focused on the following key challenges:
In the near term,
• reversing the fiscal deterioration and
• avoiding the accumulation of new domestic arrears and
Over the medium term,
• achieving macroeconomic stability by reducing the fiscal deficit;
• improving governance and transparency; and
• fostering sustainable economic growth.
A. Near-Term Challenges

18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that actions were urgently needed to address
fiscal slippages, stem the fiscal deterioration, and meet current expenditures, including
full payment of 2007 civil service salaries. The measures adopted under the
government’s emergency fiscal program (paragraph 12), as well as those to close the 2007
financing gap (paragraphs 13 and 14) are important to this end.
B. Medium-Term Outlook
19.
Given the unclear picture of the availability of adequate external support and
the domestic economic constraints, the medium-term outlook is subject to a high degree
of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the authorities and staff agreed that real GDP growth of
about 3–4 percent a year could be sustained over the medium term (Text Table 3 and
Table 8). The authorities considered that sustaining these growth rates would be important
given historical growth of less than 1 percent a year in (1991–2006). This would require (i) a
commitment to policy reform, which would enable the authorities to implement stronger
reform programs and achieve sustained donor support; (ii) a steady rebuilding of institutional
capacity and infrastructure; and (iii) a recovery of donor and investor confidence. The fiscal
position should improve over the medium term if fiscal controls are restored and nonpriority
expenditures are reined in. The external current account deficit is projected to narrow,
reflecting mainly a recovery of cashew nut exports, modest import growth as the fiscal stance
tightens, and a slight recovery in the terms of trade. Real GDP growth would reach 4 percent
by 2012 based on (i) continued expansion in agriculture, especially solid performance in the
cashew nut sector; (ii) increased activity in construction and industry—particularly cashew
nut processing and industrial fishing activities; and (iii) higher investments in basic services
and infrastructure.

20.
The authorities recognized that the sustainability of the baseline medium-term
outlook requires significant concessional external assistance, including debt relief.
Specifically, the medium-term outlook requires, at a minimum:

10

•

Project grants and loans of some 14 percent of GDP to finance a minimal level of
capital expenditures mostly in the Public Investment Program, a level consistent
with current absorptive capacity. More grants would be needed to increase priority
spending on social sectors, infrastructure, and capacity building consistent with the
reform agenda outlined in the government’s PRSP10 and MDG-related initiatives.

•

Budget support of at least 3 percent of GDP in 2008–12, similar to the levels seen
since 2000, to cover the domestic primary deficit, assuming the wage bill as a share
of GDP is unchanged from 2009 onwards.

•

Securing comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC initiative and MDRI, which by
staff estimates would reduce annual scheduled public debt service from about
36 percent of government revenue and grants in 2006 to less than 12 percent from
2010 onwards (Supplement 1).

See IMF Country Report No. 07/339.

14
21.
Over and above these requirements, additional external grant assistance would
be needed to repay domestic arrears.11
There are considerable risks to the medium-term outlook, given the heavy
22.
reliance on donor support. While the outlook assumes some fiscal adjustment, it includes
only moderate cuts in the wage bill in the absence of a comprehensive donor-financed plan to
implement civil and military service reforms. If external assistance falls short, more domestic
arrears will accumulate, and prospects for civil service and military reforms will dim.
The authorities acknowledged that securing the necessary external assistance
23.
will not be easy, given donor fatigue from the legacy of civil strife and weak governance
and economic management. Staff noted that renewed and sustained donor support will
depend on the authorities’ commitment to improve governance, strengthen institutional
capacity, and implement strong and credible reforms. Slippages in any of these areas or
political instability would jeopardize external assistance. In the next few years, the
authorities must also make every effort to strengthen policies to ensure that they reach the
HIPC completion point as envisaged in 2010.
The authorities concurred with staff that without continued reforms, economic
24.
growth would be anemic. Under a no-reform scenario, real GDP growth would revert to its
historical average of less than 1 percent a year, and the fiscal and external positions would be
unsustainable.
C. Achieving Macroeconomic Stability

25.
Sound fiscal policies, supported by structural reforms, will be critical to
achieving macroeconomic stability. Monetary and exchange management falls under the
purview of the regional central bank; prudent fiscal and borrowing policies will thus be the
main tools for ensuring macroeconomic stability. As the staff advised the authorities, there
are four main avenues to strengthen fiscal performance: improve revenue collection, reduce
current expenditures, eliminate domestic arrears, and avoid resorting to expensive
commercial borrowing.
Civil and military service reforms are crucial to contain the wage bill and ensure
26.
fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Reforms in this area, however, have been slow,
reflecting serious capacity constraints, delays in obtaining donor support, and continued
11

The strategy for arrears clearance involves an external audit (financed by the EU) of the stock of domestic
arrears accumulated in 2000–06 (CFAF 44 billion). Once audited, the authorities will seek external assistance,
over and above normal budget support, to pay off the audited arrears. The authorities will also seek external
assistance to pay the stock of pre-2000 arrears that were already audited (CFAF 20 billion). Paying off the
audited arrears over the medium term (2008–10) could require some 8 percent of GDP per annum in additional
external assistance (assuming about half of the 2000–06 arrears will be eliminated after the audit).

15
reluctance by the government to undertake reforms with political costs. Some progress has
been made in completing the military census. For the civil service, the government finished
merging two existing databases for public sector employees so that salary payments are now
based on the unified database. Since October 2006, some 2,132 civil servants (out of about
15,000 civil servants) have been removed from the respective ministries payroll and their
salaries paid by the State Secretariat of Reform. The government is planning to fully retrench
these civil servants by the end of 2007, through a program financed by the EU.12 The
authorities agreed that much more progress is needed. The next steps require firm
commitment by the authorities to implement difficult measures and support from donors in
taking the lead to coordinate the financing and technical aspects of the reforms.
Increasing revenue is also important for achieving fiscal sustainability. The
27.
authorities agreed with staff that the main measures needed to enhance revenue collection
include expanding the tax base, strengthening tax administration, enforcing fishing licenses,
and increasing the collection of other nontax revenues, such as oil and mining explorations.
Staff urged the government to promptly implement the recommendations of the recent FAD
and West AFRITAC technical assistance missions to (i) reinforce the recently created large
taxpayers unit through better control of taxpayers’ compliance, and (ii) strengthen customs
administration by upgrading the automated customs system to ASYCUDA++ (Automated
System for Customs Administration).
Despite limited progress, the authorities remain committed to meeting
28.
WAEMU’s convergence criteria. Guinea-Bissau's revenues, wage bill, and fiscal balances
fall far short of the WAEMU convergence criteria (Text Table 4). The authorities agreed that
the 2007–08 fiscal framework will not be enough to put the convergence criteria within
reach, and that much more effort is needed in the medium term.

12

The program envisages the payment of compensation for these civil servants, together with re-training and/or
micro-credit schemes.

D. Improving Governance and Fiscal Transparency

29.
There is an urgent need to improve fiscal transparency and accountability.
Adequate expenditure and cash management will help demonstrate the government’s
capacity to manage its fiscal resources (including donor support) and stem domestic arrears.
Staff stressed that a serious weakening in fiscal controls mainly explained the recent fiscal
deterioration. The authorities agreed on the need to re-establish credible and comprehensive
budget preparation and execution procedures, as well as to re-implement adequate systems of
cash and debt management, including proper functioning of the Treasury Committee. The
government’s emergency fiscal program includes measures to strengthen the Treasury by
restoring to it sole responsibility to receive revenues and pay expenditures. In addition, bank
accounts of all ministries and public entities will be centralized in a single treasury account at
the BCEAO.13
The mission also discussed ways to improve collection and transparency of
30.
revenues, including nontax revenues. The authorities indicated that as part of their
emergency fiscal program they are planning to undertake a financial audit of all sources of
government revenue, including all nontax revenues, to be under the control of the Treasury.
The mission encouraged the authorities to continue improving the enforcement and
administrative control of fishing licenses. The authorities reported that they are making
progress in acquiring equipment to monitor Guinea-Bissau’s territorial waters, with support
from the AfDB. Staff also discussed the status of oil and phosphate mining exploration and
13

The measures are also consistent with the recommendations of the March 2007 joint mission of FAD/West

17
the authorities’ plans to manage potential resource revenues.14 The authorities are exploring
the possibility of participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and are
seeking donor assistance in this regard.
Staff urged the authorities to seek financial and technical support from West
31.
AFRITAC and donors to promptly implement the expenditure and revenue measures
included in its emergency fiscal program. The authorities noted that a LICUS (Low
Income Country Under Stress) grant from the World Bank would also support technical
advisors in key revenue and expenditure departments, as well as a long-term resident macro
fiscal advisor (Table 9).
E. Promoting Sustainable Economic Growth and Competitiveness

32.
Guinea-Bissau’s overriding economic challenge is to revive growth. The
authorities attributed poor growth primarily to the long-lasting socio-political crisis and the
related withdrawal of donor support, which have eroded public institutions, basic services,
and infrastructure. Other obstacles to growth include the low skills of the labor force, weak
fiscal policies, and mounting levels of domestic arrears, which have undermined the private
sector and disrupted normal economic activity. Guinea-Bissau as a result has one of the
weakest investment climates according to the World Bank’s ranking of 175 countries.15
Raising growth requires steps to restore external competitiveness, which was
33.
hurt by a 40 percent deterioration in the terms of trade in 2000–-06 (Figure 3).
Movements in the real effective exchange rate did not offset the terms-of-trade deterioration.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated slightly over this period, largely reflecting
WAEMU-wide trends, and is now 8 percent higher than when Guinea-Bissau joined the
common currency area in 1997. For the region as a whole, however, the real equilibrium
exchange rate is still in line with its long-run equilibrium value.
The authorities and staff agreed that policies to boost growth and
34.
competitiveness should focus on improving macroeconomic management and removing
infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks. Guinea-Bissau’s wages are already
comparatively low, mainly because of the labor force’s limited skills. Steps are needed to
(i) resolve the domestic arrears problem; (ii) reallocate spending toward productivity-

14

The government signed a 25-year, $127 million contract with Guinea-Bissau Phosphate Mining Ltd (a
multinational company based in South Africa). The company expects to start production in late 2008. The
government has also granted two new concessions for oil exploration along the country’s coastal areas. There
are now five areas under concession, but so far no oil reserves have been found.

The World Bank’s “Doing Business” report ranks Guinea-Bissau 173.

improve investor confidence.
There was consensus among policymakers and private sector representatives
35.
that the poor electricity supply is one of the greatest obstacles to economic and social
development. Less than 6 percent of the population has access to electricity and the supply is
irregular, partly because one of the three operating generation units was damaged in 2006.
Staff advised the government to work closely with the World Bank to find a way to meet
short-term power-generation needs and to quickly conclude all preparations to launch and
implement the Multi-Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project.
Staff discussed the government’s strategy for the cashew nut and fishing sectors.
36.
To revive the cashew nut sector, a major revenue source (and income source for the rural
population), the government has committed to refrain from again intervening in the pricesetting mechanism of the market. Staff and the authorities agreed that, over the medium term,
alternative sources of fiscal revenues need to be found in order to limit reliance on export
taxes on cashew nuts. To develop the fishery sector, staff advised the authorities to
collaborate with neighboring countries under ongoing regional fishery initiatives supported
by the World Bank and the European Union.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

37.
Guinea-Bissau is at a crucial juncture. The new reform-oriented government has
taken early steps to reverse its fiscal deterioration, with measures to improve revenue
collection, rein in nonpriority expenditures and clear domestic arrears, including for wages.
Early indications are that, if sustained, these reform efforts could generate urgently needed
donor support, which are required to provide short-term financing. The authorities now need
to seize this window of opportunity and maintain the reform momentum with a decisive push
for much-needed structural reforms, particularly in the area of civil and military service and
improving the environment for private sector development.
A key priority is to improve economic management in order to restore
38.
confidence and shore up donor support. In this regard, the re-establishment of fiscal
discipline, transparent fiscal management, and improved fiscal performance will be essential,
as will be efforts to improve the effectiveness of the public investment program.
The government’s emergency fiscal program is a promising start and needs to be
39.
fully implemented. In particular, the Treasury Committee must be fully operational and
ensure full and transparent management of Treasury operations. Budget execution and
monitoring needs to be strengthened and the transparency of the budget improved, including
the uses of such nontax revenues as fishing licenses.

20
40.
Over the medium term, a combination of domestic fiscal adjustment and higher
external assistance will be needed to achieve Guinea-Bissau’s economic and social
objectives. Continued reforms to strengthen fiscal governance will be critical to increase
revenue collection and reallocate spending toward health, education, and infrastructure.
Meaningful progress toward the MDGs will require a substantial increase in external
assistance.
Sizeable debt relief would also be needed to restore debt sustainability. The DSA
41.
shows that Guinea-Bissau is in debt distress; key debt ratios are well above the countryspecific thresholds.
Several factors have adversely affected Guinea-Bissau’s external
42.
competitiveness, including weak fiscal policy, infrastructure bottlenecks, and a difficult
business environment. Its real effective exchange rate has appreciated slightly in recent
years, although the last WAEMU staff report found that, for the region as a whole, the REER
is broadly in line with its long-run equilibrium value. The authorities need to focus on fiscal
adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms to boost growth and competitiveness within
the existing exchange rate regime.
There is an urgent need to improve the investment climate to foster private
43.
sector development. Efforts must be made to address serious gaps in basic services,
infrastructure bottlenecks, legal and regulatory uncertainty, and weaknesses in governance.
Data weaknesses continue to hamper the effectiveness of surveillance. Data
44.
quality is very poor in all sectors and reporting lags are long. More resources must go to the
statistic institute. Staff recommends that the authorities seek technical further assistance in
this area.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 1245.
month cycle.

21

Box 1. External Aid Flows to Guinea-Bissau: How Much Is Enough?
Guinea-Bissau depends heavily on aid. Total external assistance (including grants and loans) averaged about
19 percent of GDP in 2000–06, much more than the average for the WAEMU region, although the level of budget
support is similar to that of other fragile African states.
Most of the external assistance was used to finance capital expenditures. More than two-thirds of external
assistance in 2000–06 (14 percent of GDP) was in project grants and loans that financed capital expenditures mainly
through the Public Investment Program.
Some Fragile African States: External Assistance as

18
and the country’s infrastructure continues to be

amount of budget support received was about
5 percent of GDP on average, similar to other
fragile states, and was used mainly to finance the wage bill, which increased rapidly.
Over the medium term, Guinea-Bissau will continue to depend on external assistance to finance its current and
capital expenditures. Current levels of fiscal revenues are not sufficient to cover the government’s financing needs,
and there is little room to improve revenue collection.2 As a result, in a basic scenario of limited reform to the
government wage bill, the government will need budget support of about 3 percent of GDP to finance its operations.
However, for this to materialize, the authorities would need to demonstrate a clear break with the past and firmly
commit to implementing key structural reforms and effective expenditure management. In order to reduce its
dependence on external budget support, the government has to implement serious reforms to sharply reduce the wage
bill to levels commensurate with the country’s revenue capacity. As for project support, the government would need to
continue to rely on project grants and loans of some 14 percent of GDP over the medium term, a percentage similar to
the recent past, to finance its capital expenditures.

memorandum of understanding.
2/ Ceiling. If the actual amount of external budgetary assistance falls short of program forecasts, the ceiling will be increased for the full
amount of the shortfall. The programmed amounts of external assistance in 2006 are (on a cumulative basis) CFAF 9.1 billions by endJuly, CFAF 12.4 billion by end-October, and CFAF 19.9 billion by end-December. Definition applied in 2005 includes payment of
previous years domestic arrears and therefore differs from definition applied in 2006 as stated in TMU.
3/ Floor. If the actual amount of external budgetary assistance surpasses program forecasts, the floor will be decreased by the full amount
of the difference between actual and programmed external budgetary assistance. The programmed amounts of external assistance in 2006
are (on a cumulative basis) CFAF 9.1 billions by end-July, CFAF 12.4 billion by end-October, and CFAF 19.9 billion by end-December.
4/ Floor. This floor on revenue will be fully adjusted for advances or delays in the EU’s compensation for fishing rights compared with
the assumptions underlying the program. The program assumes payments of CFAF 4.8 billion in December 2006

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GUINEA-BISSAU
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Vikram Nehru and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
and Robert Sharer and Michael T. Hadjimichael (IMF)
August 28, 2007
This analysis assesses the sustainability of Guinea-Bissau’s external public and domestic
debt. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by the staffs of the IMF
and the World Bank using the joint Bank-Fund framework for debt sustainability analysis for
low-income countries. The bilateral external debt data underlying this DSA were provided by
the Bissau authorities. The multilateral debt data provided by the authorities were reconciled
with information obtained from the creditors. On the basis of this DSA, the staffs conclude
that Guinea-Bissau is in debt distress.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
At end-2006, Guinea-Bissau’s total public debt amounted to $1,242 million or
403 percent of GDP in nominal terms1 (306 percent of GDP in NPV terms). External debt
is the largest component, with the stock of external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
debt at $993 million, of which $350 million is in arrears (Tables 1 and 2). Multilateral debt
amounts to 48 percent of total PPG debt (14 percent is owed to AfDB/AfDF, 29 percent is
owed to IDA, 0.8 percent is owed to IMF) and bilateral and commercial debt amounts to
52 percent. The NPV of external debt amounts to $766 million or 249 percent of GDP and
1087 percent of exports. Despite the concessional nature of most of the external debt, the

WAEMU rights in NPV terms instead of nominal terms.

Domestic debt has become an increasingly larger share of total public debt,
reaching 20 percent of total debt in 2006 from 15 percent in 2000. The main component
of this debt corresponds to a required capital contribution to join WAEMU. Under the terms
of its accession to the WAEMU in 1998, Guinea-Bissau agreed to contribute an equal share
as the other members in the capital contribution of the central bank (BCEAO) and the
regional development bank (BOAD). The contribution amounting to CFAF 70 billion
(44 percent of 2006 GDP) is to be paid over 25 years starting in 2005, but only a small
fraction of it has been paid using distributed dividends. There is also a sizable amount in
domestic arrears, most of which accumulated during the period 2000–06. These arrears will
be subject to an external audit to be completed in 2007 which will provide a more accurate
determination of the actual amount3. Finally, the government has a debt with the BCEAO and
took additional debt from commercial banks during the last two years.

2

According to the World Bank Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA), Guinea-Bissau is classified
as a country with poor quality of policies and institutions. Its average CPIA rating for 2004-06 is 2.7, on a scale
from 1 to 6, below the operational cutoff of 3.25 for poor performers.

3

For this sustainability exercise, we estimate the stock of arrears at CFAF 42 billion, which includes already
audited arrears accumulated before 2000 (CFAF 20 billion) and about 50 percent of nonaudited arrears
accumulated during 2000–06.

3.
Guinea-Bissau reached the HIPC decision point in 2000 but failed to maintain
macroeconomic stability causing its PRGF-supported program to go off track at a very
early stage. Two Fund Staff-Monitored Programs followed, in 2005 and 2006. Progress
under both SMPs was mixed.4 A full PRSP was finalized in 2006 after many delays owing to
political instability and capacity constraints.5
4.
In 2007, the government agreed to a new timeline to re-engage in programs
supported by the IMF and the World Bank, aiming to reach the completion point under
the HIPC Initiative by end-2010. Discussions are ongoing for possible EPCA
disbursements over a period up to three years, so as to build the necessary track record to
move to a formal PRGF-supported program, followed soon thereafter by possible HIPC
completion point.6
5.
Since the 2000 PRGF went off track, Guinea-Bissau has not benefited from most
of the debt relief committed at decision point. At the decision point in 2000, creditors
representing 80 percent of Guinea-Bissau’s external debt pledged to provide HIPC relief
amounting to $416 million in NPV terms (estimated at about $790 million in nominal terms).
Since 2001, Guinea-Bissau has had to service a large share of external debt in full. he IMF

See Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (www.imf.org).

6

A number of conditions must be met before Guinea Bissau could reach the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative, including satisfactory performance under a PRGF-supported program, which would require, among
others, satisfying the Fund’s nontoleration of arrears policy (i.e., agreement must be reached on a repayment
schedule of post-cut-off-date arrears with Paris Club creditors).

4
suspended the provision of interim relief and the Paris Club declared null and void any debt
rescheduling agreements beyond end-2001. Many agreements signed with other multilateral
and bilateral creditors have not been implemented because the country failed to remain
current on debt service obligations.7 The African Development Bank (AfDB) provided
interim relief up until 2006 and IDA continued to provide it in 2007.8 However, the statutory
ceiling for the delivery of interim relief, which was reached by AfDB in January 2007,9 is
expected to be reached by IDA at the end of this same year.10 Only China and Cuba canceled
all outstanding claims.
6.
After the decision point, Guinea-Bissau could not service its external debt and
accumulated arrears to most of its external creditors. Since 2001, the country has not
repaid any creditor that did not provide interim relief, with the exception of the IMF. The
stock of arrears has increased from $139 million before decision point to $350 million at end2006.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
7.
The medium-term macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline
projection scenario are described in detail in Box 1.11 GDP growth projections have been
revised downward compared to the 2006 DSA, with medium-term growth now projected at
3.6 percent on average during 2007–12, compared to 4.8 percent in the 2006 DSA, while
long run projections are also revised downwards to 4.5 percent average annual growth
(2013–27) instead of 5 percent previously assumed. Underlying this downward revision are
greater uncertainties about the recovery of the cashew sector and more conservative
assumptions about the implementation of needed structural reforms, including civil service
reforms.

7

See Guinea-Bissau, Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, November 2004, (IMF Country Report
No. 05/93) Box 10, for a comprehensive list of debt rescheduling agreements reached by Guinea-Bissau with
the creditors as part of the provision of HIPC relief.

8

Interim relief from IDA amounted to 100 percent of debt service falling due on debt disbursed before end1999 until October 2003, the expected date of the completion point. Interim relief was decreased to 90 percent
of debt service thereafter. The AfDB extended 100 percent debt service relief to end-2006.

9

AfDB’s interim debt relief through January 2007 covered only a fraction of the scheduled debt service
payments, and stopped thereafter.

10

IDA could at its discretion extend interim relief to 50 percent of total HIPC relief based on satisfactory
progress toward the completion point triggers and maintenance of a sound macroeconomic program. The AfDB
could raise the interim relief ceiling from 40 percent to 50 percent, but AfDB officials have indicated that this is
unlikely.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario
• GDP growth rate increases from 1.8 percent in 2006 to 4 percent by 2012, and
reaches 4.5 percent by 2017 and over the long term.
• GDP deflator is assumed to grow at a rate slightly below CPI inflation, due to
expected worsening in the terms of trade. After 2012, both GDP deflator and CPI are
assumed to increase at a rate of 2 percent.
• The noninterest current account deficit is assumed to decrease over the medium
term, converging to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2010, one percentage point below past
average levels, reflecting significant export growth and fiscal consolidation. Exports
are assumed to grow at around 7.5 percent per annum over the medium and long run.
• The domestic primary fiscal deficit1 is assumed to decrease from 7.5 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 1 percent by 2010, maintaining this level from then on. The wage bill
is projected to remain constant in nominal terms over the next two years, while offbudget expenses are expected to decrease significantly. Revenue collection efforts are
expected to be maintained as a ratio to GDP.
• External assistance. Budget support grants are projected at 2.6 percent of GDP per
annum (similar to average level observed over the last six years excluding World
Bank IDA grants). Project grants and loans are projected at nearly 8 percent and
6.3 percent of GDP, respectively, reflecting implementation of public investment
programs at similar rates as in the past. Financial gaps remaining are assumed to be
financed through highly concessional loans, with the grant element in new
disbursements assumed to remain slightly above 50 percent.
• Domestic borrowing. The DSA assumes that current domestic debts to the banking
sector are repaid before end-2008. For domestic arrears, it is assumed that they will
be audited and fully repaid by 2010. It is assumed that the audit will reduce the stock
of domestic arrears, accumulated in 2000–06, by 50 percent. The baseline scenario
also assumes that the audited domestic arrears are repaid using external concessional
loans. The framework also assumes that capital contributions to WAEMU will be
paid over 25 years starting in 2010.
• Foreign direct investment as a ratio of GDP ratio is assumed to remain constant in
the medium and long term at its average level during the last six years (2 percent of
GDP).
• Fiscal financing gaps are assumed to be filled through concessional loans, on the
grounds that the country will not have continued access to commercial debt. The
alternative to concessional loans would be to finance the fiscal gaps by accumulation
of domestic arrears, an unsustainable strategy over the medium to long term.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline: No Debt Relief
8.
The baseline scenario (Table 1a and Figure 1a) assumes that the HIPC
completion point is never attained, but real GDP growth is assumed to converge to the
long-run average of about 4.5 percent per annum. The assumed growth rates are
significantly higher than the historical average (less than one percent) which reflected a
period of great political instability and inappropriate macroeconomic policies which are
assumed to improve in the period ahead. External debt, both in nominal and NPV terms
remains at very high levels, and all debt indicators based on NPV of debt remain far above
the indicative thresholds for poor performers (Text Table 1). The assumption that loans to
finance the fiscal gap are highly concessional explains the downward trend in the NPV of
debt ratio to GDP, exports and public revenues, despite continuous recourse to additional
borrowing.

2/ Threshold over which countries considered as poor performers according to their CPIA would have at least a
25 percent chance of having a prolonged debt distress episode in the coming year. Guinea-Bissau lies within the
bottom quintile of countries ranked by the CPIA.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
10.
An alternative scenario assumes that the HIPC completion point is reached in
2010 (Table 1b, Scenario A3), and total debt relief—including HIPC, MDRI and
additional rescheduling of arrears, amounts to $591 million in end-2010 NPV terms.12
The provision of this debt relief would reduce debt service payments by about 5 percent of
GDP per year. This scenario is comparable to the baseline presented in the 2006 DSA, except
for the fact that Completion Point is now assumed to be reached one year later. In this
scenario, the NPV of external debt to GDP falls significantly at completion point reflecting
12

MDRI amounts to $75 million in end-2010 NPV terms.

7
both the assumed clearance of external arrears, and the lower debt service after HIPC and
MDRI debt relief. However, even in the long run, the NPV of debt remains above the
relevant indicative thresholds, independently of whether the debt is measured in proportion to
GDP, exports, or government revenues. Despite the relatively high long run debt level, debt
service is expected to decline to below-threshold levels, as a reflection of the highly
concessional terms of existing debt and the terms assumed for the treatment of arrears and
new borrowing.
11.
Assuming that Guinea-Bissau is able to obtain grants to pay off its stock of
domestic arrears, the debt burden indicators would be reduced even further (Table 1b,
Scenario A 4). If grants are used to pay all domestic arrears during 2008–10, the NPV of
debt/GDP would be 12 percentage points lower by 2010 than in Scenario A3. However, even
under this scenario the ratio would remain above the indicative threshold.
12.
The standard stress tests have been applied to the baseline. The first one shows
the effect of a one-time 30 percent devaluation in the exchange rate (Table 1b, Scenario B6).
The stress test scenario shows the enormous vulnerability that the country faces to a shock in
the nominal exchange rate, given current debt levels. Given a one-time 30 percent
devaluation, the NPV of debt increases by almost 100 percentage points of GDP in that year.
It is the most extreme shock in terms of NPV/GDP, debt/revenue, and debt service/revenue
(Figure 1a).
13.
A further stress test showing the impact of a one-standard deviation negative
export shock (Table 1b, B2) also illustrates the vulnerable external position of the
country. Given the high volatility of exports during the recent period, and the high NPV of
debt, shocks on exports can have a large impact on both the NPV debt/exports and debt
service/export ratios.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline: No Debt Relief
14.
The assumptions under the baseline scenario for total public debt (Table 2a and
Figure 2a) are the same as those described under the External DSA baseline. In these
circumstances, total public debt (domestic and external) as a percent of GDP decreases over
the long run, similar to the behavior of external debt described in the previous section.
15.
Despite a long run downward trend in the NPV of total public debt to GDP
ratio, this remains very high, which points to a highly vulnerable debt position,
particularly given the likelihood that the assumed strong fiscal stance and access to
concessional loans may turn out to be overly optimistic. Shocks to the economy are also
likely to increase the debt burden significantly.

8
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
16.
The first alternative scenario (Table 2b, Scenario A1) assumes that GDP growth and
the domestic primary balance remain at their historic averages. In this case, there is zero
growth in GDP and the non-interest primary deficit remains at its six-year average (6 percent
of GDP) in contrast to a gradual fiscal tightening assumed in the baseline. Guinea-Bissau’s
debt would be unsustainable, as the NPV of debt to GDP ratio would remain well above 250
percent over the estimation period, while the NPV of debt to revenues ratio declines slightly
in the outer years. Debt service remains high at over 30 percent of revenues despite the
assumption of highly concessional loans to finance the fiscal gaps.
17.
The second alternative scenario (Table 2b, Scenario A4) assumes that GuineaBissau reaches the completion point in 2010 and the corresponding debt relief is fully
delivered. Achieving completion point under the HIPC initiative by 2010 would significantly
lower Guinea-Bissau’s risk of debt distress, as the NPV of debt would decrease to 75 percent
of GDP by 2011, which amounts to a debt reduction of over 160 percent of GDP in NPV
terms with respect to the baseline scenario. Despite this reduction, the NPV of public debt to
GDP would still remain at uncomfortably high levels.
18.
The stress tests to the baseline scenario show that Guinea-Bissau’s public debt
position is highly vulnerable to economic shocks. In the case of NPV of debt-to-GDP and
debt service-to-revenue ratios, they are most vulnerable to a negative GDP shock (Table 2b,
Scenario B1); while the NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenues ratio is most severely affected by a
one-time 30 percent depreciation in the exchange rate (Table 2b, Scenario B4)13. Both
scenarios impose fairly severe conditions. The shock to GDP amounts to assuming negative
growth of -3.8 percent for two years, which translates into a 45 percentage point difference in
NPV of debt-to-GDP with respect to the baseline in only two years. Likewise, a one time
30 percent devaluation translates into a 100 percentage point increase in the NPV of debt-torevenues ratio within three years.
V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
19.
In staffs’ view, Guinea-Bissau is in debt distress. Guinea-Bissau’s external debt
ratios are well above the country-specific indicative thresholds during the complete
projection period, even after assuming full delivery of HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief.
The public DSA suggests that Guinea Bissau’s overall public sector debt dynamics are
unsustainable in light of the current size and the evolution of the domestic debt stock. The
risk rating remains unchanged with respect to the previous DSA.

13

Based on NPV of debt and debt service ratios projected ten years ahead.

9
20.
Prudent macro policies to rein in debt ratios will be crucial if the debt to GDP
ratio is to be kept from growing over time. Securing foreign aid on highly concessional
terms is also crucial for Guinea-Bissau. The country’s financial strategy should focus on
strengthening its fiscal stance, avoiding nonconcessional debt, increasing the grant content of
aid received, and providing a stable political and business environment that will favor
additional investment as well as a more stable inflow of external aid than in the past.
Containing the wage bill and avoiding off-budget expenditures will be key to reduce the
current fiscal imbalance in a sustainable fashion.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as official grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Projections

Sources: Country authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Covers debt at the general government level. Liabilities to WAEMU associated with entry rights are expressed in NPV terms.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Large residuals during 2004-08 are mostly explained by large differences between average and end-of-period exchange rates. While average exchange rate is used to express external debt in local currency, the end-of-period exchange rate is
used to obtain the contribution of real exchange rate depreciation to the variation in total debt-to-GDP ratio.

Key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions
Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on forex debt (in percent)
Average real interest rate on domestic currency debt (in percent)
Real exchange rate depreciation (in percent, + indicates depreciation)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)
Grant element of new external borrowing (in percent)

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes GuineaBissau. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
November 4, 2005. The assessment indicates that progress has been made in strengthening
the bank's safeguards framework since the 2002 safeguards assessment.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management and risk prevention have been established and follow-up on
internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The 2005 assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The status report on the implementation of safeguards assessment
recommendations, received from the BCEAO in March 2007, and 2005 audited financial
statements, indicate some progress, achieved by the Bank, in improving the external audit
process (including adopting a multi year audit program), applying IFRS, expanding
disclosures in the notes to financial statements on financial positions with the Fund by
countries, including Guinea-Bissau, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of the
internal audit function.

Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement

Guinea Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from
January 1, 1997. It joined the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
in 1997, and has no separate legal tender. The exchange system common to all members of
the union is free from multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA
franc has been pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of € l=CFAF 655.95. On April 30, 2007, the
rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR was CFAF 733.8=SDR 1. Effective
January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified
to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of exchange
arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of
the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate
legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based
on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

Guinea-Bissau is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions with Guinea-Bissau were held in Bissau March 16–30, 2006. The
staff report (IMF Country Report No. 06/312) was discussed by the Executive Board on July
31, 2006. Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix (IMF Country Report No. 06/313) was
also circulated to the Board.

XIII. Resident Representative
The Resident Representative in Senegal also covered Guinea-Bissau from September 1997
through July 2007. There is no longer a Resident Representative for Guinea-Bissau, but the
local office is still open and staffed by a local economist.

Guinea-Bissau: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of June 30, 2007)
1.
As of June 30, 2007, IDA had approved 30 credits for Guinea-Bissau. Nine credits
had been in the transport and infrastructure sector, three in the energy sector, three for
strengthening the country’s management capability (Technical Assistance (TA)/Economic
Management), two for financing urgently needed imports in support of the government’s
economic recovery program, one in the agricultural sector, three in the health sector, two in
the education sector, one in the social sector, three for structural adjustment, one for
economic rehabilitation and recovery, one for private sector rehabilitation and development,
and one for natural resource management. The total value of these projects is about
$324.9 million equivalent, of which $306.6 million has been disbursed. As of June 30, 2007,
the undisbursed balance was $29.2 million.
Structural adjustment credits
2.
IDA has approved a total of $63.4 million for structural adjustment operations. These
include two structural adjustment credits (SACs), one supplementary SAC, and one
economic rehabilitation and recovery credit (ERRC). The SACs supported the government's
program in the areas of economic liberalization and reform of the public administration and
public enterprise sectors, and the ERRC supports peace building following the political
unrest, promotes the revival of the economy and encourages the pursuit of reforms. Parallel
financing of the SACs came from Switzerland ($5.3 million equivalent), the Saudi Fund for
Development ($3.2 million equivalent), the International Fund for Agricultural Development
($5.3 million equivalent), the African Development Fund ($ 23.3 million equivalent), the
Netherlands ($7.5 million equivalent), the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) ($4.5 million), and Japan ($2 million equivalent).
Lending program
3.
During fiscal years 2005-2007, IDA approved an HIV/AIDS project ($7 million), a
coastal and biodiversity management project (USD$3 million), a Multi-Sector Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project ($15 million), and a grant under the Low Income Country Under Stress
(LICUS) initiative ($1.6 million). Moreover, IDA continues to provide interim assistance to
the country as part of the Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). For
FY08, IDA will finalize its interim strategy (ISN) for Guinea-Bissau, and will prepare a
budgetary assistance operation and a community-driven development project.

9
Nonlending Program
4.
The Bank prepared a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003 and an Integrated
Poverty and Social Assessment (IPSA) in 2005. A PER update and a Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) were prepared in FY2006. The Bank jointly prepared with the
IMF a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the authorities’ PRSP in FY07.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
5.
The IFC’s current portfolio consists of two investments: one in agribusiness
($0.25 million), and one in the financial sector ($0.28 million) to support a commercial bank
(Banco da África). Both have been fully disbursed.

10
Guinea-Bissau: Statistical Issues
1.
Despite the authorities’ efforts to reestablish their statistical data capabilities, the
quality of data has hampered effective surveillance. Data compilation was severely
impaired during the 1998–99 civil war.
2.
Guinea-Bissau is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Its GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board since November 2001. However, the metadata and plans for improvement need to
be reviewed as they have not been updated since June 2001 (February 2003 for national
accounts). An area-wide page for the WAEMU was introduced in the January 2003 issue
of IFS.
National accounts
3.
Inadequate data sources for national accounts statistics remain a major hurdle to
improving the country’s national accounts. The GDP aggregate is mostly based on crude
assumptions and coefficients derived from the 1986 benchmark-year estimates.
4.
The National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) was seriously affected by
the armed conflict, and still requires substantial technical assistance to rebuild capacity for
compiling production statistics. Guinea-Bissau is receiving technical assistance in real
sector statistics through West AFRITAC. Thanks to recent efforts, the timeliness of annual
national estimates has improved, with current price data being reported up to 2005.
However, constant price GDP estimates remain seriously out of date.
Consumer prices
5.
Since July 2002, a harmonized CPI has been compiled, based on the same structure
as in other WAEMU countries. However, price data are collected only for the capital
Bissau.
Government finance
6.
Between 2000–02, the authorities made substantial progress in preparing timely
reports on monthly and quarterly budget executions. These fiscal data reports were widely
circulated to relevant national institutions; however, they have not been prepared since
early 2003. Moreover, the quarterly reports are no longer submitted for publication in IFS.
The most recent annual data in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are
for 1989.
7.
In March and April 2003, two FAD missions—one in revenue administration and
the other in expenditure management—visited Guinea-Bissau. A third mission during the
same period—in the context of the regional GDDS project—made recommendations on

11
improving fiscal data. Two experts from West AFRITAC visited Bissau in February and
March 2004, to begin implementation of the recommendations of the April 2003 mission
on revenue administration. The February mission assisted the authorities to set up of a unit
for the monitoring of large enterprises in the Domestic Tax Department of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF), and the March mission provided TA in the area of customs
administration.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Since Guinea-Bissau’s entry in the WAEMU on May 1, 1997, the BCEAO has
assumed responsibility for compiling and reporting monetary data for Guinea-Bissau to
STA, as is the practice for other member countries in the Union. Guinea-Bissau has
adopted the BCEAO’s accounting and reporting procedures for monetary and financial
statistics. Monthly data on monetary statistics for Guinea Bissau are reported on a regular
basis for publication in IFS, albeit with some delays.
9.
The accuracy of monetary statistics is affected by large cross-border movements of
currency among BCEAO member countries and delays of up to two years in the recording
of such movements. In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of
banknotes in circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement.
These revisions are due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients
(“coefficients de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003.
10.
In March 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA test data for the central bank for June 2005 for
all member countries using the Standardized Report Form (1SR). STA sent comments on
the data to advance the work, but the BCEAO has not yet responded.
Balance of payments statistics
11.
Guinea-Bissau reports trade data to AFR for operational purposes using
information from customs. It also reports balance of payments and international
investment position statistics to STA on an annual basis. Nevertheless, balance of
payments data remain weak, due mostly to substantial unregistered trade and
inconsistencies between data on net foreign assets as reported by the BCEAO and other
economic indicators. In August 2004, an AFRISTAT balance of payments expert visited
Bissau to assess the priority needs for technical assistance and assist the authorities with
the preparation of a work plan for improving compilation of balance of payments and
international investment position statistics.

12
External debt statistics
During the civil war, the computer system processing debt data was severely damaged, and
little progress has been made in rehabilitating it. As a result, debt data have not been
compiled since mid-1998. The basis for the current external debt database is the 2000 debt
sustainability analysis, which the authorities have used to keep track of the debt situation.
However, this is an Excel-based database and a more sophisticated system is required to
improve day-to-day debt management. Moreover, the Debt Division of the Ministry of
Finance faces serious capacity constraints.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 8, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea-Bissau
On September 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau.1
Background
Guinea-Bissau faces enormous challenges after nearly a decade of conflict, political instability
and withdrawal of donor support. For most of the recent period, economic activity has remained
sluggish with real GDP growing by less than half its pre-conflict levels. The fiscal balance has
widened sharply—–mainly because of an increase in the wage bill—while spending on health
and education remained lower than the regional average. External assistance dwindled at the
same time, leading to mounting domestic arrears and an unsustainable external debt position.
Since mid-2004, Guinea-Bissau has made important strides in overcoming the effects of this
protracted period of instability. Nevertheless, Guinea-Bissau remains a fragile post-conflict
country. Despite attempts to rebuild the government’s administration and address economic
problems, continued tensions among the major political parties, frequent changes in
government, and lack of accountability and ownership of policies have worsened economic
conditions.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Economic activity in 2006 was weaker than expected, as the terms of trade deteriorated
because of lower world prices for cashew nuts—Guinea-Bissau’s main export—and rising
international oil prices. Real GDP growth was less than 2 percent in 2006, down form
3.5 percent in 2005. Government intervention in price-setting in the cashew market, which
disrupted the export supply chain, also hurt economic growth and cashew exports. As a
consequence, the external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened significantly in
2006 even though private remittances surged. Inflation remained subdued, with the consumer
price index increasing by an average of 2 percent, down from 3.4 percent in the previous year.
The fiscal stance severely deteriorated in 2006, reflecting a breakdown in fiscal controls. Weak
management led to expenditure overruns, particularly in travel and representation costs, as well
as large unbudgeted expenditures, including payment of (unaudited) domestic arrears of
previous years, and excessive incentives paid to tax collectors. The wage bill shrunk by almost
1 percent of GDP, but was higher than initially projected due to delays in implementing planned
civil service reforms. Shortfalls in expected donor support exacerbated cash flow difficulties, and
the government resorted to short-term borrowing from commercial banks and issuing treasury
bills. These borrowings were insufficient, however, and large additional domestic arrears were
accumulated by the year’s end.
Financial activity expanded in 2006 with the opening of three new banks, bringing total banks in
the country to four. However, despite an increase in bank deposits, financial intermediation
remained low even by regional standards: credit to the public and private sectors was just
5 percent of GDP in 2006. As elsewhere in the region, banks are very liquid as the lack of
profitable projects has left financial institutions with excess reserves. A large informal sector,
lack of proper financial accounting in most firms, insufficient collateral, and banks only located in
the capital Bissau are key obstacles to expanding bank lending.
Public debt is unsustainably high, and rapid accumulation of domestic arrears has stifled
economic activity. Guinea-Bissau would remain at high risk of external debt distress even after
possible HIPC and MDRI debt relief, while additional donor support is needed to reduce the
outstanding domestic debt burden. Total public debt including arrears amounted to 436 percent
of GDP in 2006, and scheduled annual debt service was about 58 percent of total government
revenues during the same year.
Cashew marketing arrangements are expected to normalize in 2007 and should help economic
activity rebound. Real GDP growth is projected at 3.7 percent. Inflation is expected to remain
below 3 percent, in line with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
convergence criteria. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 13.9 percent of GDP
in 2007, down from 21.4 percent in 2006, reflecting higher exports of cashew nuts, including
from last year’s harvest.
The fiscal stance is expected to deteriorate further in 2007. The government’s cash flow
difficulties worsened in the first half of the year, as fiscal controls weakened further and donors
continued to delay much-needed assistance. Tax revenues have been lower than expected in
the part of the year. Moreover, delays in concluding a new fishing agreement with the EU has

3
resulted in postponement until 2008 of sizeable annual compensation expected in 2007, and
government revenues are now projected some 4 percent of GDP lower than in 2006. Debt
service due in 2007 on treasury bills and (uncollateralized) commercial borrowing contracted in
2006 are also adding financing pressures to the budget.
Faced with the extremely difficult fiscal situation and a large financing gap estimated for 2007,
the new government implemented in April an emergency program to restore fiscal stability. The
action plan envisages policy measures to increase fiscal revenues and restrain expenditures, as
well as measures to improve financial management, enhance supervision and monitoring, and
address some financing weaknesses. While some measures in the emergency program will
have limited quantitative impact in the short run, they have important medium-term implications
and signal the government’s commitment to reverse the macroeconomic situation in 2007 and
beyond. Donors have signaled their support for these measures and have begun to disburse
earlier pledges. However, significant additional external financing is needed to close the 2007
financing gap and avoid substantial further domestic arrears.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress that has been made in
overcoming the effects of a long period of political instability in Guinea-Bissau, and they
welcomed in particular the emergency fiscal program adopted by the new government. At the
same time, the economy and institutions of government remain extremely fragile. Directors
considered that the authorities’ most immediate priorities should be to re-establish fiscal
controls, improve economic management, enhance confidence, and promote further donor
support.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that the main challenge will be the implementation of structural
reform policies that will lay the basis for sustained growth and external viability, and for an
improvement in the standard of living of the population and a reduction in poverty. Directors
underscored the need to enhance the investment climate in order to foster private sector
development, in particular by strengthening governance.
Directors considered that the new fiscal program is a promising start to restore fiscal stability
and transparency and support the needed improvement in fiscal performance. They looked
forward to its rapid implementation, in particular the introduction of measures to prevent
extrabudgetary spending. Directors recommended that the Treasury Committee be made fully
operational, in keeping with the objective of achieving greater transparency in the management
of Treasury functions. Directors observed that current levels of fiscal revenues are insufficient to
cover the government’s financing needs. Given the limitations on increasing revenue collections
in the short term, Directors called for a reduction in the civil service wage bill to a level
commensurate with the available resources. The further accumulation of domestic arrears
needs to be avoided.
Directors agreed that membership in the West African Economic and Monetary Union has
served Guinea-Bissau well, providing an important anchor of nominal stability. However,

4
Guinea-Bissau’s external competitiveness over the past years has been jeopardized by a weak
fiscal policy, infrastructure bottlenecks, and a difficult business environment. Directors
encouraged the authorities to focus on fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms to
boost growth and competitiveness within the monetary union.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reach early agreement on Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance, to be pursued in the context of a strong and credible commitment to fiscal discipline
and the restoration of macroeconomic stability.
Directors observed that Guinea-Bissau will remain reliant on the support of donors over the
medium term in order to reduce the outstanding domestic debt burden and achieve the
country’s economic and social objectives. Such support is likely to depend on the authorities’
commitment to improve governance, strengthen institutional capacity, and implement key
structural reforms. As Guinea-Bissau is severely debt distressed, and likely to remain so even
after possible Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative relief,
new financial assistance should be on highly concessional terms––preferably grants—so as not
to add to the debt burden.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the provision of data for surveillance purposes
and strengthen the statistical system. They recommended that the authorities seek technical
assistance in this area.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Guinea-Bissau
September 17, 2007
I - Introduction
At the outset, I would like on behalf of my Bissau-Guinean authorities to thank staff for the
helpful discussions held during the 2007 Article IV consultations. My authorities are also
grateful to the valuable support received from the international community notably
development partners to help enhance the political and macroeconomic stability. The
macroeconomic appraisal and policies contained in the candid staff report will enable my
authorities to speed up their efforts in implementing economic and structural reforms.
Guinea-Bissau remains a very fragile post-country after experiencing over the past decade a
great hardship due to political instability with a heavy toll on institutions, economic policies
and growth. Thanks to the support of the international community and the strong
determination of all stakeholders within the country towards consolidating the peace process,
the political and economic situation is improving. The new government appointed last April with strong support of the main political parties and trade unions - has embarked on an
Emergency Program for the Restoration of Fiscal Stability aiming at stemming the economic
deterioration, rein in fiscal policy and improve good governance including fight against
corruption. Despite the deep deterioration of physical infrastructure, the lack of human
resources, and difficult financial situation, the new government is making progress in
implementing fiscal and structural measures and has restored the donors' confidence, which
translated in the start of disbursement of pledges made during the meeting held in Geneva
November 2006. In the same context, the authorities have reached agreement with the
European Union on a new fishing accord covering the period 2007-11. Furthermore, they
have resolved the problem in the export of cashew nuts, which suffered in 2006 from the
decline in world prices and from the state's intervention, by reviewing their cashew-pricing
policy in 2007 with a view to better reflect market prices.
As a result of past political and economic difficulties, the public debt is highly unsustainable
both on domestic and external fronts. This situation hampers economic activity and remains a
daunting challenge for my Bissau-Guinean authorities. Building on their emergency program
and with the continuing assistance of their development partners, the authorities are strongly
committed to reverse the trend through achieving macroeconomic stability, improving fiscal
governance and transparency and addressing key structural issues. It is in this respect that my
Bissau-Guinean authorities have expressed the critical need to pursue these reforms under the
Fund's Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA). Under a program supported by the
EPCA, my authorities are hopeful to advance their policy agenda towards further restoration
of macroeconomic stability, improve the domestic and external credibility and build the
necessary track record for consideration of a new PRGF-supported program and eventual
debt relief.

2

Since the last Board meeting, discussions on the EPCA were not concluded owing mainly to
financing gap. My Bissau-Guinean authorities have pursued consultations with donors and
have obtained the confirmation of their support to bridge the financial gap. My authorities are
hopeful that with this constraint cleared a faster conclusion of the EPCA can be made.
II - Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Technical and institutional capacity constraints in addition to delays in obtaining donor
support in a context of significant deterioration of the terms of trade explain the low
performance made under the implementation of the Fund Staff-monitored programs in 2005
and 2006. However it is worth noting that the strong commitment to reforms and good
policies of the new government has laid solid foundations for a clear break from the past.
In 2006, economic activity was less than expected due to the fall in world prices for cashew
nuts coupled with the rise of international oil prices. The real GDP growth is estimated to
less than 2 percent owing to the lack of energy affecting the industry and tourism sectors as
well as the difficulties in the agricultural area. With the authorities' commitment to push
ahead needed structural reforms and improve the business environment for the private sector,
real GDP growth is projected at 3.7 percent in 2007.
The lack of donor support and difficulties experienced in export of cashew nuts led to a
substantial deterioration of the fiscal stance in 2006. To address their financial difficulties,
the authorities were obliged to borrow from commercial banks and issue treasury bills. These
solutions could not stern the cash flows difficulties leading to the accumulation of large
domestic and external arrears by the end of the year notably the civil service salaries. In order
to restore fiscal discipline, the authorities adopted in April measures to institute tight control
on discretionary spending, stop paying excessive incentives to tax collectors and re-instate
and strengthen the Treasury Committee to monitor cash flow. On the revenue side, measures
to collect tax arrears have been intensified.
In the monetary area, inflation remained low in 2006 with broad money growth slowing at
5 percent. The surge in private remittances has led to an accumulation of net foreign assets
and a narrowing of the external current account deficit. The financial activity has expanded
with the opening of three new banks bringing the total to four banks. The increase in deposits
has made these banks very liquid. However, there is a need to further promote the financial
intermediation notably in the area of credit to the private.
III - Policies and Structural Reforms for 2007
The adoption of an emergency program reflects the authorities' strong commitment to
implement bold measures meant to boost fiscal revenue mobilization, restrain public

3
expenditure and promote transparent financial management. In this context the authorities
intend also to lay grounds for restoring confidence and shoring up donor support so as to
increase international aid inflows and speed up the economic recovery and structural reforms'
implementation. Progress made so far is satisfactory and the authorities agree that full
commitment of all stakeholders is crucial for a full implementation of the emergency fiscal
program.
Fiscal policy
Prudent fiscal policy will be pursued with a view to stem the fiscal deterioration and meet
current expenditures including full payment of civil service salaries. In particular, measures
against unbudgeted expenditures as well as those avoiding expensive commercial borrowing
will be fully enforced. Efforts to redress the shortfalls on the revenue front will also be
intensified. To this end and in their efforts to increase revenue and achieve fiscal
sustainability, my authorities agree to expand the tax base, strengthen tax administration,
enforce fishing licenses and increase the collection of non tax revenues expected from oil and
mining explorations.
In addition, an adequate functioning of the Treasury Committee will ensure that the Treasury
is the sole entity entitled to receive revenues and pay expenditures. In the same vein, banking
accounts of all ministries and public entities will be centralized in a single treasury account at
the central bank. To improve fiscal transparency, a financial audit of all sources of
government revenue will be undertaken under the control of Treasury. Therefore, all
recommendations made by recent FAD and Afritac-West technical assistance missions are
welcome and will be fully implemented. In view of capacity constraints facing the country,
my authorities are hopeful that the international community and the Fund will pursue their
assistance in institutional and capacity building.
Monetary Policy and Financial Reforms
The BCEAO is the regional central bank implementing the common monetary policy in the
eight WAEMU countries including Guinea-Bissau. The sound implementation of the
regional policy has translated in a low inflation. The adherence of Guinea-Bissau to
WAEMU has helped to borrow at the regional market and finance the public expenditure.
With the expansion of the banking sector, the authorities intend to promote the financial
intermediation notably in the rural areas.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
My authorities are aware that the main challenges they face are to revive economic growth,
build up infrastructure and public institutions in order to sustain the socio-political
environment. In this regard, obstacles to growth have been identified and needed policies and

4
measures to address them will be implemented. Among these obstacles, there are weak fiscal
policies, lack of basic services notably energy supply as well as telecommunications and low
skills of labor force. The authorities are committed to re-establish credible and
comprehensive budget preparation and execution procedures as well as to re-implement
adequate systems of cash and debt management.
Regarding the economy's competitiveness within the regional exchange regime, the
authorities are of the view that focusing their efforts on fiscal adjustment and productivityenhancing reforms will boost economic growth and competitiveness. To this end, policies to
be implemented will aim at resolving domestic arrears, reallocating spending towards
productivity-enhancing projects, raising the efficiency of public administration, simplifying
the regulatory framework and enhancing the judicial system with a view to improve
confidence of investors. The authorities are very concerned about the poor electricity supply
which is identified as one of the greatest impediment to economic and social development.
They agree to work closely with development partners including the World Bank to cover the
short-term power generation. They also press ahead the preparations to launch and
implement the multi-sector infrastructure rehabilitation project.
With regard to the cashew nut sector which is the major source of exports and revenue for
rural population, my authorities are committed to refrain from intervening in the price-setting
mechanism. They intend also to look for alternative sources of fiscal revenues in order to
reduce reliance on export taxes on cashew nuts. To this end the industrial processing of
cashew nuts will be encouraged. To continue improving the enforcement and administrative
control of fishing licenses, the authorities are making progress in the monitoring of the
country's territorial waters and will also collaborate with neighboring countries under
ongoing regional fishery initiatives supported by the European Union and the World Bank.
Debt Issue and External Support
The Debt Sustainability Analysis has rightly concluded that Guinea-Bissau is in debt distress.
At end-2006, the total public debt reached $1.24 billion or 403 percent of GDP. Domestic
debt increased form 15 percent of total public debt in 2000 to 20 percent in 2006. External
debt accounts for $993 million with $350 million in arrears. Debt due to multilateral
institutions amounts to 48 percent of total public and publicly guaranteed debt and the
remaining 52 percent is owed to bilateral and commercial creditors. My authorities are
mindful of this unsustainable situation. They remain determined to strengthen fiscal stance,
avoid non concessional debt and increase grant content of aid received. They will in
particular make every effort to provide a stable political and business environment to favor
private investment and increase inflow of external assistance. Relations with all creditors will
be normalized to pave the way for the eligibility to debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and
MDRI. My Bissau-Guinean authorities also fully agree that policies containing the wage bill
and avoiding off-budget expenditure are needed to rein in the growth of public debt and give

a boost to the economic growth. In their hard efforts to benefit from the EPCA the authorities
will take all necessary arrangements to meet needed requirements in order to remain current
on debt service with multilateral creditors.
IV - Conclusion
My Bissau-Guinean authorities highly value the constructive dialogue held with staff under
this Article IV consultation. They are cognizant that despite efforts made to sustain political
stability and restore macroeconomic stability in the context of the emergency program
launched last April, a lot remains to be done. They remain firmly committed to reforms with
a view to pursue the adjustment process and sustain the momentum for prudent and sound
policies. In this regard, my authorities' efforts need to be complemented by a strong and
continued technical and financial assistance from the international community. My
authorities would appreciate Board consideration for EPCA.
