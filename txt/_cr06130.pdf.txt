EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

A recovery of economic activity gathered strength in 2003, with real GDP growth
estimated at close to 4 percent. Continued low inflation reflects the full dollarization of
the economy. Banking activity also recovered, following the downturn of 2001−02.

•

The fiscal responsibility law of 2002 aims at lowering the public debt burden through
annual limits on the fiscal deficit. The deficit limit (2 percent of GDP) was met
in 2002, but preliminary data suggest it may have been exceeded in 2003.

•

The medium-term outlook is sound, assuming continued pursuit of prudent fiscal
policies, growth-enhancing structural reforms, and adequate investment in economic
infrastructure and human capital, particularly in the export-oriented service sector
where the country has a comparative advantage.

•

Elections are scheduled for May 2004, and the thrust of market-friendly policies is
expected to continue after the change of government in September.

Policy discussions
•

2004 fiscal policy. To meet the fiscal deficit limit in 2004, measures yielding about
1 percent of GDP are needed. The authorities have decided on measures that would
cover about half of this gap, and are working to identify additional ones to ensure
observance of the deficit limit. The staff recommended adoption of a quarterly program
to help guide fiscal policy during the political transition.

•

Fiscal reforms. Sustained compliance with the fiscal responsibility law will require
structural reforms, including further improvement of tax administration; civil service
reform, and a deepening of the tax reform of 2002, in part by broadening the tax base.

•

Pension reform. Comprehensive reform of the pension system is needed to ensure its
viability. The authorities are taking some administrative steps to reduce the deficit, but
comprehensive reform will have to be done by the new government.

•

Financial sector. The prudential framework has been strengthened and is now fully
compliant with Basel Core Principles. The authorities prefer not to establish formal
lender-of-last-resort and deposit insurance schemes, given the focus of the prudential
system on crisis prevention and ample liquidity cushions in the banks.

•

Medium-term growth strategy. The authorities intend to further develop Panama as a
hub for transportation, communication and related export-oriented services. Policy
initiatives to this end include further trade liberalization and legislation for special
economic zones to allow greater flexibility in the terms of employment.

-6-

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. A Brief Perspective
1.
Panama’s economy is fully dollarized (since 1904) and relatively open. Panama’s
comparative advantage lies in the service sector, accounting for about 80 percent of GDP,
including the operations of the Panama Canal, the Colon Free Zone, and a large banking
system that is integrated with international financial markets. The banking system is sound and
well regulated. Annual output growth averaged 3.7 percent over the decade to 2002. With
public debt over 60 percent of GDP, prudent fiscal policies are essential, in support of which a
fiscal responsibility law was enacted in 2002. Key among needed fiscal reforms is an overhaul
of the social security system. Full dollarization also makes flexible labor markets a priority.
2.
Panama’s social indicators compare favorably with the average for Latin
America, but there are marked differences among geographical areas. The poverty rate is
37 percent on average (65 percent in rural areas, where 38 percent of the population live in
extreme poverty), with a particularly high concentration of poverty among indigenous people
(95 percent). Other indicators of the standard of living—including education levels, life
expectancy, and employment—are significantly higher in urban than rural areas. As part of the
effort to reduce poverty, programs to improve the quality and targeting of social spending are
being supported by the World Bank and UNDP.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
A pronounced slowdown of Panama’s economy took place in 2001–02 (Figure 1
and Table 1). Real GDP grew by only ½ percent a year in 2001–02, held back by the winding
down of large investment projects, the global economic slowdown (which affected the
transport and other export-oriented service sectors) and a weak regional economy (which
depressed net exports from the Colon Free Zone).
4.
Real GDP growth recovered in 2003 to an estimated 3.9 percent. The recovery has
been led by a boom in construction (partly stimulated by a December 2002 tax law),1 the
primary sector (particularly the fishing industry), and a rebound of export-oriented services in
the latter part of the year, notably trading activity in the Colon Free Zone and ports.
Unemployment declined modestly in 2003, but it remains high at above 13 percent.
5.
Inflation remains low, reflecting full dollarization. It rose to 1.8 percent
during 2002, reflecting some pickup in domestic demand (compared with zero inflation
in 2001 when domestic demand had declined). Inflation diminished in 2003, to a 12-month
rate of 1 percent in October.

1

Construction that is authorized before end-2003 and completed before end-2004 will be
exempt from property taxes for 20 years. Subsequently, a shorter tax-exempt period will apply.

-7-

6.
The public finances have deteriorated in recent years. The nonfinancial public
sector (NFPS) balance shifted into a deficit in 2001, which widened in 2002 (Tables 2 and 3).
A drop in tax collections in 2001 reflected the slowing economy, and over the last few years
the finances of the social security system have weakened considerably as a result of higher
pensions and a large increase in staffing and administrative expenses.2
7.
Policy actions were taken in 2002 to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase
revenues. A fiscal responsibility law was enacted in May 2002, limiting the NFPS deficit to
2 percent of GDP and targeting a gradual reduction in public debt to 50 percent of GDP.3 The
deficit limit for the year was observed, partly reflecting cuts in spending in the second half of
the year as well as some extraordinary capital revenues.4 In December 2002, the Assembly
approved a tax reform that yielded an estimated 0.4 percent of GDP in additional revenue
in 2003 (Box 1).
8.
However, in 2003 the deficit limit appears to have been exceeded. Higher revenues
from tax reform were offset by lower nontax receipts,5 while capital revenues were much
lower than in 2002.6 Cuts in both current and capital outlays in the last quarter of the year were
not sufficient to bring the NFPS deficit to within the 2-percent of GDP limit specified under
the fiscal responsibility law; the deficit is estimated to have reached 2½ percent of GDP.7
9.
The banking system experienced some stress during 2002 as a result of the
turbulence in financial markets in South America, but it began to recover in 2003. Banks
operating in Panama—particularly foreign banks—experienced large withdrawals of deposits
by nonresidents in 2002, and responded by curtailing foreign credit operations (Figure 2).
However, the impact on banks’ domestic operations was less severe, with domestic deposits
and credit to the private sector contracting only modestly. Deposit spreads (over LIBOR) rose
2

Employment in the social security agency (CSS) rose by 43 percent from 2000 to 2002. The
director of the CSS was replaced in late 2003.
3

Features of the law are described in the Staff Report for the 2002 Article IV Consultation,
Box 1.
4

Capital revenue included capital gains from buybacks of Brady bonds equivalent to
0.9 percent of GDP.
5

In particular, dividends paid by privatized enterprises and the National Bank of Panama were
reduced, and interest income from the Development Trust Fund declined.
6

Buybacks of Brady bonds and associated capital gains, originally expected in the latter part
of 2003, did not take place.

The law does not provide for penalties in the case of noncompliance with the fiscal rules.

-8-

in 2001–02, particularly for local banks, a higher risk premium reflecting the turbulence in
financial markets in South America (Figure 3). Private sector credit and bank deposits resumed
a slow growth in the second half of 2003, and falling deposit spreads during the same period
gave further evidence of recovery of the banking sector (Table 4).
10.
The fundamentals of the banking system remain sound, despite the contraction of
assets in 2002. Capital adequacy ratios exceeded 17 percent on average as of November 2003;
liquidity is ample; and banks sharply improved their profitability in 2003 thanks to the
rebound in the sector and cost-cutting measures by several banks (Table 5). Nonperforming
loan ratios decreased somewhat in 2003, to less than 3 percent on average as of endSeptember 2003.
11.
Bank interest rates have trended downward since international interest rates
started to decline in 2000 (see Figure 3). Foreign banks lowered deposit rates faster than
local banks, reflecting their closer integration with international financial markets, while
domestic lending rates have declined with a lag.
C. Political Situation
12.
The government, with a thin majority in the Assembly, has emphasized
consensus-building in its economic policy-making. It has employed national dialogues on
issues of economic recovery and social security reform to build consensus for policy change.
Presidential and congressional elections are scheduled for May 2004, and the change of
government will take place in September. The economic policies advocated by the main
presidential candidates do not signal a departure from the market-friendly policies of the
current administration.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
The staff projects a further recovery of real GDP growth to over 4 percent
in 2004. The recovery will benefit from accelerating growth in domestic demand, as well as
the impact of an improved external

Economic activity could recover more rapidly than projected if recent positive trends in
the service sectors strengthen further (in response to the improving external
environment), private consumption remains buoyant in 2004, or the construction boom
proves stronger than projected.

15.
Underlying vulnerabilities center on the high public debt and the policy
constraints implied by full dollarization. In particular:

8

•

The relatively high public debt limits the room for maneuver of fiscal policy.8 The
resulting vulnerability is compounded by the full dollarization and consequent absence
of monetary and exchange rate policies.

•

Full dollarization imposes stringent demands on the policy framework, owing to the
reduced range of policy instruments and the need for labor market flexibility. If they
are met, dollarization is a source of strength and stability, but if not, the economy could
be overwhelmed by a variety of shocks.

•

Dollarization also may enhance the risk of a potential deposit run, since there is no
lender of last resort. Key buffers against this risk should include a strong fiscal sector
and a sound banking system, in which banks maintain ample liquidity and have
business plans for responding to unanticipated liquidity needs.

The statutory 2-percent of GDP deficit limit, if pursued as a short-term (annual) target, would
also limit the room for maneuver of fiscal policy.

- 10 -

•

The economy, because of its openness and integration with the global economy, is
vulnerable to adverse developments in the external environment. Besides the need for
greater room for maneuver of fiscal policy, external competitiveness requires reforms
to enhance productivity and labor market flexibility.

16.
A baseline scenario through 2008 assumes that the fiscal deficit is maintained at
2 percent of GDP, in line with the legal limit (Appendix V, Table 1).9 Real GDP growth is
assumed at 3¾ percent a year, equal to the average over the last decade (Box 2). Under this
scenario, the public debt declines to 57 percent of GDP by 2008, but there are large gross
fiscal financing needs in the latter years of the projection period which could be a source of
vulnerability to rollover risk. Also, there is virtually no room for countercyclical policy under
the baseline scenario, owing to the assumption that the fiscal deficit ceiling under the fiscal
responsibility law is treated as a target each year. A risk to this scenario is if the incoming
administration were unable to build consensus for the needed reform of the pension system
and to comply with the fiscal rules.
17.
The staff recommended a somewhat stronger medium-term fiscal position. A
scenario with an average deficit of 1 percent of GDP would bring the public debt ratio to about
50 percent by 2008, substantially reduce the gross financing needs, and provide room for
automatic stabilizers to operate. The staff’s recommended scenario also assumes the
implementation of growth-oriented structural reforms that would raise the economy’s growth
path (see Appendix V).
18.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the public debt dynamics are vulnerable to policy
slippage and shocks (see Appendix V). If no measures are taken to reduce the fiscal deficit
(implying a departure from fiscal rules, with the deficit rising to 4 percent of GDP in 2008),
the public debt ratio would decline only marginally (to 60 percent of GDP), with significantly
increased gross financing needs. This would leave the country vulnerable to shocks,
particularly to growth and interest rates.
19.
A potentially large expansion of the Panama Canal is being studied that could
have a far-reaching impact on the economy’s growth prospects. A proposal may be ready
by mid-2004. A decision to proceed with the project, with an investment cost ranging up to
50 percent of GDP, would be taken only on the basis of a national referendum, and the project
would be completed in the next decade. The financing strategy would be to obtain an
9

The fiscal responsibility law also limits the growth rate of nominal debt (to 80 percent of the
growth in nominal GDP) if real GDP growth exceeds 1.5 percent. Effectively, the debt limit
constrains the deficit when real GDP growth is in the range of 1½–3 percent. For example, if
nominal GDP growth is 5 percent, implying a maximum 4-percent increase in nominal debt,
the deficit limit of 2 percent of GDP would likely be the binding constraint on fiscal
operations.

investment-grade credit rating for the Panama Canal Authority, and seek private sector
financing that does not rely on a government guarantee.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
20.
Discussions centered on the economic recovery in 2003 and outlook for 2004; the
stance of fiscal policy; social security reform; and the government’s strategy for raising
economic growth over the medium term.
21.
A recurring theme during the discussions was the importance of building
consensus for policy reforms in order to ensure their sustainability. The authorities
successfully employed a dialogue and consultation process that resulted in unanimous
legislative support for the fiscal responsibility law in 2002. In the area of social security
reform, however, the objective of reaching full consensus has not been achieved; the national
dialogue on social security reform, which began in 2001, has so far not resulted in an
agreement on substantive proposals for pension reform. The next administration will have to
carry the process forward in a way that leads to policy decisions for the needed reforms.
A. Fiscal Policy
22.
The authorities considered that the fiscal responsibility law provides an
appropriate framework for the conduct of fiscal policy. Although the deficit limit in 2003
was probably exceeded, they noted that the law’s objective of reducing the debt burden will be
achieved, and that the framework has proven important in maintaining fiscal discipline in the
run-up to elections.
23.
The staff concurred on the beneficial role of the fiscal rules and emphasized the
importance of adhering to them in 2004. Staff noted that projections based on the approved
budget for 2004 imply a need for measures equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP, in order to
meet the 2-percent GDP deficit limit.10 To meet the limit, the staff recommended steps to
improve the social security balance and to postpone some of the budgeted increases in
government employment (with a projected total impact of 0.6 percentage point of GDP).
Additional measures to close the remaining gap could include further restraint of low-priority
expenditure.
24.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to continued compliance with the
fiscal responsibility law in 2004. They explained that some measures for reducing the fiscal

assumptions for capital revenue.

- 12 -

deficit in 2004 were already being taken. They thought that cuts in nonessential spending
could close the remaining gap.11
25.
The staff recommended that the authorities prepare a quarterly fiscal program
consistent with the annual fiscal rules, to guide policy implementation during the
political transition and avoid a repeat of the stop-go pattern of 2003. The authorities
agreed that this would be useful, and noted their intention to implement—as recommended by
staff—spending restraint in a way that avoids accumulation of arrears.
26.
While recognizing the benefits of a stronger fiscal position over the medium term,
the authorities considered adherence to the fiscal responsibility law as sufficient.
Lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio gradually to 50 percent was the core goal of the fiscal
responsibility law, which should ensure medium-term debt sustainability. They also noted that
announcing a more ambitious target might risk undermining the broad national consensus that
has been built around the law. Staff suggested that some refinements of the fiscal
responsibility law be considered going forward, such as rules to guide policy implementation
during political transitions, and defining debt limits in a way that permits the pre-funding of
deficits. The authorities noted that such changes could only be effected by the next
government.
27.
The authorities’ debt management strategy seeks to improve the maturity
structure of debt and deepen the domestic capital market. Three- and five-year treasury
notes began to be issued in 2002, helping to define a Panamanian yield curve. Global bond
issues, totaling US$3.7 billion since 1999, have been used to meet fiscal financing needs and
retire Brady bonds.12 The authorities have decided that all future sovereign bond issues would
include collective action clauses (CACs), starting with a bond issue of US$250 million in
January 2004.
28.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the need for a comprehensive reform of
the pension system to restore its solvency and ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Their approach aims first at improving the finances of the system through gradual reductions
in staffing and steps to raise the yield on the social security fund’s portfolio. The second stage
would entail a comprehensive reform to be implemented after the September 2004 change in
government. The participants in the national dialogue on social security reform, representing

11

The projections in Tables 2 and 3 include the measures which the government already has
decided upon (lowering operating expenditure in the social security sector and raising the yield
of the social security fund’s portfolio), leaving some 0.7 percent of GDP of measures to be
adopted.
12

The latest buyback of Brady bonds (US$400 million, in January 2004) reduced the stock of
Brady bonds to less than US$400 million.

- 13 -

government, business, and labor, have presented a variety of proposals for reducing the large
actuarial deficit (Box 3).13
29.
The authorities acknowledged the need for other structural reforms to sustain
compliance with fiscal rules. Steps that should be considered are to improve tax
administration; rationalize government expenditure through civil service reform (better
aligning staffing levels with needs and improving the public sector wage-setting mechanism);
and deepen the 2002 tax reform, mainly by broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions.
B. Financial Sector Policies
30.
The supervisory framework has been strengthened. Since the Module 2 OFC report
of 2001, which reported a high level of compliance with most Basel Core Principles, the
authorities have taken actions toward reaching full compliance (mainly improving offsite and
onsite inspections and the regulation of banks’ equity investments). Several other
recommendations also have been implemented, including enhanced legal protection for
supervisors; strengthened procedures for bank mergers and acquisitions; and progress with the
consolidated supervision of financial entities, which in some cases involves cooperation with
regulators in other jurisdictions.14
31.
The authorities have taken the view that a formal lender-of-last-resort scheme is
not needed in Panama. They explained that the banking system derives its strength from a
strong regulatory and supervisory framework, and from the market discipline that is fostered
by the absence of official safety nets and contingency mechanisms to cushion liquidity
shortfalls. They believed that, given the strong emphasis on crisis prevention, transparency,
market discipline, the potential benefits of formal contingent credit mechanisms would be
outweighed by the attendant moral hazard. The authorities noted that both foreign and
domestic banks maintain high levels of liquidity. The liquidity ratio (liquid assets in relation to
deposits) averaged 28 percent as of end-November, and the average liquidity ratio that
includes marketable securities is over 40 percent for both foreign and domestic banks.15

13

An actuarial model is being developed with assistance from the UNDP to estimate the
uncovered liabilities of the pension system. Unofficial estimates from 1998 suggest that these
unfunded obligations are over 50 percent of GDP in NPV terms, including future obligations
to contributors who have not yet retired.
14

The status of compliance with the Basel Core Principles will be assessed by an MFD
mission for the Module 2 OFC follow-up, scheduled for March/April 2004.
15

More than half of the securities are marketed outside Panama, and one third of the total
comprises investment-grade securities, thus providing a high degree of liquidity.

32.
The authorities also believe that there is no clear need to establish a deposit
insurance scheme. They explained that its absence in Panama has not had a demonstrably
adverse effect on confidence in the banking system, and that protection of small depositors is
provided by giving priority over most other claims to the payment of deposits up to US$5,000.
In their view, deposit insurance would create moral hazard and could create significant
contingent fiscal liabilities. Given the absence of lender-of-last-resort and deposit insurance
schemes, the staff emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong supervisory framework
for the financial sector, with a focus on crisis prevention, transparency, market discipline, and
ample liquidity cushions, as well as a sound fiscal policy. The staff also encouraged the
authorities to consider to adjust for inflation the ceiling on small deposits with priority over
other creditor claims in the event of bank liquidation (in accordance with provisions in the
Banking Law).
33.
The authorities attach a high priority to combating money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. Panama has a comprehensive legislative framework to combat money
laundering, and it has ratified the UN International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism. The authorities are preparing draft legislation that would criminalize
the financing of terrorism.
C. Trade Policy, Competitiveness, and Labor Market
Trade
34.
The government’s strategy to raise growth is to further develop Panama as a hub
for transportation, communication, and related services. These are areas of comparative
advantage that, under the right framework, can attract foreign investors seeking the country’s
well-developed service infrastructure. The authorities explained that free trade agreements are
central to their strategy for boosting investment and growth. In their view, the most important
benefits of free trade agreements accrue indirectly by encouraging foreign investors with a
regional focus to establish operations in Panama, making use of the transportation, financial,
and communications infrastructure. A free trade agreement with Taiwan Province of China
was concluded in the second half of 2003, and discussions on an agreement with the
United States (Panama’s main export market) are to begin in April. Based on Panama’s
economic integration treaty with the Central American countries in 2002, a trade agreement
with El Salvador has been concluded, and negotiations with Costa Rica and Nicaragua are
under way.
35.
Panama’s trading system is relatively open. It has a low average tariff but also
prohibitively high tariffs on selected agricultural products (300 percent for certain poultry
products).16 The authorities explained that some import tariffs and subsidies on nontraditional

16

The unweighted average tariff is 8.6 percent, and the country has a rating of 1 (i.e., open) on
the Fund’s 1–10 trade restrictiveness index.

- 15 -

exports would be phased out by end-2005 under the terms of accession to the WTO.17 They
expect to replace export subsidies with more general tax incentives for the manufacturing
sector, consistent with WTO rules, through a law on industrial policy that became effective
February 2004. The authorities estimated the law’s fiscal impact to be neutral, as the new tax
expenditures would be about offset by the elimination of export subsidies.
Competitiveness
36.
The real effective exchange rate has declined sharply since 2002 (Figure 6), but
there are questions about Panama’s competitiveness from a broader perspective. Panama
ranked 59th out of 85 countries in a recent competitiveness study by the World Economic
Forum,18 owing to perceptions of weak public institutions and weaknesses in the business
environment such as labor market rigidities and certain licensing requirements and laws that
discourage investment. A competitiveness project supported by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) includes reforms in these areas to promote private sector investment
and employment.19 The competitiveness problems appear to be less severe in the large
international services sector, which is subject to less regulation than the agriculture and
manufacturing sectors, whose performance has lagged that of other sectors in recent years. The
staff noted, however, that declining industrial production did not justify the preferential
income tax treatment that is planned for this sector in the recent legislation on industrial
policy.
Labor Market
37.
The authorities are seeking to promote a more efficient labor market in ways that
are politically and socially acceptable. The labor code poses obstacles to job creation
because of the difficulty of laying off employees when needed; it also imposes high nonwage
labor costs and inhibits temporary employment. The authorities pointed out that it would be
very difficult to achieve broad domestic consensus on comprehensive reform of the labor code.
Instead, they are proposing legislation for special economic zones near the Panama Canal,
which would allow for greater flexibility in the terms of employment—particularly for
businesses that need to operate at night or on weekends—and thereby foster job creation. They
hope that the success of such “pilot” projects might reduce opposition to extending those labor
practices to the entire country.

17

Panama joined the WTO in 1997.

18

Panama’s ranking among Latin American countries was more favorable (8th of
21 countries).
19

In particular, the project seeks to remove sector-specific barriers to foreign investment and
to enhance the transparency of the legal framework for foreign investors.

- 16 -

D. Other Issues
38.
The authorities have made progress in implementing a number of
recommendations of the last Article IV consultation. In particular, the authorities’ focus on
meeting the debt and deficit sustainability targets embodied in the fiscal responsibility law is
consistent with the thrust of Directors’ recommendations on fiscal policy, even though the
deficit limit was probably exceeded in 2003. Directors had urged the authorities to implement
a revenue-enhancing tax reform; as noted, a tax package was approved in late 2002, yielding
about ½ percent of GDP in 2003. The draft law now before the Assembly providing for more
flexible terms of employment in special economic zones follows the recommendation to
strengthen the legal framework to facilitate job creation and investment.
39.
Progress has been more limited in other areas of structural reform where the pace
of implementation depends on progress in building consensus. In particular, a broad
domestic consensus remains to be achieved on pension reform, which is key to medium-term
fiscal sustainability. The authorities noted that the need to build consensus for policy reforms
was a key factor that determined the extent and speed with which they could implement Fund
policy advice. In many cases, a key challenge involved achieving legislative approval of
reforms.
40.
The timeliness and coverage of economic statistics is generally adequate for
monitoring purposes, but some weaknesses remain. A recent revision of the national
accounts is an improvement.20 Also, the authorities are working to reduce reporting lags for
fiscal data. The frequency and coverage of labor market statistics should be improved.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
A recovery of the economy is under way. The economic slowdown in 2001–02
reflected developments in the regional economy, and initial signs of a recovery in early 2003
gathered strength in the course of the year. The recovery is expected to continue in 2004.
42.
The fiscal responsibility law provides a sound framework for fiscal policy. It has
helped maintain a focus on the need for a prudent fiscal stance and expenditure restraint. The
staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to this framework, which is aimed at limiting
fiscal deficits and ensuring medium-term debt sustainability.
43.
The main focus of fiscal policy for 2004 should be to ensure the observance of the
fiscal responsibility law. Meeting the deficit limit this year is essential for the credibility of
the fiscal rules and will require the adoption of additional measures. The staff encourages the
authorities to prepare a quarterly fiscal program for this election year to guide fiscal policy
during the political transition.
20

GDP coverage was extended to include the canal (after its reversion to Panama at end-1999)
and some informal sector activities; GDP for 2002 was revised upward by 18 percent.

- 17 -

44.
A comprehensive reform of the pension system is needed to restore its solvency.
The staff encourages the authorities’ efforts to improve the finances of the social security
system by rationalizing its staff and improving the social security fund’s portfolio
management. However, more fundamental reforms are also needed that will generate sufficient
savings to cover the direct and contingent liabilities of the pension system. Sustained
compliance with fiscal rules will also require other structural reforms, including steps to
improve tax administration, civil service reform, and deepening the 2002 tax reform by further
broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions.
45.
Staff welcomes the progress in further strengthening bank regulation and
supervision. The authorities have implemented the recommendations made during the OFC
Module 2 assessment, bringing the supervisory framework into greater compliance with Basel
Core Principles. Progress has been particularly noteworthy in the areas of inspections and in
implementing consolidated supervision of regional banking institutions, in collaboration with
regulators in other jurisdictions. Current arrangements, including a strong supervisory
framework focused on crisis prevention, transparency, and ample liquidity cushions in the
banking system, have served the financial system well. While the staff recognizes the
preference not to introduce deposit insurance, the authorities should consider protecting the
social safety net for small depositors by inflation-adjusting the size of deposits with priority
status in the event of a bank liquidation.
46.
The staff supports the emphasis in the government’s growth strategy on
exploiting the country’s comparative advantage in the export-oriented service sector. To
this end, policies seek to focus on providing the needed economic infrastructure, promoting
good governance, and strengthening the environment for productive investment and job
creation. The task of designing and implementing policy reform in this area is challenging, and
the IDB-supported competitiveness project is a welcome effort to this end. Reducing labor
market rigidities will be particularly important, and the staff encourages the authorities’ efforts
to seek the necessary consensus for reforms in this area, initially through greater flexibility in
the terms of employment in special economic zones.
47.
The staff supports the authorities’ plans for further trade liberalization. In
pursuing bilateral and regional trade agreements, the authorities should make sure that these
agreements are broad-based, comprehensive, and consistent with multilateral trading
arrangements being pursued under the Doha Round.
48.
The medium-term outlook is sound, assuming continued pursuit of prudent fiscal
policies and growth-enhancing structural reforms. On this basis, prospects are for sustained
growth with a declining public debt burden, and a possible expansion of the Panama Canal
could give a significant further boost to Panama’s longer run growth potential.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Panama take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Tax Reform
Reforms in 2002
•

The 2002 tax law included a combination of tax reductions and increases with a
projected net revenue yield of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003 (the authorities’ proposal
envisaged a yield of 0.8 percent of GDP). The main components of the approved
law are:
¾ The annual exemption under the personal income tax was raised from US$3,900
to US$10,400.
¾ Banks’ income, previously largely exempt, became taxable.
¾ Some fiscal incentives are being phased out over five years (including tax
exemptions for construction).
¾ The corporate income tax rate was lowered from 30 percent to 28 percent.
¾ The VAT base was widened to include selected services, albeit with many
exceptions.
¾ A 5-percent consumption tax was levied on a selective basis, mainly for luxury
goods.
¾ Tax exemptions for the housing sector were modified for better targeting to
low-income housing.

•

A law to reform the main tax agency was approved in 2002, supported by regional
technical assistance to improve tax administration.

Agenda for future reform
•

Broaden the VAT to encompass a wider range of services.

•

Close loopholes and reduce poorly targeted tax expenditures.

•

Provide the tax administration authority with the required legal framework to
enforce the law and reduce tax evasion.

- 19 Box 2. Sources of Growth
•

The collapse in output in Panama resulting from the political crisis of the 1980s was
followed by a period of broad economic recovery, particularly in the dominant service sector,
which accounts for almost 80 percent of GDP. The growth of export-oriented services was
facilitated by Panama’s integration into the world economy, and services exports, anchored
around the Panama Canal, the Colon Free Zone, and an open and well regulated banking
system. Strong growth in the 1990s was followed by the regional slowdown of 2000-01.

•

Despite the strong growth record of the 1990s, total factor productivity growth has been
stubbornly low (Table). Key reforms needed to boost productivity growth include reducing
labor market frictions (below), and improving education by, for example, promoting skills
relevant to service exports such as language training.

Domestic investment for 1989-1990 is averaged to control for political instability. The tertiary sector is
comprised of services.

Panama’s unemployment rate has persisted above 10 percent for many years, exacerbated
by a rising labor participation rate. The high structural unemployment may be partly
attributable to overregulation and labor market frictions. Labor market reforms should include
instituting part-time and evening work schedules, test periods for employees, and decreasing
severance packages. The difficult political challenge of implementing labor reform has led the
authorities to focus initially on changes in labor market conditions in special economic zones
(para. 37).

Box 3. Social Security Reform
•

The balance of the Social Security Fund (CSS) has deteriorated in recent years, from
a surplus of US$133 million in 1999 to a deficit of US$18 million in 2002. The deficit is
expected to have widened further in 2003.
¾ The reserves of the CSS are well below the legal requirement, which is to cover obligations to
current pensioners. This uncovered obligation was estimated at US$2.1 billion (16 percent of GDP)
in a 1998 ILO study. The total unfunded obligations, taking into account the claims of current
contributors, were estimated at 56 percent of GDP.
¾ The reserves of the CSS would be depleted by 2023, according to the 1998 study. A revised ILO
study in 2001 estimated that reserves would be depleted by 2018.
¾

•

•

The financial imbalance in the CSS has been exacerbated by a sharp increase in personnel and
operating costs, owing mainly to a 60-percent increase in employees from 1999 to 2002.

The financial problems are rooted in the imbalance between pension benefits and
contributions to the pay-as-you-go pension system. Already, contributions do not
cover current benefits, and the deficit will widen progressively in the absence of a
comprehensive reform of the system. Benefits include:
¾

For a minimum contribution period of 15 years, a worker receives a pension of 60 percent of the
reference wage, and for every additional year of contribution payments, 1¼ percentage points is
added.

¾

The retirement age for men is 62 years and for women 57 years.

¾

A nonbinding ceiling of US$1,500 a month applies for most pensions (with the average pension
being about US$500).

A reform of the social security system is needed to ensure its sustainability.
¾ The government has promoted a national dialogue on social security reform. The dialogue has been
anchored by task forces for each of the CSS’s four programs: disability, old age, and death benefits
(IVM); maternity and health care; workmen’s compensation; and the CSS administration.
¾ The UNDP is assisting as a facilitator of the debate and a compiler of the proposals presented by the
government, employers, workers, and civil society.
¾ Consensus has been reached on aspects of three programs, but the task force on pensions (IVM) has
reached no conclusions. Proposals tabled have included higher contribution rates, a longer minimum
contribution period, and changes in retirement age (employers), and the preservation of existing
benefits (workers).

Exchange Rate Arrangements
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, National Bank of Panama (NBP) was
subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement,
which was approved on June 30, 2000 and expired on March 29, 2002. The
transitional procedures required a review of the NBP's external audit mechanism
only. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that NBP's
external audit mechanism was at the time adequate, as reported in the Staff Report for
the 2002 Article IV Consultation, May 22, 2002.

APPENDIX III

Panama: Relations with the World Bank

The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Panama, covering the
period 1999−2001, included among its central objectives a continued support toward reducing
poverty and inequality through a selective focus on environmentally sustainable development.
Accordingly, the Bank directed its investment and technical assistance to programs that aim to
increase rural incomes, curtail environmental degradation, conserve biodiversity and stem
deforestation.
Using the program flexibility built into the 1998 CAS, the Bank has delivered assistance over
the past five years at the broad reform agenda and at the sectoral level. As of
December 31, 2003, the Bank portfolio consists of six investment projects. The total
commitment amounts to US$148.2 million, of which US$82.2 million is undisbursed. The
overriding objective of the Bank strategy in Panama has been to reduce the high incidence of
poverty and improve the nutrition, health and education of low-income groups, targeting the
rural population and indigenous communities. Projects like Basic Education II, Land
Administration, Rural Poverty and Natural Resources and the Social Investment Fund have
helped achieve these goals.
One of the priorities of the government’s economic program is trade liberalization and reform
through the negotiation of bilateral, multilateral and regional trade agreements. The Bank,
through the Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance Loan, approved in July 2001, is
helping to strengthen the government's capacity for economic policy formulation and
implementation and is providing assistance for: (i) trade policy negotiations, the
implementation of commitments under the World Trade Organization, and regional trade talks;
(ii) capacity building in standards and technical regulation; (iii) strengthening the protection of
intellectual property rights, and (iv) upgrading equipment, and the construction of new
databases and information systems.
Most recently, the announcement of negotiations with the United States on a free trade
agreement (FTA) has given way to a review of planned studies, seminars, and other tasks
included in the original TA project. After the new government assumes office in
September 2004, there will be discussions about a coordinated set of instruments to strengthen
export performance and facilitate trade. Capacity-building assistance through the TA project
will provide a foundation for continued progress in trade expansion and export-led growth.

APPENDIX IV

Panama—Statistical Issues
Economic statistics are generally adequate for monitoring purposes, but there is a need for
more timely reporting. Fiscal expenditure and financing data are transmitted to the Fund with
a lag of six to eight weeks. A program is under way to improve government finance statistics
through the implementation of an integrated financial administration system (SIAFPA).
Panama has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
December 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
1.

Real sector

The authorities are completing a revision of the national accounts with a change in the base
year from 1982 to 1996, based on the 1993 SNA. The project entails an update on the
measurement of certain activities and the implementation a new sectoral classification
system. Coverage has been extended to activities that did not exist in 1982 and are now
included in the calculations. The accounts now include resident banks and enterprises
operating in the Colon Free Zone (ZLC) by strictly applying the residency criterion of the
balance of payments and national accounts recommendations. Financial services are now
allocated to users, including exports. The revised data are available by productive sector for
the period 1996−2002. At present the demand side of the new GDP series is not available.
The weights underlying the consumer price index (CPI) were derived from a household
budget survey conducted in 1983/84. The authorities plan to introduce a new CPI index in
the first half of 2004 based on weights of the 1997/98 household survey. Consumer price
data are available through November 2003.
Pending issues: The time series of GDP by use for the 1996 base has not been published.
Despite recent improvements, preliminary estimates of real GDP volume remain unreliable
and untimely, in part because of delays in data collection.
Technical assistance: The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean is supporting the development of a supply-use table.
2.

Government finance

Data on central government finances, public enterprises and agencies are compiled only on a
cash basis. Monthly and quarterly data for the operations of the budgetary central
government are currently available through September 2003. Data provision to STA is less
timely: the last month available for IFS data is April 2003, and the latest annual data
submitted for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook 2003 are for 2001.
Pending issues: Monitoring of public sector financial developments would be facilitated if
data were provided on an accrual basis and were more timely, if the consistency of
information on intrapublic sector transfers were further improved, and if the coverage of the

- 43 -

APPENDIX IV

investment program were made complete. The authorities’ decision in 2003 to include the
operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority, within the non financial public sector
statistics will require a consistent and timely flow of information on a calendar basis .The
SIAFPA coverage of the central government accounts was completed in 2003, and work is
under way to incorporate decentralized agencies such as the Social Security Agency. In
addition to broadening SIAFPA’s scope of coverage, there is a need to address the issue of
unrecorded expenditures, some of them likely due to accumulation of arrears. In this regard,
the authorities requested technical assistance from the Statistics Department to implement
the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)for a comprehensive
review of the coverage and methodology currently in use in the fiscal accounts. A STA
mission is scheduled to be in Panama City in February 2004. A preliminary report, including
a tentative timetable for a migration to the GFSM 2001 would be ready by March 2004.
Technical assistance: Training related to the GFSM 2001 was provided to Panamanian
officials during the six-week course offered at Headquarters during March–April 2003.

Monetary accounts

Provision of data by the monetary authorities has been regular and reasonably current. These
data are available monthly through November 2003. Data on the operations of the
commercial banks are prepared by the Superintendency of Banks with a lag of one to two
months, although they are reported for publication in IFS with somewhat longer lags. There
is a lack of consistent data prepared on the financial positions of the National Mortgage Bank
and the Agricultural Development Bank. In the last two years a joint effort of the banking
system and the Superintendency of Banks improved the timeliness of monetary statistics
production and minimized errors through better information technology. The wider coverage
of financial soundness indicators improved the transparency of the banking system statistics.

Balance of payments

STA technical assistance missions during 1996–2001 helped improve the compilation
procedures and systems, reduce lags in data collections, and develop procedures for quality
control. The authorities provided additional budgetary and staff resources to deal with
administrative problems and the lack of adequate data processing equipment. This technical
assistance has led to significant improvements in the quality and timeliness of external sector
statistics, including through periodic reconciliation of external debt statistics discrepancies
with multilateral lenders. International Investment Position data for 1995−2002 have been
compiled. The most recent data on balance of payments statistics pertain to June 2003.
Pending issues: Despite substantial progress, data are still subject to sizeable revisions.
Revised estimates of merchandise imports and transportation services released in 2003,
resulted in a lower current account deficit over the period 1999–2001 relative to previously
reported calculations. As a result, the revised current account deficit for 2000 and 2001 were
revised down by 1.8 and 2.9 percentage points of GDP, respectively. Revised foreign direct

APPENDIX IV

investment data modified previous estimates by more than 1 percent of GDP during the
period 1999−2002. These revisions may reflect improvements in coverage, but they also
suggest that there is room for improvement in quality control procedures. The authorities are
currently working on a full reconciliation between data of the banking sector and balance of
payments capital flows consistent with the compilation method introduced by the
Superintendency of Banks in 2002. Data are not yet available on nonfinancial private sector
debt or on transactions involving financial derivatives.
Technical assistance: In September 2002 a STA mission visited Panama to support their
participation in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).

APPENDIX V

Panama: Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Total public sector debt in the baseline scenario appears sustainable, although it leaves
little room for countercyclical policies and is somewhat vulnerable to shocks (Figures 1
and 2). The baseline scenario assumes a fiscal deficit of 2 percent of GDP, consistent with
the authorities’ commitment to the deficit limit under the fiscal responsibility law. The public
debt/GDP ratio declines to 52 percent by 2008, close to the long-term target of 50 percent
stipulated in this law. However, the baseline gives little room for countercyclical fiscal
policy, and it entails large gross fiscal financing needs, particularly in the latter part of the
projection period when debt amortization is high. There is only moderate vulnerability to
temporary shocks, many of which would leave the public debt ratio on a declining path over
the medium term (Table 3). The main exception would be a shock to GDP growth,2 which
would increase the public debt ratio. External debt dynamics would be vulnerable to a
simultaneous shock from several key parameters (Table 4).
A staff-recommended alternative scenario would yield faster progress in
lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs. This scenario assumes
a 1-percent of GDP deficit by the end of the projection period, as well as structural
reforms that are assumed to boost annual GDP growth to 4–5 percent. This scenario
would bring the total public debt ratio below 50 percent, the target specified in the
fiscal responsibility law.
A scenario without fiscal measures (implying a departure from fiscal rules)
results in a more modest reduction in the public debt ratio and raises financing
needs significantly. The public debt ratio would decline to 56 percent by 2008. Most
temporary shocks would leave the public debt ratio on a declining path in 2004–08,
the main exception being a large output shock, as in the baseline scenario.

1

The DSA includes standard sensitivity tests around the baseline medium-term scenario. The
methodology used is in line with that endorsed in Assessing Sustainability, 5/28/02.
2

A 2-standard deviation shock to GDP growth results in an assumed decline in GDP
in 2004–05, owing to the observed volatility of Panama’s growth rates.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 22, 2004
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was issued on March 1, 2004. The information does not change the staff appraisal.
•

Real GDP growth was 4.1 percent in 2003, according to preliminary national
accounts data, somewhat better than the staff estimate of 3.9 percent presented in the
staff report. Also, real GDP growth in 2002 was revised upward from 0.8 percent to
2.2 percent.

•

Consumer price inflation was 1.7 percent during 2003, compared with the staff
estimate of 1.3 percent.

•

The unemployment rate for 2003 (measured each year in August) was revised to
12.8 percent, compared with a preliminary figure of 13.4 percent (and 13.5 percent in
August 2002).

•

Preliminary data on the balance of payments for 2003 confirm the rebound of exportoriented services in the latter part of the year, notably trading activity in the Colon
Free Zone and ports; the external current account deficit was 3.2 percent of GDP, in
line with the estimate in the staff report. Foreign direct investment was
US$792 million in 2003, compared with the staff estimate of US$654 million.

•

On March 11, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced that the nonfinancial
public sector deficit for 2003 was 1.9 percent of GDP, compared with the limit of
2 percent of GDP under the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The staff has not yet received
details of the fiscal accounts and is consequently not able to ascertain whether the
lower deficit than reported in SM/04/65 (1.9 percent vs. 2.4 percent of GDP) is
attributable to a stronger revenue performance or greater expenditure restraint than
anticipated by staff.

Statement by Murilo Portugal, Executive Director for Panama
and Alfredo N. Maciá, Advisor to Executive Director
March 23, 2005
1.
Our Panamanian authorities are grateful to the staff for the open policy dialogue with
the Fund and for the support to their efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability by
strengthening fiscal prudence, moving forward with crucial reforms, and enhancing the
investment environment.
2.
Economic growth rebounded at over 6 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2004, a
trend that has been largely maintained throughout the year, with real GDP growth reaching
6.2 percent by end-year, compared to 4.1 percent in 2003. This robust economic performance
has been broad based resulting from strong construction activity, agricultural exports,
tourism and entertainment, the Panama Canal operations, and the Free Zone. Inflation
remained subdued despite pressures of higher transport and oil costs, with end-of-year
inflation projected at 1.5 percent compared to 1.7 percent at end-2003. According to the 2004
Household Survey, the unemployment rate decreased to 11.8 percent at end-2004, compared
to 13.1 percent at end-2003. Prospects for 2005 are favorable, with GDP growth expected to
remain well above the last decade’s average.
3.
Panama’s external competitiveness is favorable. The real effective exchange rate has
declined with the depreciation of the US dollar; the country has increased its export volumes
and expanded its market share in a number of services. While the external current account
deficit at end-2004 reached 8 percent of GDP compared to a 4 percent deficit at end-2003, it
was almost totally covered by foreign direct investments that reached 7.3 percent of GDP.
Exports grew at a faster rate than imports, and the revenues of the Panama Canal Authority
(ACP) increased 15.8 percent in FY2004, breaking the one billion dollar level.
Fiscal Policy
4.
As it took office on September 1, 2004, the new administration encountered a
deteriorated fiscal stance, with the non-financial public sector deficit reaching 5.0 percent of
GDP at end-2004. The authorities adopted immediate action to start reversing the fiscal
situation, including the non-renewal of personnel contracts, and an immediate expenditure
restraint of US$225.8 million. They also developed a plan to gradually reduce unpaid arrears
with suppliers.
5.
The 2005 budget envisages a fiscal deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP, with stiff controls
on current public expenditures. The authorities expressed their commitment to protect outlays
for key social sectors and to improve the targeting of subsidies for electricity, water, cooking
gas, and preferential interest rates for low-income housing. On investments, the authorities
will provide for the continuation of priority infrastructure projects related to water
distribution, electricity, and irrigation. The authorities are also going to propose new norms
to be included into the Fiscal Responsibility Law to enhance fiscal transparency, provide for
clear enforcement of fiscal policy, and promote healthier public finances. The staff

-2considered the authorities’ fiscal policies and targets appropriate and in line with the Fund’s
recommendations.
6.
The public debt level increased to US$9.98 billion at end-December 2004. The
authorities have already started to take structural measures to tackle the deteriorated fiscal
stance and growing public debt. As mentioned below, a fiscal reform yielding a 1 percent of
GDP has been approved, and a social security reform package is under discussion, in addition
to the tighter government expenditure controls that have been put in place.
Financial Sector
7.
Panama’s banking system has remained strong with assets at US$33.2 billion, a 4.5
percent increase compared to 2003, ample liquidity, and high capital levels. The liquid assets
to deposit ratio was 42 percent last September. The capital adequacy ratio stood at 18.6
percent, compared to a regulatory required CAR of 8 percent. The return on capital for the
banking system was 16.2 percent and the return on assets, at 2.3 percent, was slightly higher
than in 2003. Non-performing loans declined to 1.8 percent from 2.7 percent in 2003.
Domestic credit has grown steadily, with both foreign private banks and public banks
accounting for most of the growth.
8.
The SoB has enhanced its consolidated and cross-border supervision of the banking
system and is taking steps to move forward on the main issues regarding the Basel II risk
requirements so that they are in place by 2008. Banking system surveys are now in progress
to evaluate future capital requirements, risk supervision, and the legal framework for
adopting the Basel II rules. An MFD mission is to travel to Panama shortly to complete a
Model 2 OFC review. The mission will look into the AML/FT, the insurance sector
legislation, and the domestic stock market framework vis-à-vis international standards.
Structural Reforms
9.
The Torrijos administration announced on January 12, 2005 an overall fiscal reform
package. By February 2, the legislature approved Law no. 6 (explained in Box 1), an
equitable fiscal law that calls for fiscal discipline by the government and increased revenues
to be paid by the private sector. Public payroll is to be scaled down by early 2008 to a range
of about 165-170 thousand from the existing over 180 thousand taking into account
exceptions in health, education and security services. The fiscal law also imposes ceilings on
current expenditures, professional service contracts and, amongst other measures, reduces by
60 percent the number of vacancies within the next three years. The new law increases
operating fees, eliminates the industrial incentive law of 2004, and the exports incentives
certificates (CAT’s), which will expire at end-2005. It also limits tax breaks on donations,
while taxing a share of Panamanians’ foreign income. It widens the income tax base
including in it representation expenses, and envisages an anticipated withholding tax of 10
percent. Implementation of the representation expenses measure took place last February; the
Free Zone new operating fees will take effect in June of 2005; and other tax measures in
January 2006. The revenues to GDP ratio are expected to increase to 15.4 percent from the

-3present 14.6 percent level. Strong fiscal discipline and the prospect of a social security (SS)
reform may bring the investment grade up on Panama’s sovereign rating.
10.
Consultations aimed at a social security reform started in mid-2001 under the UNDP
sponsorship and were previously discussed during the 2003 Article IV consultation. Our
authorities are cognizant of the urgency to push forward an overall reform despite the
political cost. The reforms may entail changes in contributions, retirement age, services
coverage, and in the replacement payments, amongst other issues, in order to ensure the longterm fiscal sustainability of the system. In mid-February, an information campaign about the
precarious fiscal situation of the SS system was launched to increase awareness of the
population. The reform package, which retains full ownership by the authorities, will reach
the legislature as soon as the consultation process is concluded with the civil society and
stakeholders.

Other important structural reforms aimed at improving Panama’s competitive
strategy, which already are in their initial stages, include judicial reform, deregulation,
governmental restructuring, attracting foreign investments, and promoting exports.
12.
Free trade agreements are at the top of the 2005 agenda. Panama is presently
negotiating trade agreements with Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Singapore, and the United
States. In addition, Panama wants access to other markets and has interest in joining the G-3
Group integrated by Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. Furthermore, the country has joined
Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Nicaragua on efforts to curb the
EU proposed “tariff only” for banana imports to be in effect in January 2006. EU has
proposed a US$300 dollar tariff per ton --from the present US$75 per ton-- when the 2.6
million-ton quota system expires. Panama exports 80 percent of its production to the EU and
has to compete with the duty-free banana from the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific group
(ACP).
13.
The negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States (US), which started
in April 2004 and has gone through eight rounds of talks, will broaden the attraction of US
investments into Panama and strengthen the country’s growth potential in the medium term.
The areas remaining for a ninth and conclusive round of negotiations are agricultural
products, access to the Panama Canal procurements, and textiles among others, while most
non-agricultural issues have now been settled.
Investment Activity
14.
The reverted areas of the Panama Canal keep on attracting large foreign and local
investments. The second bridge over the Panama Canal accounting for a US$200 million
public investment effort is now in the final conclusion of its access routes. In addition, ACP
implemented an investment and maintenance program of nearly US$170 million in 2004.
Private investments surged at over US$300 million primarily in the maritime sector, tourism,
commercial services and infrastructure. On port facilities, the Panama Ports Company (PPCHutchison Wampoa) concluded in 2004 a port expansion at a cost of over US$200 million

-4that will allow it to service Panamax ships. In addition, the Evergreen and Manzanillo
International Terminal (MIT) has upgraded its ports facilities.
15.
Other investments outside the Panama Canal reverted areas include a new shopping
mall and hotel in Panama City costing US$100 million that are now in service, and the
expansion of Tocumen international airport, which began at end-2004. The hydroelectric
plant Bayano increased its capacity by 20 percent after a US$40 million investment. In
addition, La Fortuna hydroelectric is starting a US$ $225 million expansion program to
increase its capacity to 150 megawatts. At end-2004, total electricity production stood at
slightly over 5,000 megawatts, with 58 percent produced by hydroelectric plants.
16.
In addition to these investments, several mega investment projects are also being
considered, which will substantially increase the growth potential of the economy. The most
important of these projects is the construction of new sets of locks in the Panama Canal, an
approximate investment of over US$4.5 billion. In 2004, the Canal serviced 14,035 shipcrossings, a 6.7 percent increase compared to 2003, with a large portion accounted for by
super ships, including Panamax ships. At the present rate of growth in cargo and shipcrossings, the capacity of the canal may be reached by 2012. A referendum is expected to
take place late this year to authorize the expansion of the canal, which has an estimated
construction time of eight years. Today, the main users of the canal are the U.S., China,
Japan, Taiwan, and Chile. The expansion of the Canal will broaden Panama’s participation in
the regional and global trade through the use of its waterway.
17.
In November 2004, President Torrijos signed with President Uribe a Memorandum of
Understanding to pursue the construction of a gas pipeline and build an electricity interconnection between Panama and Colombia. Venezuela is also pursuing an agreement with
Panama to interconnect a gas pipeline to the Colombia-Panama project given market
demands from China and the U.S. West Coast. The gas pipeline project has an estimated cost
of US$200 million and could be in operation in 24 months. The Colombian electricity 300
megawatts interconnection has two alternate routes of 571 km and 514 km costing US$169
million and US$139 million respectively.
18. Venezuela is also considering transporting oil in the trans-Panama oil pipeline
(Petroterminales) built in 1982 to transport Alaskan oil, which now operates below its
pumping capacity of 860,000 bbl per day. Both countries initiated talks on the gas and oil
pipelines in early January 2005.
19.
A third mega project under consideration is the construction of a port in the Pacific
coast with an investment of US$600 million. Evergreen, Port of Singapore Authority (PSA),
China Ocean Shipping Co. (COSCO), Maersk Sealand, and P& O are five of the maritime
enterprises interested in the concession.
20.
PPC-Hutchinson Wampoa and MIT port operator will invest US$500 million in 2005
for expanding their port facilities in the Atlantic side of the Canal. MIT has already invested
US$300 million in its port facilities and PPC-Hutchinson Wampoa has a total investment to
date of US$340 million in the Balboa Port located in the Pacific side of the Canal.

-5Conclusion
21.
The challenges of the new administration center around needed reforms to enhance
the country’s economic growth potential, improve government finances, and strengthen
transparency and accountability. There is a strong commitment by the authorities for the
zero-tolerance policy on the fight against corruption. An Anti-Corruption Council was
established, and audits of specific government institutions are underway to investigate
corruption allegations. These are clear steps taken by the Torrijos administration to support
its anti-corruption policy. In addition, the new administration has sent the UN Convention
Against Corruption to the Legislature for approval. Our authorities are aware of the need to
further enhance the private sector environment and pursue policies to strengthen foreign
investments. The President has announced the reactivation of the “Compete Panama”
program, in partnership with the IDB, to reduce the red tape to the establishment of new
businesses, thereby enhancing business creation, investments, and employment generation.
Our authorities would like to state their strong determination to improving social conditions
for the poor and the most vulnerable groups, supported by the strong political mandate of the
May 2004 elections.
