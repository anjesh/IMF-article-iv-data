STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE
POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT
Context: Rwanda’s economic performance since the turn of the century has been
remarkable. Strong policies have played a key role in maintaining GDP growth at
7.8 percent on average since 2000, with significant poverty reduction. The economy is
recovering from the disruptions induced by aid suspension through mid-2013, with
growth bouncing back in the first half of 2014 and inflation well contained. Performance
under the PSI has remained strong. All quantitative assessment criteria (QAC) at
end-June were met and all but one benchmark observed.
Article IV discussions: The discussions focused on near-term policies needed to
maintain macroeconomic stability and support growth under uncertain prospects for aid
and the global environment; and the government’s medium-term objective of sustaining
strong, inclusive growth while simultaneously managing a successful transition from a
public sector-led, aid-dependent economy to a more private sector-led economy. Policy
priorities are mobilizing more domestic revenue, leveraging exports, and removing
impediments to private sector development, including by accelerating infrastructure
projects and tackling bottlenecks in energy.
Outlook and risks: The outlook is positive, with sustained growth projected ahead in
response to continued good policy implementation and investment. External risks
include a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies and
weaker than expected export growth.
Exchange restrictions and regime: Rwanda has accepted the obligations under Article
VIII and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate regime is
categorized as crawl-like.
Key policy recommendations:


Growth: Prioritize investments to reduce the infrastructure deficit and increase energy
generation, thus facilitating private sector engagement and growth.



Fiscal Policy: Retain the objectives of the FY14/15 budget, anchored on limiting
recourse to domestic financing, while keeping the overall budget in line with
available resources and protecting priority spending.

RWANDA



Revenue mobilization: Continue to broaden the tax base and strengthen revenue
administration.



Debt sustainability: Make judicious use of available debt space and recourse to nonconcessional financing, while fully exploring concessional financing options and
private sector participation.



Monetary policy: Maintain the current monetary policy stance, but stand ready to
prevent a build-up of pressures in the foreign exchange market. Continue efforts
aimed at strengthening the monetary and supervisory frameworks and maintain
exchange rate flexibility to preserve policy buffers and competitiveness.
Staff supports the conclusion of the second review under the PSI.

CONTEXT
1.
Rwanda has experienced strong inclusive growth since 2000. Real GDP growth has
averaged 7.8 percent in a broadly stable economic environment. Poverty declined from about
60 percent in 2000 to below 45 percent in 2010/11, and the poorest have benefited the most from
growth. Inclusive growth has been led by policies geared towards agriculture through investments in
fertilizers, improved seeds, electrification, irrigation, and rural roads and better provision of social
services, especially to the rural poor. Access of the poor to financial services has also improved.
2.
Much of this success is due to prudent fiscal and monetary policies, including judicious
use of foreign aid in support of economic development. Fiscal policy has been implemented
broadly in line with available resources. The authorities have increased their efforts to reduce their
reliance on aid through mobilizing more domestic revenue. Concerted efforts have also been made
to improve public financial management and strengthen good governance. The monetary
framework has been gradually strengthened and this has helped anchor inflation at low levels.
Foreign reserves helped cushion the impact of the aid shock in 2012, and the authorities have
allowed greater exchange rate flexibility since then.
3.
Aid flows recovered since the signing of the Great Lakes peace accord in February
2013. Budget and sector support as well as project financing, grants and loans, accounted for
11.6 percent of GDP and 40 percent of government spending in FY13/14. For FY 2014/15, budget
aid (grants and loans, including projects) is projected at 10.9 percent of GDP, about 0.7 percent of
GDP lower than budgeted. Discussions with development partners and donors suggest that
Rwanda’s reliance on aid, though, is unlikely to bounce back to the high levels observed earlier this
decade (Text figure 1). Moreover, a shift in the composition of aid from budget support to projects
has reduced the cash component of foreign exchange available to the central bank.

Rwanda is engaged in preparing the path for implementation of the East Africa
Monetary Union Protocol, signed in November 2013, setting out the process and convergence
criteria for monetary union with the East African Community (EAC) countries (Figure 1). The protocol
envisages the introduction of a common currency in 2024. To that end, it defines macroeconomic
convergence criteria for the region, a path for harmonization of monetary and fiscal policies, and
mechanisms of regional surveillance. The EAC countries also concluded negotiations with the EU
regarding an Economic Partnership Agreement, which provides a framework to guide trade and
development cooperation going forward.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

MEFP 2-8

5.
Economic growth picked up in the first half of 2014, while inflation remains subdued.
Growth rebounded in the first half of 2014 to 6.8 percent year-on-year, driven primarily by industry
and services (Table 1). High frequency coincident indicators suggest that economic activity was
somewhat more subdued in the third quarter (Figure 2). Inflation declined to 0.5 percent year-onyear in October, driven by low import prices for food and fuel and increased supply of domestic
fresh food products (Figure 3). Core inflation, (excluding fresh foods and fuels) stood at 3.5 percent.
6.
The fiscal deficit in FY2013/14 was slightly less than planned under the PSI (Figure 4
and Table 2). Revenues overperformed largely because of higher receipts from peace keeping
operations and capital grants. Current expenditures were in line with the PSI while capital
expenditures were lower on account of delays in project implementation. Because of the lower
deficit, net domestic financing was less than predicted under the program.
7.
The current account deficit widened in the first half of 2014, driven by a worsening in
the trade balance (Table 3). Imports grew by 13 percent (y-o-y), while exports remained broadly flat,
reflecting weak tourism and restrictions imposed on the movement of people between DRC and
Rwanda that were in effect through August, as well as a reduction in prices of minerals and tea.
8.
The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has kept the monetary policy stance unchanged.
With the continued decline in inflation, real interest rates have increased and credit to the private
sector was kept at 13.5 percent (y-on-y) in June (Table 4, Figures 5 and 6). Broad money growth
accelerated by end-June, partly driven by higher foreign inflows and associated higher spending at
the end of the fiscal year, while reserve money evolved in line with the program. The exchange rate
has depreciated against the dollar by 3 percent through end-October. Monetary developments in
the second half of 2014 have so far been broadly in line with the program.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

MEFP 9

9.
Compliance with the end-June quantitative criteria (QACs) was strong. All end-June
QACs and all but one indicative target were met (MEFP Table 1). The floor on domestic revenue
collection was missed by a small margin (less than 2 percent of revenue).

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

10.
Of the seven structural benchmarks scheduled for end-June, six were met (MEFP Table
2). The only benchmark that was not met was the publication of the second quarter fiscal report on
the MINECOFIN website, published with a delay (in September) because of a changeover in the
BNR’s IT system, which delayed the availability of data related to government deposits and
domestic borrowing. The end-September benchmark (review of local governments’ block grant
formula) was also met.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

MEFP 10-11

11.
The short term economic outlook is broadly favorable. Growth in 2014 is expected to be
about 6 percent, only gradually rising to the longer-term growth rate of 7.5 percent in the medium
term (Table 1, Figure 7). This reflects improved implementation of government projects and a
rebound in agriculture because of favorable climatic conditions early in the year. Prospects in
construction and real estate are also favorable, on account of strong demand for housing. The
medium-term growth rate is consistent with labor and capital contributing about 5 percent to
output growth and total factor productivity (TFP) growth contributing the remainder.1 Inflation is
projected at about 3 percent by end year converging gradually to the authorities’ target of 5 percent
in the medium term.
12.
The main risks to the growth outlook arise from adverse weather conditions, lower
than expected exports, slow project implementation, and volatile donor support. With
agriculture still playing a key role in the economy, adverse weather conditions would result in
weaker-than-expected agricultural output (see RAM). A protracted period of slower growth in
advanced economies or a decline in commodity prices, particularly in minerals and traditional
exports, would adversely affect exports. Delayed project implementation would also hinder growth
prospects.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on policies to maintain the short term momentum while
preserving Rwanda’s hard won macroeconomic stability. Staff and the authorities organized the
discussions around four themes: maintaining the country’s strong performance in terms of growth
and poverty reduction and gradually transitioning to a private-sector led economy ; maintaining
macroeconomic control through continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies; maintaining
external stability and enhancing external competitiveness; and entrenching debt sustainability by
prioritizing investment projects in line with available resources, while exploring concessional
borrowing to the extent feasible. The authorities have generally followed staff’s advice in the past
(Box 1).

Box 1. Rwanda’s Response to the 2012 Article IV Consultation Key Recommendations


Domestic financing: Minimize domestic financing of the budget
Over the past two years net domestic financing has averaged close to zero, thereby allowing domestic
funding to be allocated to private sector projects. While private sector credit growth was fairly subdued at
11 percent in 2013, it is projected to pick up this year to 16 percent (y-o-y).



Complete critical investment projects
Two major projects, namely the Nyabarongo electricity generation project and the Kigali Convention
Center, are running about a year behind schedule on account of technical difficulties associated with land
use (Nyabarongo) and building structure (KCC).



Improve revenue mobilization
This is a central feature of the second PSI and up to now, the policy has been quite successful. The tax
revenue ratio is up to about 15 percent of GDP in FY13/14, compared to 13.4 percent of GDP in FY11/12.



Increase exchange rate flexibility
The authorities have allowed the exchange rate to be guided by market conditions over the past two years.

A. Sustaining Strong Growth and Poverty Reduction
14.
The government’s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for
2013-2018 (EDPRS2) priority areas include: economic transformation, rural development,
productivity and youth employment, and accountable governance. Attaining middle-income country
status would require Rwanda to sustain high growth rates over time. Staff argued that sustaining
high growth over the long run is contingent on successfully transitioning to a private sector led and
export driven economy, given the aid outlook. Rwanda’s ambitions hinge significantly on translating
improvements in the investment climate into private investment. This requires tackling the high cost
of doing business and bridging the infrastructure deficit. Overcoming the infrastructure constraints
will require significant government investment and a careful prioritization of the investment
program, exploring all available sources of concessional financing.
Inclusive Growth
15.
The government emphasized its primary objective of lowering the poverty rate
further. The authorities expect that continued emphasis on homegrown and adapted interventions,
including by strengthening the provision of social services, especially to the rural poor, will maintain
momentum in lowering poverty. Policies geared toward agriculture have accounted for the bulk of
the decline in poverty and the government intends to maintain this strategy (Box 2).
Notwithstanding some uncertainty about the extent of improvement in yields in recent years, there
has been a clear improvement in the productivity of the agricultural sector and agricultural statistics
are now better able to capture these trends (Box 3).

Box 2. The “Complete Farmer” Approach to Inclusive Growth
Rwanda has made significant inroads in poverty reduction between 2000 and 2011 (Figure 1). Other
dimensions of inclusive growth (average consumption by income levels (Figure 2), education, health, and living
standards) have also shown a marked improvement. Much of this progress has been achieved through a
targeted approach to poverty reduction, with a particular emphasis on agriculture through the “complete
farmer” approach (Figure 3).

Policies that have contributed to improved productivity and output can be grouped into four categories:
Improved access to inputs and markets: The initial policies focused on improving access to fertilizer and
seeds through a government subsidy program. This program was implemented at a relatively low cost (about
RWF10 bn at its peak) and is being phased out. Additionally, the area under irrigation has been gradually
increased and regional markets have been set up to allow farmers to deliver their products in a timely manner.
Community-based models: The decentralized models focus on educating farmers on land use and improve
capacity building at the grassroots. Going forward, land reform will encourage farmers to regroup into
cooperatives to benefit from economies of scale.

RWANDA

Box 2. The “Complete Farmer” Approach to Inclusive Growth (concluded)
Private sector engagement: The private sector has been allowed to play a greater role in the provision of
agricultural inputs and auxiliary services. These include post-harvest management and optimizing on seasonal
factors. Additionally, commercial agreements between smaller farmers and the private sector has provided
farmers with a readily available market, while allowing the private sector to have easy access to raw materials
for commercialization and processing.
Financial inclusion: All the above programs are aligned with access to finance initiatives run by banks. The
private sector has also started schemes whereby farmers are provided with financial support at the beginning
of the season in return of trading their output.

Box 3. Agricultural Statistics in Rwanda
Most of the countries in East Africa continue to rely on the routine data collection system of the Ministry of
Agriculture–where agricultural extension officers try to collect data on area cultivated and yield rates for major
crop types. The number of extension officers is inadequate to collect data from millions of agricultural
households, and they do not have the statistical training or resources to collect the data effectively, resulting in
poor estimates of crop production. A few countries use the Crop Assessment Survey (CAS) developed by the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for food security purposes to try and estimate crop production for
national accounts. However, the CAS is conducted prior to harvest and measures food crops still growing in the
field rather than actual production. As a result, the yield rates and output are generally overestimated.
In 2012, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda and the Ministry of Agriculture agreed to replace the CAS
with a continuous Seasonal Agriculture Survey (SAS) that would provide the data needed to assess food
security as well as for compilation of national accounts. The SAS is based on a land census developed using
satellite imaging to map all arable land in Rwanda at time of planting. Multiple frame sampling is used,
combining both land area frame sampling and list frame sampling. The area frame is used to sample small
scale farmers, while the list frame is used for large scale farmers. The use of arable land rather than households
for sampling results in better estimation of crops production. The survey collects production and gross capital
formation data from all operators using the sampled land and these data are complemented by information
gathered from yearly updated list frame of large scale farmers.
For each season, two interviews are conducted – at planting and harvest time. Plots are demarcated to provide
the exact area for each of the multiple crops grown on the same parcel of land. The operator has to report
inputs for each crop area and output taken from each crop area; as well as providing information on erosion,
salinity, anti-erosion measures, gross fixed capital formation, changes in inventories, and the sociodemographic characteristics of the operators. Data on horticulture and other perennial crops are collected
annually. The data on total land planted by region from the maps is then used to rate up the sample data to
get aggregated data on area planted and production at the regional and national level by crop type.
A separate module is used to collect detailed data on livestock and livestock products from the village nearest
to the land sampled. Data are produced for national accounts as well as food security assessment purposes.
As a result of implementing the continuous SAS, Rwanda now has the most accurate and reliable agricultural
statistics in the East African region.

Demographics and Employment
16.
Harnessing the potential provided by Rwanda’s demographic transition requires
significant non-agricultural job creation to absorb the rapidly growing labor force (Boxes 4
and 5). Staff noted that the transformation of the Rwandan economy had been more rapid than
many others on the continent with a larger decline in the share of agriculture in employment.
However, most of the shift in employment had gone into low value-added services. With the large
demographic surge ahead, it was necessary to develop policies to facilitate the growth of household
enterprises and small and medium sized businesses, especially given that the ability of the
agricultural sector in Rwanda to act as an employer of last resort was increasingly limited.
17.
The authorities are putting in place a five year employment plan specifically to
facilitate the creation of non-agricultural jobs. The government’s new employment strategy has a
three-pronged focus based on skills development, the fostering of entrepreneurship for SMEs, and
support for household enterprises.2 Skills development is being enhanced through a revamp of the
government’s numerous labor training schemes and the introduction of an informal apprenticeship
system providing master trainers and craftsmen the tools to transfer hands-on skills. The
government is also designing an online national knowledge management system to improve
information sharing and coordination to improve the match between employer needs and
workforce skills. SMEs are being targeted through practical entrepreneurship and mentoring and
coaching by “business development advisors” and better access to finance and business services.
The household enterprise sector is being cultivated through the set-up of sector specialists in all
districts that can pinpoint successful projects and help provide access to finance.
18.
Staff supported the authorities’ plans for employment and gender equality. On
employment, the development of the household enterprise sector is key since this is the sector
where the bulk of new jobs would be created. Recent concerns expressed by the World Bank
regarding current conditions for household enterprises in Rwanda were being addressed through
the employment plan (provision of public space for household enterprises in Kigali and an impact
assessment of the effects of local taxes). On closing the gender gap, Rwanda has instituted an
approach that involves affirmative action to correct gender-related imbalances, and gender mainstreaming, and integrate a gender perspective in policies, activities, and budgets in all sectors. As a
result, Rwanda has been able to close the gender gap in educational attainment at primary and
secondary school, and increase substantially women representation in government senior level
positions (Box 6). Also, the overall female labor force participation is high, particularly in the rural
areas where women mostly work in subsistence farming.

Household enterprises are micro enterprises with at most one to three employees.

Box 4. Harnessing the Demographic Dividend
Rwanda’s projected population of 12.4 million in 2015 is expected to double by 2050 and nearly treble by 2100
(Figure 1). Its working age population (WAP) is also projected to increase from 7 million to 16 million by 2050.
The share of its WAP will increase from about 56 percent to peak at about 66 percent in 2070.

Rwanda’s demographic transition provides a window of opportunity, which if properly tapped can generate a
“demographic dividend”. Such transitions contributed to the “Asian Miracle”, but there are also countries where
such opportunities passed by without any meaningful progress as countries failed to put in place appropriate
policies. Asia’s more favorable economic outcomes have been attributed to stronger focus on human and
physical capital, higher labor participation rates, and an initial emphasis on labor intensive export-led growth
that created jobs and supported a transition into sectors with higher TFP.
A recent study by Drummond, Thakoor and Yu (2014) finds that the median African country with an initial per
capita income level of around US$550 in 2010 can expect to benefit from a demographic dividend of about
US$1,350 by 2100. The resulting GDP per capita of US$3,865 (in constant 2005 terms) is higher by about 56
percent. Using the same approach for Rwanda suggests GDP per capita by 2070, could be higher by about 70
percent. While GDP per capita is expected to peak at around US$1,750 in the baseline, factoring in
demographics causes GDP per capita to rise to US$3,000 by 2070.
The projected increase in Rwanda’s working age population can be transformational, but can also be a source
of social risks, particularly if the economy does not create sufficient jobs to absorb those joining the labor
market. Key factors to harnessing the demographic dividend include investment in human capital and from the
development of new sectors beyond agriculture.

Box 5. Rwanda: Employment in Rwanda
Rwanda has been successful over the past decade in moving people out of agriculture as a first step in the
process of structural transformation. Among a sample of sub-Saharan African economies, its agricultural
employment share has fallen the most, but, as is common among SSA countries, most of the displaced workers
have ended up in low value-added services rather than industry. It does however boast a higher fraction of
wage workers in industry compared to most other non-resource LICs and the recent rise in the share of wage
workers is projected to continue through 2020 as shown in Figure 1 (see Fox et al. 2013 for details on the
methodology).

Figure 2 shows how Sub-Saharan African economies have been transforming over the past decade. The figure
plots changes in the sector employment share (y axis) against the level of labor productivity in each sector
relative to the average for each country (initial period, x axis). For most countries workers have moved out of
agriculture (lower left quadrant) into services (upper right quadrant) with a slight increase in the industry
employment share for a few countries. This experience contrasts with that of the low income Asian countries
(Cambodia and Vietnam) that have succeeded in raising the industry employment share significantly.

Box 6. Closing the Gender Gap in Rwanda
The Government of Rwanda has established a two-pronged approach to gender equality: (i) the gender
mainstreaming approach, which includes integrating a gender perspective into policies, activities, and budgets
in all sectors; and (ii) the affirmative action approach that seeks to correct gender imbalances. The 2003
Constitution has enshrined the principle of gender equality by establishing 30 percent quotas for women
representation in all decision making structures. The 1999 Civil Code and the 2013 law governing land ensure
women equality in terms of land ownership and inheritance. As a result, Rwanda was classified 7th (out of 136
countries) in the in the rankings of the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Gender Gap Report.
Three indicators measure how Rwanda has been able to close the gender gap:
Educational attainment: Rwanda has been able to close the gender gap in education at primary and
secondary levels. Net attendance rates in primary education are even slightly higher for girls than for boys (92
percent and 90 percent, respectively). Completion rate of primary school is also higher for girls than for boys
(82 percent compared with 75 percent, respectively). The net attendance rates at secondary level drop
significantly for both sexes, but remain very close (10 percent and 11 percent for girls and boys, respectively).
Employment and earnings: The female labor participation (FLFP) rate at 86 percent is slightly higher than for
men (84). Women continue to provide the bulk of labor in the agriculture sector, mostly working on
subsistence farming (75 percent for women compared with about 60 percent of men). Almost one third of
Rwandan households are headed by women, of which about 90 percent work in agriculture, compared with
about 60 percent of male heads. While about one third of men are engaged in non-farm wage activities, only
around 8 percent of women gain wages off farm. In fact, women are four times more likely to work as unpaid
family workers. Women are overrepresented in the informal sector and among the poor, particularly head of
households.
Political empowerment: The gender gap in political representation has narrowed, and female representation
in senior positions has increased. In 2013, Rwanda had the world’s highest female participation in the two
chambers of Parliament at 53 percent (63 percent in Parliament). About 30 percent of Ministers were females;
women made up of half of the Supreme Court justices and about 40 percent of judges. At the village levels,
women are mostly represented in local councils.
Women are almost equally affected by poverty as men. During 2006-11, poverty fell at about the same rate
for male and female-headed households. The average number of children per woman dropped from 6.1 in
2005 to 4.6 in 2010 and Rwanda’s fertility rate is now well below the Sub-Saharan average of 5.1.

B. Maintaining Prudent Fiscal and Monetary Policies
Fiscal Policy
19.
The fiscal deficit for FY14/15 continues to be in line with available resources.
The fiscal deficit for 2014/15, after adjusting for a switch in financing between grants
MEFP 12-13, 16
and loans, is 0.2 percentage point of GDP larger than budgeted, on account of
lower-than-budgeted grants. The headline deficit is 2.1 percentage points of GDP wider though,
reflecting the change in the structure of multilateral financing of about 1.9 percentage points of
GDP, associated with Rwanda attaining a low risk of debt distress (see text table). The somewhat
higher deficit and net shortfall in external finance is being met by higher net domestic financing
(0.5 percent of GDP), in line with the PSI.

The mission urged the authorities to sustain efforts to mobilize more revenue. Tax
revenue is expected to increase by 1 percent of GDP this fiscal year, bringing it to almost 16 percent
of GDP. Tax efforts over the past year have yielded revenue gains, including the expansion of
electronic tax filing and payment and the greater use of the electronic billing machines. The current
tax effort, however, is still low with respect to comparator countries in Africa, and below the
25 percent of GDP target set by the EAC. While partly explained by structural issues (a large share of

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

agriculture and subsistence farming; loss of revenue from increasing regional free trade as the EAC
moves towards a lower common tariff; large informal economy; and shifting composition of
imports), staff emphasized that raising more revenue required combining efforts to improve revenue
administration and broaden the tax base. The authorities were confident the tax measures being
implemented would ensure a tax collection achievement that was close to the initial target set in the
budget. Moreover, because of uncertainty about tax collection, the authorities have set up a
contingency category such that that if revenues turn out lower than targeted under the program,
they would reduce expenditures to conserve borrowing space.
21.
The government remains committed to achieving the medium-term target for tax
revenue. The overall increase in tax revenue mobilization of about 3½ percentage points of GDP
through FY16/17 is in line with the original target under the PSI, once the weaker than envisaged
economic growth is taken into account. 3 In addition to better revenue administration, mediumterm plans to improve revenue mobilization focus on mining and agriculture, as well as improving
the regime for fixed property, with a combined, expected annual yield of 0.4 percent of GDP when
implemented, all of which follow FAD TA recommendations. Implementation is expected according
to the following timeline:


On mining, the authorities aim to ring fence mining operations to limit cross subsidization,
introduce regulations to support implementation of transfer pricing provisions, and clarify the
process of the administration of royalties by end-January 2015.



On property taxes, the first priority is to secure the transfer of tax collection rights from the local
governments to the central government, by end-June 2015. The adjustment of property tax
legislation will subsequently be made over time with initial steps involving the migration from a
land lease fee to a fixed asset tax in Kigali. 4



On agriculture, the authorities plan to conduct a benchmarking study based on the experience
in other comparable countries before changing the tax code. Recommendations from IMF staff
include withdrawing the tax exemption for agricultural incomes with turnover below 12 million
RWF and improving the compliance of the SME presumptive tax regime for agricultural
operations.

22.
Over the medium term, staff and the authorities agreed that the fiscal trajectory will
likely be characterized by lower, stable budget deficits as the economy approaches its
potential growth rate. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to below 4 percent of GDP, in line
with projected available aid from development partners and concessional resources. The authorities
emphasized that the medium term path was also consistent with the objective of limiting crowding
out so as to facilitate private sector investment projects.
3

The cumulative output growth shortfall over the 13/14-16/17 period would lower the tax revenue ratio by about
0.75 percent of GDP based on a tax buoyancy coefficient of 0.15.

4

A land lease fee is a simplified area based land tax whereas a fixed asset tax is a property tax levied on the market
value of a fixed asset.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies

MEFP 21-25

23.
The NBR saw merit in keeping the monetary stance unchanged in view of the inflation
and growth outlook. In its view, headline inflation had declined on account of temporary factors,
driven by lower prices for food and fuel, and end-2014 inflation is expected to be about 3 percent.
Going forward, inflation is expected to converge to the authorities’ medium term target of 5 percent
as the economy nears its potential and the output gap narrows.
24.
The mission welcomed efforts aimed at strengthening the monetary framework and
encouraged further reforms to improve the transmission mechanism. The NBR has
implemented a series of measures aimed at absorbing excess liquidity and improving the interbank
market (see IMF CR 14/185). Additionally, the modeling unit of the central bank has been
strengthened to provide forward-looking model-based information to the monetary policy
committee (See Box 7). To enhance its communication with market participants, the NBR has started
publishing inflation reports to complement its semi-annual updates on monetary and financial
sector developments.
25.
Structural impediments continue to limit the effectiveness of the transmission
mechanism. The pass-through of the policy rate to market rates has been relatively slow. The
National Bank of Rwanda partly attributes the inertia to high costs of banking and limited
competition. The NBR pointed out that measures were being considered to improve the pool of
funds available to commercial banks, including by tapping into the more liquid markets in the
region, to reduce the cost of wholesale funding.
26.
Continued exchange rate flexibility is critical to preserve policy buffers. The NBR noted
that foreign exchange interventions were primarily aimed at limiting volatility, but there was also a
need to provide foreign exchange to support imports in a context where foreign exchange flows
remained tight. Staff concurred, but emphasized that the NBR has limited room for maneuver now
that reserve cover is at about 4 months of prospective imports, and it was critical to preserve reserve
buffers. Exchange rate flexibility would also help preserve Rwanda’s competitiveness.
27.
The financial sector remains sound, but emerging vulnerabilities require close
monitoring. The main financial soundness indicators have continued to improve following the
deterioration at the peak of the aid-shock in 2013 (Table 5). Non-performing loans are now on a
declining trend but a sector disaggregation reveals that high NPLs persist in the real estate and
hotel sectors, reflecting an over-supply in some segments of both markets. Staff emphasized the
need for close monitoring of the quality of credit and avoiding too rapid an expansion of credit at
the level of households. The NBR responded that the level of NPLs was being monitored closely and
was on the decline, reflecting the effectiveness of the macroprudential policies rolled out in 2013.
They also noted that the ongoing bolstering of the regulatory and supervisory frameworks will allow
the NBR to continue to support financial stability. Plans to consolidate the Umurenge SACCOs into a
large cooperative bank by mid-2015 remain on track. The authorities have joined the Eastern and
Southern Africa AML group and plan to bolster their AML/CFT framework based on the group’s
assessment report.

Box 7. Explaining Money Target Misses in Rwanda
The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has been working on strengthening its monetary policy framework and
improving its understanding of the transmission mechanism. The use of a semi-structural macroeconomic model that
links the monetary policy stance to economic activity and inflation is part of this process. Such a model can be
integrated into a wider set of processes and tools to prepare coherent macroeconomic forecasts, perform scenario
analysis, and inform the monetary policy formulation process.
The current exercise extends the framework in Charry, Gupta and Thakoor (2014) to incorporate an explicit role for
money targets and target misses in analyzing monetary policy in Rwanda. This allows for a better understanding of
the performance of the NBR, which targets money as its operational instrument. Figure 1 shows the target misses for
base money in terms of YoY growth rates. Actual base money was below the target in all periods, with an exception
for 2008Q1. This is consistent with the perception of the target as an upper limit for base money.
One of the reasons for the deviations is that once the central bank sets the target, the economy is subject to a range
of shocks (figure 2). These can be grouped into two categories. First, those arising from the actions of the NBR, such
as deviations of money growth from targets consistent with implicit inflation targets. Second, unexpected shocks to
money demand (resulting from changes in velocity, multiplier, real demand, or interest rates). Monetary policy and
money demand shocks (particularly due to changes in velocity and multiplier) explain the bulk of the misses.
Policy formulation in Rwanda has been adapted to the changing nature of money demand resulting in target misses.
For program purposes, the reserve money target is set within a band to give the authorities greater space in the
conduct of monetary policy.

Efforts to develop the capital markets are ongoing. Measures include: the issuance of
instruments with longer maturities, the quarterly issuance of government bonds, and ongoing
collaboration with the IFC as regard issuing both regional bonds and developing technical expertise
and infrastructure in Rwanda. Additionally, an automated clearing and settlement platform is now in
place and the authorities are currently working on implementing an automated trading platform.
Initiatives are also ongoing to connect the various markets in region. The authorities believe that the
new instruments and infrastructure will provide a platform to deepen the capital markets in Rwanda.

impediments to financial intermediation and increase saving and investment opportunities, thereby
furthering financial inclusion.

C. Export competitiveness and External Stability

MEFP 14-15

29.
Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to develop the export sector, both by
diversifying into new markets and improving the export base, with a view to lower the trade
gap. This included taking advantage of opportunities provided by regional integration, particularly
through the EAC. Exports are currently dominated by tea, coffee, minerals, and tourism. Since 2012,
exports to the DRC and EAC account for about 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of Rwanda’s
total exports.
30.
The government argued that its export strategy focused on adding value to traditional
exports (e.g., washing coffee) and moving into new areas (e.g., horticulture and pyrethrum)
and was being achieved through targeted interventions in industrial development. The
construction of the Kigali convention center and plans to build a new airport reflect the authorities’
desire to expand business tourism and some success has already been achieved in industrial
development. For example, some light manufacturing has started to take off (shoes, textiles), but the
authorities acknowledged that the scale of this activity was still small. Moreover, with Rwanda being
land-locked, they agreed that lowering the costs of doing business in terms of reliable provision of
power and better transportation would be required before these types of activities can expand on a
large scale. Rwanda has the third best doing business indicator in Sub-Saharan Africa with cross
border trade a notable weakness. 5
31.
The authorities have allowed for greater exchange rate flexibility and aim to maintain
import cover of about 4 months. In recent years, staff has supported the authorities move to allow
greater exchange rate flexibility, allowing the exchange rate to be market determined. The Rwandan
Franc depreciated against the US dollar by over 13 percent since 2012 (through October).
32.
The real effective exchange rate has remained fairly stable in recent years and appears
to be in line with fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by about
2 percent in 2013 mainly due to the fall in the nominal value of the Rwandan franc against the
currencies of its main trading partners. Based on the extended external balance assessment (EBAlite) current account gap estimate, staff assesses the 2013 REER to be broadly consistent with its
long run fundamentals (a point estimate of about 3.1 percent overvaluation, Box 8). An alternative
equilibrium real exchange rate estimate would seem to confirm this assessment.

5

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to limited respondents, geographic coverage and
standardized assumptions.

Box 8. Rwanda: External Stability Assessment
Overall assessment. The immediate risks to the external position appear to be manageable but medium-term
vulnerabilities will need to be addressed. Rwanda remains susceptible to external shocks given its narrow export base and
reliance on aid flows. The effective implementation of structural reforms to improve export capacity and diversification
under EDPRS II is critical to mitigate risks arising from the narrow export base and volatility of commodity prices. Further
lowering of the costs of doing business and removal of other structural impediments to speeding up private sector’s share
of the economy are essential to improving Rwanda’s external competitiveness and attracting large FDI flows. Limited
international capital market access could be used to complement traditional sources of external financing but needs to be
done prudently to avoid external debt sustainability problems.
The underlying current account deficit in 2013 is very close to its estimated norm. The extended External Balance
Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology estimates a CA norm of -5.7 percent of GDP and a gap of -1.4 percent in 2013
(figure 1).1 However, the current account deficit is expected to deteriorate in 2014 to 11.8 percent of GDP, mainly due to
weaker export performance and healthy growth in imports, but will gradually improve thereafter over the medium term
to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2018 as exports rebound. Given the low export base, the Rwandan economy remains
vulnerable to external shocks, for example, to a fall in commodity prices or a slowdown in trade partners’ demand.
However, these risks are expected to be mitigated over the medium term by the anticipated improvement in export
performance via the implementation of the export expansion and diversification strategy under the EDPRS II.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with its long-run equilibrium. The real effective exchange
rate depreciated by about 1.7 percent in 2013 mainly due to the fall in the nominal value of the Rwandan franc against
the currencies of its main trading partners. The authorities have allowed greater flexibility in the Rwandan franc in
foreign currency market. Based on EBA-lite current account gap estimate and a long-run elasticity of -0.46 the REER is
estimated to be 3.1 percent overvalued in 2013, and hence broadly consistent with its long-run fundamentals.
Maintaining a more flexible exchange rate regime in the medium term would continue to support efforts to enhance
export competitiveness.

Capital and financial accounts flows. In 2013, traditional aid flows were complemented by commercial borrowing via
the Eurobond issuance to finance the current account deficit. FDI flows were 2 percent of GDP. In the near-term aid
flows will continue to play an important role in external financing in Rwanda. Implementation of structural reforms in
the private sector is anticipated to increase FDI flows over the medium term.

Box 8. Rwanda: External Stability Assessment (concluded)
The low risk of external debt distress rating has expanded the envelope of available concessional borrowing, while reducing the
share of grants in aid flows. With the government’s access to international capital markets, commercial borrowing could also
complement traditional aid flows in financing of the current account deficit. The limited space for commercial borrowing means
however that this form of debt financing should be undertaken judiciously to preserve debt sustainability.
International reserves level is broadly adequate. Reserves covered 5 months of imports in 2013, in line with the average for
2009-2013. Over the medium-term, reserves are expected to remain over 4 months of imports. A cost-benefit approach to the
2
optimal level of reserves in LICs suggests that projected reserves would be broadly consistent with the optimal level estimated at
3
4-5 months of imports, assuming an opportunity cost of holding reserves in the range of 3-4 percent (figure 2).

Broader competitiveness indicators. The 2015 Doing Business Indicators ranks Rwanda 46 out of 189 countries, the third best
overall ranking for any Sub-Saharan country, behind Mauritius and South Africa respectively. But while it compares favorably on
most indicators relative to the EAC and SSA, its indicators of cross border trade are inferior to its regional peers (Figure 3). This
suggests that important structural competitiveness challenges remain.

Rwanda’s level of foreign exchange reserves remains adequate but the room for
maneuver is limited. Import cover is near the 4 months target, which is consistent with estimates
of Rwanda’s optimal reserve level and also the target set by the EAC convergence criterion. 6 Staff
cautioned that in the past, the profile of reserve coverage was strongly correlated with aid inflows.
The challenge, therefore, will be to maintain the current level of reserve coverage while reducing
reliance on foreign aid. Maintaining reserves cover at 4 months of imports over the medium term
would be consistent with a current account deficit (including grants) leveling out at about 8 percent
of GDP.

D. Infrastructure Spending and Debt Sustainability

MEFP 18-20

34.
Rwanda has significant investment plans to help overcome the infrastructure
constraint, but the financing of most of these projects is yet to be finalized. There is currently a
pipeline of projects in the areas of energy, transportation (air and road) and water with projected
financing from development partners (including IDA and AfDB) of about US$1.5 billion for these
projects over the medium term (2014-19). Two additional priorities for the government include the
new airport at Bugesera and Rwanda’s share of the regional railway (with costs of US$750 million
and US$1.5 billion, respectively), but financing for these two projects has not yet been identified.
35.
The authorities concurred that strengthening implementation capacity was key to
timely completion of projects. Two flagship projects (the Nyabarongo power plant and the KCC)
were running about 1 year behind schedule on account of technical issues. The authorities
acknowledged that more time was needed at the initiation stage to work through potential pitfalls
and limit the size of corrective measures during implementation. A Minister of State in charge of
planning has thus been appointed to oversee the strengthening of linkages between planning and
budgeting, help establish a public investment committee and a national investment plan team to
ensure better planning of public projects. A readiness filter is to be introduced that will require each
project above US$1 million to undergo a feasibility study and cost benefit analysis before it is
implemented. Moreover, quarterly reports will be sent to Cabinet on the status of projects and
responsibility for the proper implementation of the projects will be set at the Ministerial level.
36.
Staff supported the authorities’ plan and suggested establishing an explicit Public
Investment Program (PIP) listing all major projects and their expected phasing and financing.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fully explore concessional financing options and
private sector participation before considering non-concessional resources, but recognized that
recourse to some non-concessional financing was inevitable and appropriate, given the country’s
infrastructure needs and available fiscal space.
37.
On account of uncertainties in the timing of project implementation and the
availability of alternative sources of financing, the authorities did not have an explicit
timeline for contracting non-concessional borrowing. The new debt unit at the Ministry of

Finance was charged with analyzing various debt sustainability scenarios based on the IMF and
World Bank LIC DSA methodology. The authorities underscored the importance of infrastructure
spending to relieve bottlenecks but they wanted to keep the low risk rating that allowed them to
access additional concessional financing.
38.
The staff and authorities reviewed alternative scenarios under the DSA to ensure
consistency with Rwanda’s current low risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario all debt
burden indicators are projected to remain below the policy-dependent thresholds. Standard stress
tests show a marginal temporary breach of the PV of the debt service-to-revenues ratio in 2023
when the Eurobond issued in 2013 matures. As this breach is temporary, and it is assumed that
Rwanda will be able to rollover the maturing Eurobond, the assessment of a low risk of debt distress
remains. Alternative financing scenarios under the DSA also suggests that Rwanda has limited
flexibility to use non-concessional financing options. The analysis shows that non-concessional
borrowing of US$ 500 million during 2015 would not adversely affect Rwanda’s debt risk rating.
However, recourse to larger non-concessional borrowing would increase public debt vulnerability
and may raise Rwanda’s risk of debt distress.
39.
Staff advised the authorities to smooth out the profile of any new non-concessional
borrowing and urged that project selection should be made carefully. The issuance of a single
large bond for a small country like Rwanda could lead to a cost premium and would pose rollover
risks at maturity, especially in less favorable circumstances. Staff supported the government’s
strategy of availing itself of the larger concessional financing resources offered by donors because
of the low debt distress rating. Staff also recommended splitting non-concessional borrowing over
a multi-year horizon to contain rollover risks and fully lining-up financing prior to project
commitment. On project selection, while recognizing that the new airport was a national priority,
staff urged the authorities to share the financing of this project with private sector partners so that
future risks would be diversified.

PROGRAM ISSUES

MEFP 26

40.
The authorities propose, and the staff supports, modifications of end-December 2014
QACs, reflecting the shortfall in aid for FY2014/15 and the revised monetary program. The broad
macro targets remain intact (growth, inflation, fiscal, and reserves coverage). Specifically, the floor
on net foreign assets (NFA) of the central bank is being revised downward by $11 million to take
into account the combination of three adjustments: the initial end year target of $895.5 million is
supplemented by the unused Eurobond proceeds associated with the delays in the completion of
the KCC ($76.7 million) and reduced by the difference between the latest estimate of budget
support (loans and grants) and the estimate that was made at the time of the last review up to a
maximum of $80 million. This also includes a small reduction in the cash component of project
grants because this affected the availability of foreign exchange. In line with revised economic
assumptions, slight adjustments have been made for domestic revenue, priority expenditure, and
consolidated domestic debt. Reserve money has been adjusted marginally lower while the ceiling on
NDF has been adjusted upward slightly to reflect increased domestic financing needs for the first
half of the fiscal year. The ceiling on non-concessional borrowing remains unchanged at US$250
million through end June 2015.
41.
Structural conditionality going forward supports the authorities’ desire to raise tax
revenues and extend financial disclosure to sub-national units. To support the ambitious
revenue objectives, three structural benchmarks associated with new taxation legislation for
agriculture, mining and property were initially set for end-December. However, the authorities have
requested more time to prepare the tax legislation for the various components. A benchmarking
study on agricultural taxation is to be carried out as a basis for revised legislation, the latter by endDecember 2015. On mining, the revision to the income tax code that incorporates the ring fencing
of mining operations, introduces regulations to support implementation of transfer pricing
provisions, and clarifies the process of the administration of royalties is projected for end-January
2015. Finally, on property taxes, the law regulating the switch in the collection of local government
taxes to the Rwanda Revenue Authority is projected for end-June 2015 while a new benchmark
specific to property taxes has been added for end-December 2015. The other remaining benchmark
on requiring frequent financial reporting at the sub-national level is set for end-December 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Rwanda has been a strong performer in terms of growth and poverty reduction among
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades. The government’s current economic
strategy has the clear priority of removing impediments to private sector development and making
the economy more attractive for potential investors.
43.
Economic growth has rebounded this year and, provided that the government
succeeds to implement its investment plans, a medium-term growth rate of 7.5 percent is
feasible. On agriculture, the economy remains quite far from the production possibility frontier and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the process of structural transformation into services and industry is in its early stages. Inflation has
remained at low levels and the real exchange rate has been stable. Greater exchange rate flexibility
has contributed to stabilizing the import cover around 4 months.
44.
The authorities are commended for maintaining their plans for domestic revenue
mobilization in the face of a weaker medium-term outlook than assumed under the original
PSI program. By end FY16/17 the tax revenue ratio will be in line with the PSI program, taking into
account the expected economic growth path. Moreover, the authorities have made progress and are
putting in place mechanisms that will make greater revenue mobilization a permanent fixture.
45.
Staff recognizes that limited implementation capacity has hindered the timely
completion of certain large projects. They welcome mechanisms being put in place to address
these problems in terms of greater oversight, coordination and phasing of projects. They also
underscored the importance of setting up an explicit public investment program that demonstrates
the authorities’ priorities, phasing and expected financing in terms of large projects. At the current
juncture the authorities are to be commended for stepping up planning and implementation efforts
before embarking on new investment outlays, as well as seeking to exhaust all possibilities for
concessional financing and private sector participation in projects before considering finance on
non-concessional terms.
46.
Staff commends the set up of a new debt unit in the Ministry of Finance. The unit
provides the authorities an important instrument to help inform their debt decisions going forward,
including by monitoring the available debt space and its sensitivity to assumptions about export
growth.
47.
Staff supports the continued tight monetary stance in light of the inflation and growth
outlook. It is consistent with the expected pick-up in inflation toward the year-end and should help
prevent undue pressures in the market for foreign exchange. The initiatives implemented by the
central bank over the past year will contribute to improving the transmission mechanism and
strengthening the monetary framework. Ongoing efforts to bolster the legal and supervisory
frameworks, including the AML/CFT framework, would contribute to enhancing the overall resilience
of the financial sector.
48.
On external stability, the immediate risks to the external position appear to be
manageable but medium-term vulnerabilities need to be addressed. Rwanda remains
susceptible to external shocks given its narrow export base and reliance on aid flows. The effective
implementation of structural reforms to improve export capacity and diversification under EDPRS II
is critical to help mitigate risks arising from the narrow export base and volatility of commodity
prices. In addition, further lowering of the costs of doing business and removal of other structural
impediments to speeding up private sector’s share of the economy are also essential. Improvement
in the current account balance in the medium-term is contingent on the successful implementation
of these measures to address structural impediments to export expansion and Rwanda’s external
competitiveness. International capital market access could be used to complement traditional
sources of external financing but needs to be done prudently to avoid debt sustainability problems.

49.
Staff supports the completion of the second review under the PSI. Program
performance has remained strong. All QACs were met and all benchmarks were met on time except
for the publication of the quarterly report on government finances, met with a delay. Staff supports
the request for modification of the end-December QACs and setting of end-June 2015 QACs.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation takes place within 24 months, subject to
the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

Appendix. Letter of Intent
Kigali, Rwanda
November 11, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) is an update of the April 2014
MEFP and sets out the macroeconomic policies of the Rwandan government for the remainder of
fiscal year 2014/15 and the medium term.
Rwanda’s performance under the PSI has remained strong. As described in the MEFP, all end-June
2014 quantitative assessment criteria (QAC) were met. All indicative targets, but one, have been met.
The slight breach of the floor on domestic revenue collection was due to the offsetting effect of
investment allowances for certain companies and delays in the accrual of revenue from
implementation of some measures. Reflecting our strong commitment to the PSI objectives six out
of seven structural benchmarks due as of end-June were met. The quarterly budget execution report
(continuous benchmark) was published with a delay due to a glitch arising from a technological
upgrade at the BNR. In light of this satisfactory performance and its continued commitment to
sound policies, the government requests the completion of the second review under the PSI. Based
on the revised macroeconomic framework, the government also requests modification of the
assessment criteria for end-December 2014.
The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the MEFP will deliver the
objectives of the PSI-supported program but we will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the IMF—at its own initiative or
whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a consultation—before the adoption of
any such measures or changes to the policies described in the attached MEFP.
The government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request in connection
with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the
objectives of the program. It is expected that the third review will take place before end-June 2015.
The Government of Rwanda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter, its
attachments, and all reports prepared by the IMF staff.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Claver Gatete
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies—
Update
November 11, 2014

1.
This MEFP update reviews performance under the PSI-supported program through end-June
2014 and discusses the macroeconomic outlook and policies for the remainder of FY2014/15. It also
describes quantitative and structural targets for end-December 2014 and end-June 2015. As in the
April 2014 MEFP, policy formulation in all areas will take into account Rwanda’s commitments to the
East African Community.

RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY PERFORMANCE
2.
Introduction. After the slowdown associated with the suspension of aid by some donors
and delays in the approval of disbursements by others and a weaker than anticipated agricultural
output in 2013, economic growth returned to a healthy 6.8 percent in the first half of 2014. Inflation
continues to remain well contained.
3.
Growth. The pickup in growth in the first half of 2014 confirmed the initial observations that
the slowdown in 2013 was temporary in nature. The recovery was broad based, with most of the
sectors affected by the slowdown in 2013 registering robust performances in the first half of 2014,
particularly services (+8.4 %) and construction (+5.8 %). This reflected normalization of economic
activities and acceleration in the implementation of previously delayed government projects.
4.
Inflation. Inflation, both headline and core, was firmly contained with the former standing at
0.5 percent year-on-year in October and the latter at 3.5 percent. This reflected a combination of
lower imported inflation from the region, stable fuel prices, benign commodity prices and a decline
in domestic food prices.
5.
External balance. The external balance deteriorated somewhat in the first half of 2014,
reflecting the pick-up in economic activity, which resulted in acceleration in the imports of capital
goods as the implementation of investment projects resumed. Formal exported goods increased
only marginally by 1.3 percent in value but declined by 1.7 percent in volume, as a result of weaker
prices and lower volumes for traditional exports. Reserve cover is expected to decline from 5 months
of imports at end-2013 to stand at 4.1 months of imports at end-2014, reflecting both the weaker
current account outturn and only partial use of the Eurobond proceeds for the Kigali Convention
Center.
6.
Fiscal developments. The implementation of the revised FY2013/14 budget was broadly on
target except for a slight reduction in capital expenditures associated with lower than expected
foreign financing. On the revenue side, tax revenues were comparable to the PSI target and non-tax

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

RWANDA

revenue surged on account of an increase in receipts from peace keeping operations. Global Fund
disbursements were also much larger than expected but budgetary grants were lower. In sum, total
revenues and grants were slightly higher than projected by about 0.5 percent of GDP (to stand at
26.2 percent of GDP). Recurrent expenditures were on target while capital expenditures faltered
somewhat on account of lower foreign financing. Slight delays in the construction of the Kigali
Convention Centre (KCC) and other infrastructure projects led to lower than expected outlays under
net lending and foreign financed capital expenditure. The combined effects resulted in the fiscal
accounts recording a slightly lower deficit than initially projected for FY 2013/14 of 4 percent of GDP
compared to 4.4 percent of GDP initially projected for FY 2013/14.
7.
Progress in the implementation of Public Finance Management (PFM) reforms
throughout FY2013/14 was impressive. Key achievements registered during the year include:
i.

Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) started the implementation of electronic billing machines
(EBM) and currently 6183 EBMs belonging to 4860 tax payers have been installed and are in use.
7 service providers to distribute EBMs have been certified to supply machines and software while
6 are undergoing the certification process;

ii.

The number of unqualified audit reports increased from 9 percent to 32 percent;

iii.

The audit coverage is now covering 79 percent of all government expenditure compared to
75 percent from the previous year;

iv.

The draft policy document entitled “Accounting Policy for Fixed Assets” was submitted to
Cabinet for approval. After its adoption, it is envisaged that fixed assets registers will be
established in MDAs and Sub-National governments;

v.

A feasibility study on E-procurement system was carried out and the final report is available. An
e-procurement system roadmap is currently under elaboration;

vi.

The government Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) now covers more
than 140 budget agencies with a total of 275 sites/cost centers. To ensure its continuous
operationalization and usage over 1,700 users have been trained. The system is now stable and
supports various financial management functions as recognized by all users, auditors and the
systems internal and external reviewers;

vii.

The implementation of the easy to use accounting system and financial reporting system
commenced with the training and go live; all sectors from 2 districts (Gasabo and Nyarugenge)
have been connected to the Subsidiary Entities Accounting and Reporting System (SEAS). Plans
are underway to roll out the system to 5 more districts.
8.
Monetary and exchange rate developments. The NBR has continued to focus on limiting
the risks from monetary inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations, while containing pressures
on the exchange rate. The key policy rate was reduced by 50 basis points to 6.5 percent in June
2014. Within the flexibility of the monetary policy framework, the interbank market has improved
46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

and transactions increased to RWF 116.1 billion in the Jan-June 2014 period compared to RWF 71.85
billion the same period in 2013. Credit to the private sector has picked up in the first half of 2014,
reflecting the broader increase in economic activities. Compared to December 2013, credit to the
private sector increased by 7.3 percent, against an initial projection of 6.1 percent at end-June 2014.
The exchange rate remained fundamentally market driven and the Rwandan Franc has depreciated
by 3 percent as of end-October, compared to 6.1 percent for the calendar year 2013. NBR sales of
forex in the January-June 2014 period amounted to USD 128 million compared to USD 152 million
projected. Regarding the monetary aggregates, broad money increased by 19 percent as of endJune 2014, compared to an initial projection of 5.5 percent. Net foreign assets at end-June 2014
stood at USD 821.43 million, exceeding the USD 775.52 million projected, reflecting disbursements
from the AfDB, EU, and Global Fund.
9.
Program performance. Program performance under the new PSI has been strong. All endJune 2014 quantitative assessment criteria (QAC) were met. All but one indicative targets were met.
The slight breach of the floor on domestic revenue collection was due to the offsetting effect of
investment allowances for certain companies and delays in the accrual of revenue from some
measures as well as shortfall in non-tax revenue mainly administrative fees and charges. These are
temporary factors and the revenue shortfall is projected to be made up this year. Reflecting our
strong commitment to the PSI objectives, six out of seven structural benchmarks due as of end-June
were met. The quarterly budget execution report (continuous benchmark) was published with a
delay due to a glitch arising from a technological upgrade at the BNR.
MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND POLICY FOR FY2014/15 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
10.
Economic growth is likely to meet the projection for 2014 and inflation will remain
contained. Following the uptick in economic activities in the first half of 2014, the outlook for the
remainder of the year is broadly stable, with the main risks arising from a weaker than expected
second agricultural season and potential delays in donor disbursements. The government expects
growth to meet the 6 percent target for 2014. All the main sectors are expected to contribute to
this broad based growth: agriculture (+4 percent) led by an increase in the production of food
crops arising from the increase in the area under cultivation as well as the application of fertilizer
and improved seeds; industry(+7 percent), particularly the electricity and gas sub-sector
(+10 percent) due to the addition of new power plants to the grid; construction (+6 percent); and
services (+7 percent) due to the upturn in government consumption and private sector credit
growth as well as higher growth of agriculture impacting on trade in services. Inflation will remain
contained and is projected at 3.2 percent at end-December, slightly lower than the NBR’s target.
This reflects both a combination of subdued inflationary pressures and the monetary policy stance.
11.
Growth is projected at 6.0 per cent in 2015. The government expects the accumulated
effects of public investment in the recent past to begin to reap economic benefits, particularly its
infrastructure investment. A conservative estimate of the increase in the electricity grid between
today (124 MW) and mid-2015 is 35.0 per cent, as new hydro, methane, solar and peat plants come
online. The government expects these structural changes to the supply-side of the economy to
partially offset the potential vulnerabilities that can arise from unpredictable agricultural harvests
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

RWANDA

and the current account deficit. Other public investment in the transport network and private
investment in the communications network also support this view that Rwanda’s total recent
investment will increase the productive capacity of the economy–particularly the private sector–
through its higher infrastructure capital stock.
12.
The fiscal framework for 2014/2015 has been revised to take into account some policy
changes as well as structural changes in donor budget support disbursement profiles. On the
resource side, total donor budget support has declined slightly, partly due to an over estimate of
commitments earlier this year and a shift in donor flows from budgetary grants to budgetary loans.
Reflecting the structural change in donor funding, budgetary loans are now included in the revised
fiscal framework. Tax revenue collections are expected to rise by 1 per cent to almost 16 per cent of
GDP. In addition, the growth projection for 2015 of 6 per cent is lower than the 6.7 per cent
originally estimated and the effect of this change has been reflected in the framework. As a result of
these changes, total revenues and grants are now projected to be lower than initially projected at
RWF 1,394.7 but comparable in terms of GDP. Implementation of several on-going measures
including improved tax compliance from the introduction of the electronic billing machines as well
as the collection of local government taxes by Rwanda Revenue Authority are expected to allow the
tax revenue target to be achieved. Total grants of RWF 397.3 billion (7 per cent of GDP) are now
RWF 147.5 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) lower than the original estimate of RWF 544.8 billion. The
decline is due to a compositional change as IDA and AFDB now provide budgetary loans instead of
grants. Reflecting the slight decline in total resources, total expenditure and net lending are
projected to decline from RWF 1,698.1 billion to RWF 1,680.4 billion. The overall cash deficit reflects
the compositional change in donor budget support funds as some grants are converted into
budgetary loans. As a result, and despite the reduction in expenditures, the overall deficit increased
to RWF 295.6 billion (5.2 per cent of GDP) from RWF 177.7 billion (3.1 per cent of GDP). This higher
deficit is financed with increased foreign net loans financing of RWF 197.5 billion and domestic net
financing of RWF 98.2 billion. In the original budget both foreign net financing at RWF 107.6 billion
and net domestic finance of RWF 70.1 billion were lower.
13.
Given the uncertainties concerning donor budget support disbursements and the risk
associated with the growth prospects, the tax revenue total of RWF 894.6 billion includes
RWF 28 billion (0.5 per cent) as contingent revenue. To ensure that the domestic financing target
is protected, an equal amount of expenditures has also been identified as contingent expenditure
that can only be spent when the contingent revenue accrue. The contingent expenditures are
distributed under goods and services, transfers, and domestic capital expenditure.
14.
Regarding the external sector, the current account deficit is projected to deteriorate in
2014. This is due to the slow growth in exports of only 1.1 percent and the increase in imports by
13 percent reflecting the expected pickup in economic activity in general and improvement in
implementation of delayed infrastructure projects. Capital and intermediate goods imports will
largely contribute to the rebound in imports. The increase in imports will be financed primarily by
the improvement in the capital account due partly to a compositional change in some donor funds
accrual with more loans instead of grants and the unused Eurobond proceeds allocated to the Kigali

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

Convention Center and the Nyaborongo hydro project. Foreign reserves coverage will be around
4 months of imports.
15.
Over the medium term, the current account deficit is projected to reduce to about
8 percent of GDP by 2018. Exported goods and services will experience steady growth, albeit lower
than was projected previously, while the growth in imports will slow as certain large investment
projects have reached or are near completion. Current transfers as a percentage of GDP will decline
in the medium term as the projected decline in official transfers will, only be partially offset by the
modest increase in private transfers. FDI will also steadily increase as a percentage of GDP.
16.
Structural measures aimed at supporting the domestic revenue mobilization strategy
will be accelerated. Total grants are expected to be around 7 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 but
decline to an average of 4.2 percent of GDP in FY2015/2016 and FY2016/2017. Given the continued
uncertainty regarding long-term donor engagement and the government’s commitment to reducing
its reliance on donor financing, accelerating domestic revenue mobilization remains a key priority.
The overall aim of the ongoing reforms is to reach approximately 17 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16.
Based on an IMF technical assistance study, the Medium Term Tax Reforms Plan 2013-2016 has been
revised to incorporate the recommendations and broadly the following are being done:


Agriculture taxation: the key to successful implementation of the IMF recommendations on
agriculture taxation lies in their feasibility. Therefore, MINECOFIN is hiring experts to conduct a
benchmarking study and develop an agricultural income taxation model for Rwanda. Hence, the
delay in implementation. The experts will also develop a data base on Land-use mapping as well
as crop productivity profitability per hectare (using information from MINAGRI and Land Centre).
We will share the benchmark study with the IMF by end-June 2015 and will revise agriculture
legislation by end-December 2015.



Mining tax regime: most of the recommendations are being considered under the income tax
law revision, and the draft mining law that will be submitted for Cabinet approval by January
2015 as against December 2014 in the first review.



Improving tax collection from immovable property: the revision of the ‘law establishing the
sources of revenue and property of decentralized entities and governing their management’ is
underway to cater for the transfer of collection of decentralized taxes and fees by RRA and
adjust property tax legislation with initial steps involving the migration from a land lease fee to a
fixed asset tax in Kigali. The law will be submitted to Cabinet by end-June 2015. By end-2015,
one district in Kigali will have fully migrated to the fixed asset tax as a step toward full
implementation. All local governments will be required to provide financial reporting by endDecember 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

RWANDA

The following measures are to be implemented on the tax administration side over the FY 2014/15
and in the medium term:


Acquire and use new software for local government revenue management;



Develop a revenue forecasting model for RRA;



Build a taxpayer database for local government taxes;



Expand usage of electronic domestic tax filing and payment;



E-tax enhancement: further development of the system by incorporating other modules i.e.
audit, enforcement, objection and appeals management, Tax account and refund
management plus motor vehicles management;



Implement Single Customs Territory under roll out phase;



Expand usage of electronic billing machines (EBM) by increasing the number of users and
ensuring strict compliance with their requirements;



Integrate e-payment with mobile money system and visa card service operator;



Introduce the electronic certificate of origin;



Rollout the Electronic Single Window System to all remaining Agencies/Ministries involved in
international trade;



Implement mobile declaration for small cross border traders;



Implement One Stop Border Posts at Rusumo and Kagitumba;



Extend working hours at Rusumo and Kagitumba borders.



Integrate temporary entry/exit motor vehicles management with e-payment;



Develop on line application for the renewal of temporary importation;



Implement the Authorized Economic Operator program;



Upon availability of related legal instruments, design and use a single unified declaration
form for PAYE tax, pension and medical contributions;



Upgrade RRA call centre software to become more customized and user-friendly;



Establish and use the RRA Data Warehouse System;



Rollout and monitor the Electronic Cargo Tracking System.

17.
A number of measures are being introduced to further strengthen public financial
management. These include:


50

Development projects budgeting and reporting: In order to closely monitor and integrate
development projects in the government reporting and budgeting cycle, a Project and
Evaluation Framework will be developed, which should help further promote the use of country
systems in development projects;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA



PFM legislations: key PFM legislations such as the State Law on Finance and Property and the
Public Procurement Law were promulgated in early 2014, but their implementation texts that
include regulations and manuals among others are yet to be approved by cabinet or other
relevant organs. So all these are set to be approved and published in 2014 to assist in the
smooth implementation of the organic laws;



Financial reporting of sub-national entities: The rollout of the Subsidiary Entities Accounting
and Reporting System that commenced last year will be further rolled out to other remaining
sectors as part of the first phase of covering all sectors in the country;



Fiscal statistics - The authorities are committed to the full introduction of the Government
Finance Statistics 2014 system (GFS 2014). So far, various different systems of government
accounting have been harmonized and migrated to GFS 2014 and there is a medium-term
implementation plan in place to ensure fuller statistical coverage of government economic and
financial activity in future.



Debt Management: Cabinet approved the creation of a new Debt Management Unit in the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in the middle of 2014. Its main function is to ensure
that Rwanda’s public debt stock is well managed and remains on a sustainable trajectory. The
creation of a dedicated unit ensures greater focus on debt policy in future. So far, the Unit has
engaged senior management at MINECOFIN on a number of key procedural issues such as
increasing the formalisation of the loan guarantee procedure and has familiarised management
with the key risks in Rwanda’s debt management. It has also engaged the IMF on the scope and
definition of debt across different Fund documentation and will continue this conversation in the
future. Importantly, the Unit completed a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) and a Medium-Term
Debt Strategy (MTDS) in the middle of 2014, which were presented to the Ministry’s Debt
Management Committee. It is now in the process of updating these analyses, given updated
macroeconomic information and a clearer sense of the country’s medium-term investment
needs. Non-concessional debt will only be used for high return projects that are recognized as
critical to the achievement of high and sustained growth.

18.
The implementation of key infrastructure projects, particularly in transportation,
water, and energy are critical towards meeting the objectives of the EDPRS2. Some of these
projects are at the very core of the economic transformation envisaged under the EDPRS2. In
particular, the new airport and the expansion of Rwandair are critical to connect landlocked Rwanda
to the rest of the world. Similarly, regional projects such as the railway will contribute towards
reducing the cost of doing business. While the financing of these projects is yet to be finalized, they
are most likely to involve a hybrid of public and private financing, which the new Debt Management
Unit will be well placed to advise on.
19.
Public Investment Program Implementation: the Rwandan economy is at a critical stage
in its transition from aid-dependency to private-sector driven growth. The Public Investment
Program, currently redeveloping into a National Investment Program, recognizes this and will
identify both key areas of the economy where public and private investment are required, and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

RWANDA

means (both procedural and financial) by which the government can facilitate this. The government
is committed to facilitating these large investment projects and funding them when private
investment is not possible, but further emphasizes that phasing of investment projects will be critical
in ensuring the public sector has the implementation capacity and financial resources to achieve this
economic transition. Important selection criteria for phasing will be to reduce the cost of doing
business and to remove impediments to private sector development. It will also be essential to
ensure that public debt sustainability is not compromised whilst achieving the desired economic
objective of sustainable, private-sector driven growth.
20.
With regard to implementation capacity, a number of reforms have been initiated in 2014
covering project planning, implementation and monitoring. All projects estimated above USD 1
million in cost are required to undergo a feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis. A public
investment committee at the level of Permanent Secretaries has been set up to scrutinize and
approve all projects; rigorous monitoring of projects is undertaken quarterly and monitoring reports
sent to Cabinet. This is reinforced by Cabinet appointment of a Minister of State in charge of
Economic Planning that will further strengthen the focus on planning and implementation of priority
projects. The overall planning system has been improved by the introduction of planning
consultations ahead of budgetary consultations to streamline coordination. Private sector
participation has also been given prominence with the planning and budgeting call circular
requiring both central and local government to engage the private sector and demonstrate
responsiveness of their annual plans and budget proposals to the private sector. At a more
upstream level, quarterly reports are prepared for the Economic Cluster of Ministers to ensure
further monitoring of both the general planning process and specific project implementation.
21.
The NBR will maintain its prudent monetary policy stance in a bid to anchor
inflationary expectations while supporting growth and containing pressures on the currency.
Private sector credit is expected to pick up in 2014 as the economy reverts to its potential, growing
by 16.1 per cent between December 2013 and December 2014. The exchange rate will remain
market driven and the NBR will continue to allow greater exchange rate flexibility and ensure reserve
levels remain comfortable (at a minimum level of 4 months of prospective imports (CIF)).
22.
The NBR will also sustain its efforts aimed at strengthening the monetary policy
framework. NBR is committed to promoting the interbank FOREX market by organizing the Dealer’s
Association through signing the code of conduct. This will contribute to having the daily two ways
quote on the foreign exchange market and the commitment on minimum amount to be sold. In
addition, in a bid to promote capital market development and support the transmission
mechanisms, the NBR in collaboration with MINECOFIN, is committed to issuing on quarterly basis
Treasury Bonds and extend the maturity to seven and ten years in FY2014-15.
23.
Monetary policy will continue to play a supportive role to overall economic
developments while strengthening the liquidity management framework. The NBR will further
sustain its efforts to implement monetary policy in a way that could promote market development
and lay the foundation for an effective interest rate transmission channel. The current liquidity
management framework continues to leave room for a flexible implementation of the reserve
52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

money program where changes in liquidity supply and demand can be accommodated in the short
run. As a consequence, incentives to banks for managing their liquidity and make use of the
interbank market will be improved. The NBR will continue improving its communication strategy and
publishing the inflation report (started in April 2014). The report will aim to improve the
communication of the central bank with market participants as regards the formulation of monetary
policy.
24.
Financial sector policies will remain geared toward fostering financial inclusion and
sustaining financial stability, particularly through the implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Plan (FSDP2). An action plan on how to achieve 80 percent inclusion in the next two
years has been drafted and it forms part of the financial inclusion strategic plan spearheaded by the
Financial Sector Secretariat in MINECOFIN. Also, the NBR Board of Directors approved in June 2014
the Oversight Policy Framework for Financial Market Infrastructures in Rwanda. Non-performing
loans (NPLs) have continued to decline and commercial banks are complying with the new NPL
guidelines. The NBR Board of Directors approved in September 2014 the plan to contain the NPLs in
microfinance sector. The NBR will continue to conduct off-site surveillance and on-site examinations
under risk-based supervision, and capacity building efforts for bank supervisors will be sustained.
Additionally, given the increasing importance of cross-border banks, the NBR will increase its
participation in supervisory colleges to conduct joint on-site inspection of cross-border banks.
25.
The legal and regulatory framework will continue to be bolstered. New NBR and
banking laws have been drafted and are at their final review stage for Cabinet approval. These are
expected to be implemented in 2015. Regarding the development of regulations related to New
Banking law, gaps have been identified in the existing regulations and the reviews will be considered
after the publication of the new banking law. The deposit insurance law was approved by the
Cabinet and it is under discussion in the standing committee of the Chamber of Deputies. The NBR
has put in place a dedicated team to draft a Basel II/III framework. The team has received training on
Basel II/III and technical support. The draft framework will be validated by the Steering Committee1
in December 2014. A new insurance law is being drafted, and is expected to be approved by the
BNR Board in the December 2014 meeting. The pension law was adopted by the Chamber of
Deputies and is under the Senate, while their implementing regulations are being prepared by NBR.
26.
Program issues. Table 1 contains new end-December 2014 and end-June 2015 QACs for the
third and fourth reviews under the PSI and new indicative targets for end-December 2014 and endJune 2015. These QACs are consistent with the understandings reached with the IMF staff on the
macroeconomic framework. The assessment of the end-December 2014 targets is expected to be
completed by end-June 2015, at the time of the third review, and the end-June 2015 targets by endDecember 2015 (fourth review). Table 2 includes the structural benchmarks under the PSI.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
November 11, 2014
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative targets described in the memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP) for the period December 2, 2013–November 30, 2016
supported by the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI), and sets out the data reporting requirements.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) supersedes the TMU issued in Country Report
No. 14/185.

I. QUANTITATIVE PROGRAM TARGETS
2.
The quantitative program will be assessed through assessment criteria (AC) and indicative
targets (IT) for the duration of the program.
3.
AC will apply to the following indicators for December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015 (the test
dates) throughout the program period:


Floor on stock of net foreign assets (NFA) of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR);



Ceiling on stock of reserve money;



Ceiling on flow of net domestic financing (NDF) of the central government;

4.

IT apply to the following indicators throughout the program period:


Floor on flow of domestic revenue collection of the central government;



Ceiling on flow of net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government;



Ceiling on stock of consolidated domestic debt of the public sector; and



Floor on flow of priority spending.

5.
Assessment criteria on contracting or guaranteeing of new non-concessional external debt
by the public sector and stock of external payment arrears of the public sector are applicable on a
continuous basis for the duration of the program.
6.
Program exchange rates. For accounting purposes, the following program exchange rates,
which are end-December 2013 rates, apply for 2014:

7.
The central government fiscal operation table comprises the treasury and line ministries,
hereafter referred to as the government unless specified otherwise.

B. Targets Related to the Execution of the Fiscal Program
Ceiling on net domestic financing of the government (AC)
8.
A ceiling applies to NDF. The ceiling for December 31, 2014 is cumulatively measured from
December 31, 2013, and for June 30, 2015 cumulatively from December 31, 2014.
9.
Definition. NDF of the government is defined as the change in the sum of (i) net banking
sector credit to the government and (ii) non-bank holdings of government domestic debt.
10.

Net banking sector credit to the government is defined as



Consolidated credit to the government from the banking system (NBR and commercial
banks, as recorded in the monetary survey), including credit to the government, provinces
and districts. The outstanding consolidated government debt held by the banking system,1
includes government debt to the NBR amounting to RWF 38.6 billion incurred as a result the
overdraft to the pre-war government and the 1995 devaluation 2, as well as the current
overdraft with the NBR. Credit to the government will exclude treasury bills issued by the

1

Consisting of bank holdings of treasury bills, bonds (domestic), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt), new
development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other accounts receivable.
2

The authorities will inform Fund staff of any substantive changes in government accounts with the banking system,
which may affect the calculation of net bank claims.

NBR for monetary policy purposes, the proceeds of which are sterilized in deposits held as
other NBR liabilities.
less total government deposits with the banking system (as recorded in the monetary
survey), including in the main treasury account, the accounts of line ministries, the fund for
assistance to genocide survivors, the Rwanda Revenue Authority, the electoral commission,
the demobilization commission, fonds routier, the privatization account, and the accounts of
any other autonomous public enterprises and public agencies over which the government
has direct control over their deposits. Thus, this definition excludes any government
deposits, over which the central government does not have any direct control (i.e., for
project accounts, Global Fund money meant for the private sector, counterpart funds, and
fonds publics affectés).



11.
Non-bank holdings of government domestic debt consist of non-bank holdings of treasury
bills, bonds (domestic and non-resident), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt), new
development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other accounts
receivable.
Adjusters to NDF:


The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of any shortfall between actual
and programmed budgetary loans and grants3 (defined in Table 1. Quantitative Assessment
Criteria and Indicative Targets of the MEFP), up to a maximum of US$80 million, evaluated in
Rwandan francs at the program exchange rate.



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward/downward by the extent to which in Rwandan
francs at the program exchange rate the unused proceeds of the US$400 million euro bond
issued in April 2013 is lower than/exceed US$76.7 million by end-December 2014.



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food imports
in the case of a food emergency.

12.
Reporting requirement. Data on NDF (showing separately treasury bills and government
bonds outstanding, other government debt, and central government deposits), each type of debt to
be shown by debt holder, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five weeks from the end of
each month. Deposits of the government with the NBR and with the commercial banks will be
separated from the deposits of the public enterprises and autonomous public agencies and
agencies that the government does not have any direct control over.

Floor on flow of domestic revenues (IT)
13.
A floor applies to domestic revenue. The floor for December 31, 2014 is cumulatively
measured from December 31, 2013, and for June 30, 2015 cumulatively from December 31, 2014.
14.
Definition. The floor on domestic government revenue is defined as total government
revenue (tax and non-tax revenues), per the central government fiscal operation table, but excluding
external grants, peace keeping operations, and privatization receipts.
15.
Reporting requirement. Detailed data on domestic revenues will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Floor on priority expenditure (IT)
16.
The floor applies to priority spending of the government. The floor for December 31, 2014 is
cumulatively measured from December 31, 2013, and for June 30, 2015 cumulatively from December
31, 2014.
17.
Definition. Priority expenditure is defined as the sum of those recurrent expenditures,
domestically-financed capital expenditures, and net lending that the government has identified as
priority in line with the EDPRS2. Priority expenditure is monitored through the computerized SIBET
expenditure management system which tracks priority spending of the annual budget at the
program level.
18.
Reporting requirement. Data on priority expenditure will be transmitted on a monthly
basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government (IT)
19.
A ceiling applies to net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government.4 The ceiling for
December 31, 2014 is cumulatively measured from December 31, 2013, and for June 30, 2015
cumulatively from December 31, 2014.
20.
Definition. The net accumulation of arrears is defined as the difference between the gross
accumulation of new domestic arrears (measured as the difference between payment orders and
actual payments related to payment orders issued) and gross repayment of any arrears outstanding
since the beginning of the year under review (including repayment of float during the review year
and the repayment of older arrears).
21.
Reporting requirement. Data on repayment of domestic arrears and the remaining
previous year’s stock of arrears will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five weeks of the end
of each month.
4

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

C. Limits on External Debt
Limit on new non-concessional external debt of the public sector (AC)
22.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new nonconcessional borrowing with non-residents (see below for the definition of the public sector,
concessionality and debt). The ceiling is given in Table 1. Quantitative Assessment Criteria and
Indicative Targets of the MEFP which applies continuously from December 2, 2013 to end-June
2015. The ceiling also excludes non-concessional borrowing by one state-owned bank, the Bank of
Kigali, which is assumed not to seek or be granted a government guarantee. The ceiling also applies
to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended, including future swaps involving
foreign currency loans guaranteed by the public sector (see below for swaps), and which, therefore,
constitute a contingent liability of the public sector.
23.
Definition of the public sector. The public sector comprises the general government (the
central government, the NBR, local governments which include provinces and districts) and entities
in which the government holds a controlling stake (owning more than 50 percent of the shares or
the ability to determine general corporate policy).5 This definition of public sector excludes the Bank
of Kigali.
24.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of
the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in
cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public sector to finance
partially or in full any shortfall incurred by the debtor.
25.
Definition of concessionality. For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a
grant element of at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the
difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage
of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.6 The discount rate used
for this purpose is 5 percent.
26.
Definition of debt for the purposes of the limit in the QAC table is set out in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt, effective December 1, 2009. It not
only applies to the debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of
5

Government control of an entity can be established based on the following criteria: (i) ownership of the majority of
the voting interest; (ii) control of the board or other governing body; (iii) control of the appointment and removal of
key personnel; (iv) control of key committees of the entity; (v) golden shares and options; (vi) regulation and control;
(vii) control by a dominant public sector customer or group of public sector customers; and (viii) control attached to
borrowing from the government.
6

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

debt set forth in No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in
Fund Arrangements reads as follows:
(a) The term "debt" will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being
as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official
swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lesser retains the title
to the property. The debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give
rise to debt.
Limit on the stock of external payment arrears (AC)

27.

A continuous assessment criterion applies to the non-accumulation of payment arrears on

external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. External payment arrears consist of
external debt service obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at the time they are
due, as specified in the contractual agreements, but shall exclude arrears on obligations that are
subject to rescheduling.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

Consolidated Domestic Debt of the Public Sector (IT)
28.
For program purposes, domestic debt (DD) excludes treasury bills issued by the NBR
for monetary policy purposes. The ceiling on DD applies to domestic commitments contracted or
guaranteed by the public sector. This also applies to private debt for which official guarantees have
been extended either implicitly or explicitly. The authorities would inform Fund staff of any changes
in debt position of public sector entities.
Adjusters:


In the case of a shortfall in programmed budgetary loans and grants (per paragraph 11), the
ceiling on consolidated domestic debt of public sector will be adjusted upward by the same
amount as the increase in the ceiling in the NDF, but capped per paragraph 11.



The ceiling on the DD will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

29.
Reporting requirement. Data on domestic debt of the public sector, including treasury bills
issued by the NBR for monetary policy purposes, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five
weeks of the end of each month.

D. Targets for Monetary Aggregates
Net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (AC)
30.
A floor applies to the net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBR for December 31, 2014 and for
June 30, 2015.
31.

Definition. NFA of the NBR in Rwandan francs is defined, consistent with the definition of

the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) template, as external assets readily available to, or
controlled by, the NBR net of its external liabilities. Pledged or otherwise encumbered reserve assets
(including swaps) are excluded; such assets include, but are not limited to, reserve assets used as
collateral or guarantee for third party external liabilities. Foreign assets and foreign liabilities in
U.S. dollars are converted to Rwandan francs by using the U.S. dollar/Rwanda franc program
exchange rate. Foreign assets and liabilities in other currencies are converted to U.S. dollars by using
the actual end-of-period U.S. dollar/currency exchange rate. Foreign liabilities include, inter alia, use
of IMF resources (CCFF and post-conflict emergency assistance purchases and SAF/ESAF/ECF
disbursements).
Adjusters:


62

The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of any shortfall between actual
and programmed budgetary loans and grants per Table 1. Quantitative Assessment Criteria

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

and Indicative Targets of the MEFP. This adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of
US$80 million, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program exchange rate.


The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the extent to which actual
encumbered reserve assets are lower (higher) than programmed encumbered reserve assets,
evaluated in Rwandan francs at the program exchange rate.7



The floor on NFA will be adjusted upward/downward by the extent to which in Rwandan
francs at the program exchange rate unused proceeds of the US$400 million euro bond
issued in April 2013 exceeds/is lower than US$76.7 million by end-December 2014.



The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of expenditure for food imports
in the case of a food emergency, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program exchange rate.

32.
Reporting requirement. Data on foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the NBR will be
transmitted on a weekly basis within seven days of the end of each week, including breakdown of
assets that are pledged or encumbered. This transmission will include daily and weekly data on the
NBR’s foreign exchange liabilities to commercial banks (including required reserves with the NBR)
and the exchange rate used for their conversion into Rwanda francs will be shown separately.
Reserve money (AC)
33.
A ceiling applies to the stock of reserve money for December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015 as
indicated in Table 1. Quantitative Assessment Criteria and Indicative Targets of the MEFP. The ceiling
is the upper bound of a reserve money band (set at+/- 2 percent) around a central reserve money
target).
34.
The stock of reserve money for a given quarter will be calculated as the arithmetic average
of the stock of reserve money at the end of each calendar month in the quarter. Daily average of all
the three months in the quarter will constitute the actual reserve money to be compared with the
target.
35.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, commercial banks’ reserves,
and other nonbank deposits at the NBR.
Adjuster:


7

The ceiling on the stock of reserve money will be adjusted symmetrically for a change in the
required reserve ratio of commercial banks. The adjustor will be calculated as (new reserve
ratio minus program baseline reserve ratio) multiplied by actual amount of liabilities
(Rwanda Franc plus foreign-currency denominated) in commercial banks.

The programmed amount of encumbered reserve assets stands at zero at December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

RWANDA

36.
Reporting requirement. Data on reserve money will be transmitted on a weekly basis
within seven days of the end of each week. This transmission will include a daily and a weekly
balance sheet of the NBR which will show all items listed above in the definitions of reserve money.

II. OTHER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
37.
For the purposes of program monitoring, the Government of Rwanda will provide the data
listed in TMU Table 1 below, weekly data within seven days of the end of each week; monthly data
within five weeks of the end of each month; annual data as available.
38.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days (excluding legal
holidays in Rwanda or in the United States) prior to making any changes in economic and financial
policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program. Such policies include but are not
limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates, exemptions, allowances, and thresholds), wage
policy, and financial support to public and private enterprises. The authorities will similarly inform
the IMF staff of any non-concessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government,
the NBR, or any statutory bodies, and any accumulation of new external payments arrears on the
debt contracted or guaranteed by these entities. The authorities will furnish an official
communication to the IMF describing program performance of quantitative and structural
assessment criteria and benchmarks within 8 weeks of a test date. The authorities will on a regular
basis submit information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time lag as indicated in
TMU Table 1. The information should be mailed electronically to the Fund. (email: afrrwa@imf.org).

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 4 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
______________________________________

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.

Safeguards Assessments:
The 2007 safeguards update assessment noted that since 2003, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR)
strengthened its own safeguards: External audits were completed on time, the Committee of
Auditors became operational, and the Internal Audit Department helped in the strengthening of
controls over monetary program data. The update assessment’s priority recommendations
concerned timely publication of the audited financial statements, further improving external audit
arrangements, and conformity with IFRS. Safeguards policy does not require an update safeguards
assessment in the case of a non-financial arrangement with the Fund.
Exchange System:
The currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF and maintains a system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. As of October 30, 2013, the
official exchange rate was RWF 661.5 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has depreciated about 2.5
percent since end-2013. The de facto exchange rate regime is currently classified as crawl like and
the de jure as floating. With effect from December 27, 2010, the official exchange rate is the
weighted average of a foreign exchange interbank market transaction and an intervention
transaction by the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR). The Average Reference Rate, formerly used for
the official exchange rate, was eliminated. The NBR applies a margin of +/-0.8 percent to the official
rate to derive a customer rate. With a view to introducing more flexibility in its exchange rate policy,
since March 24, 2010, NBR has introduced an exchange rate corridor framework.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that are
qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 which
remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral
contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member under the

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: The quality of national accounts, government finance and monetary statistics is high in
Rwanda and the country makes good use of technical assistance support from the IMF. The country
has one of the most frequent base year updates among SSA countries and coordinates the base
year update with a new household survey to get a better sense of home production and the
informal sector. The government released its latest five year plan in the fall of 2013 advocating the
need for greater resources to improve capacity and help monitor the yardsticks embedded in the
government’s latest Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy.
National Accounts and Price Statistics: Annual GDP estimates in current and 2011 constant prices
are compiled and disseminated by NISR, based on the 1993 System of National Accounts concepts.
Commendable efforts have been made to improve the GDP estimates, with technical assistance
being provided by the East AFRITAC and DFID. NISR has been disseminating quarterly GDP
estimates from 2010 and released the latest estimates consistent with the 2011 base year revision in
June 2014.
Annual agricultural surveys have recently been introduced making use of GPS territory data and this
should help improve agricultural production estimates over time. Currently, there exist large
differences between the estimates of the agricultural survey and those of the Ministry of Agriculture
that are reported by the FAO.
The absence of a comprehensive economy-wide business survey precludes a reliable
benchmark of economic activities in the private sector. Proxy indicators such as monthly VAT
turnover data cover the formal sector and financial data reported by a limited number of large
companies are used to estimate the production.
Economic activities in the informal sector are estimated every 5 years making use of household
surveys but the plan is to raise the frequency of household surveys to every three years with the next
projected survey this year.
On the expenditure side, estimates of government consumption, gross capital formation, and
trade in goods and services are compiled from data sources including government budget
reports and balance of payment estimates, but private consumption and changes in inventories are
estimated as the gap between the sum of these components and a total GDP estimate from the
production approach.
Government Finance Statistics: Detailed quarterly revenues and expenditures are posted on the
Ministry of Finance’s website in conformity with the Fund’s structural benchmark. The classification
of government data is fully consistent with the GFS 2001 manual, but data is still being presented
using the 1986 system. In terms of presentation, expenditures on PRSP-designated “priority areas”
are clearly identifiable.
Monetary Statistics: The balance sheet of the NBR and detailed data on money market transactions
are transmitted to AFR on a weekly basis with a lag of one week, while the monetary survey and the
consolidated balance sheet of commercial banks are transmitted on a monthly basis with a lag of
about five weeks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

Balance of Payments: The government is moving away from the existing International Transactions
Reporting System (ITRS) sources for trade in services, to one based on direct surveys. This change is
needed to compile quarterly balance of payments. Results from the Foreign Private Capital Survey
(FPC) can be used to replace existing direct investment flows, stocks and income estimates but
currently it is only available on an annual basis.
Work is ongoing to implement BPM6 standards for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments and IIP statistics. The main outstanding issue is the identification of data for goods for
processing.
On travel credits and debits, a new border survey has been launched by the Rwanda Development
Board (RDB) to update average daily expenditures from departing foreign visitors and a new border
survey of returning Rwandan travelers was launched in 2013. On remittances, data are available for
formal transfers through banks and Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) but informal estimates are
less reliable and are being cross-checked with the 2011 Integrated Living Costs Survey.
The coverage of external aid remains a cause of concern. Data produced by the CEPEX does not
include offshore payments, direct payments to contractors, and technical assistants, nor does it
capture aid from important UN agencies and from certain countries. Only the external aid registered
in the Government budget is fully covered. Concerning the NGO sector, the data should result from
the survey of NGOs, but its coverage is insufficient.
Databases on external public debt are maintained by both MINECOFIN and the NBR.
A committee, composed of staffs from the ministries of finance and economic planning,
foreign affairs, and the NBR, is responsible for collecting, harmonizing, and monitoring the data
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Rwanda has subscribed to the GDDS since 2009
but the dissemination of the sector pages has
been spotty. As part of a current review the
authorities have indicated that they will update
the pages on national accounts statistics, CPI
and producer price index and submit to the IMF
by end November 2014. The pages for External
Trade and Balance of Payments are also being
updated.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The quality of the national accounts data in
Rwanda is one of the highest in Sub-Saharan
Africa with annual agricultural surveys now well
integrated into the calculation of output. The
updating of base years is also done on a
frequent basis and household survey releases are
now more frequent than any other country in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

RWANDA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Roger Nord and Dan
Ghura (IMF) and John
Panzer (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly
by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities.

The results of the debt sustainability analysis indicate that Rwanda continues to face a low
risk of debt distress, similar to the analysis prepared in the previous year. 1 Under the
baseline scenario all debt burden indicators are projected to remain below the policydependent thresholds. Standard stress tests show a marginal temporary breach of the PV of
the debt service-to-revenue ratio in 2023 when the Eurobond issued in 2013 matures. As
this breach is temporary, and it is assumed that Rwanda will be able to refinance the
maturing Eurobond, the final assessment of a low risk of debt distress remains. Rwanda’s
debt profile is expected to improve over the medium term, as exports expand and become
more diversified and economic growth remains strong. These favorable medium-term
macroeconomic projections and debt dynamics, along with its record of sound economic
management, have contributed to Rwanda’s credit rating being upgraded to B+ from B by
Fitch in July 2014.2 However, the maintenance of prudent macroeconomic and sound debt
management policies is required to prevent Rwanda losing its “low risk” of debt distress
rating. In particular, too aggressive expansion of external commercial debt would make
public debt more vulnerable, as would also weaker-than-expected growth and slower-thananticipated export expansion, resulting in a downgrade in the debt distress risk rating.
1

This debt sustainability analysis replaces the DSA update contained in IMF Country Report no. 13/372
(December 2013). The fiscal year for Rwanda is from July–June; however, this DSA is prepared on a calendar year
basis. The results of this DSA were discussed with the authorities and they are in broad agreement with its
conclusions.
2

Further, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) which assesses the quality of a country’s present
policy and institutional framework has classified Rwanda as a strong performer, with an average CPIA score of
3.86 over the last three years.

RWANDA

BACKGROUND
1.
The Rwandan economy slowed significantly in 2013. Real GDP grew by 4.7 percent as
a result of poor performance in the agricultural sector, coupled with delays in the disbursement
of budget support and the consequent negative spillovers on the government’s investment
program and the services sector activity. However, the weak economic growth of 2013 is
expected to be temporary and growth is anticipated to pick up in 2014 to about 6 percent on
account of stronger agricultural growth and the catch-up effects from the implementation of
government projects. Inflation declined in 2013 along with the slowdown in economic growth,
with year-on-year headline inflation reaching 3.6 percent, as food, energy and import prices
decelerated. Inflation is expected to decline to 3.2 percent in 2014, below the authorities’
medium-term target of 5 percent.
2.
The current account improved considerably in 2013 but worsened in 2014. The
improvement in 2013 resulted from a combination of strong export growth, mainly in mining,
and flat imports. A number of foreign companies have recently invested in the mining sector and
contributed to the surge in mining exports. The flat imports reflected the adverse effects of
delays in government-financed projects and weaknesses in private consumption due to the
slowdown in economic growth. The rebound in public sector external grants also helped to
strengthen the current account. However in 2014 weak exports of goods and strong growth in
imports of goods of 13 percent (year-on-year) have contributed to a deterioration in both the
trade and current account balances.
3.
Public sector debt remains low. At end-2013, total public sector debt was 28.4 percent
of GDP - with the external debt of the public sector at 21.4 percent of GDP and mainly
comprised of concessional borrowing, and domestic debt at 7 percent of GDP. These debt ratios
compare favorably with those of other countries in the region. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has
increased steadily over the last three years, reflecting new borrowing, in particular large
disbursements under multilateral concessional loans. In addition to the concessional loans,
donors have provided significant support for Rwanda’s economic development program in the
form of grants – general or sectoral budget support and project grants. However, Rwanda’s lowrisk rating of debt distress will shift donor support further towards concessional lending going
forward. In 2013, Rwanda also accessed non-concessional financing, most notably through the
issuance of the 10-year Eurobond, to fund public sector investments and repay commercial debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium and long-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is
consistent with the baseline scenario presented in the Staff Report for 2014 Article IV
Consultation. The main assumptions and projections for key macroeconomic variables are
summarized in Box 1 and Table 1. Since the last DSA update, staff have lowered expectations of
near-term growth but economic activity is expected to remain strong in the medium term. GDP
growth is expected to recover after the slowdown in 2013 to 7.5 percent over the medium and
long term, starting from 2017 (Table 2). Inflation is expected to remain low and stable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

Box 1. Macroeconomic Framework for the DSA
The medium-term framework underpinning the DSA assumes that Rwanda continues to enjoy rapid growth,
and low and stable inflation. Key highlights:



Growth: Long-run growth is projected at 7.5 percent. However, the composition of growth is expected
to shift toward greater export orientation as policies geared towards expanding and diversifying the
export base take hold. The role of the private sector is also assumed to expand, while public investment
in infrastructure will remain high.



External sector: Exports of goods and services are expected to gradually rise from 15.6 percent of GDP
in 2013 to 18 percent by 2034. However, despite the completion of some current projects in the nearterm import needs are expected to remain high, reflecting continued high investment needs in the
economy, reaching 28.1 percent of GDP in 2034. Consequently, Rwanda’s external current account is
projected to remain in deficit throughout the period under consideration, though the gap is expected to
narrow to 6.6 percent of GDP by 2034 (from 11.8 percent in 2014).



Inflation: Inflation is expected to remain contained. After falling at the end of 2013 to 3.6 percent, the
rate is expected to be anchored to the authorities’ medium-term target of 5 percent. Improvements in
agricultural productivity are expected to lower food prices over the long run, containing a prime driver
of inflation in Rwanda.



Reserves: Reserve buffers are expected achieve coverage of 4.5 months of prospective imports by 2023,
which would facilitate monetary integration among East African Community members.



Fiscal outlook. The key fiscal assumption is that there would be a gradual and consistent effort to raise
domestic revenues (excluding grants) from 16.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 21.9 percent by 2034. This
reflects the authorities’ commitment to raise Rwanda’s revenue collection efforts to comparable level
observed in other countries in the region. Primary expenditures are forecast to remain high at about
24-25 percent of GDP on average, reflecting the need for ongoing significant capital and current
spending.



Grants. The DSA assumes a tapering of external donor assistance, reflecting reduced access to grants,
given Rwandan’s improved debt distress risk rating, and greater capacity to mobilize and use domestic
revenue. As a result, grants are forecast to decline from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.5 percent by
2034.



External borrowing. The assumptions for new external borrowing vary over the assessment period.
From 2014-19, the framework assumes external financing requirement is met mainly by the
disbursements of external concessional debt and smaller shares of bilateral and non-concessional debt.
From 2019 onward, the framework assumes that any external financing need of the central government
will be financed by new external debt, with progressively increasing contribution from commercial debt,
including bonds issued in the international capital market.



Domestic borrowing. The framework assumes that domestic borrowing will continue to decline until
2019 as the authorities anchor fiscal policy on a goal of limiting net domestic financing. From 2020,
domestic borrowing of 2.5 percent of GDP is assumed, which sees domestic debt rise gradually to 18
percent of GDP by 2034 – about 47 percent of outstanding public debt. Over time, the composition of
domestic borrowing is also expected to shift towards medium- and long-term debt as the authorities
intensify efforts to develop the local government bond market.



Domestic interest rates. New domestic borrowing is expected to be contracted at a nominal interest
rate of 8 percent – a weighted average of the cost of short-and long-term domestic debt.

5.
Under the baseline, the current account balance is expected to be negative over
2014–34. Exports of goods and services are expected to gradually rise from 15.6 percent of GDP
in 2013 to 18 percent by 2034, as the export base expands and diversifies, though at a slightly
slower pace than was envisaged under the previous DSA. The authorities are implementing a
series of measures to boost both traditional and non-traditional exports and tourism, which are
assumed to be successful.3 Imports of goods and services, though falling from their peak in
early years, are expected to remain high throughout the assessment period, reflecting continued
high investment needs in the economy, partly related to new infrastructure projects, and the
overall expansion of the economy, reaching 28.1 percent of GDP in 2034. As a result, Rwanda’s
current account is projected to remain in deficit throughout the assessment period, though the
deficit is expected to narrow to 6.6 percent of GDP by 2034 (from 11.8 percent in 2014). Hence,
the current account is now projected to be slightly worse than was assumed in the last DSA
update (Table 2).
6.
Assumptions regarding external borrowing remain similar to the macroeconomic
framework underpinning last year’s DSA (see Table 2).4 In particular, the new external
borrowing in the period from 2014-19 mainly reflects concessional loans and smaller shares of
bilateral and non-concessional debt. From 2019 onward, the framework assumes that any
external financing need of the central government will be financed by new external debt, with
progressively increasing contributions from non-concessional debt, contracted by a combination
of loans and bonds issued in the international capital market.

Some of these measures have been described in IMF Country Report no. 13/372 (December 2013).

7.
The authorities have identified several investment projects in support of the EDPRS
2 objectives. These are mainly in the energy and transportation sectors. Plans include a new
airport and several large regional projects such as the regional oil pipeline and railway. These are
still at an early stage, and financing for these projects has not yet been identified. Given the
uncertainties in the timing of project implementation and the availability of alternative sources
of financing, the authorities did not have an explicit timeline for contracting non-concessional
debt. As a consequence the baseline does not assume any additional large-scale nonconcessional borrowing.

External and domestic financing terms are similar to last DSA update, except the
IDA terms which now reflect their new features. All new non-concessional debt is assumed to
have 10-year maturity and interest rates of 7-8 percent, with amortizing or bullet repayment
structures, depending on whether commercial loans are contracted or international bonds are
issued. Financing terms for multilateral and bilateral loans are the standard terms typically
associated with the respective multilateral and bilateral lenders from which Rwanda is assumed

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

to borrow and reflects the new terms for IDA loans.5 Finally, the DSA assumes more use of
domestic borrowing after 2019, reflecting efforts to tap domestic savings and the authorities’
goal to develop financial markets through the provision of a wider variety of instruments
denominated in Rwandan francs. This debt is assumed to carry a nominal interest rate of
8 percent – a weighted average of the interest rates on the short- and long-term debt
instruments issued by the government.
9.
The macroeconomic outlook is subject to risks. Although there have been downward
revisions to some key macroeconomic variables, including exports, relative to the baseline of last
year’s DSA, the baseline scenario is still built around relatively favorable assumptions, most
notably about long-term economic growth and expansion and diversification in exports,
commodity prices and improvement in tax revenues. Given the low export base, the Rwandan
economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, for example, to a fall in mineral prices or a
slowdown in trading partners’ demand which could retard the envisaged export expansion and
diversification efforts. A prolonged worsening of the terms of trade or foreign demand could
lead to severe external sector imbalances and require additional foreign borrowing to avoid a
sharp contraction in income. This could have negative implications for debt sustainability,
resulting in the deterioration in the risk of debt distress rating.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. External DSA
10.
Based on the assumptions outlined above, Rwanda’s debt is assessed to be
sustainable with low risk of debt distress (Appendix Figure 1a and Tables 1a and 1b).
Similar to the last DSA update, the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability framework (DSF) for
low-income countries classifies Rwanda as a “strong” performer, based on the quality of the
country’s policies and institutions as measured by the 3-year average of the ratings under the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). This is reflected in higher debt
sustainability thresholds compared to countries operating in a weak policy environment.6 Under
the baseline scenario all debt burden indicators are projected to remain comfortably below the
policy-dependent thresholds. Standard stress tests show in 2023 (when the Eurobond issued in
2013 is set to mature) a marginal temporary breach of the debt service-to-revenue (24.9 percent)
ratio7, and the debt service-to-exports ratio being identical to its threshold. These findings
highlight the vulnerability of the Rwandan economy to external shocks and liquidity pressures at
the time the Eurobond matures. However, as the breach of the debt service-to-revenue ratio is
small and temporary, and taking into account the low level of external debt and strengthening
5

New IDA loans will have a maturity of 38 years, with 6 years of grace and equal annual principal payments. The
interest charge remains unchanged at 0.75 percent. The implication of these new terms is that the level of
concessionality is lower (about 7.3 percentage points) than under the old terms.
6

The thresholds for strong performers are 200, 50 and 300 percent for the PV of debt to exports, GDP and
government revenue, respectively. Debt service thresholds are 25 and 22 percent of exports and revenue,
respectively.

indicators of repayment capacity (the expansion of Rwanda’s export base and tax revenues), and
that Rwanda is assumed to refinance the maturing Eurobond, the final assessment for Rwanda’s
external public and public guaranteed debt is a low risk of debt distress.

B. Public DSA
11.
Adding domestic public debt to external debt does not change the results of the
analysis (see Appendix Figure 1b and Tables 2a and 2b). The evolution of the total public
debt indicators broadly follows that of external debt under the baseline. The DSA suggests that
public debt remains stable under the baseline. Based on the 3 indicators examined—PV of public
debt-to-GDP, PV of public debt-to-revenue and debt service of public debt-to-revenue—the
long-term path of total public debt is projected to be stable in the baseline (Appendix Figure
1b). PV of public debt-to-GDP remains comfortably below the indicative benchmark throughout
the assessment period. The PV of total public debt is expected to increase from 24.8 percent of
GDP in 2014 to 36 percent in 2032 and then decline thereafter to 33.4 percent in 2034. Over the
assessment period, domestic public debt as share of GDP rises (from 7 percent in 2014 to
18.9 percent of GDP by 2034), reflecting the substitution of domestic borrowing to partially
offset the decline in foreign aid. The sharp increase in the PV of debt-to-revenue indicator when
the primary balance is assumed fixed at 2014 level highlights the importance of securing the
revenue gains assumed under the baseline. With the primary deficit anchored at 4.3 percent of
GDP (and hence not reflecting the assumed revenue improvements), the PV of debt-to-revenue
indicator rises sharply from 96.6 percent in 2014 to reach 223.1 percent by 2034.

C. External and Public DSA under Alternative Financing Scenarios
12.
External and Public DSAs were also done for two alternative financing cases. In the
first alternative scenario (NCB A US$230 million) it is assumed that the authorities contract
US$230 million non- concessional debt– equivalent to 2.7 percent of 2015 GDP. This amount is
equivalent to the current remaining non-concessional borrowing space under the PSI. In the
second alternative scenario non-concessional borrowing is expanded more aggressively and the
authorities contract US$500 million of non-concessional debt equivalent to about 6 percent of
2015 GDP.
13.
Under the first alternative scenario, debt vulnerabilities would be similar to the
current baseline scenario (Figure 2a). Under the baseline scenario all debt burden indicators
are projected to remain below the policy-dependent thresholds. Standard stress tests show
marginal temporary breaches of the debt service-to-exports (26.3 percent) and debt service-torevenues (25.6 percent) ratios in 2023 when the Eurobond issued in 2013 matures. However, as
these breaches are minor and temporary, and it is still judged that Rwanda’s ability to rollover
these maturing Eurobonds would not be impaired, the risk of debt distress would remain low.
14.
Under the second alternative scenario, debt vulnerabilities would also remain
similar to the current baseline and the risk rating would still remain unchanged (Figure
2b). Under the baseline scenario all debt burden indicators are still projected to remain below
the policy-dependent thresholds. However, figure 2b illustrates that standard stress tests show a
borderline breach of the PV of debt-to exports ratio threshold (208.2 percent) in 2016 and
breaches of the debt service-to-exports (26.7 and 25.8 percent) and debt service-to-revenues
(26.0 and 25.5 percent) ratios in 2023 and 2025 when the Eurobonds issued in 2013 and 2015 are

7

RWANDA

set to mature. However, as these breaches are all temporary and maturing non-concessional
debt can be refinanced the risk of debt distress would still remain low.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
15.
The Rwandan authorities broadly agree with the results of this DSA and the overall
assessment of low risk of debt distress. They concur with the assessment that the main risk to
debt vulnerability remains the narrow export base. However, at the same time, they also expect
that the on-going investments in the mining and non-traditional exports and tourism sectors will
make the expansion in the export base sufficiently durable to limit this risk. Further, the
authorities agree that maintaining a prudent medium-term debt management strategy and
carefully and prudently assessing future projects and their financing remain important to prevent
public debt from becoming unsustainable.

CONCLUSION
16.
Rwanda continues to face a low risk of debt distress but remains subject to external
vulnerabilities. Under the current set of baseline assumptions, Rwanda’s debt burden indicators
remain below the policy-related thresholds under baseline scenario, with one temporary breach
of the debt-service-to-revenue ratio in 2023, and the debt service-to-exports ratio being
identical to its threshold under standard stress tests. This breach and near-breach of these two
liquidity ratios underscore Rwanda’s susceptibility to external shocks and potential risk of
liquidity pressures in the future. However it is judged that the risk arising from this breach of the
debt-service-to-revenue ratio can be mitigated by the ability of the authorities to refinance nonconcessional debt falling due in 2023, provided that sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies
are maintained. Public debt is low and primarily consists of concessional borrowing. Rwanda’s
external debt burden profile is also expected to improve further, given the anticipated strong
growth and expansion in exports.
17.
The main risk to Rwanda’s debt sustainability remains the narrow export base.
Previous DSAs have highlighted risks stemming from its narrow export base. This risk is expected
to be mitigated by the improvement in export performance experienced over the assessment
period. However, should these anticipated export gains fail to materialize, resulting in lower than
expected export volumes, the risks to debt sustainability over the longer term would increase.
18.
In addition, Rwanda remains highly dependent on foreign aid. While the underlying
macroeconomic framework assumes a gradual decline in aid flows over the longer term, a much
sharper correction cannot be ruled out. The developments in 2012 demonstrated the still-high
reliance on external assistance, which will be difficult to address in the short run. Over the
medium term, as the authorities are better able to reduce their reliance on aid, the risks from an
aid shortfall would decline.
19.
The low domestic revenue base reduces the capacity to substitute for shortfalls in
foreign aid in the near term. The framework builds in an improvement in domestic revenue
collection over the medium term- it is assumed that Rwanda’s revenue collection efforts
converge to the average for the region. However, in the event that the envisaged gains from
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

revenue mobilization are not realized, there would be implications on either debt sustainability
as additional borrowing is used to finance the authorities’ economic development program, or
there would have to be a scaling down in expenditure, and hence growth, as plans would need
to be adjusted to the prevailing financing envelope. In either case, the envisaged improvement
in Rwanda’s debt profile would be harder to achieve.
20.
The DSA suggests that Rwanda does have some flexibility to use non-concessional
financing options, but this space is limited. Alternative financing scenarios show that nonconcessional borrowing of about US$ 500 million in 2015, would not adversely affect Rwanda’s
debt profile. However, increasing rapidly external non-concessional debt much more beyond this
would result in public debt vulnerability rising to the extent that Rwanda would risk losing its
“low-risk” of debt distress rating. Therefore, it is vital that the authorities continue to exercise
caution going forward. In particular, in terms of the choice of financing options, Rwanda should
continue to avail itself of concessional financing to the extent possible. The “low risk” rating has
expanded the set of new sources of concessional financing, which should be prioritized over
commercial borrowing. Any non-concessional borrowing should be distributed over a multi-year
horizon to help manage rollover risks and minimize the carry costs associated with the timing
difference between the contracting of the debt and the use of the proceeds. Care should be
taken also on both the selection of projects that they wish to implement and the modalities of
financing these investments. Projects need to be prioritized and sequenced, and supported by
strong, independent cost-benefit analyses to ensure the economic benefits are commensurate
with the opportunity costs of utilizing Rwanda’s limited debt space.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Rwandan authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 10 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Second PSI Review for Rwanda and Concludes 2014
Article IV Consultation
On December 8, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund completed the
second review of Rwanda’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI)1 and also concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation2 with Rwanda.
The PSI for Rwanda was approved on December 2, 2013 (see Press Release No.13/483).
Following the Board discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, made the following statement:
“The Rwandan authorities are to be commended for their strong implementation of the economic
program supported by the Policy Support Instrument, carried out against a challenging economic
environment. Poverty has declined over time, economic growth has recovered since 2013, and
inflation remains contained.
“Fiscal policies remain prudent and the objectives of the FY2014/15 budget are within reach. In
the medium term, fiscal deficits are projected to decline with limited recourse to domestic
financing. Strengthening the domestic revenue base is an important objective, including for
reducing aid dependency, and the authorities should vigorously pursue improvements in revenue
administration and tax policy improvements in agriculture, mining, and property.

1

The PSI is an instrument of the IMF designed for low-income countries that do not need or may not want balance
of payments financial support. The PSI helps countries design effective economic programs that once approved by
the IMF's Executive Board, signal to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund's endorsement
of a member's policies (see http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/psi.htm). Details on Rwanda’s current PSI are
available at www.imf.org/rwanda.
2

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
“The central bank’s current monetary policy stance is appropriate in view of rising inflationary
pressures and the more flexible monetary policy framework will serve to make monetary policy
implementation more effective. However, stepped-up efforts are needed to better promote
financial deepening and inclusion, including through implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Plan, and to enhance domestic and cross-border financial supervisory and
regulatory frameworks.
“The government has taken important steps to strengthen Rwanda’s debt management capacity
and project implementation, including establishment of a Debt Management Unit. The available
room to fund new infrastructure projects and maintain a low risk of debt distress is limited, and
sensitive to changing economic circumstances. This requires consistent and prudent debt
management, through exploring all available concessional financing options, private sector
involvement and judicious use of non-concessional borrowing.
“Removal of remaining structural impediments to private sector investment will help foster
greater regional integration and export diversification. Efforts are needed to strengthen the
business environment, including by lowering business costs and reducing remaining trade
barriers”.
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV Consultation with Rwanda.
Rwanda’s economic performance since the turn of the century has been remarkable. Strong
policies have played a key role in maintaining Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at
7.8 percent on average since 2000, with significant poverty reduction. The economy is
recovering from the disruptions induced by aid suspension through mid-2013, with growth
bouncing back in the first half of 2014 and inflation well contained.
The fiscal deficit for the fiscal year 2014/15 continues to be in line with available resources. Tax
revenue is expected to increase by 1 percent of GDP this fiscal year, bringing it to almost
16 percent of GDP. Continued efforts to mobilize more domestic revenue should allow Rwanda
to reduce its reliance on donor resources and finance its ambitious development agenda.
The monetary stance has remained unchanged since mid-2014 and is consistent with the
projected pick-up in inflation and improved growth outlook. The National Bank of Rwanda
(NBR) has implemented a series of measures aimed at improving the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy and allowed greater exchange rate flexibility to maintain reserves at adequate
levels.
Growth in 2014 is expected to be about 6 percent, rising to the longer-term growth rate of
7.5 percent in the medium term. This reflects improved implementation of government projects
and a rebound in agriculture because of favorable climatic conditions early in the year. Prospects

3
in construction and real estate are also favorable. Inflation is projected at about 3 percent by end
year, converging to the authorities’ target of 5 percent in the medium term.
In terms of risks, weather conditions and delayed project implementation would hinder growth
prospects, and a protracted period of slower growth in advanced economies or a decline in
commodity prices - minerals and traditional exports - would adversely affect exports.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Rwanda’s
continued strong performance under the PSI-supported program, which has led to progress
towards macroeconomic stability; robust, sustained and inclusive growth; improved gender
equity; and poverty reduction. Despite strong program performance and the favorable economic
outlook, Directors noted the country’s vulnerability to external shocks and high aid dependency,
and encouraged the authorities to sustain the reform momentum. They supported the creation of
an enabling environment for successful economic transformation to a more diversified,
private-sector-led growth strategy, through macroeconomic prudence and productivity and
competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors called for continued efforts to strengthen fiscal sustainability through enhanced
revenue mobilization and reduced foreign aid dependency. They recommended improvements in
tax administration and broadening the tax base with Fund technical assistance, including through
tax policy measures in agriculture, mining and property. On the expenditure side, Directors
welcomed the identification of specific contingent cuts for FY2014/15, which safeguard priority
social spending, in the event of revenue shortfalls. They also encouraged ongoing efforts to
strengthen public financial management.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance appropriate in view of rising inflationary
pressures. However, they encouraged the authorities to improve the effectiveness of the
monetary transmission mechanism, through the development of deeper financial markets and
new monetary instruments. Directors called for the implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Plan, to further promote financial deepening and inclusion. They advised
strengthening both domestic and cross-border financial supervisory and regulatory frameworks,
and improving the AML/CFT regime.

Directors agreed that Rwanda’s real exchange rate remains broadly in line with economic
fundamentals, and underscored the need to maintain exchange rate flexibility to reduce external
imbalances and preserve foreign exchange buffers.
Directors welcomed the establishment of the new Debt Management Unit, and supported the
authorities’ plans to develop the country’s project implementation capacity, guided by a
well-prioritized and appropriately phased public investment plan. They noted the authorities’
commitment to fully explore concessional financing options and private sector participation, and
called for careful management of non-concessional borrowing to mitigate rollover risks.
Directors advised the removal of remaining structural impediments to private sector investment,
and encouraged greater regional integration and export diversification. They recommended
improving the business environment, including by lowering business costs and reducing
remaining trade barriers.
