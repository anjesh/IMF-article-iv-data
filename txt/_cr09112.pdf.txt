EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Papua New Guinea is feeling the impact of the global crisis primarily through
collapsing commodity prices. Growth is expected to slow in 2009, and the outlook remains
uncertain. Nevertheless, the positive sentiment associated with the prospective Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) project is spurring domestic demand. Moreover, a sound fiscal position
and a relatively insulated financial sector mean that the economy is better placed than many
to weather the storm.
Main issues: The main challenge is to cope with a rapidly deteriorating external environment
while ensuring that the accumulated mineral windfall is used effectively to support
sustainable growth.
Staff views: Given the external environment, staff endorse some fiscal loosening in 2009,
but are concerned about the magnitude and the quality of public spending. The current
monetary stance is appropriate. However, staff called for policy to react quickly to shifts in
the balance of risks to inflation and growth. The kina appears mildly overvalued and should
be allowed to adjust to help offset the impact of declining commodity prices on export
incomes.
Authorities’ views: There was broad agreement on most issues and the required policy
responses. The authorities stressed that monetary policy needed to remain focused on price
stability given the current outlook. Although they saw merit in allowing the exchange rate to
adjust, they noted that smoothing exchange rate movements was key to anchoring inflation
expectations. On the fiscal front, the authorities were mindful about the importance of
maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability, but pointed to the mounting pressures to
spend some of the accumulated mineral windfall given the country’s development needs.

I. MACROECONOMIC BACKDROP
A. Context
8B

1.
Macroeconomic performance has improved, but Papua New Guinea remains a
poor country highly exposed to commodity price fluctuations. Buoyed by commodity
export revenues, GDP growth performance has improved notably in the last several years.
Until recently, inflation has remained low, thanks to favorable terms-of-trade and improved
macroeconomic management. However, GDP per capita remains low and improvements in
living standards have lagged other low-income countries in the region. An unattractive
investment environment, due primarily to weak infrastructure, problems with governance,
and high crime, constrains more rapid growth of the nonmineral sector. The economy
remains highly vulnerable to swings in commodity prices owing to their importance in both
export and public revenue.

2.
Papua New Guinea experienced high growth and a pick-up in inflation in 2008.
Real GDP grew by 6.5 percent in 2007, on the back of strong growth in the nonmineral
sector (7.3 percent), especially in construction and communications. Leading indicators,
including employment rates and retail sales, suggest that activity continued to expand rapidly
in 2008. After remaining in the low single digits during 2004–07, CPI inflation accelerated in
late-2007, reaching nearly 13.5 percent (y/y) in September 2008. Although this mainly
reflects rising food and energy prices, there are some limited indicators of broad-based
inflation pressures.

The fiscal position had strengthened until recently. In the last few years, the fiscal
balance has consistently overperformed, with the mineral windfall largely saved and public
debt reduced. However, reliance on mineral revenue has increased and the nonmineral deficit
has remained high. For 2008, the estimated fiscal surplus is 4.5 percent of GDP, down from
8 percent in 2007. The projected narrowing of the fiscal surplus in 2008 reflected a large
drop in mineral revenues, which more than offset lower-than-expected development
expenditure. The 2009 budget balance envisages a reversal, turning from surplus into deficit
given the expected drop in mineral revenues and higher planned expenditure.

The policy interest rate was increased during the second half of the year, but
monetary conditions remain accommodative. Since June 2008, the policy rate was
increased four times by a total of 200 basis points, to its current rate of 8 percent. However,
high inflation has reduced real lending rates. Despite some sterilization, the large increase in
foreign reserves through August contributed to an easing in credit conditions. Credit growth
accelerated to 41 percent (y/y) in December 2008 from 34 percent (y/y) at end-2007.

To date, spillovers from the global financial market turmoil have been limited.
Banks are very liquid and largely isolated from international capital markets (Box 1). The

Box 1. The Global Financial Turmoil: The Impact on Papua New Guinea1
The exposure of Papua New Guinea’s financial sector to global financial markets is minimal and
spillovers from the current turmoil have so far been limited. Total financial sector assets represent roughly
85 percent of GDP, with commercial banks dominating the sector. Three large banks hold about 70 percent of
total financial sector assets. The nationally owned Bank of South Pacific is the largest, holding 50 percent of
bank assets.

Banks are not vulnerable to international credit markets developments as their balance sheets are funded
primarily by domestic currency deposits and are highly liquid. Deposits comprise approximately 80 percent
of bank liabilities, with foreign currency deposits representing about 10 percent. About 60 percent of total
banking sector assets are liquid. Lending, which represent 35 percent of bank assets, is directed primarily to the
business sector. While only 1.3 percent of loans are currently classified as non-performing, banks maintain high
provisioning against default.

Until recently, effective exchange rates have remained stable, but commodity
price vulnerability lingers. Both the real and nominal effective exchange rates have been
stable since 2003 through mid-August 2008, while improved terms-of-trade delivered a
sequence of current account surpluses. Preliminary data up to the third quarter of 2008
suggest that the current account surplus widened further, propelled by the global commodity
boom, although this trend may have been reversed during the last quarter of the year with the
decline in commodity export prices. Current account surpluses reduced external debt to about
27 percent of GDP at end-2008. Official foreign exchange reserves rose to US$2.7 billion in
early August, reflecting large commodity-price-related revenue inflows. In the second half of
2008, reserves were drawn down to about US$2 billion resisting depreciation pressures in the
kina/U.S. dollar rate owing to falling commodity prices. Consequently, the real effective
exchange rate has appreciated since August, primarily because of the depreciation in the
Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
1B

7.
In the near-term, the challenge is to cope with a rapidly deteriorating external
environment while ensuring that the accumulated mineral windfall is used effectively to
support sustainable growth. In the medium term, the priority is to strengthen the private
nonmineral sector to help close the development gap with regional peers and reduce external
vulnerability. Accordingly, discussions focused on:
•

managing the accumulated fiscal surpluses ensuring that the mineral windfall is directed
toward achieving more broad-based growth;

•

guarding against persistently high inflation; and

•

assessing financial sector stability.

higher investment. Staff expect inflation to ease quickly, as commodity-price declines feed
through. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) officials noted that domestic price
pressures may add some persistence, despite declining food and energy prices, given the
boost to confidence from the LNG project and increased public spending envisaged in the
2009 budget. 2

Although raising the required capital for the LNG project could be difficult given conditions in global
financial markets, many expect the project to start as proposed, in part because of Exxon’s comments that it is
one of their most attractive prospective projects.

With a final approval for the LNG project not expected until end-2009, it is not included in the staff’s baseline
forecast.

11

9.
There was broad agreement that downside risks dominate, albeit with some
mitigating factors. Given the risk of further deterioration in the global economy, the outlook
remains highly vulnerable to additional weakening in the terms of trade and further softening
in external demand. On the upside, expectations that the LNG project will move forward may
have a larger-than-expected positive impact on domestic demand.
B. Fiscal Policy—Managing Mineral Wealth
1B

10.
Staff commended the authorities for adopting the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
(MTFS) (Box 2).The framework reduces the exposure of the budget to the volatility of
mineral revenues with a rule constraining the nonmineral deficit to be no more than 8 percent
of GDP. The ongoing-spending nonmineral deficit cannot exceed 4 percent of GDP—the
assessed structural ratio of mineral revenue to GDP. However, the strategy also allows for
additional public investment of up to 4 percent of GDP from accumulated past surpluses,
provided it is directed toward achieving Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS)
goals.
Box 2. The New Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
In July 2008, the Government approved a new MTFS for the period 2008–12. Under this
strategy, the nonmineral fiscal deficit is constrained to fall within a range of 4 to 8 percent of
GDP. This range has been chosen based on the following principles:
•

Ongoing spending (including recurrent and development spending) should be kept in
line with “normal revenues”. Normal revenues are defined as the sum of nonmineral
revenues and normal mineral revenues—the mineral revenues that would be expected
without a commodity-price boom, about 4 percent of GDP. Ongoing spending is
limited to the sum of normal mineral revenues and nonmineral revenues.

•

Mineral revenues above 4 percent of GDP should be used for “one-off” expenditures,
debt reduction (30 percent) and additional public investment (70 percent). Amounts
not used for debt reduction accumulate in trust accounts to be drawn down over time.
In any year, no more that 4 percent of GDP can be spent from the trust accounts on
additional public investment.

The estimate of normal mineral revenues is based on the average from the pre-boom years of
1999–2003 and the expected performance in 2010–12 based on planned production and IMF
commodity price forecasts. Every two years, the government will reassess the
appropriateness of the 4 percent of GDP estimate of normal mineral revenues.
11.
The new MTFS will significantly strengthen the fiscal framework, but staff
emphasized that it would benefit from some fine tuning. The framework still contains the
potential for procyclicality by allowing greater investment spending in the event of more
buoyant mineral revenues. To reduce the risk of procyclicality, staff advised that the cyclical

12

position of the economy be used explicitly to determine the amount of excess mineral
revenue to be spent each year. The authorities saw merit in this recommendation.
12.
On the 2009 budget, staff agreed that some fiscal loosening was appropriate
given the external environment, but expressed concerns about the magnitude (Box 3).
Provided inflation eases as expected and spare capacity is available, cyclical conditions could
accommodate increased public investment expenditure. Although the magnitude of the 2009
deficit is expected to fall within MTFS limits, the fiscal stance will be too expansionary
given the cyclical position of the economy and aiming for a balanced budget on staff’s
definition would be more prudent. Further, given the revenue outlook, the level of public
spending in the budget cannot be maintained without undermining debt sustainability.
Box 3. The 2009 Budget
The 2009 fiscal stance is expansionary. The fiscal balance is expected to deteriorate to -2 percent of
GDP from an expected surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting a large drop in mineral
revenues and higher expenditure.
The budget may underestimate the increase in expenditure:1
•

•

First, District Service Improvement Program
(DSIP) expenditure may turn out to be higher. The
2009 budget allocates 356 million kina
(1.8 percent of GDP) to be directed to districts and
provinces and financed with accumulated
surpluses held in trust accounts. This is in addition
to the 890 million kina (4.2 percent of GDP)
allocated in the 2007–08 budgets to the DSIP, of
which only 0.2 percent of GDP had been spent as
of end-September 2008. Given the recent easing
of the constraints on spending from DSIP trust
accounts (i.e., removal of restrictions on type and
timing of expenditures), the total envelope to be
spent under the DSIP could amount to 6 percent of
GDP in 2009.
Second, the budget does not factor in the increase
in the minimum wage introduced in February. The
total increase in the minimum wage is
170 percent. It will be phased in over 40 weeks,
starting mid-February through mid-October.

13.
Staff noted that the use of trust funds in the 2009 budget was not fully consistent
with the MTFS and questioned the efficacy of some planned public spending. A portion
of the allocation of spending to provinces and districts will be financed with accumulated
windfall revenue. Because there are no mechanisms to ensure that these resources will be
directed toward public investment in MTDS priority areas, this is inconsistent with the
MTFS. Given the outlook for commodity prices and thus the limited prospects for additional
windfall revenues in the coming years, staff stressed the importance of safeguarding the
accumulated revenues and using them effectively to achieve development needs.
Additionally, the lack of capacity to prioritize and manage projects, and the near absence of
reporting and accountability in local governments raises concerns about the efficiency of
such spending.
14.
The authorities were mindful about the importance of maintaining mediumterm sustainability, but pointed to political pressures to spend. In particular, the
country’s acute development needs alongside the large accumulated trust funds have
generated demands to visibly increase spending at the local level, hence the increase in
District Service Improvement Program (DSIP) spending. However, given the outlook for
mineral revenues both in the short and the medium term, they acknowledged the risk to fiscal
sustainability, particularly in light of the DSA analysis presented by staff.
15.
Staff advised that continued tax reform would help reduce budgetary
dependence on mineral revenues. Strengthening tax administration and rationalizing
corporate tax incentives would improve nonmineral revenue buoyancy and efficiency. A
number of tax concessions have been granted in the past in many sectors resulting in a
growing list of ad hoc concessions that undermine the tax base. The authorities stressed that
incentives were necessary to stimulate growth, but committed to maintain the current tax
base. In the future, granting tax concessions on an ad hoc basis will be avoided and future tax
concessions will only be granted under the existing laws.
16.
Discussions also focused on the implications for the medium-term fiscal position
of the planned public investment in the LNG project (Box 4). The mission advised that
budget plans be cautious because the government’s financial obligations associated with the
project could put pressure on the country’s debt position. Also, the mission emphasized the
importance of channeling the dividends from the public’s equity stake in the project through
the budget to ensure that they are directed toward addressing development needs.

C. Monetary Policy—Guarding Against Persistently High Inflation
12B

17.
Staff noted that the current monetary stance was appropriate, but underlined
the need for monetary policy to react quickly to changing circumstances. Although
imported inflation will fall rapidly given declining commodity prices, policy needs to ensure
that domestic pressures do not keep inflation too high. In particular, the fiscal stimulus in the
pipeline for 2009 and still rapid credit growth may fuel nontradables inflation going forward.
With real lending rates expected to rise as headline inflation declines, staff advised the
central bank to keep its policy rate on hold until there is more certainty about how domestic
inflation pressures will evolve. However, with risks to inflation assessed as lying on the
downside, staff stressed that the central bank should be prepared to loosen quickly if leading
indicators suggest that domestic demand will slow sharply or the inflation outlook improves.
18.
The authorities agreed broadly with this assessment, although they considered it
unlikely that they would need to loosen monetary policy in the near term. They noted
that domestic capacity is stretched and confidence has been supported by increased certainty
that the LNG project will proceed. In the absence of official data on property prices, they
pointed to anecdotal evidence of rapidly rising real estate prices as an indicator of the extent
of domestic demand pressures. Furthermore, they noted that the magnitude of the planned
fiscal easing and the increase in the minimum wage had the potential to impart significant
domestic inflation pressure.
19.
Staff supported the transfer of part of the government’s trust accounts from
private banks to the BPNG, and encouraged the quick transfer of the remaining
accounts. Private sector credit growth, fueled by strong expansion in deposits, has added to

15

domestic demand and further strained available resources. Staff reasoned that moving the
public trust accounts to the BPNG was a cost-effective means of reducing liquidity and
easing credit growth. 3 The authorities agreed and noted that negotiations to transfer the
remaining trust accounts were ongoing.
F

D. Financial Sector—Coping with the Financial Turmoil
13B

20.
There was agreement that the financial sector is insulated from the direct effects
of the global financial market turmoil. With banks funded primarily via domestic deposits,
the tight conditions in international capital markets are not affecting their liquidity.
21.
Staff and the authorities saw asset quality as the greatest risk to financial
stability. With export incomes expected to decline sharply owing to falling commodity
prices, concerns about debt-servicing capabilities have risen, particularly in light of the rapid
pace of credit growth over the last few years. It was noted that credit expansion has been
largely to banks’ long-term customers, somewhat mitigating these concerns. The authorities
noted that the downturn could slow credit growth as both credit demand and deposit growth
ease. They also reported progress on credit monitoring, including the establishment of the
credit and data bureau that provides data to inform credit decisions. Regarding staff’s
concerns that the recent revival of the Development Bank could see funds directed by
political interests generating hidden fiscal liabilities, the authorities noted that the
Development Bank has remained both small and profitable.
22.
To date, the superannuation funds have weathered the turmoil well. Despite
significant holdings of mining, oil, and other equities that have dropped substantially in
value, these funds were still expecting positive returns in 2008. This reflects continued strong
performance of other domestic investments, particularly real estate.
23.
Staff reiterated that the level of financial intermediation remains very low
relative to peers—a constraint on private nonmineral sector growth. Credit to the private
sector represents less than 20 percent of GDP, largely due to structural rigidities, including
weak enforcement of contracts and credit rights. The authorities concurred and hoped that the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), tentatively scheduled for late-2009, would
provide impetus for reform. They also confirmed their willingness to undertake a selfassessment of the financial sector prior to the FSAP.

The government’s trust accounts are an inexpensive source of funds for the banks as interest of only 1 percent
is paid on these deposits.

16

E. Assessing the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and External Stability
14B

24.
In line with the recent deterioration in the terms of trade, staff estimates suggest
mild overvaluation of the kina (Box 5). The mission encouraged the authorities to continue
to shift toward greater exchange rate flexibility. Allowing the currency to adjust in response
to the sharp decline in commodity prices would help offset the impact on export incomes and
safeguard foreign reserves. The authorities acknowledged the benefits of allowing the
exchange rate to adjust given the decline in commodities prices. However, they noted that
given the extraordinary global volatility and high domestic inflation, slowing exchange rate
adjustment was key to anchoring inflation expectations.
25.
External debt has decreased, but negative terms-of-trade shocks and
uncertainties about other liabilities raise concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability.
Large current account surpluses in recent years and the early repayment of debt have resulted
in a significant improvement in the external debt position. External debt declined to about
27 percent of GDP in 2008. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that the risk of debt
distress is moderate (Appendix 1). 4 However, the scale of broader public-sector obligations
(i.e., borrowing and guarantees associated with the LNG project, the large unfunded pension
liability, the uncertain magnitudes of state-owned-enterprise debt, and the government’s
commitments under the memorandum of agreement with landowners) combined with
vulnerability to deteriorations in the terms of trade suggests that highly unfavorable debt
dynamics could arise.
F

Alternative scenarios include the LNG-project scenario and other liabilities.

17

Box 5. Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate1
Staff estimates points to evidence of mild overvaluation. According to the macro balance
(MB) estimates the kina is broadly in line with fundamentals.2 The medium-term estimate of
overvaluation implied by the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach is 16 percent.
The decomposition of the point estimates into time-varying contributions of the explanatory
variables points to demographic factors and trade oil surpluses as the main determinants of
the equilibrium current account under the MB approach, while the change in the terms of
trade is the key factor in determining the equilibrium exchange rate.

F. Fostering Sustainable, Broad-Based Growth
15B

26.
The implementation of structural reforms has slowed. The Medium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS), spanning 2005–10, has correctly recognized the need to shift
the sources of growth toward the private nonmineral sector. The strategy stresses the
importance of increasing exports of

However, decisive actions have been
lacking, with the exception of the communication sector. The government plans to undertake
a review of the development strategy in late 2009. The extraordinary improvements in
communication services, following the introduction of competition in the cellular phone
market, illustrate the benefits of continued reform.
27.
The authorities agreed with this assessment. They noted that the political
commitment toward accelerating these reforms has been minimal because focus has been
almost entirely directed toward the LNG project.
28.
Staff underscored that the prospective LNG project could provide a permanent
boost to GDP growth, provided the resulting revenues and dividends were directed
toward addressing development needs. The mineral sector operates as an “enclave” with
limited direct spillovers to other sectors. The key linkage to the nonmineral sector of the
economy is via revenues to the public budget. Therefore, while it is crucial to directly
encourage private activity in the nonmineral industries, nonmineral sector growth will
continue to be influenced by growth in the mineral sector and the effective use of the
resulting public resources. If the LNG project goes forward, it will result in a large, one-time
increase in the level of GDP once production commences. Without significant progress on
the reform front, GDP growth will revert to trend in the following years. To permanently
raise long-term growth in the nonmineral sector, the resulting revenues and public ownership
proceeds must be channeled through the budget and directed toward effectively addressing
development needs.
29.
The mission stressed that notable improvements to public service delivery and
the private investment climate were central to addressing developments needs.
Enforcing contracts, dealing with licenses, and obtaining credit are relatively more
cumbersome compared to other countries in the region, according to the World Bank ease-of-

19

doing-business database. Further, security issues continue to be a significant barrier to private
sector activity.
G. Other Issues
16B

30.
There has been only limited progress on improving the quality and timeliness of
macroeconomic data. The authorities reported that the department of National Planning and
Monitoring, currently responsible for the National Statistic Office (NSO), has been unwilling
to transfer the compilation and dissemination of economic statistics from the NSO to the
BPNG, as advised by the December 2007 STA mission. Staff reiterated that intensive efforts
are needed to address shortcomings in the quality and timeliness of the macroeconomic data.
The authorities agreed, but offered no indication of when or how the impasse might be
resolved.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
2B

31.
Papua New Guinea was in a relatively favorable position at the onset of the
global financial crisis. Windfall mineral revenues had been largely saved. Large current
account surpluses and the early repayment of public debt had improved the external debt
position. Exchange rate flexibility had increased and the banking system had only limited
exposure to global financial markets.
32.
Yet, the deterioration in international economic conditions is having an impact,
albeit milder than in many other countries. The global slowdown is taking its toll mainly
through lower export revenues, owing to the collapse in commodity prices, worsening both
domestic and external balances. However, despite the highly synchronized nature of the
global downturn, some idiosyncratic factors such as the prospective LNG project and the
relative insulation of the banks from global financial markets are buffering the impact on
Papua New Guinea.
33.
The monetary stance is appropriate, but caution is needed moving ahead.
Despite the decline in food and energy prices, there are risks that domestic price pressures
could prevent a rapid decline in inflation. However, with the balance of risks to inflation on
the downside because of the deteriorating external environment, the central bank should be
prepared to loosen quickly if a larger-than expected negative domestic impact materializes.
34.
The new Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy, if fully implemented, will help maintain
macroeconomic stability. Insulating recurrent spending from abnormal fluctuations in
mineral revenues will facilitate both public and private planning and help guard against
procyclical fiscal policy. However, macroeconomic stability would be enhanced if the
monetary and fiscal authorities cooperated to ensure that the cyclical position of the economy
determined the magnitude of annual spending from trust accounts.

20

35.
A looser fiscal policy seems warranted in 2009, but concerns remain about the
magnitude and the quality of spending. Although inflation is forecast to moderate over
2009, capacity pressures could still keep it uncomfortably high. Therefore, to ensure that
public demand does not stimulate inflation, it would be prudent to reduce public spending in
2009 so as to achieve a balanced budget by staff definition. In addition, should the planned
level of expenditure be maintained over the medium term, fiscal sustainability will be
threatened. Moreover, with acute capacity constraints and almost no oversight or
accountability mechanism in place, the expected increase in spending at the district level
raises concern about achieving appropriate value for money.
36.
More discipline is needed in spending the mineral windfall accumulated over the
last few years. The windfall should be safeguarded and directed toward achieving the
Medium-Term Development Strategy objectives and be available to support growth should
the impact of the global slowdown be larger than expected.
37.
Indicators suggest that the currency is mildly overvalued. Given the sharp decline
in commodity prices, the currency should be allowed to adjust to help offset the impact on
export incomes. This policy would also help to safeguard foreign currency reserves.
38.
The financial sector has been relatively immune to the global financial crisis.
With banks funded primarily via domestic deposits, the tight conditions in international
capital markets are not affecting their liquidity. However, the impact of declining commodity
prices on export incomes could stress debt-servicing capabilities, driving up nonperforming
loans. Therefore, banks should maintain strict lending standards and monitor borrowers’
servicing abilities carefully.
39.
The pace of structural reform must accelerate. To make meaningful progress
toward achieving development objectives, the public-sector reform program on health,
education, and law and order needs to be reinvigorated. Complete transparency of the
financial conditions of state-owned enterprises and full transfer of their returns to general
government revenue will be necessary to ensure that the government has the resources to
implement the reform agenda. If the LNG project proceeds, to permanently raise long-term
growth in the nonmineral sector, the resulting revenues and public ownership proceeds must
be channeled through the budget and directed toward effectively addressing development
needs.
40.
Macroeconomic data needs to improve. The government must press ahead with
Fund recommendations on the compilation and dissemination of economic data as they form
the cornerstone for sound macroeconomic policy.
41.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Table 8. Papua New Guinea: Authorities’ Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice 1/
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Stand ready to
tighten monetary policy given the expectation of a
looser fiscal stance.

The policy interest was increased during the second
half of year 2008. To better control liquidity part of the
funds in trust accounts held at private banks has been
transferred to the BPNG

The exchange rate should be allowed to move flexibly
as needed, should upward pressure be sustained or
downward pressure unexpectedly materialize.

Exchange rate daily volatility has increased since
2007. However, reserves have been drawn down to
resist depreciation pressures in kina-U.S. dollar cross
rate.

Fiscal Policy: A new proposal to update the medium
term fiscal strategy (MTFS) should be approved to
replace the current policy under the existing MTFS.

The new MTFS was approved in July 2008.

Containing the actual cash expenditure to more
sustainable and stable levels, while ensuring that
windfall revenue is used for well-designed MTDSprioritized spending and debt reduction.

Windfall revenue has been partly used to early
repayment of debt. However, spending at the
provincial and district level has been allocated outside
the MTDS priority areas.

Proposals to increase public borrowing to fund largescale investment projects are a concern.

Public borrowing has increased to fund the LNG
project.

The resumption of public sector reform plans is
urgently needed to help improve implementation
capacity, and strengthen monitoring, accountability,
and transparency.

Progress has been limited and it appears to lack
political will.

Financial Sector Policy: Need to overcome the
underlying structural rigidities that are constraining
development, including weak enforcement of contracts
and creditor rights.

Progress has been slow, although some actions have
been made on improving credit monitoring, including
the establishment of the credit and data bureau that
provides data to inform credit decisions. The
authorities have requested an FSAP that is tentatively
scheduled for the fall of 2009.

The revived development bank should not engage in
expensive borrowing and expansion into microfinance
should comply with due diligence and commercial
criteria.

The development bank has remained very small and
profitable.

Structural Reforms: Broader reforms are necessary
to lift medium-term growth by boosting productivity,
and to strengthen international competitiveness and
resilience to external shocks.

Progress has been disappointing.

Intensive efforts to improve macroeconomic statistics
to address shortcomings in the quality, coverage and
timeliness of macroeconomic data.

Limited progress has been made in improving the
quality of macroeconomic data, with the exception of
the bop data where progress has been substantial.

APPENDIX I: PAPUA NEW GUINEA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
3B

I. INTRODUCTION
Papua New Guinea has made significant progress in reducing its public debt burden.
However, Papua New Guinea still remains at moderate risk of external debt distress over the
medium and long term. External debt burden indicators on public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt are below their indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, but
some indicators would breach their thresholds if the terms of trade deteriorates further or
LNG project related contingent liabilities are materialized. 1 Compared to the 2007 Article IV
DSA, given the change in the global outlook, this analysis shows that Papua New Guinea
exhibits more vulnerability to external shocks. The inclusion of domestic debt as well as
several contingent liabilities also shows risks to long-run fiscal sustainability. Box 1
summarizes the macroeconomic framework underlying the baseline analysis.

II. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 2
5B

F

The public sector debt has been declining over the past 7 years (Table 1) from about
71½ percent in 2002 to under 34 percent of GDP in 2007. This improvement reflects prudent
fiscal policy, favorable terms of trade, appreciation of the kina against the U.S. dollar, lower
interest rates, and sustained economic growth since 2003. The public external debt also
declined from the peak of over 50 percent of GDP in 2001 to below 17 percent at end-2007. 3
External debt to multilateral institutions accounts for about 65 percent of public external
debt, with Japan as the main bilateral creditor. Private sector external debt is estimated at
about 14 percent of GDP at end-2007.
F

F

The baseline scenario envisages a gradual increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio in
the medium term.4 It reflects the additional financing needs on the external side, mainly due
to the sharp deterioration of the terms of trade and corresponding current account. However,
all debt burden indicators remain well below the thresholds and are expected to decline in the
long run. On the domestic side, the expectation of continued prudent fiscal policy and
1

Papua New Guinea is rated as a weak performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMFWB low-income country DSA framework. Consequently, the applicable thresholds for this category to external
public debt are: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of debt-toexports ratio, 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio,
and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
2

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

3

By end-2008, it is estimated that public debt declined further to about 26½ percent of GDP with public
external debt about 12 percent.

4

Baseline scenario does not include the LNG project.

30

favorable debt dynamics are expected to help the public domestic debt burden continue to
decline in the medium and long term. In sum, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
peak at 30 percent in the medium term, then gradually decline to 22½ percent in the long run.
The standard alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected debt
path is particularly sensitive to changes in real GDP growth and further deterioration
of terms of trade (Table 2 and Figure 2). A shock to real GDP growth during 2009–10,
equal to the historical average of GDP growth rate minus one standard deviation, would
bring the present value (PV) of the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 71 percent in 2028. This
highlights the need to manage expenditures prudently, while protecting priority spending, in
the event of a growth slowdown. Further deterioration of the terms of trade would also bring
the public debt burden to the alarming level, as discussed more detail below.

Borrowings by SOEs are also estimated
to be significant and growing, although information is limited. 7 Other contingent liabilities
arising from the government’s commitments under the memorandum of agreement with
landowners are also reported to be significant and the government needs to pay some
liabilities in near future to allow the LNG project to move forward.
F

5

Only unfunded pension liabilities are included in Table 1 since other liabilities are all Fund staff estimates.

6

These liabilities are arising from the issue of exchangeable bonds to finance the state’s equity participation (in
2009) and the state’s completion guarantee for debt financing (by 2013).Under this scheme, the creditor
acquires exchangeable bonds, amounting to US$1.1 billion, with the option to exchange the bonds for equities
in the Oil Search company. If the share price remains below this strike price, the state will have to pay to the
creditor the difference between the market price and the face value of the bond. Under the completion
guarantee, if the project fails, the government will have to pay up to US$2 billion to the creditor.

7

Preliminary estimates for SOE related contingent liabilities, based on end-2007 financial statements of nine
SOEs, are about 2.5 percent of GDP when we consider borrowings, various provisions, and other liabilities.
However, there is no information on the off-balance sheet liabilities which also may be significant.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6B

All PPG external debt and debt service indicators remain below the policy-dependent
debt burden thresholds under the baseline scenario. However, a country-specific scenario
indicates the vulnerability of the external debt sustainability if the terms of trade deteriorates
further in the medium term. The main results of the external DSA are as follows:
•

The debt burden indicators in the baseline scenario are expected to increase in
the medium term before declining in the long run (Table 3). Additional financing
needs arising from the deterioration of the terms of trade and corresponding current
account would raise the PV of PPG external debt over GDP from below 11 percent in
2008 to 12 percent in the medium term, which is still well below the 30 percent of
threshold. The PVs of PPG external debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios are
also expected to increase accordingly in the medium term, but still well below the
indicative threshold levels.

•

The debt burden is expected to increase under the various standard stress tests,
but all debt burden indicators remain below their indicative thresholds (Table 4
and Figure 1). Alternative scenarios with key variables at their historical averages in
2008–28 show a reduction of the debt burden because of the current account
surpluses and FDI inflows in recent commodity booming years. 8
F

•

8

A country-specific scenario shows
that the external debt sustainability
would be vulnerable to the terms of
trade shock. If export prices decline
further, by 20 percent compared to the
January 2009 WEO price assumption
for 2009–13, the PV of external PPG
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to breach
the 30 percent threshold in the medium
term, due to the deterioration of current
account and corresponding additional

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
•

Real GDP growth is projected to be at around 3.8 percent in the near term and then
slow to about 2½ percent in the medium and long term—above the recent historical
average of 2 percent. Moderate growth in the nonmineral sector, including in
agriculture, and the several mining projects coming on stream will offset a steady
decline in petroleum and copper production. However, the large Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG) project under consideration is not incorporated in the baseline scenario.

•

Inflation is projected to peak in 2008 because of the rise in food and energy prices
until July, and subsequently stabilize at around 2 percent in the long run.

•

The current account surplus (including grants) will turn into a deficit in the near and
medium term, primarily reflecting continued strong growth of capital imports related
to investment projects as well as the impact of global economic slowdown.

•

The grant element of loans is expected to decline. As per capita income rises, the
share of external financing provided on concessional terms is expected to decline
gradually over the projection period.1

•

The fiscal balance is projected to turn into a deficit in 2009 and to remain in deficit
over the medium term, due to falling mineral revenues and the spending of preceding
years’ mineral windfall revenues. The deficit is expected to be financed by a run down
of resources held in trust accounts.

__________________________
1

Grant element of new public borrowing increases slightly in the near term, before it declines in the long
run, due to the relatively large disbursement commitment from the AsDB in the pipeline.

The following text table summarizes Papua New Guinea’s indicative thresholds, actual 2007
ratios, and average debt ratio dynamics in the medium and long term under the baseline
scenario.

9

Considering that PNG currently has comfortable level of reserves, we assume that additional financing needs
would be filled by additional concessional external borrowings and the use of reserves. However, if the import
coverage of reserves falls below 3 months, we assume that all financing needs should be filled by additional
external borrowings.

IV. CONCLUSION
Papua New Guinea still remains at moderate risk of external debt distress over the
medium term. Though external PPG debt burden indicators are well below their indicative
thresholds under the baseline scenario, the projected PPG debt paths point to a significant
vulnerability against the terms of trade shock and slower economic growth. The inclusion of
the liabilities arising from several sources raises concerns about long-term fiscal
sustainability.
Continued prudent management of debt over the medium and long term will be
required to mitigate the risks to public debt sustainability. The staff encourages the
authorities to build on recent steps and move forward to strengthen debt management
capacity.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [i - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with i = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) was
subject to a transitional assessment based on its Stand By Arrangement (SBY) with the Fund,
which was approved in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment
was completed on May 4, 2001 and made recommendations to alleviate identified weaknesses.
Currently, the BPNG is not subject to the safeguards policy.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Papua New Guinea has a floating exchange rate arrangement; the exchange rate of the kina is
determined in the interbank market in which authorized banks participate. Papua New Guinea
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held during November 1–14, 2007. It was
concluded by the Executive Board on February 15, 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/98).
Papua New Guinea is on the 12–month cycle.
X.

Technical Assistance from Headquarters:

FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in
October 2000. A mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large
and volatile differences in fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Treasury
Department and information reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A mission in
February 2002 assessed progress in improving fiscal transparency.
LEG: A mission in November 1996 provided advice on the legal framework for the National
Value-Added Tax. A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax
administration law. A mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance
in the development of the AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity
building. A mission in August/September 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms
of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: A mission in November 2001 reviewed foreign exchange management. A mission
in June 2001 assessed the monetary policy implementation framework. During 2001–03
assistance was provided through missions in bank supervision, financial sector restructuring and
improving the accounting framework and monetary operations of the central bank. A resident
advisor was assigned to the BPNG research department for 15 months through August 2003.
Technical assistance through peripatetic visits was delivered on bank regulation and supervision
(2001–February/March 2007), medium-term monetary policy formulation (October 2004 and
September 2005), reserve management (June 2006–September 2007), internal audits (2004–
August 2007), accounting (September/October 2006–February 2007), and liquidity management
(January 2009).
STA: Four missions in 1995–96 provided advice on the compilation of national accounts. A
mission reviewed monetary and financial statistics in April 2005 and to follow-up missions
took place in May 2006, and in April 2008. Subsequently, a multisector mission visited in
September 2006 followed by a high level STA mission in December 2007.

ANNEX II: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE 1
(As of October 27, 2008)
Until the Resident Representative position was closed in May 2008, the resident
representative helped coordinating TA assistance to Papua New Guinea (PNG), with the
extensive assistance provided by the Australian Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP).
Since 2000, PFTAC has provided more than 24 missions to PNG, and the Government has
sent over 50 officials to the Centre’s regional seminars, workshops, and training courses in
this period.
Public Financial Management
PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The
PFTAC PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and
an attachment of one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. PNG
participated, with four officials, in the US Treasury study visit in September 2008.
Tax Administration and Policy
The IMF Legal Department drafted a Tax Administration Act in 2005, adopted by the
Government in 2006, that: (i) the re-established the Internal Revenue Commission as an
independent tax authority; and (ii) included customs administrative provisions. An IMF
Legal Department mission in September 2007 prepared the Internal Revenue Commission
Administration Bill 2007 to strengthen and consolidate all revenue administrative provisions
into one statute. It is expected that the new law will shortly be passed by the Parliament.
PFTAC has delivered a project to: objectively assess the existing IT system of the Internal
Revenue Commission and; develop and draft an information technology strategic plan (ITSP)
and: based on the ITSP, draft a business plan for the redevelopment of the IT system. The
project comprised of six missions over the period June 2006 to May 2008 and delivered the
following:
• An assessment of the current and future business drivers.
• Development of the business system architecture for the ITSP.
• Completion of the applications, information and IT technical architecture phases of the
ITSP project.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Korea, Japan
and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Development of a business case to fund redevelopment of the Internal Revenue
Commission (IRC) technology system, that is suitable for presentation and decision
making by the Government of PNG and other potential donor organisations.

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area, as technical assistance is provided by
MCM, but the Advisor visited BPNG in September 2004 and July 2005 to identify areas
where technical assistance could be provided. In October 2005, the BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC
is the secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from
BPNG to assist the Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination
of a domestic bank. In 2008, PFTAC funded an attachment of one supervisor to assist the
Reserve Bank of Fiji under an on-site examination of a local branch of a PNG-based bank.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, the Advisor briefly assessed the BOP compilation with a view to improve
its quality, and to assess progress against recommendations made by previous missions. A
multi-sector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP,
national accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics and monetary statistics),
with the PFTAC Advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination.
The BOP expert provided some TA to progress improvements to the methodology and source
data. In June 2008 the Advisor undertook a balance of payment (BOP) statistics mission to
Papua New Guinea (PNG) to review statistics prerequisites, progress in improving
compilation methods and source data, as well as to assist Bank of PNG statistics staff in
assessing the feasibility of electronic data collection.

ANNEX III: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP

(As of February 5, 2009)
The World Bank Group has a long history of engagement in Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG
formally became a member of the World Bank upon gaining independence in 1975 but had been
a recipient of loans from the World Bank since 1968. To date, the World Bank has provided PNG
with 36 IBRD loans totaling US$786.6 million and 16 IDA credits totaling US$195.0 million in
commitments.
The Bank’s relationship with the Government of PNG in 2003–06 was uneven as a result of a
suspension and later cancellation of the Forestry Conservation Project. Between 2003 and 2006
the World Bank did not approve any loans or credits for PNG and focused instead on analytical
and outreach activities.
Following a significant improvement in political stability, macroeconomic performance and
general relationship with the Government, the Bank, in close consultation with the Government,
prepared in 2007 a full four-year CAS, which was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors on
December 18, 2007. The FY08–11 CAS is designed to launch a long-term partnership between
the Bank and PNG aimed at supporting sound management of economy and natural resources,
and addressing immediate livelihood and service delivery needs of the poor people, while also
building a foundation for tackling longer-term institutional and accountability challenges.
Empowering women and youth and strengthening governance have been prioritized as crosscutting themes.
Under the FY08–11 CAS, the World Bank provides PNG with concessional financial resources
on the order of US$40 million per year 2 and assists the country in accessing global and regional
grant funds such as Global Environmental Facility. In accordance with the Strategy, the Bank has
already approved a Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (US$27.5 million; approved by
the Board in December 2007) and Second Mining Sector Institutional Strengthening Project
(US$17.0 million; approved in June 2008). Together with the Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project totaling US$40.0 million in IBRD and US$37.3 million in IDA
commitments, these projects represent the World Bank’s current credit portfolio in PNG. In
addition to the loan and credits, the Bank is also currently implementing a Global Environment
Facility-supported Teachers’ Solar Lighting Project (US$0.99 million) and the regional
Sustainable Energy Financing Project, which covers also PNG.
In line with PNG’s medium-term debt strategy which envisions limiting external public
borrowing primarily to concessional terms and using mineral windfall revenue for early
repayment of more expensive debt, in late 2007 the Government pre-paid seven IBRD loans
totaling US$56 million. As a result, PNG’s debt outstanding to the World Bank as end2

PNG is formally a blend IBRD-IDA country. However, PNG’s debt strategy does not provide for nonconcessional borrowing and no immediate IBRD lending to PNG is therefore envisioned.

7
December, 2009 stood at US$229.6 million compared to over US$321.5 million at the end of
2006. In December 2008, the Government made an additional prepayment of four more IBRD
loans totaling about US$15 million.
The pipeline of the World Bank projects under preparation is rapidly expanding under the FY08–
11 CAS. Currently four projects are being prepared: Productive Partnership in Agriculture
(focusing on coffee and cocoa sub-sectors), Rural Service Delivery and Local Governance
(focusing on small community-level development projects), Urban Youth Empowerment (aiming
at expanding opportunities for urban youth) and Rural Telecommunications (which will create a
fund to roll out telecommunications services to uneconomic areas). The Bank is also moving
forward with mobilizing global grant resources for PNG, in particular through the Fast Track
Initiative for Education. Two more projects—Rural Electrification and Health—are at the
concept stage.
The Bank’s analytical work and technical assistance include economic monitoring and reporting,
dialogue with the Government as part of the programmatic Public Expenditure Review and
Rationalization process, and support to the nationally representative Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (jointly with AusAID). The Bank is also assisting the Government in
preparing a Climate Change Strategy. The Bank’s support to civil society has consisted of two
rounds of the Development Marketplace-type Youth Competition (in 2006 and 2008) which
provided small grants to promising grassroots development project. The Bank has also been
involved in a number of community outreach activities through its Global Development Learning
Network and Public Information Center. As part of its strengthening commitment to PNG, the
Bank has also expanded the staff of its Port Moresby office.
The Bank’s private sector arm, International Financial Corporation, has also strengthened the
level of its engagement in PNG over the past few years. IFC’s Advisory Services—Pacific (IFC
AS Pacific) established a full-time presence in PNG in early 2006, co-located with the World
Bank. Since then IFC advisory service activity in PNG has increased considerably, with a focus
on access to finance, tourism, the business environment, and infrastructure.
Within these programs IFC AS Pacific is working to: improve the capacity of commercial banks
to provide credit; increase the availability of finance and financial services for the poor, including
investment in PNG Microfinance; assist in building financial infrastructure, including
establishment of a credit referral bureau; improve the business environment by working on a subset of the Doing Business indicators, in collaboration with the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service; strengthen the tourism sector; improve agribusiness production, quality, supply chains
and marketing; and explore—jointly with the Bank—opportunities to support growth in the
commercial fisheries sector, including enabling work on a special economic zone to host regional
tuna processing.
The IFC’s current investment portfolio in PNG consists of a US$1.2 million equity commitment
to PNG Microfinance Limited, of which US$756 thousand has already been disbursed, giving the
IFC a 19 percent shareholding in the bank. The equity investment is supported by a US$2 million
institutional capacity building program presently under implementation. The IFC has also

8
provided Digicel PNG Ltd with a US$40 million line of credit to support the roll-out of its
national mobile telephony network, and a US$44 million line of credit to global agribusiness
company ECOM Ltd. for coffee supply chain improvement across 6 countries, including PNG. In
addition, the IFC is tracking investment opportunities in agribusiness, gas and mining,
infrastructure, and forestry.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided one guarantee in PNG. The
guarantee worth US$76.6 million in gross exposure covers a portion of equity investment and a
loan by a syndicate of commercial lending institutions for the Lihir open-pit gold mine. The
guarantee facilitated several hundred million US$ in foreign investment in PNG.

ANNEX IV: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 3
(As of February 4, 2009)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved 63 loans to Papua New Guinea (PNG)
totaling $1,127 million for 48 projects, of which 26 loans ($558 million) have been extended
from ordinary capital resources (OCR) while 37 loans ($569 million) from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF). AsDB also provided one ADF grant amounting $15 million. In
addition, technical assistance (TA) grants ($54.4 million) have been provided for 137 TA
projects. There are currently 9 active loans and grant involving 6 projects and one ADF grantfinanced project.
In 2008, the AsDB approved a Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program of
$100 million loan from ADF resources. Four TA projects totaling $3.0 million were approved for
the Power Sector Development project, the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development
project, National Transport Development Plan (2011-2020), and support for development
planning.
A Country Program Strategy Mid-Term Review in December 2008 confirmed the rationale and
validity of the Country Strategy and Program for 2006–2010, which focuses on four key strategic
areas including (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector development, (iii) the
transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, the AsDB also sees the potential to
broaden its infrastructure support in general, and is prepared to support the development of power
sector and civil aviation in PNG. The AsDB is of the view that increased development
investment is essential to reduce poverty in PNG, where infrastructure investment is much
needed and many people lack access to basic services. The AsDB stands ready to expand its
current lending program in line with the Government's Medium Term Development Strategy.
As a key feature of the AsDB’s work in PNG, the AsDB continued close cooperation with
development partners through Government-led processes to increase aid effectiveness.
Furthermore, consistent with the AsDB’s managing for development results action plan to
improve its effectiveness in reducing poverty and promoting development in the Asia and Pacific
region, the AsDB supports the government’s work to develop its own results-management
framework and adopts the government’s performance targets and indicators in the preparation of
the country operations and business plan for PNG.
Through its private sector operations, the AsDB has made investments in two private equity
funds—Kula Fund I and Kula Fund II Limited—aggregating to $8 million, that provided
assistance to enterprises in the AsDB’s Pacific developing member countries, including PNG. In
addition, the AsDB assisted the Government to prepare its Public Private Partnership (PPP)
policy, which was approved by the National Executive Council (NEC) in late 2008. The AsDB
will provide further support in the next phase of PPP policy implementation, for: (i) legislation
and regulations; (ii) establishing a PPP Center; and (iii) consolidating a national infrastructure list

for possible PPP application. The AsDB also funded an assessment of the current market,
technology and regulatory environment for mobile banking in PNG.

ANNEX V: PAPUA NEW GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of February 18, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, fiscal accounts, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The National Statistical Office (NSO) lacks sufficient staff with computer training. The
accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. The Bank of Papua New Guinea
(BPNG) and the Department of Treasury produce the most current data. In mid-2000, the NSO released a set of
national accounts estimates: National Income, Expenditure and Product, 1993–98. These estimates were
compiled using the 1968 System of National Accounts. However, the NSO has been working to implement the
1993 SNA. In March 2004, the NSO released a preliminary set of national income, expenditure, and production
accounts estimates for 1994–2002, rebased to 1998 prices. As these figures are still in need of substantial
improvements, the 2006 STA multisector mission recommended against publication of the new GDP data until
the needed revisions are made. In an attempt to fill the vacuum, the Treasury—responsible for Government
finance statistics (GFS)—has actually assumed the role of estimating the NA for 2002 to the present.
Price statistics: The NSO currently compiles a new quarterly wholesale price index (which it does not publish)
and a quarterly consumer price index that is based on weights that are thirty fine years old. The NSO intends to
use the results of the planned Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) to rebase the CPI; however, this
has been delayed for a long time.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS reported to STA suffer from insufficient coverage. While central
government tax revenue statistics are generally accurate and timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure data
are deficient. In particular, development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are
recorded with long lags, and few records on the use of accrual trust accounts are available. While interest
payment records are accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of interest on discount securities.
These weaknesses contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt
data and those derived from fiscal records. The 2006 STA multisector mission encouraged the authorities to
prepare a list of public sector units to permit a comprehensive delineation of the levels of government, which
should help reconcile the GFS with other datasets.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are now being produced on a regular basis and reporting to STA has
improved. Three monetary and financial statistics missions (April 2005, May 2006, and April 2008) visited
Papua New Guinea which helped to (i) finalize the review of the collection, compilation, and dissemination
procedures of monetary statistics by the BPNG; (ii) develop a work program to facilitate the full
implementation of the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM);
(iii) prepare the standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data of the central bank, other
depository corporations, and monetary aggregates; and (iv) finalize the integrated monetary database that meets
the data needs of the BPNG, STA, and APD. Due to the importance of the other financial corporations (OFCs),
a follow-up mission is scheduled for early 2009 to introduce the SRF for the OFCs based on the newly
introduced call report forms to obtain balance-sheet data and compile a financial corporations survey.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments data are derived from the International Transactions
Reporting System (ITRS), which is not tightly monitored despite the BPNG reporting requirements. There are
marked differences between the official data on exports and imports of goods and those reported by trading
partners. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in data collection,
especially in the areas of private external debt. Quarterly data are also published by the BPNG. The 2006 STA
multisector mission identified as a priority to strengthen current account estimates, including through improved
classification of investment earnings, trade credits, and grant receipts as well as enhancing source data for
imports and exports. Progress is being made to implement the recommendations from the PFTAC’s BOP
mission in June 2008. Detailed BOP statistics are under review to be released in the near future.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Papua
New Guinea
On March 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea. 1
Background
Macroeconomic performance has improved, but Papua New Guinea remains a poor country
highly exposed to commodity price fluctuations. GDP per capita remains low and improvement
has lagged other low-income countries in the region. An unattractive investment environment,
due primarily to weak infrastructure, problems with and governance, and high crime curtails
development.
Real GDP grew by 6.5 percent in 2007, on the back of strong growth in the nonmineral sector.
Leading indicators suggest that activity continued to expand rapidly in 2008. After remaining in
the low single digits during 2004–07, CPI inflation accelerated in late-2007, reaching nearly
13.5 percent (year-on-year) in September 2008.
In response to rising inflation the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has increased the policy
interest rate during the second half of 2008. However, monetary conditions remain
accommodative as rising inflation has reduced real lending rates. In the last few years, the fiscal
balance has been in surplus, with the mineral windfall largely saved and public debt reduced.
For 2008, the estimated fiscal surplus is 4½ percent of GDP, down from 8 percent in 2007.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
To date, spillovers from the global financial market turmoil have been limited. Banks are very
liquid and largely isolated from international capital markets. However, the stock market has
weakened since its peak in June, in line with other stock markets in the region.
Both the real and nominal effective exchange rates were stable between 2003 and mid-August
2008, but have appreciated since then. Improved terms-of-trade delivered a sequence of
current account surpluses that reduced external debt to about 27 percent of GDP at end-2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Papua New Guinea was in a relatively favorable position at the
onset of the global financial crisis. In particular, they commended the authorities for saving the
bulk of recent windfall mineral revenues and repaying public debt to improve the external debt
position. Directors noted that, while the banking system has only limited exposure to global
financial markets, the deterioration in international economic conditions is having an impact.
Owing to the collapse in commodity prices, lower export revenues are worsening both domestic
and external balances.
Directors agreed that the current prudent monetary stance is appropriate. Despite the decline in
food and energy prices, the authorities are paying due regard to risks that domestic price
pressures could prevent a rapid decline in inflation. Given the downside risks to inflation
associated with the deteriorating external environment, Directors considered it important to
monitor developments closely and to be prepared to ease monetary policy if the domestic
impact turns out more negative than expected.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ policy of slowing exchange rate depreciation to
moderate inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, and noting the staff’s assessment that the kina
is mildly overvalued, they were generally of the view that the currency should be allowed to
adjust to the sharp decline in commodity prices. This would help offset the impact on export
incomes, safeguard foreign currency reserves, and help preserve external stability.
Directors welcomed the new Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy, observing that its full
implementation will help maintain macroeconomic stability by reducing the risks associated with
volatile mineral revenue. To enhance macroeconomic stability further, Directors encouraged the
monetary and fiscal authorities to cooperate so as to ensure that the cyclical position of the
economy determines the amount of spending from accumulated windfall revenues. Directors
stressed that windfall revenues should be directed toward achieving the Medium-Term
Development Strategy objectives and to support growth should the impact of the global
slowdown be larger than expected.
Directors agreed that some easing in fiscal policy is warranted in 2009. Given domestic capacity
constraints, in particular at the district level where a substantial increase in spending is planned,
they nevertheless encouraged the authorities to adopt a less expansionary policy stance than
envisaged and to protect the quality of public spending through careful prioritization. This would
ensure that public demand does not stimulate inflation, and help maintain the level of public
spending at a level consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability.

3
Directors noted that the financial sector has been relatively immune to the global financial crisis.
The strains in international capital markets are not affecting liquidity because banks are funded
primarily via domestic deposits. Given the impact of declining commodity prices on incomes,
Directors encouraged the authorities to ensure that banks maintain strict lending standards and
carefully monitor debt-servicing abilities and non-performing loans. They supported the
authorities’ request for an Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite the pace of structural reform. To make
progress on development objectives, they pointed to the need to reinvigorate public-sector
reform programs in health, education, and law enforcement. Directors stressed that greater
transparency of the financial conditions of state-owned enterprises and full transfer of their
returns to general government revenue are desirable to ensure that the government has
adequate resources to implement the reform agenda.
Given the importance of high quality and timely data for policy making, Directors stressed the
need to press ahead with the improvement of economic statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Alternate Executive Director for Papua New Guinea
March 16, 2009

Papua New Guinea’s recent economic history has been one of sustained growth and stability,
underpinned by a favourable external environment – in particular, high prices for its
commodity exports – sound domestic policy settings, and progress on important structural
reforms. The global financial crisis, and the associated sharp downturn in global activity,
clearly poses significant policy challenges for the authorities, while last year also saw a
pickup in inflationary pressures associated with higher food and energy prices, demand
pressures associated with a major resource development, and strong growth in bank liquidity,
while monetary policy settings have been tightened in response. On the fiscal side, the
authorities have chosen to use a portion of the earlier accumulated savings from the
commodity price boom to buttress domestic demand and improve the provision of services
and infrastructure essential to enhancing the productive capacity of the economy and
addressing development needs.
GDP growth is expected to remain robust in 2009, if somewhat more subdued than the very
strong performance of the last two years. The continued strength of activity in the mining and
agricultural sectors is expected to offset declines in the petroleum sector, while structural
reforms in telecommunications are expected to sustain growth in the non-mining sector,
albeit below the unprecedented levels of recent years. The coming year should see a
continuation of solid growth, albeit at a lower rate than the 7.2% achieved in 2008. There is
also some evidence of an easing in inflationary pressures, with measures of underlying trend
inflation showing some moderation through the June and September 2008 quarters. While the
external current account is expected to shift into deficit in 2009, holdings of international
reserves are expected to remain high, at around five months import cover according to Fund
estimates. Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledge the need for policy settings to remain
responsive to the significant downside risks associated with the deteriorating global
environment.
PNG continues to face daunting development challenges, compounded by the nation’s
impenetrable geography and ethnic and cultural diversity – with over 800 spoken languages,
PNG is the most linguistically complex country in the world. This inevitably influences the
political economy of reform. Indeed, the re-election of the Somare Government in 2007 for a
second five-year term represents a period of political stability unprecedented in recent PNG
history. In the area of economic policy, it has facilitated the adoption of significantly
improved medium-term policy frameworks relating in particular to fiscal policy and
development strategy.

2
Fiscal Policy
The 2009 Budget is the first to be delivered following the Government’s endorsement of a
refined Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) for the period 2008-2012. The MTFS: limits
ongoing expenditure in line with ‘normal revenues’, defined as non-mineral revenues plus
mineral revenues equal to 4% of GDP (based on assumptions regarding long run price levels
for Papua New Guinea’s commodity exports); requires that additional mineral revenues
above this norm be used to fund public investment projects (70%) and repay debt (30%); and
caps the actual level of public investment expenditure sourced from additional revenue in any
given year to 4% of GDP, with the remainder to be saved. Also, under the Fiscal
Responsibility Act (2006), the Government can not increase the level of net public sector
debt.
In his budget speech, the Minister for Treasury and Finance underscored the importance the
authorities attach to this framework, both as a tool for stable and responsible macroeconomic
management and as a benchmark for preserving PNG’s policy credibility in the eyes of
international investors and donors. The authorities will therefore give careful consideration
to staff’s recommendation that the Framework be fine-tuned to take explicit account of the
cyclical position of the economy in determining the excess mineral revenue to be spent in
any year.
Nonetheless, the existing Framework has required that the 2009 budget be framed in the
context of significant declines in the level of budgeted revenues, and the absence of any
‘additional revenue’, as a result of sizeable falls in export prices for Papua New Guinea’s
major commodities. Within these constraints, the authorities have sought to allow for
increased funding of key development priorities, focused on transforming the rural sector
into a major driver of sustainable growth, and to support domestic demand in the face of
increasing global uncertainties. In this connection, the authorities agree with staff that the key
development challenge relates to unlocking the potential of the non-mineral sector.
Development spending will be guided by the priorities set out in the Medium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS), which targets an increasing share (82.7% in 2009) of overall
development funding to seven priority areas: primary and preventive health care; HIV/AIDS
prevention; basic education; development-oriented adult education; transport; promotion of
income-earning opportunities; and law and justice. The authorities are committed to
addressing administrative and capacity constraints which have hitherto resulted in shortfalls
against the MTDS’s annual targets. And they consider the significant increase in funding for
the District Services Improvement Program (DSIP) will help overcome endemic
administrative and other capacity constraints which, in the past, have undermined community
level service provision in PNG’s eighty-nine districts.

3
In the minerals sector, the authorities consider that the public equity investment in the
proposed major LNG project, scheduled to come on line in late 2013, will ensure that the
public interest is appropriately reflected in the development of a significant national resource.
They fully concur with staff’s observations regarding the importance of making sure that the
returns to the public sector are used effectively to foster a broader-based, sustainable
development.
This approach is also more broadly consistent with the authorities’ adoption of a PublicPrivate Partnership (PPP) approach to shaping the public sector’s role in the provision of
both economic and social goods. The Asian Development Bank has been assisting the
authorities in the development of an appropriate PPP framework.
With regard to the immediate future, the authorities acknowledge staff’s concerns regarding
the sustainability of budgeted spending, in particular regarding the implications for debt
sustainability, and fully concur with the need to monitor developments carefully, and if
necessary to adjust the budgetary stance at the time of the midyear review. They have
expressed interest in further dialogue with Fund staff at that time on this issue.
Looking to medium term, institutional reforms have been initiated in the area of tax
administration, focused on building the capacity for a more risk-based approach to auditing
and enforcement activities, alongside more decentralised revenue collection arrangements
involving the creation of provincial revenue offices. The authorities are exploring options for
utilising technical assistance for this through PFTAC.
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
The staff’s recommendation regarding the stance of monetary policy and, in particular, the
potential need for the Bank of PNG to be prepared to loosen quickly if leading indicators
suggest domestic demand, and inflationary pressures easing more than expected, has been
noted by the authorities. However, they remain inclined to caution on this front.
While there is evidence that the earlier impact of high global food and energy prices on
domestic inflation eased through the latter half of 2008, domestic inflation pressures remain
high. The monetary authorities considered it appropriate to progressively raise the Kina
Facility Rate by 200 basis points, to 8% by December 2008, which will see real interest rates
return to positive territory over the next few months in line with the forecast decline in
inflation to around 6%.
This represented a response to continued strong growth in bank liquidity and credit. It also
reflected an awareness of the potential for the preparatory activity, and related confidence
effects associated with the proposed major LNG project referred to above to underpin
domestic inflationary pressures. Looking forward, the current expansionary fiscal policy

4
stance, and the impact of the recently-approved increase in the minimum wage (of 170% to
be phased in over 40 weeks commencing in mid-February), together with, more generally,
evidence of rapid employment growth and skilled labor shortages in the formal sector, all
also argue for close monitoring of inflationary pressures.
The authorities are continuing to progress arrangements to consolidate the public sector trust
accounts – many of which are currently held in the private banking system – at the Bank of
PNG. They agree with staff that this offers a cost-effective way of removing excess liquidity
from the system.
As noted in the staff report, the real effective exchange rate appreciated over the last year,
initially driven by the earlier positive terms of trade shock. More recently, the Bank of PNG
has sought to lean against subsequent depreciation pressures, in order to moderate the impact
on inflation and inflationary expectations. This approach reflects the importance of imports
in PNG’s consumer basket and doubts about the relative effectiveness of other monetary
policy transmission mechanisms. The optimal pace and size of this exchange rate adjustment,
however, have been the subject of debate within PNG. The authorities are very conscious of
the collapse in the terms of trade and the risks that the exchange rate not adjusting would
pose for competitiveness, domestic incomes and tax revenues and, ultimately, for the buildup of imbalances which would precipitate a disorderly adjustment. The points made by staff
regarding the need to allow the exchange rate to adjust in response to commodity price
movements, and to preserve the level of international reserves in these uncertain times, are
therefore well taken and will be given careful consideration.
The Financial System
As noted by staff, PNG’s financial system has been relatively unaffected by the recent global
turmoil. The major banks are well-capitalised with relatively strong credit books and limited
direct exposure to global markets. Similarly, the superannuation funds have continued to
show positive investment returns. In both cases, this reflects to some extent the relatively
undeveloped nature of PNG’s financial sector (and in the case of superannuation funds,
recent very strong domestic property returns). The authorities agree that this remains a
longer term weakness in terms of enhancing potential growth and development. They also
acknowledge the potential for the current global turmoil to negatively affect the PNG
financial system indirectly through the downside risks to trade and the real sector. It is in this
context that they continue to express their interest in participating in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) later this year.
Other Matters
Implementation of the institutional changes previously suggested in addressing the need to
improve the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic data has proven problematic.

5
However, the authorities appreciate that this remains a very serious issue for the Fund, and
for the quality of policy-making more generally, and one that must be dealt with. They will
continue to engage candidly and constructively to explore practical options which can be
pursued.
Finally, on this and on all other issues discussed during the consultation, my authorities
would like to express their appreciation for the professionalism, technical expertise and
candor that Mr. Hunt and his team brought to the table. They have indicated their agreement
to publishing PNG’s 2008 Article IV Report and Selected Issues papers.
