INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
URUGUAY
Staff Report for 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés and Dominique Desruelle
January 12, 2011
Context: Uruguay’s economy is booming with vigorous growth in domestic demand and
exports. Unemployment is at record lows, some sectors experience labor shortages, and
inflationary pressures are rising, but there are signs of moderation of economic activity. In
the context of economy-wide wage negotiations and the budget discussion, political tension
has risen.
Main issues: The most immediate macroeconomic policy challenge is to ensure conditions
for a smooth transition to more sustainable growth rates and reinforce the economy’s
resilience to spillovers from global and regional shocks. The medium term challenge is to
secure rapid growth with less volatility than in the past. These challenges call for calibrating
macroeconomic policies to moderate domestic demand and build policy space to cope with
future shocks, and for reforms to tackle infrastructure gaps and labor market shortcomings.
Staff welcomed the increase in the monetary policy rate in September and the recently
approved budget for 2010–14. Staff supported the budget’s focus on reducing public debt, its
broad spending priorities, and the creation of a fund to shield the budget from droughtinduced costs in the electricity production. Given the outlook and risks, staff recommended a
more conservative fiscal policy with slower growth in fiscal spending in 2011–15, cautioned
against cutting the top VAT rate in the near term, and thought further normalization of the
policy rate was warranted to bring inflation to the mid-point of the official target range.
Discussions also covered macro-prudential responses to support fiscal and monetary policy,
ideas to enhance the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks further, and reforms to improve
the prospects for medium-term growth with lower vulnerability.
Fund relations: (Supplement 1) Uruguay and the Fund have excellent relations. There is a
long shared view on broad macroeconomic policy priorities. In recent consultations views
have differed slightly on the pace of the withdrawal of policy stimuli with the Fund favoring
a somewhat more rapid adjustment and more emphasis on reducing inflation.
Mission: A staff team comprising U. Erickson von Allmen (head), M. Rosales, H. Zavarce,
S. Acosta-Ormaechea (all WHD), T. Wezel (MCM), visited Montevideo November 29–
December 13, 2010. M. Gonzalez (Resident Representative) and N. Melgar (the Resident
Representative office) assisted the mission. Mr. Valdés (WHD) joined the last part of the
mission. Mr. Vogel (OED) participated in the discussions.

I. A BOOMING ECONOMY
1.
Uruguay’s recent economic growth performance has been very strong, capping a
remarkable recovery from the country’s crisis in 2002. This recovery has been
accompanied in a mutually reinforcing way by significant improvements in public and
private sector balance sheets. Large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have spurred
big productivity improvements, notably in agriculture, and Uruguay has managed to recover
almost all of the output loss (vis-à-vis trend) in about seven years after the crisis.

Though not immune to the global
crisis when it hit emerging markets in 2009,
Uruguay’s rebound has been quick and
strong. A contraction in output in the first
quarter of 2009 has been followed by six
quarters of growth (Figures 1–6). Although
Uruguay avoided a contraction in annual GDP
in 2009, the deceleration in growth was
nonetheless significant (from 8.5 percent in
2008 to 2.9 in 2009).

The resilience to the global crisis and the quick recovery reflects several factors:1



Growth momentum: Uruguay entered the global crisis with significant momentum.



Policy credibility: Stead-fast implementation of reforms and prudent policies across
governments has generated confidence in Uruguay’s policy management.

For analyses of emerging markets’ performance in the crisis, see How Did Emerging Markets Cope in the
Crisis, and The Global Financial Crisis: Explaining Cross-Country Differences in the Output Impact, Berkmen
et al., (IMF WP/09/280).

4


Strong and improving fundamentals: Years of sizeable primary surpluses and
proactive debt management (Annex 1) that have helped to reduce sharply the public
debt (a legacy of the 2002 crisis), a strengthened monetary policy framework in the
context of a floating exchange rate, substantial international reserves at the Banco
Central del Uruguay (BCU), significant improvements in financial sector regulation
and supervision, declining (though still high) bank dollarization, little leverage in the
economy, and a very liquid and capitalized banking system.



And good fortune: Low global interest rates, high commodity prices, and strong
growth in partner countries provided a very supportive environment. Also, the
comparatively underdeveloped capital market muted the impact of the global crisis.

4.
In 2010 the economy fired on all cylinders with vigorous growth in domestic
demand and exports, and inflationary pressures have risen. The recovery in private

experiencing shortages, in particular for skilled labor, that have been aggravated by recent
strikes. Headline inflation was 6.9 percent in December, close to the upper end of the current
inflation band, despite administrative measures (including delayed adjustment of some tariffs
and a temporary freeze on health insurance fees) to contain prices. Staff’s estimate of core
inflation (which excludes some food items and administratively set prices) has edged up to
7.7 percent. Growth decelerated in the third quarter of 2010 (to 1 percent q/q, s.a.) despite
continued strong domestic demand. Staff projects GDP growth at 8–8½ percent for 2010 as a
whole.

Domestic demand has been underpinned by fiscal and monetary policy, but a
gradual shift toward more neutral began in the latter part of the year.

The authorities have put aside US$150 million (equal to 0.4 percent of GDP) of UTE’s profits in an Energy
Stabilization Fund. The accumulation of resources in the ESF is currently treated as spending, in line with the
authorities’ accounting. When the guidelines for how the ESF will be used become more concrete, the proper
recording of the ESF should also be considered, something the authorities agreed with.

Box 1. Uruguay: De-dollarization Trends
Uruguay has experienced a marked decline
in banking sector dollarization since the
2002 crisis. In December 2002—October 2010,
deposit and credit dollarization decreased by
15 and 24 percentage points, respectively. In
the first ten months of 2010, de-dollarization of
credits declined by two percentage points and
of deposits by half percentage point.

Sources: Banco Central del Uruguay and IMF staff calculations
the following factors as important: exchange
rate appreciation and volatility, prudential measures relating to currency risk, the development of the
domestic financial market, and the extension of the yield curve in domestic currency.1/ In Uruguay, in
recent years the authorities have introduced prudential regulations to encourage de-dollarization in the
banking system, e.g., higher reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits; larger capital
requirements for foreign currency loans; limits on banks’ foreign currency exposures, and tighter loan
provisions for lending in foreign currency to consumers and large corporations. Since March 2009, the

Uruguay has so far bucked the typical pattern of booming domestic demand
causing an external current account deterioration. Indeed, the current account surplus
increased in the first half of 2010 (to 1.2 percent of projected 2010 GDP), owing to buoyant
exports, resilient terms of trade, and a bumper tourism season (mostly regional). The strong
exports, reflecting impressive productivity gains in the agricultural sector, in particular, are
expected to continue but at a more moderate pace. Nonetheless, a surge in consumer imports
is underway (+34 percent in January–November, 2010, y/y) and the current account started to
shift to a small deficit in the second half of 2010.

7
7.
Not surprisingly, with ample global liquidity and booming domestic demand and
exports, the currency has appreciated. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by
17 percent between August 2009 (the last Article IV) and June 2010, while the BCU
intervened and bought US$1.4 billion in foreign exchange. In June, concerned about the rapid
appreciation, the Ministry of Finance announced it would take an active role in intervention
and sterilization which caused an immediate 10 percent depreciation. After clarifications that
there is no exchange rate target and that the overriding goal for monetary policy is price
stability—later reinforced by the September policy rate increase—the peso has strengthened
somewhat against the dollar and also in real effective terms with less active intervention
(US$0.5 billion in June–December). The government has taken advantage of external inflows
to repay external debt and de-dollarize the public debt and thus absorb some of their impact.
The state-owned Banco República has also made foreign exchange purchases to this end.

Still, Uruguay’s external position remains strong. Though the picture is somewhat
more mixed than at the time of the 2009 Article IV Consultation—when staff considered the
real effective exchange rate in line with its equilibrium—the strength of the currency appears
commensurate with Uruguay’s position in the

economic cycle and not out of line with longrun fundamentals (Box 2). Importantly, the
floating exchange rate, the current account
surplus, the booming export volume growth,
the ample international reserves, and the
declining external debt mitigate external
stability risks. Since last July, Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch have raised their ratings of
Uruguay’s sovereign external debt to two
notches below investment grade and Moody’s
to one below.

Macro-financial vulnerabilities remain low at this time despite the international
volatility. Banks rely on deposit funding, maintain substantial liquidity cushions, and carry
little leverage. Though on declining trend, capital adequacy ratios still exceed the regulatory
minimum (8 percent) by a wide margin and compliance is ensured even under the strong
shocks in the BCU’s stress tests.3 Overall loan-loss provisions stand at about six times the
historically low level of non-performing loans, partly reflecting the dynamic provisioning.
Despite a significant presence of Spanish banks, funding pressures faced by the parent banks
have not spilled over to Uruguay, in part because the authorities decided to limit the exposure
of the subsidiaries to the parent banks. On December 6, Scotia Bank (Canada) announced it
intends to buy Nuevo Banco Commercial, one of the largest private banks. Specific
remaining vulnerabilities relate to the high but declining share (31 percent) of credit in
foreign currency to the non-tradable sector (primarily households) and the trend decline in
banks’ profitability. To strengthen systemic supervision the authorities are creating a
Financial Risk Committee.

and the slow growth in the labor force, addressing
infrastructure gaps and enhancing the skills of the labor force will be needed to sustain rapid
growth. The government’s policy agenda reflects these priorities.
12.

There are seemingly conflicting risks to this outlook.



Overheating: The most immediate risk is that the pace of domestic demand does not
abate as envisaged, because of delayed recalibration of the policy stance, or additional
impetus from the expansion in global liquidity and higher commodity prices, or both,
causing higher inflation, more appreciation, and a sharper deterioration in the current
account—raising the risk of an abrupt end to the boom.



Worse international outlook: A worse global or regional outlook would affect
Uruguay primarily via lower FDI and export volumes and prices (Figure 6). Effects
from volatility in sovereign bond markets would be limited in the short term, at least,
by Uruguay’s modest external financing needs and BCU’s ample reserves. The
banking sector’s ownership links to Spain could be a conduit for transmitting shocks
to Uruguay, though, as mentioned, there a number of mitigating factors.

13.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the outlook and risks, but were
more worried about spillovers from global or regional volatility. They saw the economy
adjusting to a sustainable pace without the need for further policy actions at this stage.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions focused on how to secure a soft landing and how to achieve
strong growth over the medium term with less volatility than in the past. Uruguay has a
history of high output volatility, which can cause abrupt fluctuations in unemployment and
poverty and undermine long-term investment. Countries with similar characteristics (small
and open, commodity dependent, some dollarized) have achieved important reductions in
output volatility. Although Uruguay’s volatility is likely to have fallen in recent years, thanks

11
to the changes in the economic framework, including the floating exchange rate, highfrequency data show still higher output volatility in Uruguay than in comparator countries
(but, interestingly, much less volatility in inflation).4

The budget targets primary surpluses of 2.0–2.2 percent of GDP in 2011–14 to
reduce the public debt to about 40 percent of GDP in 2015 (60 percent at end-2009).
Since the budget was based on conservative GDP assumptions for 2010, achieving these
results should be feasible despite the sluggish revenue observed in 2010. Still, there are
downside risks on the revenue side—including from a weakening in the performance of the
state-owned fuel import and distribution company, ANCAP, (higher oil prices, delayed tariff
adjustments), and the effects of tax exemptions.
16.
In staff’s view, more conservative fiscal results would be feasible and warranted
to secure a soft landing and reduce the debt faster. Staff estimates a small positive fiscal
impulse in 2011, a year in which

less reliant on performance of public enterprises.6 Given the importance of infrastructure
investment for growth, it would be preferable for such a further slowdown in spending
growth to focus on central government current expenditure (the wage bill and transfers rise in
the budget by 0.6 percentage points of GDP between 2010 and 2014). Staff also encouraged
the authorities to save eventual cyclical revenue over-performance. The authorities
considered the fiscal stance appropriate to achieve a sound and sustainable economic path as
projected. They saw the wage bill growth as key to rectify pay imbalances in certain sectors
and to strengthen public services like education and security.

The authorities intend to cut the top VAT rate but staff cautioned that the
timing does not seem propitious given the strong domestic demand. The authorities noted
that the reduction in the VAT would be in the context of a significant increase in revenue
administration efficiency and reduction in tax evasion and that it would not put the fiscal
objectives at risk. Staff worried about adding more fuel to domestic demand and noted that a
two percentage point cut in the top rate, as was discussed, would cause a revenue loss equal
to 0.7 percent of GDP if applied across the board. This loss would be difficult to offset by
efficiency gains, in the short run at least, especially since efficiency is already quite high and
tax evasion low (see below).

An increase in government expenditure by 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with an appreciation of the
real exchange rate by 1–2½ percent (World Economic Outlook, October 2010, and Regional Economic
Outlook—Western Hemisphere, Spring 2010).

13
above official targets, and the policy rate barely positive in real ex ante terms call for further
normalization of the monetary policy stance. Staff suggested that aiming more clearly for the
middle of the inflation target range (5 percent) would create more space for countercyclical
monetary policy in the event growth falters. Stability in the target and the band is important
for the inflation target’s role as an anchor for expectations. The authorities broadly concurred
and emphasized their commitment to the inflation targets, noting that the center of the target
has been stable.

Uruguay will likely continue to see strong external inflows and appreciation
pressures. Most of the inflows reflect the current account surplus and FDI but there is also
growing demand for local currency assets, reflected in the fall in local-currency bond yields.
Capital inflows will strengthen as Uruguay moves toward investment grade—which many
observers see happening within two years—and its local capital markets develop. The
challenge is to harness capital flows into productive investments, rather than into
consumption or real estate, and to this end advancing on the PPP agenda can help.

Staff and the authorities agreed on the importance of maintaining a flexible
exchange rate. Given the BCU comfortable reserves, further foreign exchange intervention
could be limited. Staff suggested that intervention be subordinated to the inflation target. If
appreciation pressures intensify, staff suggested that reducing domestic demand via a further
deceleration in government spending be considered. There is also a case for considering
relaxing further the limits on investments abroad for pension funds.7 A macro-prudential
response could help contain credit growth if the rapid expansion gains too much strength.
The authorities indicated that they would respond to continued inflows with a combination of
exchange rate flexibility, debt management, and intervention aimed at reducing volatility.
21.
A well-functioning labor market and prudent wage agreements are essential to
maintain a dynamic economy, keep inflation in check, and avoid erosion in export
competitiveness. The rising labor conflicts are a concern since they disrupt production and
can deter needed investments. Staff highlighted the importance of a labor market that
provides protection without hindering the needed factor reallocation. Staff supports the
government’s recent guidelines to add a link to productivity growth in the wage setting
framework for the private sector (starting in 2010).
Medium Term
22.
The budget for 2010–14 includes improvements to the fiscal framework. In
particular: the anchoring of the budget in a declining gross public debt and the creation of the
Energy Stabilization Fund. Staff and the authorities discussed how some aspects of the fiscal
framework could be enhanced further.

Pension funds can invest up to 15 percent of their assets in foreign bonds issued by multilaterals, but they are



The budget. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to develop and publish cyclicallyadjusted fiscal balances. To strengthen the budget framework further staff encouraged
consideration of a more transparent process for mid-year spending adjustments.



Public-Private Partnerships. Staff supports the government’s plans to use PPPs to
help address infrastructure gaps (Box 3). The authorities have received TA from the
World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs
Department. Staff underscored the importance of maintaining a fair balance of risks
between the government and the private sector, establishing limits on the stock and
flows of the PPP-related liabilities, and ensuring their proper and transparent
recording. Staff welcomed that the draft PPP law includes strong safeguards with a
key role for the Ministry of Finance in due diligence and assessment of fiscal risks.
The authorities agreed on the importance of transparency and are also considering
limits on PPP-related liabilities.

23.
With respect to the monetary policy framework, staff welcomed the BCU’s
strategic plan for 2010–14 and reiterated the importance of improving communications.
The plan touches all aspects of the BCU’s activities and includes an ambitious agenda to
improve the analytical work on monetary policy. Staff suggested that, in particular, more
active and substantive communication by the BCU—at the time of monetary policy decisions
and in the quarterly monetary policy report—of the inflation forecast and risks, and how the
BCU sees inflation reaching the official targets would help guide inflation expectations and
strengthen the transmission mechanism. The BCU plans to strengthen its communications,
but also noted that it will be important to have more robust projections of inflation.
24.
The recapitalization of the BCU is welcome but some of the modalities could
make it insufficient. The recapitalization (October 31, 2010) involves US$2.4 billion worth
of government inflation-indexed bonds: US$1.9 billion in perpetual bonds at 3 percent real
interest to cover the BCU’s operational deficit and US$486 million in 30-year-maturity
bonds at 3.5 percent real interest rate. Staff noted two concerns with the recapitalization.
First, although the BCU is allowed to use the 30-year bond as collateral in repo operations,
this may not be feasible since the bonds are not allowed to be traded in the secondary market.
Second, the recapitalization does not seem to include any real cash flow to the BCU since the
coupon on the bonds will be paid with 30-year bonds (with the same limitations as above).
The authorities noted staff’s concern and would consider if further changes were needed.
25.
Enhancing BCU’s credibility further would strengthen the monetary policy
framework, make it easier to bring down inflation, and reinforce de-dollarization. Staff
suggested that one practical way would be to make clearer the different roles of the BCU’s
Monetary Policy Committee (which recommends monetary policy decisions to the BCU
board) and the Macroeconomic Coordination Committee (a space for macroeconomic

16
coordination and where the authorities set the inflation target) where the Ministry of Finance
is also represented, but which many observers see as the real monetary policy decision body.
To this end, a clearer distinction could be made in public communications on monetary
policy decisions (as was the case in the December press release) and by delinking their
meetings (which is common in international practice). The authorities stressed that the BCU
exercises operational independence and they thought the current set up worked well.
Box 3. Uruguay: Public Investment and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs)
Public investment in Uruguay is low by international standards, especially when considering the
large role played by the public sector in the economy. The 2010–14 budget include an increase in
public investment to around 3.5 percent of
Public Investment
GDP on average in 2010–14, but this is still
(In percent of GDP, average 2005–09)

below regional levels. To supplement public
5
investment, the government plans to expand
the use of PPPs.1/ PPPs are long term
4
contracts under which a private firm
finances, builds, maintains, and/or operates
3
infrastructure that provides public services.
2
The main weaknesses of PPP relate to
contingent liabilities and risks, and the more

needed.

The following factors are typically seen as
important to reduce the risks with PPPs:

Source: IMF staff calculations.

1.

A solid institutional framework (including a PPP Law) for the whole PPP process.

2.

Trained teams to evaluate PPPs carefully, especially at the Ministry of Finance (MEF).

3.

A competitive bidding process to help maximize benefits and reduce costs.

4.

A model of risk transfers and sharing with the private sector.

5.

A rigorous system for accounting and reporting all PPP liabilities.

6.

A limit on the liabilities from PPP. The liabilities should be counted as public debt.

The Corporación Nacional para el Desarrollo is responsible for promoting and managing the PPPs in
Uruguay, while the MEF has responsibility for due diligence and fiscal risk analysis.
_______________
1/ Uruguay has experienced with PPPs. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the government granted more
than ten PPP concessions for toll roads, port terminals, airports, gas distribution, and water networks.
Most of them are still operated by the private sector, but several are now operated by the public sector.

17
26.
Bank soundness is good, even by the upcoming Basel III standards, but the
profitability remains lackluster notwithstanding low delinquency and recovering credit
growth.


Capital adequacy: Banks’ common equity (i.e., core Tier 1 capital, or subscribed
capital and stock of retained earnings) as a share of assets is well above the minimum
required rate of 4.5 percent under the future Basel III regulations. Capital Equity
consists exclusively of Tier 1 capital.



Macro-prudential: The overall regulatory regime is in line with international best
practices, with many measures on credit risk and foreign exchange exposures in
place. Uruguay is a pioneer in dynamic loan-loss provisioning, but given the very
high provision for NPLs, a review of the parameters of this scheme seems warranted.
The authorities noted that they would take this into consideration. Staff supports the
creation of a Financial Risk Committee to focus on systemic risk. Credit
intermediation is still low (20 percent of GDP) so some trend increase is welcome;
however, the strong growth in consumer credit, in particular from less-regulated
nonbank institutions, warrants tight supervision. Some of those nonbank institutions
that operate without prudential control may have to be brought within the regulatory
perimeter. Staff and the authorities also discussed how macro-prudential framework
can help keep the incipient credit expansion from turning into a full-fledged credit
boom. The authorities follow developments closely and stand ready to adjust the
framework if needed. They noted that changing reserve requirements is a tried and
tested tool to control liquidity and they stand ready to use this instrument again, but
they did not see a need at this time.



Profits: Despite strong growth, a recovery in credit, and record low nonperforming
loans, the majority of private banks continued to incur losses in 2010, while the

Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to develop the small local capital market.
The authorities are mindful that the lack of a developed and globally integrated capital
market helped Uruguay avoid the more nasty

Staff supports the initiatives to foster investment and productivity growth.
Uruguay ranks 64 out of 139 in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Report 2010–11 and 124 out of 183 in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2011. Key
weaknesses relate to rigidities in the labor market, limited local market competition, onerous
business regulations, and infrastructure shortcomings (e.g., railroads and relating to foreign
trade). The government’s agenda tackles many of the weaknesses.


Business environment. Last May the government launched the “Enterprise in a day”
which reduces significantly the time it takes to start a business.



Infrastructure. The government’s infrastructure program focuses on improving the
electricity supply, modernizing the railroad and port infrastructure (including through
PPPs), and facilitating trade through customs reform.



Public sector. The Reform of the State agenda is underway. It includes a pilot
program for performance-based budgeting in 2011, supported by TA from the Fund.
Staff suggested that the planned Inter-American Development Bank/World Bank
public expenditure review will provide an opportunity to explore how to make the
public more efficient.

29.
The authorities’ are making efforts and considerable progress toward meeting
international tax standards. They have signed seven bilateral agreements and five more are
underway (12 agreements is a threshold for being considered by the OECD to have
“substantially implemented the tax standard”). Also, on December 15, 2010, Parliament
approved a law allowing bank secrecy to be lifted in response to requests for information for
tax purposes (as per the bilateral agreements). Uruguay has also made significant progress in
strengthening AML/CFT, including with TA from the Fund’s Legal Department.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Uruguay’s growth performance since the country’s own crisis in 2002 has been
very strong. Domestic and external factors have contributed to this economic revival, not
least the implementation of major reforms (e.g., to financial regulations and supervision, and
the tax system) and prudent macroeconomic policies across administrations.
31.
The outlook for the coming years is good, but with challenges. The most
immediate challenge is to secure a soft landing of the economy in the context of ample global
liquidity, low interest rates, and high commodity prices. At the same time, there is a risk of
spillovers from a worse global or regional outlook. The medium-term macroeconomic
challenge is to sustain rapid growth with less volatility than in the past.
32.
The macroeconomic policy requirements to deal with these challenges go in the
same direction. They involve fiscal and monetary policies to temper domestic demand
growth to help steer the economy away from a boom/bust path and create policy space (lower
debt and inflation) to respond to future shocks. Given the full employment for skilled labor
and slow growth in the labor force, sustaining growth at 4 percent over the longer term is
feasible but will require efforts to overcome gaps in infrastructure and in the skills of the
labor force. The government’s policy agenda reflects these challenges and priorities.
33.
The budget for 2010–14 includes many important improvements. Notably, the
focus on reducing the public debt while increasing spending on infrastructure, education,
security, and social program, and the creation of the Energy Stabilization Fund. Staff
supports the efforts to get a better handle on the costs of tax exemptions, which risk
undermining the impressive gains in tax efficiency in recent years. The plan to publish
cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances will help improve the budget framework and fiscal policy.
Staff suggests more transparent mechanisms for intra-year changes in the budget.
34.
The budget seeks to sustain the fiscal improvement in 2010, but even more
ambitious fiscal targets for 2011–14 would be feasible and desirable. The fiscal position
is robust. But more conservative fiscal targets for 2011–14 would better support a soft
landing, reduce appreciation pressures, and achieve a faster reduction in the public debt. The
fiscal impulse is admittedly difficult to calculate with precision, but this uncertainty together
with the state of the cycle and the risks to the outlook reinforce the case to err on the side of
caution. This would also include saving cyclical revenue over-performance. Staff cautions
against cutting the VAT in the near term. Of course, if growth falters, the more ambitious
fiscal targets should be reconsidered so as to allow automatic stabilizers to operate.
35.
The increase in the monetary policy rate last September was a welcome step but
a continued tightening is warranted in light of the inflationary pressures. Strong
domestic demand and the risk of inflation expectations becoming stuck above official targets
call for a continued measured normalization of the monetary stance. The narrowing of the
inflation target band in late 2009 was a welcome signal of commitment to inflation but it also
raised the stakes for the BCU. Staff suggests that the BCU aim for the middle of the inflation

20
target range to ensure space for countercyclical responses. Further, stability in the target band
is important for the targets to serve as an anchor for expectations. Finally, staff would caution
against using administrative measures to contain inflation.
36.
The recapitalization of the BCU is welcome although two design features could
be improved: ensuring sufficient real cash flow to the BCU and allowing the 30 year bonds
to be traded in the secondary market.
37.
There is scope to strengthen the monetary policy framework and its credibility
further. A practical step would be to separate clearly the Monetary Policy Committee from
the Macroeconomic Coordination Committee in public communications and by de-linking
their meeting schedules. The BCU can also strengthen its influence over inflation and
inflation expectations through improved communication of the inflation outlook and risks,
and how it sees inflation reaching the official targets.
38.
Staff supports the flexible exchange rate and does not consider the real effective
exchange rate to be out of line with long-run fundamentals. The BCU’s level of
international reserves is comfortable and further intervention can be limited and subordinated
to the inflation target. Continued pro-active debt management is a good way to absorb capital
inflows to improve the public debt structure. A further slowdown in government expenditure
would be appropriate if appreciation pressures intensify. And the limits on investments
abroad for pension funds could be relaxed.
39.
A well-functioning labor market with prudent wage agreements is essential for
maintaining a vibrant economy and avoiding erosion in competitiveness. The reform to
take into account sectoral productivity growth in the wage setting framework for the private
sector is a welcome step forward.
40.
There are no major vulnerabilities in the financial system at this time. Banks are
well-capitalized and highly liquid, and nonperforming loans are at record low. Staff
welcomes the extension of the limits on banks’ credits to their parent banks and the creation
of a Financial Risk Committee to monitor systemic risks. Banks’ low profitability remains a
concern and calls for efforts to strengthen productivity in the sector. In supervision, the
design of the loan-loss provisioning system may need to be modified given the persistently
high provisioning of impaired loans. The growing lending by nonbank financial institutions
warrants close supervision. Staff welcomes the authorities’ readiness to adapt the macroprudential framework as needed to contain credit growth if the rapid expansion continues
unabated.
41.
Staff welcomes the initiatives to boost long-term growth prospects including via
PPPs. It will be important for the PPP framework to ensure an appropriate balance of risk
between the private and public sector, establish limits on the liabilities generated by the
PPPs, and ensure their appropriate reporting.
42.

Staff proposes that Uruguay remain on the 12-month Article IV cycle.

ANNEX 1. URUGUAY’S EXPERIENCE WITH PROACTIVE DEBT MANAGEMENT
1.
The origin. One consequence of the 2002 financial crisis was a rise in the
indebtedness of the public sector from 40 percent of GDP in 2000 to 107 percent in 2002 as a
result of the large fall in output, the currency depreciation, the fiscal cost of rescuing the
banking system, and the substantial fiscal deficits. The increase in debt created sizeable debt
service payments and financing requirements over the subsequent five years.
2.
The response. The government tackled the debt and financing challenges through
actions on several fronts. In addition to major fiscal adjustment, in 2003 the government
completed a comprehensive, voluntary debt exchange (which included all foreign currency
denominated bonds) that helped smooth the 2003–05 financing needs. Financial support from
the Fund and other international institutions also helped overcome the large financing
requirements. And in December 2005, the government created a Debt Management Unit in
the Ministry of Finance that has undertaken proactive debt management operations.
3.
The result. These actions together with strong economic growth and a substantial real
exchange appreciation reduced the public debt to 53 percent of GDP in June 2010, improved
the debt structure, and strengthened the government’s liquidity buffers.
4.
Debt management operations. In 2006–09, the Debt Management Unit took
advantage of favorable conditions in the capital markets to improve liquidity buffers, and to
reduce roll-over, interest rate, and exchange rate risks. Key operations include:


Liquidity buffers: The government used contingent credit lines and an active
prefunding policy. At the end of 2009, the central government had built up about
$1.5 billion in deposits at the BCU, more than enough to finance the 2010 budget.



Roll-over-risk: The government prepaid or bought back about $3.6 billion of short
and medium-term debt, issued $6.5 billion in long-term Global Bonds (10–30 year),
and contracted loans with multilaterals (average maturity of 17 years). The duration
of the debt increased from 4.6 years by the end of 2004 to 10.3 years by end-2009.



Interest rate risk: The government issued Global Bonds at fixed interest rates, and
changed the floating rate loans with the IADB to fixed-rate loans. By end-2009 only
10 percent of debt was at floating rates, down from 23 percent in 2004.



Exchange rate risk: The government has increased the funding in domestic currency.
In 2010, it increased the issuance of debt in indexed units with five and ten year
maturities. At the end of June 2010, foreign currency denominated debt, though still
high, had been reduced to 65 percent of total debt from almost 90 percent in 2004.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. The currency is the Uruguayan peso (Ur$). Uruguay has
followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002. Since September
2007, monetary policy uses the policy rate, and no longer monetary targets, as intermediate
instrument. In 2008, Uruguay’s de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified from a managed
float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to a floating exchange rate regime. On
December 21, 2010, the exchange rate in the official market was Ur$ 19.95 per US dollar.
Uruguay’s exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

The Inter- American Development Bank is preparing its new Country Strategy with Uruguay
(2011-2015), which is expected to be approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of
2011. Lending under the new program is expected to reach approximately US$ 1.9 billion.
The program will also include additional non reimbursable financing for technical assistance
and analytical work. Under the new Strategy, it is expected that the IADB will continue to
support the development of productive infrastructure, particularly transportation and energy,
as well as human capital investments, particularly in secondary education and targeted social
programs, such as INFAMILIA, aimed at improving living conditions and social inclusion of
disadvantaged children, adolescents and their families.
The Bank’s current Country Strategy, approved in March 2006, supports the Government’s
policy, which seeks to consolidate growth and improve the population’s social welfare. In
support of this longer-term goal, the Strategy focuses on the following priority areas: (i)
improving public sector management, to increase its efficiency and efficacy, while
supporting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) enhancing regional and international
competitiveness of domestic output and encouraging private investment in order to promote
sustainable growth; and (iii) reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion.
The Bank’s strategy proposed an original lending scenario of about US$ 1.2 billion for the
five-year period 2005–09, which was considered to be consistent with Uruguay’s five year
budget plan, annual amendments approved by Congress, and the maintenance of a relatively
neutral net flow of Bank resources (during this period of concentrated external-IFI
maturities). Between 2005 and 2009, 34 loans were approved, adding US$ 1,297 million.
This program included lending to support the Government in the key policy areas of
competitiveness (17 loans adding US$ 437 MM and representing 34% of the approved
amounts), the social sectors and poverty reduction (6 loans adding US$ 490 MM,
representing 38% of the approved amounts), and public sector management (11 loans, adding
US$ 371 MM; 29% of the approved amounts).
Highlights from 2009 and 2010 lending program include: within the area of competitiveness,
additional financing for modernizing the Port of Montevideo approved in November 2009
(US$ 20 million) as well as an investment loan approved in September 2009 (US$ 10.5
million) aimed at improving public administration within the agricultural sector.
In support of the Government’s social policy aimed at reducing poverty and social exclusion,
the Bank approved in December 2009, a US$ 6 million investment loan to support Plan
Ceibal (one laptop per child enrolled in primary and secondary public schools), as well as a
US $40 million, approved in September 2010, to support the implementation of the National
Strategy for Childhood and Adolescence. Another investment loan (US$ 48 million) in

6
support of secondary education is under preparation and expected to be approved in
December 2010.
Within the public sector management, a second programmatic operation was approved in
April 2009 for US$ 285 million aimed at the modernization of the tax administration system
and improving public expenditure; and in December 2009, the Bank approved a US$ 4
million operation in support of institutional strengthening of the Central Bank’s supervision
of financial services.
As of November, 2010 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the
financing of 36 projects; two of which are to the private sector without sovereign guarantee.
The lending portfolio, aligned to the administration’s priorities and consistent with the
Bank’s Country Strategy, amounts to US$ 1,137.3 million, of which US$ 562.7 million are
pending disbursement. Portfolio performance related to investment loans in 2010 is relatively
normal and disbursements will total US$ 121.8 million in 2010.

ANNEX 4. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 1, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.
National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005)
and adopted the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). However, national accounts
statistics still have a number of shortcomings, limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long
publication lags, inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly
accounts. The central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in
current and at previous year prices by the production and expenditure approaches, as well as
quarterly constant price GDP estimates by the production and expenditure approaches. Gross
national income, gross disposable income and gross savings are also available annually.
Consumer prices: Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular
and timely basis for publication in the IFS. The consumer price index has a base period of
March 1997 = 100, and the base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001.
Coverage of the CPI is limited to the capital city. In 2011, the CPI will have national
coverage, a more detailed basket, updated weights, and a base period of 2006=100. Fifty
thousand price quotations will be included in the index. Producer price indices (March 2010
=100) for national products were recently disseminated. The authorities do not provide trade
price and volume indices for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state
enterprises and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems
with the timeliness of the data on local governments. There are also problems with the
timeliness of financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical
publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data
respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central
government and total public sector, but no information is reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics. The information reported for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on revenue and expense for the
consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for local governments have
not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations on financial assets
and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in
accordance with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities
report monetary data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial
corporations (OFCs) using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the

8
OFCs are limited to off-shore financial institutions. A mission could be fielded in FY 2012 to
expand the institutional coverage of the OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full
institutional coverage. Authorities reported Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) for 2008,
but the historical series and updates have not been submitted.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a
quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on
balance of payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for
publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. New surveys are
allowing for improved coverage of the private sector in the IIP. Uruguay started
disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data template on the
Fund’s external website in 2005. The BCU also disseminates quarterly external debt statistics
on its website, although not in the format envisaged by the SDDS.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in
February 2004 and is in observance.

Data ROSC published on October 1, 2001.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
or in the International Financial Statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Uruguay
On January 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2010 Article IV consultation with Uruguay, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.1
Background
Uruguay’s growth performance over the last seven years has been very strong. Domestic and
external factors have contributed to this economic revival, not least the consistent
implementation of important reforms and prudent policies across administrations. Though not
immune to the global crisis when it hit emerging markets in 2009, Uruguay’s rebound has been
quick and robust. In 2010, Uruguay’s economy has been booming with vigorous growth in
domestic demand and exports in the context of strong growth in partner countries, high
commodity prices, ample global liquidity, and low international interest rates. The banking sector
is well-capitalized and highly liquid, and nonperforming loans are record low under a regulatory
regime in line with international best practices.
Unemployment has fallen to record lows, and inflationary pressures have risen. Headline
inflation was 6.9 percent in December, close to the upper end of the current inflation band.
Staff’s estimate of core inflation (which excludes some food items and administratively set
prices) has been edging up and was 7.7 percent. Some sectors are experiencing shortages, in
particular for skilled labor. The external current account remained in surplus on the back of
buoyant exports, resilient terms of trade, and a bumper tourism season. Economic activity
slowed in the third quarter of 2010 and the economy is expected to growth 8–8.5 percent in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
2010 as a whole. In 2011, a continued moderation of the economic activity rate is expected,
with growth performing around 5 percent.
The authorities’ policy response has sought to balance different tradeoffs. Concerns about the
real effective exchange rate appreciation amid external inflows and buoyant demand conditions
led to intervention and sterilization operations. The risk of inflation above the target range
triggered a policy rate increase in late September, but the rate was left on hold in December.
On fiscal policy, the budget for 2010–14 aims to reduce the level of debt while focusing outlays
on infrastructure, education, security, and social programs. Also, the government has taken
advantage of external inflows to continue de-dollarize the public debt helping to moderate their
impact. Staff projects the public sector primary surplus to improve to 1.8 percent of GDP (from
1.1 percent in 2009) owing to the rebound in the state electricity company’s performance
following normalization of weather conditions. Despite strong economic growth, there was some
worsening in the balance of the central government (reflecting robust growth in real primary
expenditures and somewhat sluggish tax revenue).
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Uruguay, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Uruguay’s growth performance since the country’s own crisis in 2002 has been very strong.
Domestic and external factors have contributed to this economic revival, not least the
implementation of major reforms (e.g., to financial regulations and supervision, and the tax
system) and prudent macroeconomic policies across administrations.
The outlook for the coming years is good, but with challenges. The most immediate challenge is
to secure a soft landing of the economy in the context of ample global liquidity, low interest
rates, and high commodity prices. At the same time, there is a risk of spillovers from a worse
global or regional outlook. The medium-term macroeconomic challenge is to sustain rapid
growth with less volatility than in the past.
The macroeconomic policy requirements to deal with these challenges go in the same direction.
They involve fiscal and monetary policies to temper domestic demand growth to help steer the
economy away from a boom/bust path and create policy space (lower debt and inflation) to
respond to future shocks. Given the full employment for skilled labor and slow growth in the
labor force, sustaining growth at 4 percent over the longer term is feasible but will require efforts
to overcome gaps in infrastructure and in the skills of the labor force. The government’s policy
agenda reflects these challenges and priorities.
The budget for 2010–14 includes many important improvements. Notably: the focus on reducing
the public debt while increasing spending on infrastructure, education, security, and social
program, and the creation of the Energy Stabilization Fund. Staff supports the efforts to get a
better handle on the costs of tax exemptions, which risk undermining the impressive gains in tax
efficiency in recent years. The plan to publish cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances will help

3
improve the budget framework and fiscal policy. Staff suggests more transparent mechanisms
for intra-year changes in the budget.
The budget seeks to sustain the fiscal improvement in 2010, but even more ambitious fiscal
targets for 2011–14 would be feasible and desirable. The fiscal position is robust. But more
conservative fiscal targets for 2011–P14 would better support a soft landing, reduce
appreciation pressures, and achieve a faster reduction in the public debt. The fiscal impulse is
admittedly difficult to calculate with precision, but this uncertainty together with the state of the
cycle and the risks to the outlook reinforce the case to err on the side of caution. This would
also include saving cyclical revenue over-performance. Staff cautions against cutting the Value
Added Tax (VAT) in the near term. Of course, if growth falters, the more ambitious fiscal targets
should be reconsidered so as to allow automatic stabilizers to operate.
The increase in the monetary policy rate last September was a welcome step but a continued
tightening is warranted in light of the inflationary pressures. Strong domestic demand and the
risk of inflation expectations becoming stuck above official targets call for a continued measured
normalization of the monetary stance. The narrowing of the inflation target band in late 2009
was a welcome signal of commitment to inflation but it also raised the stakes for the Central
Bank of Uruguay (BCU). Staff suggests that the BCU aim for the middle of the inflation target
range to ensure space for countercyclical responses. Further, stability in the target band is
important for the targets to serve as an anchor for expectations. Finally, staff would caution
against using administrative measures to contain inflation.
The recapitalization of the BCU is welcome although two design features could be improved:
ensuring sufficient real cash flow to the BCU and allowing the 30 year bonds to be traded in the
secondary market.
There is scope to strengthen the monetary policy framework and its credibility further. A
practical step would be to separate clearly the Monetary Policy Committee from the
Macroeconomic Coordination Committee in public communications and by de-linking their
meeting schedules. The BCU can also strengthen its influence over inflation and inflation
expectations through improved communication of the inflation outlook and risks, and how it sees
inflation reaching the official targets.
Staff supports the flexible exchange rate and does not consider the real effective exchange rate
to be out of line with long-run fundamentals. The BCU’s level of international reserves is
comfortable and further intervention can be limited and subordinated to the inflation target.
Continued pro-active debt management is a good way to absorb capital inflows to improve the
public debt structure. A further slowdown in government expenditure would be appropriate if
appreciation pressures intensify. And the limits on investments abroad for pension funds could
be relaxed.
A well-functioning labor market with prudent wage agreements is essential for maintaining a
vibrant economy and avoiding erosion in competitiveness. The reform to take into account
sectoral productivity growth in the wage setting framework for the private sector is a welcome
step forward.

4

There are no major vulnerabilities in the financial system at this time. Banks are well-capitalized
and highly liquid, and nonperforming loans are at record low. Staff welcomes the extension of
the limits on banks’ credits to their parent banks and the creation of a Financial Risk Committee
to monitor systemic risks. Banks’ low profitability remains a concern and calls for efforts to
strengthen productivity in the sector. In supervision, the design of the loan-loss provisioning
system may need to be modified given the persistently high provisioning of impaired loans. The
growing lending by nonbank financial institutions warrants close supervision. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ readiness to adapt the macro-prudential framework as needed to contain credit
growth if the rapid expansion continues unabated.
Staff welcomes the initiatives to boost long-term growth prospects including via Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs). It will be important for the PPP framework to ensure an appropriate
balance of risk between the private and public sector, establish limits on the liabilities generated
by the PPPs, and ensure their appropriate reporting.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Uruguay: Document Containing the Authorities’ Views
Prepared by the Chair Representing Uruguay at the IMF Executive Board
February 16, 2011

Uruguay’s Economy: Another Remarkable Year
After enduring 2009, a difficult year for the region and the world, with positive economic
growth –though substantially lower than the average of the past years-, Uruguay exhibited
another year of vigorous economic activity in 2010. This was accompanied by a constant
decline in the unemployment rate (which is currently the lowest on record), and a prudent
increase in real salaries. The latter, together with transparent and well-targeted social
policies, have allowed Uruguay to present a significant decline in poverty rates and
meaningful progress towards reducing inequality. These developments, once again, clearly
demonstrate the strong linkages between economic stability and social achievements. The
sustainability of policies and reforms critically relies on a fair distribution of their benefits
among the whole society. At the same time, social improvements must be based on sound
policies, which tend to generate conditions and resources to promote and sustain those
improvements.
Robust and Broad-Based Economic Growth
Exports are exhibiting a notable performance. External sales of goods reveal a considerable
diversification in markets (e.g., Mercosur: 32 percent of total external sales; the rest of the
Americas: 15 percent; Europe: 23 percent; China: 6 percent) and products. Meanwhile,
tourism is flourishing, following a virtuous cycle with estate and hotel developments in the
main tourist destinations of the country. Private consumption also presents a robust dynamic
in the context of a sound path of credit growth. Investment continues to indicate the
attractiveness of Uruguay as a regional investment center and, in this regard, it is worth
noting the outstanding increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent years, a trend
which has been reinforced by announcements over the last few months related to the set up of
huge foreign investment projects.
The Five-Year Budget: Reinforced Economic Stability; Higher Social Expenditures;
and Renewed Efforts to Increase Value of Spending
The recently approved five-year Budget perfectly mirrors the authorities’ commitment to
reinforce economic stability while devoting more resources to social spending. On the latter,
the authorities are fully aware that devoting resources is not a sufficient condition to increase
the value of public spending, thus the above-referred budget, as well as further policies, will
redouble efforts aimed at increasing this value, for instance, by systematically assessing the
quality of the programs and the fulfillment of their envisaged results.

2
The Uruguayan authorities believe that social expenditure is the key instrument in achieving
their social objectives and, in this regard, education is the government’s key priority. Health
and housing are other areas that the authorities have given particular consideration to in the
budget, together with the country’s considerable infrastructure needs. Precisely, considering
the imperious necessity for an important amount of resources, the coexistence with other
priorities, and the advantages of undertaking some projects jointly with the private sector, the
authorities will reinforce the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for which they are
progressing in setting up a solid legal, institutional and managerial framework in line with
the best international practices.
Meanwhile, the budget establishes a gradual decline in the overall fiscal deficit from the
current 1.2 percent of GDP—an outstanding figure these days in the world economy—to
0.7 percent in 2015, which will drive the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 40 percent by that year.
Public Revenues: Reaping the Fruits of Years of Reforms
Five years ago, Uruguay implemented bold reforms in its tax system and revenue
administration. Admittedly, when these changes were planned and first established, the
envisaged results could have been regarded as too optimistic. However, the authorities’
strong commitment to the reforms, together with the substantial efforts from the revenue
administrations (DGI and BPS), has obtained notable results. The fact that tax evasion
decreased 17 percentage points, from 32 percent in 2004 to 15 percent in 2009, and the
significant efficiency gains speak for themselves on the implication of the changes.
Nonetheless, perhaps even more important than figures is the reinforcement among the
Uruguayan population of the tax compliance culture, which involves a long-term facet in a
country. Furthermore, once again, public revenues in 2010 have shown a very satisfactory
performance.
In the meantime, the Uruguayan authorities have repeatedly emphasized that any decision on
taxes will be established in the context of additional revenue efficiency gains and, as usual,
fully verifying the coherence of measures relative to the tax system’s pillars and their
consistency with the government’s synergetic objectives of economic stability, promoting
investment, and social improvements.
Public Debt: Deepening Trends
In recent years, the gross public sector debt-to-GDP ratio has substantially decreased, which
has been accompanied with a crucial transformation in Uruguay’s debt structure. In this
respect, it is worth underlining the sizeable extension of the debt average maturity—
stretching out to 12 years—the ample decrease of its de-dollarization—debt denominated in
domestic currency and indexed units (Unidades Indexadas, linked to CPI) increased to 40
percent, very close to the authorities’ target of 45 percent envisaged for 2015—and the fact
that most of the debt is at fixed rates. These trends have been deepened with the successful
debt operation carried out a few weeks ago, when the central government issued notes

3
denominated in local currency and indexed units, which was mostly acquired with debt
already issued by the central bank with a shorter maturity; as summarized by the Uruguayan
authorities, “urgencies have been vanishing, while certainties consolidating”.
Credit rating agencies have continued to upgrade Uruguay’s debt; the most recent was
Moody’s, raising Uruguay’s debt to one notch below investment grade. It is interesting to
note that Uruguay’s sovereign spreads are around 152 basis points (data as of end-January of
this year), which is within a range of 30 basis points observed for Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru and Uruguay) and below sovereign spreads in many advanced economies. Perhaps, once
again, credit ratings are somewhat behind developments in countries and markets.
Monetary Policies: Clear Objectives to Face Global Challenges
As in many emerging countries around the world, and particularly in the region, the Central
Bank of Uruguay has to deal with challenges stemming from the substantial pick up in
commodity prices worldwide, and the accommodative monetary policy stance observed in
advanced economies. Admittedly, some factors can temporarily deviate inflation figures from
the target range, but this system should be seen with an appropriate perspective and, in this
regard, the central bank has reiterated its strong commitment to the overriding objective of
maintaining low and stable inflation rates, and will continue to act consistently.
Of course, in a context of a floating exchange rate system, the authorities are closely
following developments in the exchange market in order to smooth volatility and movements
that could hurt competitiveness in the short term. The authorities have taken advantage of the
international financial conditions to accumulate a considerable amount of international
reserves which, according to the staff report, is at a comfortable level, although downside
risks still observed in the global economy merit a cautious approach in this regard.
Sound Prudential Framework and Governance as the Basis of a Healthy and Dynamic
Financial System
Uruguay’s financial system has experienced critical reforms over the past years, and their
results have been noticeably observed, especially during this global financial crisis. Among
the structural changes in the system, it is worth noting the significant transformation in the
governance of BROU and BHU and, consequently, their incentives, functioning, and
performance; a very efficient regulation and supervision framework (including some
innovative aspects as the dynamic provisioning system); and a strengthened structure of the
system as a whole. As also mentioned in the staff report, the banking system is highly liquid
and well-capitalized and non-performing loans are at very low levels (about 1 percent). The
banking system’s relatively low profitability may be seen, to some extent, as the other side of
the coin. However, the adaptation of the banks to the current global market conditions—
particularly low international interest rates—the fact that the credit intermediation in
Uruguay is still low compared to regional and international benchmarks, as well as the
positive perspectives offered by the Uruguayan economy and its investment climate, lead to

4
infer that the system’s profitability will continue to improve. The authorities consider that the
sound prudential framework, which, if needed, could be subject to further adjustments,
establishes a sound basis for healthy and profitable developments in the financial system.
Meanwhile, the authorities have underscored the importance of enhancing financial
inclusiveness as a way to keep increasing formal economy and to facilitate access to financial
services to individuals, as well as small and medium-sized businesses—the lack of its access
frequently constitutes an important constraint to enhance the population’s opportunities.
Conclusions: Significant Achievements but also Sizeable Challenges
Uruguay is facing a positive period based on prudent economic policies and structural
reforms, which is supported by a favorable external environment. Policies and reforms
together with Uruguay’s sound institutions, political maturity, and social values have
critically contributed to promoting economic stability, attracting investment, creating genuine
employment, and increasing the population’s real income. Consequently, considerable social
achievements have been made. Beyond these achievements, much remains to be done. The
authorities are fully aware of the challenges posed by the current global economic situation
and the country’s positive cycle. Commodity prices are increasing, generating inflationary
pressures worldwide, particularly in emerging and low-income countries; capital inflows will
likely persist or even deepen in the short term, although the low level of interest rates will not
last indefinitely. At the same time, envisaged economic and social objectives give rise to the
need to address some considerable shortfalls (for instance, in education and infrastructure),
and the government is committed to dedicating high amounts of resources and efforts in this
regard. The authorities firmly believe that this positive period constitutes an historic
opportunity to critically heighten Uruguay’s economy and society in a sustainable manner
and are fully encouraged to achieve it.
