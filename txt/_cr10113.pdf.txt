SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
The Azerbaijani economy has withstood the impact of
the global financial crisis relatively well, but has not
been immune to it.


In 2009, overall GDP grew at 9.3 percent, but non-oil
GDP growth slowed from 16 to 3 percent, fiscal and
export revenues fell by more than 30 percent, and
credit and liquidity conditions tightened substantially.



Due to the authorities’ appropriate policy response,
the exchange rate remained stable, inflation dropped
dramatically, official poverty rates continued to fall,
and financial stability was maintained.



In 2010, overall GDP growth will slow down to
2.7 percent, driven by nearly flat oil GDP growth, but
non-oil GDP growth is expected to recover to 4.2
percent. Inflation could increase slightly to 4 percent,
with the exchange rate expected to remain stable.

IMF staff made the following policy recommendations:


On fiscal policy, additional oil fund resources should
not be used to increase spending in 2010, even if oil
prices turn out to be higher than budgeted, given the
scope to improve public expenditure efficiency and
the need to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability
in light of the short-lived oil boom.



On the financial sector, rising nonperforming loans
need to be addressed, but liquidity support should be
withdrawn as financial sector health improves, so as
to limit fiscal risks and prevent a pickup in inflation. If
additional support were to become necessary, the
implied quasi-fiscal costs should be made
transparent by requiring that any such support
originates directly from the budget.



On the exchange rate, the U.S. dollar peg will
remain appropriate in the short term, while more
flexibility will become beneficial in the medium term.



On structural reforms, economic diversification
should be accelerated through further improvements
in the business climate, in particular, through further
tax and customs modernization and structural
financial sector reforms.

The Azerbaijani authorities broadly agreed with the policy
recommendations.

BACKGROUND



Major expansions in oil and gas production and large increases in public expenditure generated
spectacular growth rates, averaging 20 percent during 2003–08, combined with a rapid decline in
official poverty rates, from 45 percent in 2003 to 11 percent in 2009.1 However, the oil boom also
led to high inflation, unprecedented credit growth, and unsustainably high non-oil fiscal deficits.



While the oil boom has created extraordinary opportunities for economic and social development,
it is highly temporary in nature. Oil production is expected to peak in 2014, and oil reserves are
expected to be exhausted in 20–25 years unless new discoveries are made.



The de jure exchange rate regime has been a peg to a euro-dollar basket since March 2008, but
the de facto regime has been stabilized against the U.S. dollar since June 2008 (see
Informational Annex I).



The last Article IV consultation was concluded on May 23, 2008. The staff report was published
and can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22135.0. The next
Article IV consultation is expected to take place on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Given its high per capita income (consistently above the International Development Association (IDA) operational cutoff for a
number of years), the favorable medium-term outlook, and its relative resilience to external shocks, Azerbaijan is—from April
2010—no longer eligible for concessional IMF loans under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).

IMPACT OF THE CRISIS

The Azerbaijani economy has thus far withstood the impact of the world economic and
financial crisis relatively well.



The economy grew at an impressive 9.3 percent during 2009, driven by a pickup in oil production
growth,2 as well as continued growth in services and agriculture.



Inflation fell dramatically, from more than 20 percent in 2008 to 1.5 percent in 2009, driven by
falling international commodity prices, and lower domestic and external demand.



Despite mounting depreciation expectations in early 2009, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA)
successfully intervened to keep the exchange rate pegged against the U.S. dollar, which helped
to reduce inflation, prevented further dollarization, and avoided a negative impact on households’
and banks’ balance sheets. While the CBA’s gross international reserves fell by 16 percent as a
result of its interventions, they remained comfortable at US$5.4 billion (4.8 months of imports of
goods and services) at end-2009.



The official unemployment rate remained stable, and the official poverty rate declined further from
13 percent in 2008 to 11 percent in 2009, reflecting lower inflation and higher social spending.

2.

Nevertheless, Azerbaijan has not been immune to the impact of the global crisis.



The large drop in oil prices caused fiscal oil revenues to fall by 35 percent during 2009. Non-oil
revenues remained roughly at their 2008 level, but were 17 percent lower than budgeted.



The large drops in international commodity prices also caused total exports to fall by over
30 percent during 2009. Non-oil exports fell by about 22 percent, but there was no clear evidence
of a loss in market share. Combined with falling remittances, the fall in exports reduced the
current account surplus from 35 percent in 2008 to 24 percent of GDP in 2009.



A number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and banks faced difficulties rolling over short-term
foreign liabilities, which triggered a liquidity shortage in the banking system, and contributed to a
sharp decline in credit growth.



Non-oil GDP growth slowed down from 15.7 percent in 2008 to 3 percent in 2009, with falling
output in construction and non-oil manufacturing sectors, further depressing demand for credit
and further causing loan portfolios of banks to deteriorate.



IMF staff expects non-oil GDP growth to recover to 4.2 percent in 2010, but overall GDP growth
to slow down to 2.7 percent. Given that existing oil fields have already reached their maximum
production capacity, oil GDP is projected to grow by only 1.3 percent. Inflation is expected to
increase to 4 percent, reflecting the recovery of the non-oil sector and the rise in international
commodity prices. Growth and inflation will be lower if businesses remain pessimistic or external
demand recovers only modestly.

2

Oil GDP growth increased from 7 percent in 2008 to 15 percent in 2009, largely due to a one-off resumption in oil production
at the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) oilfield in the Caspian Sea, following a temporary shutdown in late 2008 in response to a
natural gas leakage, combined with a pickup in oil production from a new platform at Deepwater Gunashli.

FISCAL POLICY: RETURNING TO A SUSTAINABLE PATH

In 2009, the government responded to the crisis with a number of fiscal policy measures
that allowed the non-oil deficit to remain broadly unchanged.



Despite the large drop in oil prices, the budgeted transfer of resources from the State Oil Fund of
Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) was fully implemented, which limited the overall revenue impact.



To support SOEs that faced difficulties with repaying foreign debt obligations resulting from the
drop in commodity prices, the government provided a capital injection and a governmentguaranteed loan to the state oil company (SOCAR), and another such loan to the state-owned
aluminum company, in total amounting to US$1.4 billion (3.2 percent of GDP).



To support economic activity, profit and income tax rates were cut in 2009, effective 2010, and
access to the simplified tax regime was increased by raising the VAT threshold.3



The government adjusted for the fall in revenues by cutting non-priority spending and by financing
only ongoing capital investment projects in 2009 (Figure 3). As a result, the non-oil fiscal deficit
remained broadly unchanged, while the government was still able to increase social spending by
1.8 percentage points of non-oil GDP, mostly for education and social protection.

4.

IMF staff welcomed the conservative 2010 budget and the authorities’ renewed
commitment to fiscal sustainability, and made the following recommendations:



Even if oil prices turn out to be higher than budgeted, additional oil fund resources should not be
used to increase government spending given (i) the available room to improve the quality and
efficiency of spending, and (ii) the need to significantly reduce the non-oil deficit to secure
medium-term fiscal sustainability.4 Estimates of a positive non-oil output gap, while subject to the
usual caveats (e.g., WP/06/68), also support a contractionary fiscal stance in 2009 and 2010.



To gradually reduce expenditure, the government should (i) improve expenditure efficiency by
increasing budget transparency and tightening procurement procedures, particularly for public
investment; (ii) lower the current expenditure burden through pension and civil service reform,
and better-targeted public services and social safety nets; and (iii) reduce the financial support to
SOEs by improving their financial discipline and by better monitoring their quasi-fiscal activities.



To increase non-oil revenues, the government should further reduce exemptions, simplify the tax
system, and strengthen risk management approaches, along with other measures (Section VI).

Given the caveats involved in output gap estimation, the authorities were not convinced that the
output gap was still positive, but they agreed on the medium-term fiscal consolidation path, as well as
on the expenditure and revenue reforms, which they stressed would take many years.

3

Effective January 1, 2010, the profit tax rate was reduced from 22 to 20 percent, and the maximum personal income tax rate
was reduced from 35 to 30 percent for labor income, and from 35 to 20 percent for the self-employed. At the same time, the
VAT threshold was increased from 23,500 manat per quarter to 150,000 manat per year. The Tax Ministry estimates that these
measures imply about a 100 mln manat reduction in tax revenues, but that this will be offset by an increase in compliance.

4

The estimated sustainable non-oil deficit (Figure 3) is derived from a permanent income model for oil revenue, which aims at
a sustainable level of constant real spending. A similar definition is used in the government’s Long Term Oil Revenue
Management Strategy (LTORMS), which was developed in 2004 with IMF assistance, and is supported by the World Bank.

EXCHANGE RATE POLICY: MAINTAINING STABILITY

Following the transition in March 2008 to a euro-dollar basket peg, the CBA first increased
and then reduced the weight on the euro, implying a de facto peg against the dollar.



Mounting expectations of exchange rate depreciation in early 2009, fueled by the large
depreciations in other countries in the region, caused large deposit outflows and an increase in
dollarization, creating additional liquidity pressures for banks.5



Despite the strong depreciation pressures, the CBA successfully defended the de facto peg
against the dollar by making foreign exchange sales of more than US$1 billion (16 percent of
reserves) in February and March 2009. As a result, dollarization was reduced, deposits returned,
and a negative impact on households’ and banks’ balance sheets was avoided.

6.

IMF staff advised that exchange rate stability will remain appropriate in the short term,
while more flexibility will become beneficial in the medium term:



Due to the dramatic drop in inflation, the real exchange rate remained close to equilibrium in
2009, or even became somewhat undervalued. Staff estimates based on the Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP) approach, External Sustainability (ES) approach, and Equilibrium Real Exchange
Rate (ERER) approach all suggest slight undervaluation in 2009, by 4, 6, and 10 percent,
respectively (Figure 4).



In the short term, there are clear benefits from continuing to peg to the U.S. dollar, given that a
significant share of trade is U.S.-dollar denominated, the volatility of capital flows is relatively low,
there is a need to stabilize expectations given the recent history of high inflation and high
dollarization, and no strong real appreciation or depreciation pressures are expected.



In the medium term, however, the benefits from more flexibility will increase as the economy
becomes more diversified and more integrated with international capital markets. Based on the
ES approach—which defines the sustainable non-oil current account deficit as a constant annuity
on Azerbaijan’s net foreign assets, including the present value of oil and gas wealth—the non-oil
current account deficit is expected to start exceeding the sustainable level after 2014. This
underlines the importance of developing a strategy to promote non-oil exports (Section VI).



There are several conditions for moving to further exchange rate flexibility, some of which may
only be fully met after more flexibility is, in fact, introduced. A first condition is to strengthen
monetary policy, including through increased central bank independence, more flexible and
responsive policymaking and policy coordination, and the development of a new credible nominal
anchor to replace the peg. A second condition is to improve exchange rate risk management by
market participants, including through tighter prudential regulation and supervision. Third, to avoid
excessive volatility during the transition, a deep and liquid foreign exchange market needs to be
developed, with a reduced market role for the public sector and a coherent intervention strategy.

The authorities fully agreed with the exchange rate assessment, and looked forward to further
discussions on the timing, modalities, and conditions for increasing flexibility.
5

Total deposits fell by 30 percent during the first quarter of 2009, while the deposit dollarization ratio for private banks
increased from 34 to 52 percent between September 2008 and June 2009, after which it fell back to 44 percent by end-2009.

MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES: ENSURING FINANCIAL
STABILITY
During 2009, the CBA successfully maintained financial stability by keeping the exchange
rate stable and providing liquidity support to the banking system.



To address the tightening of liquidity and credit conditions, the CBA reduced the reserve
requirement on deposits from 12 to 0.5 percent, and cut the refinancing rate from 15 to 2 percent
between September 2008 and December 2009 (Figure 5). In addition, the CBA allowed the
Azerbaijan Mortgage Fund (AMF) to resume its lending activity from July 2009, financed through
budget transfers and by the issuance of long-term AMF bonds.



Overall, the CBA provided about US$1.1 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) in liquidity support to banks,
and another US$1.1 billion in government-guaranteed credit to the state-owned International
Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) for onlending to the state oil and aluminum companies, which required
an amendment of the central bank law. In addition, banks and insurance companies were
exempted from tax on profits used for recapitalization from 2009 onwards.



To further boost confidence in the banking system, the deposit insurance coverage was
increased significantly in June 2009, including by raising the deposit limit from 6,000 to 30,000
manat (7.8 times GDP per capita).

8.

IMF staff advice focused on the need to remain vigilant, while working on an exit strategy:



While nonperforming loans remain low, they have been rising and are likely to be underestimated.
The authorities should, therefore, continue to closely monitor the banking system and strengthen
banking supervision by periodically assessing balance sheets, dealing with nonperforming loans
on a timely basis, and improving risk management and corporate governance.



As financial sector health improves and credit growth resumes, liquidity support should be
gradually withdrawn so as to limit fiscal risks and prevent a pickup in inflation. If additional support
were to become necessary, this should originate directly from the government budget rather than
from the CBA, so as to make transparent the implied quasi-fiscal costs and limit any conflict of
interest with the CBA’s supervisory responsibilities.



Despite the significant reduction in the refinancing rate and the fall in inflation, average deposit
and lending rates remain high, keeping credit and liquidity conditions tight. To bring down interest
rates, the authorities should (i) make monetary policy transmission more effective, including by
deepening the secondary market for government securities; (ii) facilitate the recovery of collateral
by banks; and (iii) increase competition in the banking system, including by privatizing IBA within
the next few years, as its market dominance (nearly 50 percent of total banking system assets)
and extensive lending to SOEs distorts competition and crowds out private credit.

The authorities agreed on the exit strategy, but preferred not to finance any needed further support
directly from the budget, as this would require a supplementary budget and could prevent a swift
policy response. While the CBA was of the view that interest rates are largely market-determined, the
authorities agreed on the proposed monetary and financial sector reforms, including on the need to
privatize IBA in the next few years.

AZERBAIJAN’S MAIN MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGE: DEVELOPING THE
NON-OIL ECONOMY

The unexpected fall in oil revenues and the sharp slowdown in the non-oil economy in
2009 have once again illustrated the crucial importance of accelerating reforms to
diversify the economy and improve the medium-term outlook for Azerbaijan.



Starting from 2010, oil production will no longer be the main source of growth (with the exception
of 2014, when the Chirag oil field becomes operational), while non-oil growth will likely no longer
be boosted by oil-fueled demand for nontradables. Non-oil exports, which currently account for
only 5 percent of total exports, will therefore need to take over as the driver of the economy in the
medium term.



Azerbaijan’s Doing Business ranking improved significantly in 2009, from 97 to 33 out of 183
countries, driven by the establishment of a “one-stop shop,” a more flexible labor code, and
improvements in contract enforcement. However, the country continued to score poorly in the
areas of paying taxes, trading across borders, and dealing with licenses. Moreover, Transparency
International’s 2009 Corruption Perception Index remained high at 143 out of 180 countries, while
important anti-monopoly and investment legislation were recently withdrawn from Parliament.

10.

IMF staff recommended that, rather than aiming to stimulate specific export sectors, the
most effective way to develop non-oil exports is through further improving the business
environment, including through tax, customs, and financial sector reforms:



Further progress with tax and customs reforms is crucial for improving the business environment.
Regarding tax reforms, the recently introduced tax cuts and the sophisticated electronic tax filing
system have already reduced some of the tax burden on businesses,6 but further progress with
risk management approaches and reducing exemptions is needed to create a level playing field
for all businesses. Regarding customs reforms, the authorities’ continued commitment to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is welcome, as this requires further improvements in customs
legislation and administration, regulations for customs valuation, and customs tariff policy.



Further progress with structural financial sector reforms is needed to (i) improve access to credit
for the non-oil sector, including through increasing the availability of borrower information to
creditors, and accelerating the ability of creditors to access collateral in the event of default;
(ii) gradually eliminate directed credit and interest rate subsidies to SOEs; (iii) foster banking
sector consolidation through prudential and other means to increase capitalization, efficiency, and
confidence; (iv) increase competition in the banking sector by privatizing IBA and encouraging the
entry of strategic investors; and (v) address the remaining deficiencies in the area of anti-money
laundering and combating terrorist financing (AML/CFT).7

The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations, and are committed to developing a non-oil
export strategy that focuses on improving the business environment.

6

According to the authorities, 99 percent of registered VAT payers and 87 percent of all tax payers filed their tax returns
electronically during 2009, and by end-2010, 30 tax terminals will have been built to assist taxpayers with e-filing.
7

These include bringing the AML/CFT legislation in line with international standards, making the Financial Intelligence Unit fully
operational, boosting domestic coordination, and ensuring that the AML/CFT provisions are implemented more effectively.

13

BOX 1: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External debt in percent of GDP has declined substantially since oil production took off in
2005, and is expected to remain low in the medium term.


Since 2005, the Azerbaijani government has been able to use its rapidly growing oil revenues
to finance a large part of domestic investment projects, which reduced external debt from
40 percent of GDP in 2004 to 20 percent in 2009.



The government’s intention to issue US$500 million in Eurobonds in 2010 would set a useful
benchmark for companies looking to raise funds in international capital markets, while
keeping external debt broadly stable at about 20 percent of GDP in the medium term. Even if
key variables return to their 2000-09 historical levels, external debt would remain below
30 percent.

Public and publicly guaranteed debt will remain low as well, but may increase moderately in
the medium term.


The government-guaranteed loans extended to the state oil and aluminum companies in
2009 caused public-sector domestic debt to increase by about 2.7 percent of GDP.



The government’s plan to increase the issuance of both T-bills and longer-term government
securities is a welcome measure to further develop securities markets. While public and
publicly guaranteed debt would increase moderately over the medium term, it is expected to
remain low at around 14 percent of GDP. However, public debt could go up to 50 percent if
fiscal parameters were to return to their historical 2000–09 levels.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) was subject to
an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved on July 06, 2001, and
expired on July 5, 2004. The assessment was completed on March 11, 2002, and it was concluded
that the external audit and financial reporting were adequate. The assessment proposed a set of
measures to strengthen internal control, data reporting to the Fund, and the legal framework. The
majority of the recommendations were implemented, except for the recommendation to establish an
Audit Committee. The external audit of 2009 CBA financial statements is scheduled to be completed
by end-April 2010, and the audit report is expected to be published immediately afterwards.

1

Following the Low Income Countries (LIC) reforms, effective January 7, 2010, the PRGF arrangements were renamed the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangements.

3
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994. The de
jure exchange rate regime has been a peg to a euro-dollar basket since March 2008, but the de facto
regime has been stabilized against the U.S. dollar since June 2008.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective November 30, 2004,
and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons that have
been notified to the Fund.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

The 2008 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan was concluded on May 23, 2008.
X.

ROSCs

A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and updated in
April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place in April 2005. A data
dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/86).
The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is available on the IMF web site. Several financial
systems ROSC were conducted in the context of the FSAP (2003–04) but were not published. A CPI
data ROSC completed in July 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/273).
XI.

Resident Representative

In October 2009, Mr. Koba Gvenetadze ended his term as IMF Resident Representative in Azerbaijan.
Since November 2009, the IMF no longer has a Resident Representative in Azerbaijan, but the IMF
Office in Baku, located in the building of the Ministry of Finance of Azerbaijan, continues to operate,
headed by Ms. Aghgun Gadirli (Office Manager).
XII.

Resident Advisers

An adviser on the establishment of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Nurcan Aktürk, was
stationed in Baku from December 1994 to September 1996. He was succeeded by Mr. B.K.
Chaturvedi, whose assignment was extended twice, first through August 2000, and then through May
2001. Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi was replaced by Mr. A. Khan, whose assignment started in May 2001 and
ended in August 2002. A technical long-term adviser for tax administration, Mr. Mark Zariski, was
stationed in Baku from April 1995 to April 1996. He was succeeded by Mr. Peter Barrand, who was
stationed in Baku from January 2001 to December 2002. Mr. Isaac Svartsman was resident advisor in
the CBA for bank supervision and restructuring from September 1998 to April 2001. Ms. Nataliya
Ivanik was stationed in Baku as a STA regional external sector statistics advisor from November 2006
to November 2008.

ANNEX II. AZERBAIJAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of April 8, 2010)
1.
The World Bank has been actively implementing a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that
supports poverty reduction and improves economic management in Azerbaijan. The CPS for 2007–10
has been focusing on four key pillars: (i) improving public sector governance; (ii) fostering non-oil
economy growth; (iii) strengthening social services; and (iv) improving environmental management.
Over this period, the Bank has provided about $1.5 billion in lending with a heavy emphasis on water
supply, highways, railways, public sector institutions, and rural investments. On the analytical side, the
Bank has completed a Country Economic Memorandum (“A New Silk Road: Export-Led
Diversification”), a Programmatic Poverty Assessment, and a Corporate Governance ROSC. The
Bank recently organized a High Level Forum, chaired by the Prime Minister and the Bank’s Managing
Director, that brought together key government officials, international practitioners and academics, and
Bank staff to review key challenges and policy options for improving competitiveness and export
diversification of the non-oil sectors in the post-crisis environment.
2.
The World Bank Group is currently preparing a new CPS for Azerbaijan for the period 2011–
14. The strategic framework of the CPS will likely rest on three pillars: (i) promoting economic
diversification and competitiveness; (ii) strengthening human capital for growth with equity; and
(iii) supporting sustainable development. Bank staff expects to present the new CPS to the Board in
the fall of 2010.
3.
The strategy of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) focuses on supporting the non-oil
sector to help economic diversification. To this end, the IFC aims to catalyze foreign direct investment
in non-oil sector projects and to contribute to the modernization of the country’s financial sector, its
agriculture, its manufacturing base, and basic infrastructure. The IFC’s strategy for the non-oil sector
involves (i) promoting competition and improving corporate governance in the banking sector;
(ii) establishing joint ventures in the nonbank financial sector; (iii) providing technical assistance to
private local banks for institutional capacity building; and (iv) improving access to finance through
credit lines to local private banks for on-lending to small and medium size enterprises.
4.
Relations between the Bank and the Fund concerning Azerbaijan are very good in terms of
coordinated policy advice and collaboration on macroeconomic monitoring. There is also broad
agreement between the Bank and the Fund on the division of labor between the two institutions. The
Bank's investment operations and analytical activities will continue to focus on the areas of
competitiveness and sustainability of economic outcomes, infrastructure provision, budgeting and
public expenditure management, education, private sector development, and other sectoral issues, as
well as some financial sector issues as outlined in the three pillars of the upcoming CPS. The Fund
will continue to focus on macro-critical areas, and will share responsibilities with the Bank on banking
and financial sector soundness, taking care to coordinate closely so as to minimize overlap and
ensure harmonization of policy advice.

ANNEX III. AZERBAIJAN: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of December 31, 2009)
1.
As of December 2009, the EBRD has signed 114 projects in Azerbaijan for a cumulative
business volume of US$1.6 billion (including regional projects). The current portfolio stock amounts to
US$979 million, and the ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio now stands at 62 percent.
2.
The infrastructure sector (municipal infrastructure, transport, and power) dominates EBRD’s
portfolio, representing 34 percent. EBRD financed three power projects for a total of US$281 million,
making Azerenergy, Azerbaijan's state-owned power utility, EBRD's single largest client. EBRD also
financed five transport projects and one municipal project for a total of US$201 million. The natural
resource sector represents about 25 percent of the portfolio. EBRD financed 16 natural resource
projects for a total of US$571 million, including several landmark transactions such as BTC, ACG, and
Shah Deniz. The corporate sector represents about 22 percent of EBRD's portfolio. EBRD financed 15
projects for a total of US$224.7 million, including two projects with Garadagh Cement, EBRD's second
largest client in Azerbaijan. The financial sector represents 18.6 percent of EBRD's portfolio but
covers 73 projects, more than any other sector.
3.
In 2009, EBRD invested a total of US$232 million in 9 projects. This included a EUR 120
million loan to Garadagh Cement—EBRD's largest loan in the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan to-date—
that will implement a state-of-the-art dry process cement production technology, significantly reducing
energy consumption and CO2 emission. The other projects in 2009 were in the financial sector. EBRD
also worked closely with Azerenergy to generate carbon credits under the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) established by the Kyoto Protocol. In July 2009, Azerenergy signed an Emission
Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) to sell carbon credits generated by the rehabilitation of the
Azdres Thermal Power Plant financed by EBRD. The project is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by
three million tons annually. This is a landmark deal that involved the development of a new CDM
methodology for power plant rehabilitation projects. The methodology, which was developed with
EBRD's assistance, can now be applied worldwide. EBRD is preparing a new country strategy for
Azerbaijan for 2010–13. The strategy will be provided to the government for comments in early May,
posted on EBRD's website for public consultation in late July, and is expected to be adopted by
EBRD's board of directors in late September. The central theme of the strategy will be EBRD's
support to the development of Azerbaijan's non-oil economy through investments in financial
institutions, private enterprise, and infrastructure.
4.
Azerbaijan is part of EBRD’s Early Transition Countries (ETC) initiative. Launched in April
2004, this initiative aims to increase investments in EBRD’s eight countries of operation in the early
transition stage, while building on international efforts to address poverty in these countries. Through
this initiative, the EBRD focuses its efforts on private sector business development and selected public
sector interventions. It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined approach to financing,
focusing on smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and encouraging ongoing economic reform.
EBRD will accept higher risk in the projects it finances in the ETCs, while still respecting the principles
of sound banking.

7
ANNEX IV. AZERBAIJAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving the quality and
timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should be addressed,
particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and external sector statistics. STA has
provided extensive technical assistance and recommendations in these areas.
2.
Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC mission
reviewed Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and conducted an
assessment of the quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI), producer price index
(PPI), government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data module of the
ROSC is available on the IMF’s external website. Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator
in August 2005. An SDDS assessment mission in April 2007 provided technical assistance on the
outstanding issues required for SDDS subscription. A data ROSC module to reassess the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) completed in July 2008.
A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.
Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been provided to
the State Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of areas. Methods for
compiling gross national income have been improved and revised estimates disseminated; quarterly
national account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004 have been compiled; capital investment
data have been revised; estimates of undeclared wages have been made; and a new methodology for
calculating price indices for the construction and transportation sectors is well underway. The MarchApril 2005 mission identified the following problems: (i) the Oil Fund’s transactions are not adequately
reflected in the national accounts due to lack of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the SSC does not
have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances from domestic residents working
abroad; and (iii) there are no estimates of informal sector activity.
4.
In January 2005, the CPI was revamped—the consumption basket was expanded to cover 585
items and expenditure weights updated to reflect recent consumption patterns. With respect to
regional coverage, which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC used population-based weights in
the aggregation of elementary price indices. However, this treatment raised methodological questions,
because (i) international best practices suggest the use of expenditure-based weights in every stage
of aggregation in CPI compilation, and (ii) population shares are not reliable proxies for regional
expenditure shares. The recent reassessment of the CPI found that, although the SSC did use
population weights for regional aggregation through 2006, it has weighted regional indexes by
expenditure since 2007, using 2006 Household Budget Survey results on household expenditure,
while 2009 data are based on 2008 expenditure weights.
5.
Given that property prices are thought to be inflating rapidly in urban centers, it is important for
the SSC to measure both the asset and rental prices of housing. Accordingly, the 2008 CPI
reassessment mission suggested compiling a house price index, which would provide an estimate of
inflation for the capital formation component of household final expenditure. The SSC has been
considering proposing such an index for its statistical development program, as a new price indicator
distinct from its consumption-based CPI.
B. Fiscal Sector
6.
Recent treasury modernization efforts are expected to improve the compilation of fiscal data.
With the assistance of a Fund peripatetic advisor, the Ministry of Finance developed the treasury chart
of accounts (COA), an essential input to the new treasury system. The October 2006 STA government

8
finance statistics mission found the latest draft COA broadly consistent with the Government Finance
Statistics Manual, 2001. The work on the COA is proceeding in parallel with the computerization of
Treasury operations.
7.
The 2002 data ROSC mission recommended expanding the coverage of government finance
statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and publishing details on financing and
debt outstanding. Starting in 2006, the state budget incorporates transfers to Nakhichevan as a
separate expenditure item, but no further details are provided.
C. Monetary Sector
8.
The Azerbaijan National Bank (CBA) compiles monetary statistics according to the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBA reports monetary data to STA
within three weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
Monetary and financial data have also been published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
Supplement since December 2006.
D. External Sector
9.
Azerbaijan’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled and disseminated by the CBA
and are broadly in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The
CBA has also initiated compilation of International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. The IIP data for
2002–2008 have been published in IFS; however, the authorities have indicated that they have
discontinued the official publication of IIP data effective 2009.
10.
During November 2006–November 2008, a Regional Advisor in External Sector Statistics to
Azerbaijan and Georgia was stationed in Baku to (i) facilitate activities carried out by different
government agencies in the development of external sector statistics; (ii) assist with statistical capacity
building; (iii) coordinate the technical assistance activities of STA with the MCD’s work program; and
(iv) assist the authorities in coordinating with other international institutions and bilateral agencies
involved in technical assistance in statistics in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Moreover, Azerbaijan has
benefited from a STA technical assistance mission in external sector statistics, which visited Baku in
October 2009 to further assist the authorities with addressing a number of outstanding issues related
to the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics.
11.
The 2009 mission found that appropriate statistical legislation to assign responsibilities for
compilation and dissemination of external sector stocks statistics (IIP and gross external debt) has yet
to be developed. A draft Presidential Decree On Improvement of the Gross External Debt and
International Investment Position Statistics of Azerbaijan was developed in order to authorize the CBA
to compile private and public debt data from relevant agencies, but still has not been approved. As a
result, the CBA temporarily discontinued dissemination of IIP statistics and the development of the
compilation system for the IIP and gross external debt statistics. The mission recommended the
authorities to address these issues, as they would affect the timing of Azerbaijan’s subscription to the
SDDS. The mission also expressed concerns with regard to the pace of implementation of the
strategic framework for the development of external sector statistics. However, the authorities note
that recent changes in staffing have led to improvements in this area.
12.
The 2009 mission also found that, in spite of the CBA’s efforts, data sharing and data provision
remain a challenge for the compilation of external sector statistics. Consequently, the mission
recommended to set up a formal, high-level structure for data sharing and data provision. Moreover,
given the outstanding issues related to data sharing and data provision by various respondents, and
non-reporting by major market participants, the mission considered that the existing International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) should be further developed, including by changing the ITRS
design to introduce a closed ITRS, and by further improving ITRS verification procedures via the onsite inspection of reporting banks.

9
13.
Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a due-forpayment basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public and publicly
guaranteed external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest components, is also
provided with a one quarter lag. However, systematic information on nonguaranteed external debt,
including a sectoral breakdown, is lacking. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission noted that it would
be desirable to use balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining to banking sector liabilities,
which would permit presentation of information with a breakdown by maturities and instruments.
14.
Monthly data on total official reserve assets and daily CBA net interventions in the foreign
exchange market are provided within 15 days of the end of each month. Data on official reserves
during the month are provided on request from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does not disseminate
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data, but the CBA and the
government have stated that there have not been any forward or futures transactions that could give
rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency assets. STA has recently advised the
authorities on the definition and coverage of gross official reserve assets. As the authorities indicated
that several definitions of gross official reserve assets are used, STA stressed the importance of using
only one definition, more specifically the definition that follows the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). STA will continue to provide advice
to the authorities for the correct compilation of Azerbaijan’s gross official reserve assets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Republic of Azerbaijan
On May 3, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article VI consultation with the Republic of Azerbaijan.1
Background
The Azerbaijani economy has withstood the impact of the global financial crisis relatively well,
but has not been immune to it. Overall gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an impressive 9.3
percent during 2009, but non-oil GDP growth slowed from 16 percent in 2008 to 3 percent in
2009. The large drop in international oil and other commodity prices caused fiscal and export
revenues to fall by more than 30 percent. In addition, a number of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and banks faced difficulties rolling over short-term foreign liabilities, which triggered a
liquidity shortage in the banking system, and contributed to a sharp decline in credit growth. As
international commodity prices fell, average annual inflation dropped dramatically from more
than 20 percent in 2008 to 1.5 percent in 2009.
The government responded to the crisis with effective fiscal policy measures. First, it limited the
budgetary impact of the large drop in oil prices by allowing the oil fund to still transfer the
budgeted amount of resources to the state budget. Second, it provided a large capital injection
and government-guaranteed loans to help the state oil and aluminum companies stay current

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

on their foreign debt obligations. Third, the government adjusted for the fall in revenues by
cutting non-priority spending and by financing only ongoing capital investment projects. As a
result, the government managed to keep the non-oil fiscal deficit broadly stable and was still
able to increase social spending. The 2010 budget targets a narrowing of the non-oil deficit,
while allowing for cuts in profit and income taxes.
The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) successfully maintained financial stability by keeping the
exchange rate stable and injecting liquidity into the banking system. Despite mounting
depreciation expectations in early 2009, the CBA successfully intervened to keep the exchange
rate pegged against the U.S. dollar, which reduced inflation, prevented further dollarization, and
avoided a negative impact on households’ and banks’ balance sheets. To address the
tightening of liquidity and credit conditions, the CBA reduced the reserve requirement on
deposits from 12 to 0.5 percent and cut the refinancing rate from 15 percent to 2 percent
between September 2008 and December 2009. Furthermore, the CBA provided about US$1.1
billion (2.6 percent of GDP) in liquidity support to banks that were faced with temporary liquidity
difficulties. Finally, the deposit insurance limit was increased by five times, which helped to
restore confidence in the banking system.
Non-oil GDP is expected to recover to 4.2 percent in 2010, but downside risks remain. Oil GDP
is projected to grow by only 1.3 percent, implying overall GDP growth of only 2.7 percent. Along
with the recovery of the non-oil sector and the rise in international commodity prices, inflation in
2010 is expected to increase slightly to 4 percent. Growth will be lower if businesses remain
pessimistic or external demand recovers only modestly.
Given that oil production will likely no longer be the main source of growth from now on, the
medium-term outlook for the Azerbaijani economy depends strongly on whether non-oil exports,
which currently account for only 5 percent of total exports, will be able to take over as the driver
of the economy. Realizing this, the authorities are committed to developing a non-oil export
strategy that focuses on further improving the business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent policy responses to the impact of the global
crisis, which helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability and robust GDP growth.
Going forward, the key challenges are to preserve the hard-won stability and diversify the
sources of economic growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ adjustment measures in the face of falling fiscal revenues
in 2009 and their renewed commitment to fiscal sustainability. They supported the intention not
to increase spending in 2010 even if oil prices turn out to be higher than budgeted, given the
room to improve expenditure efficiency and the need to significantly reduce the non-oil deficit to
secure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Directors commended the authorities on making
Azerbaijan the first country to be fully compliant with the principles and criteria of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative. They looked forward to greater transparency on the
expenditure side and reforms to lower the current expenditure burden and the financial support
to state-owned enterprises, cut tax exemptions, and simplify the tax system.

3
Directors agreed that the authorities’ decision to maintain a stable exchange rate had served
the country well during the crisis, by reducing inflation, preventing further dollarization, and
avoiding a negative impact on households’ and banks’ balance sheets. They saw continued
benefits from maintaining exchange rate stability, noting that the real exchange rate remained
close to equilibrium in 2009. Directors broadly concurred that the benefits from more flexibility
could be expected to increase in the medium term, as the economy becomes more diversified
and more integrated with international capital markets. They saw merit in close cooperation
between the staff and the authorities in this area.
Directors commended the authorities’ skilful monetary and financial sector responses during the
crisis, including the sharp reductions in reserve requirements and the policy rate, as well as
substantial liquidity support to the banking system. Given rising nonperforming loans, albeit from
a low level, Directors stressed the need for continued close monitoring of the banking system
and strengthened banking supervision. As financial sector health improves and credit growth
resumes, the authorities should gradually exit from crisis-related liquidity support so as to limit
fiscal risks and prevent a pickup in inflation. Directors encouraged the authorities to press
ahead with further reforms to improve monetary policy transmission and access to credit by the
non-oil sector, foster banking sector consolidation, and privatize the International Bank of
Azerbaijan. They welcomed the strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, and looked forward to further progress.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to developing a non-oil export strategy that
focuses on enhancing competitiveness and improving the business environment through further
progress with tax, customs, and financial sector reforms. They welcomed the authorities’
continued commitment to join the World Trade Organization.

Statement by Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, Alternate Executive Director for Republic
of Azerbaijan and Ibrahim Chowdhury, Advisor to Executive Director
May 3, 2010
On behalf of our Azerbaijani authorities, we thank the staff for the comprehensive and
insightful staff report, and for very constructive discussions. Both provide valuable input into
the authorities’ policy formulation and implementation. The authorities broadly agree with
the staff’s appraisal, especially with respect to the need for fiscal and financial sector
reforms. In the post-crisis context, they are even more aware now that sustained economic
growth requires effective management of resource revenues and non-oil sector
diversification. Against this background, the authorities remain committed to developing a
non-oil export strategy that focuses on further improving the business environment.
Since the last Article IV consultation, economic developments in Azerbaijan have been
marked by the global crisis. As highlighted in the staff report, non-oil real GDP growth
declined from 15.7 percent in 2008 to 3.0 percent in 2009, but overall real GDP growth in
2009 still reached an impressive 9.3 percent. The impact of the crisis was mostly felt through
lower oil revenues due to weaker crude oil prices and lower external demand. In addition,
commercial banks cut back their loans to the private sector, as increased risk aversion
lowered access to foreign financing and refinancing became more challenging. On the other
hand, with falling international commodity prices, average annual inflation dropped
drastically from more than 20 percent in 2008 to 1.5 percent in 2009.
Looking beyond 2009, Azerbaijan is expected to benefit from the effects of higher oil prices
and increased external demand. These factors will support economic growth in 2010. In the
first quarter of 2010, non-oil GDP grew at 4.4 percent year-on-year, in line with staff
projections.
The authorities responded successfully to the difficult challenge of managing an abrupt shift
from overheating to a sharp slowdown in the wake of the global crisis. A combination of
revenue and expenditure measures helped support economic activity. On the revenue side, a
number of tax measures were introduced, including a reduction in the profit and income tax
rate effective from January 2010. Notably, despite the large drop in oil prices, the impact on
overall revenue was limited as the budgeted transfers from the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan
(SOFAZ) were fully carried out, allowing the oil fund to fulfill a countercyclical function. On
the expenditure side, lower non-priority spending helped to limit the fiscal deficit. The
authorities agree that, going forward, additional oil fund resources should not be used to
increase spending in 2010, even if oil prices turn out to be higher than budgeted. They also
reiterate their commitment to improve public expenditure efficiency and to ensure mediumterm fiscal sustainability.
Owing to its limited linkages to global financial markets, the Azerbaijani banking system
avoided many of the negative repercussions of the global crisis. Nonetheless, the banking

2
system has not been immune. Nonperforming loans have been rising, although from a low
level, and the banking system experienced a liquidity shortage. The Central Bank of
Azerbaijan (CBA) reduced the reserve requirements for commercial banks’ domestic and
foreign currency deposits to 0.5 percent and increased the deposit insurance coverage to
ensure sufficient liquidity and strengthen confidence in the banking sector. As mentioned in
the staff report, the CBA provided liquidity support and government-guaranteed credit to the
banking sector, in part for onlending to the state oil and aluminum companies that
experienced temporary financing problems as a result of the drop in international commodity
prices. The authorities are aware that liquidity support should be withdrawn as financial
sector health improves, so as to limit fiscal risks and prevent a pickup in inflation. In
addition, the CBA will continue to further improve its monetary policy framework and
instruments, so as to make monetary policy transmission more effective.
The authorities are determined to continue to closely monitor the banking system, strengthen
banking supervision and improve risk management and corporate governance in the banking
sector. In its outlook for 2010, the CBA is confident that it will continue to ensure the
stability of the banking system. To this end, the CBA is developing a medium-term strategy
for banking sector consolidation and optimization. The authorities are hopeful that the
restructuring of the banking sector will increase competition, reduce interest rates in line with
the fall inflation in 2009, and reduce the spread between lending and deposit rates.
The authorities fully concur with staffs’ assessment on the need to eventually increase
exchange rate flexibility in the medium term as the Azerbaijan economy becomes more
diversified and more integrated with international capital markets. They acknowledge the
benefits of developing a new credible anchor to replace the peg, improving exchange rate
risk management, and fostering a deep and liquid foreign exchange market.
The authorities have remained focused on implementing their macroeconomic and structural
reform agenda. Significant progress has been made in achieving more transparency and
accountability in large state enterprises. In 2003, the government established a committee to
implement its obligations under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and
Azerbaijan has since published annual and semi-annual EITI reports. In December 2009,
Azerbaijan released its 11th EITI report. Taking into account that Azerbaijan has instituted a
regular process of disclosing, reconciling and publishing company payments and government
receipts, it became in 2009 the first ever country to complete the EITI’s quality assurance
process, which verifies compliance with EITI principles and criteria. The most notable, yet
simple achievement of the initiative is that the public reporting of revenues from the oil and
gas industry, which did not occur in Azerbaijan before the EITI, has now become routine.
