EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Main developments
The Maltese economy continues experiencing sluggish growth. For a fourth consecutive
year, growth languished in 2004, reflecting an adverse external environment and domestic
factors. The low growth pattern was triggered by shocks to key sectors, and reinforced by the
slowing of its main trading partners and restructuring of the manufacturing sector.
Renewed efforts to consolidate the fiscal accounts substantially reduced the deficit in
2004, and produced tangible parastatal reform. In contrast with recent history, the fiscal
outturn was on target, implying a decline in the deficit of over 2 percent of GDP in 2004.
Also, a fresh wave of reforms led to tangible results, including a better than targeted
operating outturn for Malta Shipyards.
Malta entered ERM-2 on May 2, 2005. The Maltese lira was thus re-pegged to the euro,
and the authorities unilaterally committed to keep the currency at its central parity.
The Central Bank of Malta raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent in
April, and thus restored the interest premium on the lira. The premium was further
enhanced by ERM-2, as the higher interest rates on the sterling and the dollar are no longer
part of the relevant comparator. Foreign exchange losses since late 2004 were arrested.
Policy requirements
Fiscal consolidation. Reversing increases in public debt is key. In 2005, this will require
identifying areas where current expenditure can be under executed, and following through if
revenue projections prove optimistic.
High quality fiscal adjustment and pension reform. A lasting adjustment requires tough
decisions to cut spending and articulate policies to: (i) lower public sector employment;
(ii) shift part of the financial burden of health care services to the end-user, and (iii)
rationalize the welfare system to enhance its effectiveness. This will shield capital spending,
and thereby supporting public investment and economic growth. In the long-run, fiscal
stability hinges on substantive pension reform.
Fostering growth. Aside from fiscal consolidation, unleashing Malta’s growth potential
requires reforms addressing long standing problems in the labor market, including releasing
redundant public sector employment, enhancing human capital, boosting employment rates—
particularly, for women—and streamlining public bureaucracy.
Euro adoption and the financial sector. Malta is well placed to benefit from euro adoption,
provided fiscal consolidation is forthcoming. The financial system is strong and wellsupervised but a number of regulatory measures, particularly regarding property-related
financing, can strengthen its resilience.

debt on a sustainable path and to foster convergence with the EU.
Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Overall, the authorities have concurred with the thrust of the Fund’s policy advice,1 and its implementation has been
spurred by EU membership:
•

Opening markets to international competition has been completed upon EU accession.

•

Progress has been made in consolidating fiscal accounts in 2004, and the medium-term deficit target is
consistent with staff’s proposal. There is a need to rebalance expenditure cuts toward current spending,
and to reform the welfare and pension systems.

•

The pace of privatization and parastatal reform was accelerated in 2004. Further progress in reducing
public sector employment is needed.

•

Restrictions on interest rates were abolished, and interest rates managed more flexibly as the current
account was liberalized gradually, with virtually all restrictions on capital movements dropped upon EU
accession. The independence of the Central Bank of Malta has been increased.

•

ERM-2 entry has followed progress in lowering fiscal deficits. Successful participation, including euro
adoption, hinges on implementing a high-quality fiscal adjustment.

•

Malta has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Sections 2, 3, and 4) of the Articles of Agreement.

II. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
For a fourth consecutive year, growth languished in 2004 (text figure), reflecting
the weakness of, and increasing competition in, Malta’s export markets, as well as
domestic factors (Table 1 and Figure 1). The slowdown in Malta—a highly open and
narrowly based economy—

partners (notably the EU),
and more recently by oil price developments. The real effective exchange rate has
depreciated since 2002, but Maltese exports lost market share (Figure 2) due to increasing
competition from Asia and emerging tourist destinations in Central and Eastern Europe. Still,
domestic factors also played a role. The manufacturing sector restructuring—in part
following the accession-related dismantling of import levies—resulted in declining sales of
processed food products and beverages, and hastened losses in the clothing sector (text
figure). Low employment rates and low human capital have also held back output
(Section III.C) and hobbled employment growth.

Despite weak growth, the fiscal balance improved substantially in 2004 and
parastatal reform gathered steam (Tables 2 and 3). In contrast with recent history, the
fiscal outturn was on target in 2004 (text table) implying a decline in the deficit of over 2
percent of GDP. Much of the improvement

5.
Inflation spiked as a result of one-off domestic factors in 2004. Malta’s longstanding exchange rate peg to a basket of currencies—comprising the euro (70 percent),
sterling (20 percent), and dollar (10 percent)—provided an effective nominal anchor,2 which
was repegged to the euro with no realignment in the value of the Maltese lira (¶19).
Nevertheless, prices jumped by 2.7 percent in 2004 following adjustments in tax rates and
domestic energy prices. Inflationary pressures remained subdued, nonetheless, as modest
increases in public sector wages were partially offset by the declines in (private) service
sector—narrowing the margin of price increases of services over headline inflation
(Figure 3)—and, so far, housing services (rental rates) have not reflected sharp increases in
house prices (¶9).
6.
Given the subdued inflationary pressures and a sizable reserve cushion, the
Central Bank of Malta (CBM) had kept the key policy rate unchanged for more than
1½ years, but raised it in April. Despite the small erosion in the basket-weighted interest
rate premium of the lira from the rising interest rates in the U.S. and the U.K. (Figure 4),
reserves remained largely unchanged through the third quarter of 2004. But facing persistent
reserve losses since late 2004, the CBM decided to increase the intervention rate by 25 basis
points in April 2005 to 3.25 percent. This reestablished the premium, which was further
enhanced upon ERM-2 entry when the higher interest rates of the sterling and dollar dropped
out of the relevant comparator (¶11 and 19).

Inflation has averaged just over 3 percent in the past 20 years. For a discussion of the pros and cons
of the Maltese exchange rate regime see Country Report No. 03/276.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
The discussions centered on leveraging the achievements in 2004 to bring about
a high-quality fiscal consolidation and propel growth. In this connection, fiscal
consolidation presents a dilemma: withdrawing fiscal stimulus could prolong sluggish
economic activity in the short run, but is essential for public debt sustainability. Mitigating
adverse output effects will require putting in place a fully spelled-out fiscal package—
articulating measures to cut current expenditure, safeguard capital spending, and address the
fiscal consequences of aging—and persevering with the restructuring needed to unleash
Malta’s potential. A moderate boost to output could also result from lower interest rates—
consistent with the experience of countries recently entering ERM-2 (Figure 6)—as markets
reassess country risk in line with progress in these areas.
A. Economic Outlook and Short-Run Policy Issues
9.
The near-term outlook remains subdued. With a shared view that growth would
remain below 2 percent in 2005–06 (Table 6), the discussions focused on the main risks to
this scenario:
•

External environment. The authorities agreed that delays in the recovery of Malta’s
main trading partners would weigh on exports in 2005. Next year, an envisaged
modest export led recovery was predicated on a gradual pickup in Europe that,

Semiconductor sector. The authorities noted that the types of products Malta had
increasingly specialized in—automobile and wireless applications—faced strong
demand, and prices could inch up later in the year. But the strong euro and
competitive pressures manifested in the weak first quarter results, made the mission
skeptical regarding the boost that higher prices could provide.

There was agreement that continued fiscal consolidation was essential in 2005,
despite the sluggish economy. The authorities stressed the need to place public finances on
a sustainable path to ensure macroeconomic stability. In this connection, and despite
increases in capital spending—including projects financed by the Fifth Italian Protocol and
EU funds—the 2005 budget envisages lowering the deficit by 1.5 percent of GDP to
3.7 percent of GDP. An unwavering control of recurrent spending—including reducing the

increase relative to
GDP by 0.8 percentage points reflecting increases in non-tax revenues, the impact of a fullyear collection of VAT at the new higher rate, and some adjustments in excise taxes. The
authorities were confident that the normal margins in the budget, and the evolution of
revenue collection thus far would safeguard the deficit target from the statistical effect
associated with the downward revision of GDP in 2004. The mission welcomed efforts to
address recurrent spending and encouraged the authorities to stand ready to underexecute the
budget if revenue projections proved optimistic.
11.
The mission also welcomed the CBM’s decision in April to increase interest
rates. The authorities explained that the adjustment reflected their assessment of economic
and financial developments, including the evolution of the premium of the lira and the
erosion of international reserves. The CBM would continue to use the central intervention
rate to influence short-term interest rates in view of the high concentration in Malta's banking
system (¶20).
12.
The authorities expected that ERM-2 participation would ease external reserve
pressures, which had partly been prompted by market uncertainty over the exchange
rate regime and level. The authorities also commented that the pressures on the exchange

- 12 -

rate had subsided following ERM-2 entry5 and competitiveness indicators broadly support
the view that the lira is not grossly misaligned (Box 2). Nevertheless, the mission pointed to
the persistence of sluggish growth, weak export penetration, and increasing unit labor costs
relative to other new EU members, as indicating a competitiveness problem. But it agreed
that a devaluation would have at best short-lived effects—given the openness of the economy
(trade amounts to almost 200 percent of GDP) and speed of the nominal exchange rate passthrough to prices. Enhancing competitiveness thus required an intensification of reform
efforts (Section III.C).
B. Medium-Term Consolidation and Long-Run Fiscal Challenges
13.
Stressing the growth-enhancing benefits of fiscal consolidation, the authorities
explained their plan to cut the deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP by 2007 (Box 3). To
counteract the envisaged decline in grants from the Fifth Italian Protocol and the EU of about
3 percent of GDP, expenditure cuts relative to GDP of more than 5 percentage points are
planned. Current expenditure cuts (about 2 percentage points) would be achieved through a
broad containment of expenditures (1.3 percentage points), wage moderation and natural
attrition (0.4 percentage points), and smaller contributions to government entities as
parastatal reform continued (0.2 percentage points). The bulk of the proposed cuts
(60 percent) would fall on capital spending, which upon completion of the major
infrastructure projects in 2006, would return to levels consistent with the recent past. The
authorities pointed out that the projected decline in capital spending was overstated in 2007,
because investment projects that could be expected to be financed by European funds from
the 2007–13 EU budget had not been budgeted; the effect on the deficit would be limited to
the domestic cofinancing requirement.
14.
The mission welcomed the ambitious goal to reduce the fiscal deficit by cutting
expenditures but emphasized the need for high-quality adjustment. The consolidation
target is broadly in line with the maximum fiscal deficit that is estimated to be prudent upon
euro adoption (text table) and consistent with a primary surplus resulting in a gradual
reduction in public debt in the medium-term. While acknowledging that efforts to toughen
tax enforcement could reduce the needed expenditure restraint, the mission stressed that a
lasting consolidation will require articulating policies to rationalize current expenditure in
the 2006–07 budgets (Figure 7) and thus provide room to protect capital expenditures
(Section III.C). In particular, the mission stressed the need to take the following actions:

Box 2. Exchange Rate Alignment and Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Prices
The CBM has completed a comprehensive assessment of the degree of real exchange rate
misalignment—using a number of econometric techniques—with the following results:
•

PPP-based cross-country estimates suggest that the lira is overvalued (undervalued) against the euro
by about 6 (2) percent using the HICP (GDP deflator). Differences in the representativeness of the
indexes explain the varying assessments.

•

Behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) time series approach points to a small (2 percent)
overvaluation vis-à-vis the “permanent” equilibrium exchange rate, and virtually no deviation from
the “current” equilibrium exchange rate.

•

Combined PPP-based and BEER panel data measures provide a number of alternative calculations,
with roughly an equal number of these pointing to over and undervaluation; none find the
overvaluation to be greater than 6 percent.

However, misalignment estimates must be interpreted with caution. In particular, data limitations hinder
addressing the issue of whether the estimated equilibrium exchange corresponds to an internal
equilibrium. Also, establishing the relevant country benchmark is difficult given Malta’s idiosyncrasies;
the short time span of the available data impinges on the power of statistical tests to establish the
underlying properties.
Still, with Malta’s degree of openness, it is unlikely that realigning the nominal exchange rate would
result in lasting effects on the real exchange rate. Gauging the degree of pass-through to prices is
complicated, however, by the limited informational content of the data from a peg that has not been
adjusted. The most recent adjustment was the lira devaluation in 1992, in the wake of the ERM crisis.
Staff estimates for that episode (1992–95) suggest that the “long-run” pass-through to prices was in the
range of 80 to 90 percent, the bulk of which occurred within a year (text figure).

Box 3. The Three-Year Fiscal Plan
The 2005 budget provides a plan for the next two years (text table), whose main elements are:
•

Total revenues decline by 3 percent of GDP, but is more than offset by cuts in total
expenditures (5.4 percent of GDP).

•

Capital expenditures are set to fall by about 3 percent of GDP.

•

Public debt declines reflecting primary surpluses beginning in 2005.

Lower public employment. A proactive policy to identify and eliminate redundancies
in the public sector was stressed (¶17). While agreeing on the need to streamline
public sector employment, the authorities expressed concern about the pace, even
allowing for the training and time-bound assistance needed to address social
concerns.

•

Reform health care. Shifting part of the burden in the provision of health care to the
end user—fees per visit and co-payments—to bring about a more rational use of the
system and ease the burden on the public purse. In response the authorities stressed
the need to study the factors pressuring health care spending—including, soaring
prescription prices—and to address these directly.

•

Rationalize social benefits. Critically review and evaluate the list of benefits with a
view to eliminate those that no longer consistent with current needs. Instead, the
authorities explained that abuse presented a greater threat to the welfare system.

•

Extend means testing. This would ensure that welfare benefits and the social safety
net target those in need, and promote social justice by excluding those who are not.
The authorities explained that practical considerations—increased incentives to
underreport income and the need for a new bureaucracy to oversee the revised
system—limited the effectiveness of means testing, despite the mission’s proposal to
scale reductions in benefits and cross-reference indirect indicators of income, such as
electrical power consumption.

The authorities agreed that more resources should be devoted to the budget office, which was
overburdened by the additional responsibilities associated with EU membership. This would
enhance its ability to assess budget execution, address emerging problems early on, and add
an estimation of tax expenditures to the budget documents.
15.
Safeguarding fiscal stability in the long run entails reforming the pension
system. The pay-as-you-go “two-thirds” pension system6 will come under stress as the
population ages in the wake of a sharp drop in fertility rates—half of those prevailing 30
years ago—and life expectancy rises of ten years from the levels of the mid-twentieth
century (Figure 8). The mission noted that demographic trends, if left unaddressed would

increase public expenditure in relation to GDP by 3 percent by 2027, and push the public
sector debt to over 100 percent in 2050. In this connection, the authorities have recently
published a white paper on pension reform, which, provided fiscal consolidation proceeds as
planned, would lower debt in the long-run (Box 4). They explained that, while the
replacement rate remained unchanged, the reform envisaged phased-in adjustments in other
key parameters (text table):

Retirement age would increase to 65 years of age, an increment of five years.

•

Pension benefit base would be calculated using the wages from the last 40 years,
instead of the best three years in the last decade.

•

Contribution period for a full pension would be extended to 40 years, instead of 30
years.

In addition, the reform calls for the creation of a compulsory, privately funded second pillar
and a voluntary third pillar, details of which are to be determined by actuarial studies of the
Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).
16.
The mission found widespread acknowledgement of the ageing problem and, in
welcoming the proposal—including the envisaged periodic reviews—stressed that the
desirable phasing-in required that reforms not be watered down or delayed. Discussions
with social partners revealed differing views on pension reform. Labor unions favored
strengthening the publicly funded first pillar, establishing a voluntary second pillar, and
fostering increases in the retirement age through a more attractive pension package.
Employers favored gradually implementing the obligatory second pillar, even if it implied
larger social security contributions, to ensure that larger firms—with a higher union
presence, and thus less ably to resist calls for its establishment—not be placed at a
disadvantage vis-à-vis smaller firms. Consultations with social partners have concluded, and
the Pension Working Group’s final recommendation are expected to be presented to
government in early summer 2005, and to be in place by 2007.

Box 4. Fiscal and External Sustainability
Fiscal Sustainability. The baseline scenario reflects the authorities’ ambitious fiscal consolidation and
substantive pension reform, which would lower public debt from 75.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 43.7
percent of GDP in 2050 (text figure and Table 7). Without these policies—using historical averages for
real interest rates, output growth and the primary balance—the public debt would exceed 300 percent of
GDP in 2050 (stress test 9, Table 7). Moreover, fiscal consolidation without pension reform would not
suffice to place debt under control, as debt would exceed 100 percent of GDP by the end of the
simulation scenario (stress test 8, Table 7). Other scenarios suggest that the baseline is broadly robust to
the assumptions underlying it (Table 7).

External Sustainability. External assets and liabilities have been growing significantly— almost
quadrupling between 1996 and 2003—with assets continuing to exceed liabilities. Data on external debt
is not publicly available (Appendix II) but the CBM estimates that total gross external debt reached 41
percent of GDP in 2004, largely reflecting borrowings by the banking system and in particular by a new
foreign-owned bank. Significantly, the proceeds of foreign borrowings are typically used for acquisition
of foreign assets in the form of bonds and direct loans. Non-bank external debt—the main source of
potential external debt vulnerability—is low (about 16 percent of GDP), and has declined (text table).
While in recent years Malta ran substantial current account deficits, these were financed by FDI and
other durable inflows, which will likely be boosted by EU membership. Provided fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms take hold, current account deficits should decline due to an increase in export
shares observed in many new EU members.

The authorities stressed that privatization would enhance economic efficiency
and debt reduction. They noted that the privatization process would be largely concluded
by mid-2006 (text table), leaving two final challenges for this legislature: privatizing
Enemalta’s fuel and gas divisions, and Air Malta. The mission welcomed these efforts and
urged the authorities to reduce excess employment in companies slated for privatization, and
to release these resources for more productive uses in the private sector.

C. Fostering Growth
18.
Unleashing Malta’s growth potential will require investing in human capital,
boosting employment rates, and streamlining public bureaucracy. In particular, the
discussions noted the following:
•

The available human capital development indicators portray a worrisome picture
(Figure 9). Developments in labor productivity, particularly compared with new EU
members, provides no solace in this regard (text figure). The authorities recognized
the challenges—including lowering high school drop out rates and boosting the share
of students pursuing careers in science and technology—but explained that the low
level of youth education attainment reflects the absence of a national certification

increases were still
needed. Thus, they did not see merit in the mission’s proposal to target stipends to
those careers in key sectors, nor in subjecting these stipends to means testing.

•

The authorities noted ongoing efforts to make fuller use of the economy’s relatively
abundant labor endowment, which was held back by low female employment rate
(text figure). In addition to the child care project in the budget—providing training
and incentives for companies to establish child care facilities for their employees—
the authorities pointed to the National Action Plan for Employment, which includes
lowering the income tax rate for part-time spouses, providing a one-year tax holiday
for women returning to work after a five-year absence, and establishing child care
regulations and tuition subsidies. In discussing the long run trends, they pointed to the
encouraging fact that there were more female than male post-secondary students. The
mission welcomed these efforts and the continuing analysis of the barriers that
hindered female labor participation.

The authorities explained that streamlining the public sector and establishing a
business-friendly environment were essential to attract FDI and foster domestic
investment needed to create jobs and fuel growth. Even though there have been recent
successes in attracting new investment, and several existing foreign companies are
expanding, more progress is needed. In this connection, the authorities pointed to the
ongoing port reform aimed at lower costs of operating in Malta and the efforts to
establish a one-stop registration for businesses. The mission welcomed this approach,
but saw the need for a systematic analysis to pinpoint areas hindering business
activity.
D. Exchange Rate Policy, Euro Adoption, and the Financial Sector

19.
ERM-2 entry provides continuity to the fixed exchange rate regime. On May 2,
the weight of the euro in the exchange rate basket was increased to 100 percent, and the
central parity was set at 0.4293 lira per euro—the closing rate on the previous working day.
The authorities commented that Malta would no longer have the small flexibility afforded by
the peg to the currency basket. They explained that, in repegging the lira to the euro, a
unilateral commitment was made to keep the lira at its central parity, which would be
facilitated by a strong international reserve position. The authorities observed that their longstanding experience of operating monetary policy under an exchange rate peg bode well for
forgoing the flexibility allowed by the maximum 15 percent band. Moreover, a narrow
band—consistent with fluctuations in the past couple of years, that is, plus-minus 2 percent
(Figure 10)—would afford only a small margin in operating monetary policy, which would
not offset the added uncertainty in its operation. The mission agreed that a small band was
not needed but cautioned that Malta’s ability to operate a hard peg would depend on fiscal
consolidation.
20.
Provided fiscal consolidation is adequately addressed, Malta is well placed to
benefit from euro adoption. The authorities noted some important synergies with the euro
area, both in terms of economic structures (Figure 11) and synchronization of economic
cycles. In the financial sector, deposit and lending rates have increasingly converged to the
euro area levels, but deposit-lending rate spreads still remain wide in Malta, reflecting a high
degree of concentration in the banking sector. In these circumstances, adopting the euro—as
soon as Maastricht conditions have been met and following the minimum 24-month stay in
ERM-2—will serve to lower transaction costs, reduce exchange risk, and expand the range of
profitable trading opportunities.
21.
The authorities considered that Malta’s sound financial system had continued
strengthening and reported improvements in 2003–04. Bank capitalization, liquidity and
profitability indicators improved from very comfortable levels (Table 8). Also,
nonperforming loans have declined steadily in recent years (although they edged up in the
first quarter of 2005). The authorities explained that periodic stress-testing exercises had
revealed limited vulnerability of bank balance sheets to plausible interest rate and exchange
rate shocks, and other risks. They noted that EU membership—for which Malta’s financial
system had been well prepared, including the strengthening and harmonization of its

- 21 -

institutional framework—would generate net benefits for Malta’s financial development
despite the increased competition. Work was ongoing to prepare the implementation of Basel
II, and the authorities provided an update of the progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2003 FSAP (Table 9).
22.
The mission encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant in identifying
financial vulnerabilities, particularly regarding mortgage credit. Weaknesses in the
corporate sector and banks’ high liquidity have resulted in a sharp expansion in mortgage
lending, which has grown by an average of 15 percent annually in the past five years.
Moreover, with a marked rise in house prices in 2004, banks have been recently competing
by providing higher loan-to-value credit, sometimes up to 90 percent or higher. The mission
expressed concern—shared by the authorities—about this trend, and saw the need to tighten
regulations governing mortgage credit. For instance, introducing a rising scale for
provisioning requirements linked with this ratio, which would serve to internalize the
macroeconomic risks of the credit boom. Also, the mission suggested that supervisory bodies
could require banks—in their assessment of the repayment ability of the self-employed—to
consider only the income declared for tax purposes. Aside from helping to cool the market,
this would provide an added incentive to reduce tax evasion.
E. Other Issues
23.
The authorities welcomed the ROSC data module that will take place during
June 22–July 5, as well as efforts to secure technical assistance on fiscal matters.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Efforts to address macroeconomic imbalances and reform the economy in 2004
moved Malta a step closer to reaping the full benefits of EU membership. The fiscal
deficit was reduced substantially—despite sluggish growth—and was complemented by a
number of tangible results in reforming the parastatal sector. These achievements were
recognized in the EC’s favorable decision regarding ERM-2 participation. Moreover, the
continuity of the exchange rate regime, which has served as an effective nominal anchor, was
ensured by re-pegging the Maltese lira to the euro and by the authorities’ unilateral
commitment to maintain the current parity.
25.
In the near term, the pace of growth is likely to remain moderate. The external
environment continues to pose threats to Malta’s two largest sectors: tourism and
semiconductors. Also, increases in unit labor costs relative to other new EU members are
envisaged to impinge on Malta’s ability to compete in export markets; the external current
account is expected to narrow slowly, also due to the strength in fuel and capital good
imports.
26.
Continuing along the road of fiscal rectitude is essential. Fiscal consolidation is
needed to arrest increases in public debt, which otherwise threaten macroeconomic stability
and weaken the credibility of the exchange rate. In 2005, safeguarding the budget target will

- 22 -

require identifying areas where current expenditure can be underexecuted, and following
through if revenue projections prove optimistic. These tasks can be facilitated by
strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Finance through assigning additional staff to the
budget office to analyze and assess budget execution, and to address deviations early on.
This enhanced ability would also serve to introduce a tax expenditure budget as an integral
part of the overall budget.
27.
A lasting adjustment requires that high-quality expenditure measures be
articulated. Without prejudicing ongoing efforts to ensure that all pay their fair share of
taxes, the experience in Europe suggests that durable adjustment requires reducing
expenditures, as opposed to increasing revenues, which are already high. In this connection,
and recognizing the political difficulties, Malta will need to make tough decisions to cut
spending: (i) lowering public sector employment—beyond a strict control on hiring and
natural attrition—and moderate wages; (ii) shifting part of the financial burden of health care
services to the end user, in addition to making other cost-containment efforts; and
(iii) rationalizing the welfare system to enhance its effectiveness as a social safety net by
eliminating outdated benefits and extending means testing to all welfare benefits. As
experience is gained with the new system, adjustments may be warranted. Addressing all of
these areas will be needed to safeguard capital spending.
28.
In the long run, fiscal stability requires substantive pension reform. The gains in
life expectancy and sharp decline in fertility rates place considerable pressure on the pension
system. Implementing the white paper’s proposals—including increasing the statutory
retirement age and establishing a compulsory second pillar—are needed to secure the
system’s financial integrity. Putting in place these reforms by 2007 will facilitate the desired
phasing-in of the adjustments, and the envisaged periodic reviews will enable timely
adjustments to be made in the face of economic and demographic developments.
29.
Revitalizing economic growth will involve complementing fiscal consolidation
with reforms addressing long-standing problems in the labor market, including low
human capital development. Free tertiary education and student stipends treat the
symptoms of a low human capital development, but making education pay is key to boosting
it. There is room, nonetheless, to align student stipends more closely with the needs of the
economy by limiting these to careers of high priority. Aside from social considerations,
extending means testing to stipends could generate savings, which might serve to increase
average stipends. Looking forward, the role of wage compression—resulting from the
collective bargaining system and the creep in minimum wages—in dampening incentives for
education needs to be assessed and reversed.
30.
Making fuller use of Malta’s main resource—its people—calls for continued
efforts to eliminate barriers to female labor market participation. Female participation is
set to improve as the increasing number of female university students complete their studies.
A more difficult challenge will be to facilitate women’s return to the workforce after
childbirth. In this connection, closely monitoring the impact of the measures envisaged in the

- 23 -

National Action Plan for Employment should allow the authorities to focus their efforts on
those programs that prove to be most effective.
31.
Fostering job creation and economic growth entails establishing a vibrant
business environment by streamlining public bureaucracy and lowering the costs of
operating in Malta. A business-friendly environment will play an essential role in boosting
investment and creating jobs. Some reassurance can be taken from the recent successes in
attracting new investment and from the expansion plans of existing foreign companies. But a
quantum leap can result from modernizing the institutional framework and eliminating
outdated regulations stifling entrepreneurship. Further efforts are needed to reduce red tape
and lower the cost of operating on the island, including by reforming the port system.
32.
Provided fiscal consolidation is forthcoming, Malta is well placed to benefit by
adopting the euro. The economy is very open to international trade, and the importance of
the EU—its main trading partner—has risen. These linkages are set to deepen further with
the introduction of a common currency, which will serve to lower transaction costs, reduce
exchange risk, and expand the range of profitable trading opportunities.
33.
Malta’s financial system is strong and well supervised, but its exposure to the
narrow economic base and the booming housing market needs to be watched closely.
The banking system is highly capitalized, and should be able to absorb plausible economic
shocks and the new prudential requirements associated with the forthcoming adoption of
Basel II standards. However, the sharp expansion of mortgage credit needs to be monitored.
34.
A number of regulatory measures may strengthen financial sector resiliency,
especially regarding property-related financing. There is a need to tighten prudential
regulations so as to discourage banks from extending credit with high loan-to-value ratios. In
this connection, tying the scale for provisioning requirements to this ratio should be
considered. Also, supervisory bodies might require banks—in their assessment of the
repayment ability of the self-employed—to consider only the income declared for tax
purposes. Aside from helping to cool the market, this would provide added incentives to
reduce tax evasion. More broadly, the general legal framework governing the rental market is
in need of further revisions—including shortening the lengthy tenant eviction process—to
contribute to an expansion of the rental market and a more balanced environment for
property-related transactions.
35.
Malta’s database continues to improve and is adequate for surveillance. The
timeliness of national accounts and fiscal data requires further strengthening.
36.

It is recommended that the next consultation be held on a 24-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

MALTA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
In the last few years, Malta has made significant progress improving its macroeconomic
statistics. Notably, the National Statistics Office (NSO) was created in March 2001 as an
autonomous and independent institution, superseding the Central Office of Statistics (COS).
The authorities have made significant efforts to provide it with the needed resources and
skilled staff. The NSO is in the process of developing procedures to ensure its coordinating
role, as required by the Statistical Act 2000. Moreover, the authorities have been in close
contact with the ECB and Eurostat to upgrade their statistical systems to meet euro-area
standards, and most of Malta’s statistics can be accessed through Eurostat. Malta has
participated in the GDDS since September 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. These metadata were updated in June 2003. Malta
is also preparing to subscribe to the SDDS.
Real sector data: Data on retail price movements, labor market indicators, and tourism
arrivals are released monthly, usually with a short lag; access to these data is available
through the Internet via NSO’s web site. The NSO completed the project to improve the
coverage of GDP estimates in accordance with ESA 95, and are published on the NSO web
site, with a 3-month lag, since August 2004. The harmonized index of consumer prices
(HICP) was first published in May 2004.
Fiscal data: In accordance with the requirements established for EU membership, Malta has
improved significantly the quality of its fiscal data. Several innovations have been introduced
to make these consistent with ESA 95 methodology. Among these, the government has begun
presenting fiscal data on an accrual basis and has included the transactions of local
governments. Also, more disaggregated information regarding the classification of functions
and transactions of the government has been made available and efforts have been made in
order to improve information on extra-budgetary units, such as those dealing with the
operation of the Treasury Clearance Fund.
Monetary data: Monthly monetary aggregates (which cover deposit money banks,
international banking institutions, long-term credit institutions and investment banks), as
well as interest rates and data for the analytical accounts of the monetary authorities, deposit
money banks, and other banking institutions are available within one month from the end of
the reference period. The recording of the monetary data is now on an accrual basis. The
Central Bank of Malta (CBM) has begun sending data to STA using the new Standardized
Report Forms for monetary statistics.
External sector: Summary balance of payments data (merchandise trade, current account
balance, and selected capital account data) are released on a quarterly basis with a lag of
about three months. More detailed balance of payments data, as well as those on the
international investment position, are released annually, the latter with a lag sometimes of
more than 1 year. Summary trade statistics are released monthly with a lag of about 40 days.
Balance of payments data through the last quarter of 2004 have been published in the June

1/ Includes transportation.
2/ Net portfolio investment flows reflect investments by resident banks in long-term assets, such as bonds and notes. The
drop in "other" financial inflows in 2004 was driven by an increase in loans from resident banks to non-residents and by a
fall in the repatriation of residents' holdings of foreign currency deposits.
3/ The overall balance figures are not strictly comparable with changes in net official foreign reserves because of exchange
rate effects and differences in the timing of valuation.
4/ Includes customers' deposits and sinking funds held with the Central Bank, and other official funds held with the
treasury.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 14, 2005

1.
This statement provides an update on recent developments since the staff report
for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Malta was issued. The new information does not
change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Economic indicators for the second quarter of 2005 point to subdued economic
growth. The evolution of output is consistent with growth lingering below 2 percent in 2005.
Domestic demand advanced moderately as the weakness in private consumption was offset
by a sharp increase in investment (inventory accumulation), which expanded by 8.2 percent
(y-o-y) in the second quarter. The summer tourism season finished strong in August—hotel
occupancy rates were high although prices were weak. An uptick in manufacturing appears
underway, but semi-conductors prices continued to be soft. Inflation was subdued through
August, and will likely remain so if the landmark six-year collective agreement is reached.
So far, the impact of oil prices has been moderate due to the averaging effect of the quarterly
adjustment mechanism for domestic petrol prices.
3.
The outturn of general government accounts through August remains broadly
consistent with the nominal budget target. Revenue collection has been boosted by the
strength in nontax revenue—foreign grants associated with the Italian Protocol and EU
funds—that has more than offset the weakness in tax revenue. Expenditures have reflected
one-off outlays on medical equipment, which have been countered by lower debt service
payments and capital expenditures. In preparation for the 2006 budget, the authorities have
issued an innovative White Paper on fiscal policy covering a five-year timeframe (2006–10).
The paper envisages the fiscal deficit to decline to less than 1½ percent of GDP by 2007, and
proposes a host of measures, including redeploying redundant public sector employees to the
private sector, and establishing means testing to determine eligibility for social benefits. On
pension reform, the authorities are considering the recommendations of the working group.
4.
The current account deficit fell to 9 percent of GDP in the second quarter, a
narrowing of 2 percent of GDP from the previous quarter. A weak recovery in exports of
goods—primarily semiconductors—was accompanied by robust import growth. Increases in
service exports marked the beginning of the high tourism season, but was constrained by
near-full capacity operation in the tourist sector. Caution is needed in interpreting
developments in service exports, however, as the positive errors and omissions reflect the
difficulties in fully capturing this expanding sector.
5.
The Central Bank of Malta has kept interest rates unchanged since April noting
increases in international reserves since ERM-2 entry and subdued inflationary
pressures. The evolution of reserves validates the authorities’ ERM-2 strategy and provides
reasonable assurance that markets have judged the interest rate premium on the Maltese lira
as being appropriate. Developments in monetary aggregates continue to reflect the
reallocation of portfolios toward government securities and longer-term deposits, which are

-2-

not part of M3. Overall domestic credit growth has been weak, but credit to the private sector
continued to growth appreciably—almost 7 percent in the 12 months to August—reflecting a
buoyant mortgage market.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Exeucitve Director for Malta
and Lucio Landi, Advisor to Executive Director
October 14, 2005

Introduction
The Maltese authorities would like to express their deep appreciation to Mr. Hoffmaister and
his team for the constructive discussions held in the capital and for the well-balanced Staff
Report. The authorities are in broad agreement with the staff’s main conclusions. Over the
past few years the policy dialogue with staff has been very fruitful and staff’s
recommendations have been broadly implemented, as Box 1 in the paper clearly recognizes.
Recent macroeconomic developments and outlook
Malta has adopted a totally liberalized trade and capital regime and implemented a bold
program of reforms to strengthen the market infrastructure, following membership in the
European Union in May 2004. The aim of these policies is to enable the economy to take full
advantage of the European Union membership. However, as a result of these more open
policies, the Maltese economy is more exposed to external developments.
The Maltese economy is projected to grow by 1 percent in 2005, roughly the same rate as
that recorded in 2004. This growth rate remains below potential and mainly reflects the
persistent weakness in external demand for manufactured goods, particularly electronic
components, and tourism. The main factor driving economic growth this year is thus
expected to be investment, in both the public and private sectors.
Higher imports of capital equipment and consumer goods, the latter reflecting an ongoing
shift in household consumption patterns following total trade liberalization in 2004, are
expected to result in a worsening of the external account, especially as exports of goods and
services continue to experience only minimal growth at best. Consequently the current
account deficit as a percentage of GDP is now expected to exceed 8 percent this year. The
capital and financial account, on the other hand, should register a significant surplus
underpinned by inflows of foreign direct investment and capital transfers, particularly from
the EU.
With regard to inflation, the generally slow pace of the economy is expected to dampen
inflationary pressure. However, inflation is expected to remain above the 2 percent level as a
result of higher energy prices. Concerning the situation of the labor market, wage increases
should remain moderate, while a slight reduction in the unemployment rate is expected as
investment continues to pick up in light of the industrial restructuring program and ongoing
infrastructure projects.1

of 2004. Source: A Better Quality of Life, 2006-2010, Pre-budget Document, The Maltese Government.

-2Fiscal policy and debt sustainability
The authorities are fully aware that the adherence to a fixed exchange rate policy, the efforts
to align the economy closely with that of the European partners, and the need for reducing
the public debt require a high quality program adjustment. In 2004 important improvements
were achieved (an on-target fiscal outturn and some implemented parastatal reforms) which
have paved the way for further consolidation. In line with the medium-term fiscal program,
the authorities are committed to reducing the fiscal deficit substantially, despite the weak
GDP growth projected for this year and the next. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to drop
from 5.2 percent in 2004 to 3.7 this year, and continue to decline to 2.3 in 2006, and 1.4 in
2007. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is also projected to decline from 75.6 percent in 2004 to
74.4 in 2005, to 72.9 in 2006 and to 72.8 in 2007, reverting the upward trend shown in the
last years.
The ambitious fiscal consolidation plan hinges on a comprehensive, articulated, and
calibrated set of measures aiming at fiscal stability, while allowing some stimulus for growth.
The key features of the plan are as follows. First, in 2005 cuts in recurrent spending
(reduction in the public sector employment, re-deployment of employees, and wage
moderation) and increases in tax revenues are projected. Second, to reduce the deficit to 1.4
percent in 2007, expenditure cuts over two years totaling 5.4 percentage points of GDP (40
percent in current expenditure and 60 percent in capital spending) are projected. The
reduction in public spending is accompanied by a decline in total revenues of 3 percent of
GDP. Third, to ensure long-term sustainability of public debt and address the aging problem,
a far-reaching pension reform is envisaged to be put in place in 2007, centered on the
following elements: a) a 5-year increase in the retirement age, b) revision of the pension
benefit base, extended to consider the wages from the last 40 years instead of the best 3 years
in the last decade; c) extension of the contribution period to 40 years; 4) a compulsory
privately-founded second pillar and voluntary third pillar; 5) periodic review of the new
pension system over time.
The European Commission in its February 2005 assessment stated that "the prudent
underlying macro-economic scenario and the nature of the announced measures aimed at
reducing the deficit, as well as budgetary projections set up in the program, make the
consolidation path broadly plausible."
The authorities fully agree with staff on the need for rationalizing public spending in the
2006-2007 period in the areas of public employment, health care, and social benefits;
however, they prefer different implementation actions, or a more cautious pace, than those
suggested by staff. For example, with regard to the reform of the health care system, the
authorities have introduced pilot reference pricing for the procurement of pharmaceuticals,
instead of shifting the cost of health care to the end user through co-payments, as suggested
by staff.
As the DSA exercise shows that debt is projected to decrease to 43.7 percent of GDP in
2050, provided that the envisaged fiscal adjustment and the pension reform are both
implemented. Such a scenario appears to be robust with respect to a series of stress tests. As
far as external debt is concerned, while official data are not available, the main source of

-3vulnerability, namely the non-banking component, is estimated to be low and declining over
time. The public component of the external debt is very low and estimated at 4.3 percent of
GDP for 2004.
Monetary policy
A major development this year was the participation of the Maltese lira in the ERM II. Upon
entry into the mechanism on May 2, the Maltese lira was re-pegged from the previous
currency basket to the Euro, with the central parity rate being set equal to the previous day's
closing level. In order to retain the stability and benefits of a fixed exchange rate regime
enjoyed in the past, the Maltese Authorities have unilaterally decided to maintain the
exchange rate of the Maltese lira at the central parity rate, eschewing the use of the standard
fluctuation bands. The transition to the ERM II occurred smoothly and did not require
fundamental policy changes. Monetary policy and the level of short-term interest rates will in
fact continue to be oriented to supporting the exchange rate peg.
Indeed, in April, prior to ERM II entry, the Central Bank of Malta raised its central
intervention rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent, following a period in which the Bank’s
external reserves had declined. The rise in interest rates was intended to curb excessive credit
growth, dampen inflationary pressures and help address imbalances between saving and
spending. The increase in official interest rates, and Malta’s subsequent participation in ERM
II in May, helped to stabilize the Bank’s external reserves and these continued to increase
over the summer.
Structural reforms
Malta faces a competitiveness problem that requires the implementation of structural
reforms.
The authorities are committed to a wide range of measures to increase the growth potential
and competitiveness of the economy: a) completion of the privatization process by mid-2006,
with the exception of the energy sector and Air Malta; b) increased investment in education
and human capital to raise labor productivity; c) increased participation rate, especially for
women, by more flexible labor practices, and childcare schemes; d) streamlined public
bureaucracy and the establishment of a business-friendly environment (in this regard the
reform of the port system, which is scheduled to be implemented from June next year, is
crucial).
Concerning education, in line with the staff’s recommendations, the authorities launched in
September 2005 the reform of student grants and stipends, focusing on increased benefits for
poor students and for those enrolled in degree programs in science and technology,
considered relevant for the country’s economic development. On the contrary, grants and
stipends for students enrolled in other types of degree programs have been decreased. As a
strategic goal, the government intends to increase the participation rate in tertiary education
from 23 to 30 percent by 2010.

-4In July a pre-budget document2 set forth the strategies for the government’s action over the
coming years. Inter alia, there will be a shift from direct taxation to environmental-related
taxes, the introduction of tax incentives to stimulate the rental market, and the revision of the
child allowance system in consideration of the aging population and falling birth rates.
Financial sector
The financial sector has been strengthened over the last few years, in view of EU accession,
and is well supervised. The authorities implemented almost all the 2003 FSAP
recommendations. The process for the introduction of Basel II recommendations is under
way. The authorities are vigilant on the developments of the mortgage market, and stand
ready to adopt additional measures if required. As a preliminary step, in August the
government asked the Financial Services Authority of Malta to probe banks’ lending terms
with the view of tighten regulations on the provision of mortgage credit if necessary.
Statistics
As staff recognize, the macroeconomic statistics system has greatly improved in recent years,
in order to meet the Euro-area standards. The authorities are committed to improving the
timeliness of national accounts and fiscal data.
Concluding remarks
The authorities are committed to strengthening the policy dialogue with staff in the coming
years and to pursuing fiscal consolidation in view of the adoption of the Euro. In this regard,
they would like to underscore the importance of receiving technical assistance from the IMF
on fiscal matters.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Malta
On October 14, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Malta.1
Background
Notwithstanding Malta joining the European Union on May 1, 2004, growth languished in 2004
for a fourth consecutive year. Slow growth reflected the weakness of, and increasing
competition in, Malta’s export markets, as well as domestic factors. The slowdown had begun
with shocks to the key sectors, and was reinforced by slow growth in Malta’s trading partners
and by recent oil price rises. Despite real effective exchange rate depreciation since 2002,
exports suffered from increasing competition from Asia and emerging tourist destinations.
Still, domestic factors have also played a role. Manufacturing sector restructuring resulted in
declining sales in those sectors coming under increasing competition. Low employment rates
and low human capital have also held back output and hobbled employment growth.
Although growth was weak, the fiscal balance was improved substantially in 2004,
and parastatal reform gathered steam. In contrast with recent history, the fiscal outturn was on
target in 2004, implying a decline of over 2 percent of GDP in the deficit. Much of the
improvement reflected the strength in current revenues. Nontax revenues—namely the Fifth
Italian Protocol, and European funds—accounted for the bulk of the increase, but also tax
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2revenues were sustained by a hike of 3 percentage points in the VAT rate that rose to
18 percent and the establishment of an ecotax. On the expenditure side, total expenditure
increased in relation to GDP, reflecting higher current spending; capital expenditure remained
unchanged but lower than targeted. A fresh groundswell of parastatal reform resulted in
tangible results, including a better-than-targeted operating outcome for Malta Shipyards.
Nonetheless, public debt continued increasing, rising to over 75 percent of GDP in 2004.
The current account deficit deteriorated sharply to over 10 percent of GDP in 2004, as imports
surged—reflecting an influx of consumer goods, strong imports of capital goods, and a
mounting energy bill—and exports remained weak. External reserves loses were contained at
3¾ percent of GDP, however, partly due to large positive net errors and omissions, which
could reflect unrecorded economic activity, notably in the financial sector.
Inflation spiked as a result of one-off factors in 2004. The long-standing exchange rate peg
provided an effective nominal anchor, which was repegged to the euro (with no realignment)
when Malta entered ERM2 on May 2, 2005. But prices jumped as tax rates were adjusted.
Also, domestic energy prices reflected rises in world oil prices. Wage pressures remained
subdued, however, as modest increases in public sector wages were partially offset by the
declines in (private) service sector. And so far housing services—rental rates—have not
followed the intensification of house price increases.
Given the subdued inflationary pressures and a sizable reserve cushion, the Central Bank of
Malta had kept the key policy rate unchanged for more than 1½ years, but in April raised it 25
basis points to 3.25 percent in the face of persistent reserve losses since late 2004;
the interest rate premium on the Maltese lira was further enhanced by entry into the ERM2
when the higher interest rates of the pound sterling and dollar dropped out of the relevant
comparator. Broad money expanded modestly, while domestic credit increased by about
5 percent in 2004, fueled by real estate lending.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities on Malta’s successful accession to the
European Union and the smooth initial transition to a lira/euro peg in the context of ERM2.
Commendable progress has also been achieved in strengthening macroeconomic
management, including the substantial reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2004 despite weak
economic growth, and in reforming the parastatal sector. Directors observed that Malta is
well-positioned to derive the full benefits of euro adoption, provided continued progress is
made in consolidating fiscal accounts and reforming the economy to promote private
sector-led growth.
Although short-term growth prospects are moderate, Directors stressed that continued
consolidation of Malta’s public finances remains a key priority in light of the sharp increase in
public debt, which—if not addressed—would threaten macroeconomic stability and weaken the
credibility of the exchange rate. Achieving the 2005 budget target will be essential, and
Directors encouraged the authorities to identify proactively areas where current spending could

-3be contained—a process that would be facilitated by assigning additional staff to the budget
office. It will also be important to follow through should revenue projections prove to be
overoptimistic.
Directors underscored the importance of high-quality fiscal adjustment to reduce the fiscal
deficit further, while protecting capital spending in priority areas. While welcoming the
authorities’ commitment under the medium-term fiscal program and ongoing efforts to improve
tax administration, they stressed that durable adjustment will entail lowering expenditure.
This will involve politically difficult but necessary decisions aimed at reducing public sector
employment, shifting part of the financial burden of health care to the end user, and reforming
the welfare system to enhance its effectiveness as a social safety net. Directors also
recommended extending means testing to those welfare benefits that are not currently
covered. Progress in these areas will require continued consensus-building efforts, and some
Directors also advised the authorities to proceed at a cautious pace in some of the most
sensitive areas.
Directors saw the reforms envisaged in the White Paper on the pension system as important
steps that would bolster long-run fiscal stability by addressing the fiscal consequences of
population aging. In particular, they highlighted the importance of raising the statutory
retirement age to secure the pension system’s financial integrity. The establishment of a
compulsory, privately funded second pillar should complement the pay-as-you-go old-age
pension. Directors urged the authorities to begin implementing reforms promptly to ensure that
measures can be phased in gradually, and to avoid the need to take more drastic actions
when the demographic shock is imminent.
To revitalize economic growth and enhance competitiveness, Directors stressed the need to
complement fiscal consolidation with structural reforms aimed at developing human capital and
raising labor productivity. While acknowledging recent efforts to align student grants and
stipends more closely with the needs of the economy, they saw room for further strengthening
incentives for education, including through reforms to increase wage dispersion. Directors also
underscored the importance of improving labor utilization and welcomed efforts to eliminate
barriers to female participation in the labor market. In this regard, they urged the authorities to
continue assessing the impact of the measures included in the National Action Plan for
Employment, with a view to focusing efforts on those measures that prove to be effective.
Directors stressed that a business-friendly environment will be key to boosting investment and
fostering job creation. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to the ambitious
privatization plan, and looked forward to its expeditious implementation. Directors also
encouraged further efforts to streamline bureaucracy, eliminate outdated regulations,
and, more generally, lower the cost of operating on the island, including by reforming the port
system and establishing a one-stop registration for businesses.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to increase domestic interest rates in the run-up
to ERM2, and noted that markets have so far judged the interest rate premium on the Maltese
lira as being appropriate. Going forward, they considered that Malta is well poised to benefit

-4from euro adoption, since its openness to international markets and close trade links with the
European Union are likely to increase even further as the introduction of the common currency
will lower transaction costs, reduce exchange risk, and expand the range of profitable trading
opportunities. Directors nevertheless emphasized that Malta’s significant current account
deficit underscores the need for the authorities to persevere with fiscal consolidation and step
up structural reforms to boost the economy’s competitiveness, including through greater
attention to labor market flexibility and wage moderation.
Directors noted that Malta’s financial system appears to be sound and well supervised.
The highly capitalized banking system should be able to absorb economic shocks, as well as
the new prudential requirements associated with Basel II standards. Directors cautioned,
however, that the increasing bank exposure to the booming housing market calls for close
monitoring. They urged the authorities to tighten prudential regulations to discourage banks
from extending credit with high loan-to-value ratios. This could involve tying provisioning
requirements to that ratio, and requiring that banks consider only the income declared for tax
purposes when assessing the repayment ability of the self-employed. Directors also
underscored the need to address the problems affecting the housing market, in particular by
reforming the legal framework governing the rental market.
