STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Qatar is implementing an ambitious diversification strategy through a large
public investment program, while retaining its systemic role in the global natural gas
market. The policy framework is being strengthened in a number of areas, including
fiscal and financial policies. Growth is expected to remain strong this year, but will slow
going forward. The recent large drop in oil prices will lead to a substantial
deterioration of the fiscal and external balances.
Focus. This year’s consultation focused on these key issues:
1.
Living with cheap oil. Qatar’s public finances remain sustainable at
expected oil prices, but in contrast to the recent past, projected budget balances no
longer appear consistent with intergenerational equity. Measures to improve the
budget balance by 5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP should be implemented
gradually over the medium term. Policymakers should specify clear medium-term fiscal
objectives, make the annual budgets binding, and further increase transparency of
fiscal accounts. The prospects of persistently low oil prices and slowing medium-term
growth also call for intensification of diversification efforts through further
improvements in the business environment, higher education quality, and labor market
reforms, which would also make growth more inclusive.
2.
Risks from public investments. The ongoing investment program is
essential for economic development, but entails a risk of overheating the economy in
the near term, while creating overcapacity over the medium term. Recent progress in
improving public investment management to tackle these risks is welcome.
Consideration should be given to raising the real estate transaction fees to deter
speculators and further increasing land supply.
3.
Financial sector. Banks remain sound and the financial regulatory agenda
is moving ahead, but emerging risks and vulnerabilities need to be carefully monitored.
These include rapidly growing credit to selected sectors and across the border. Further
enhancements to the early warning system, including improving availability of real
estate statistics, are needed.

CONTEXT
1.
Qatar is implementing an ambitious diversification strategy, while retaining its
systemic role in the global natural gas market. Qatar accounts for one-third of global LNG
trade and has emerged as an important global financial investor, labor importer, and donor.1 The
authorities are executing a $200 billion infrastructure program to advance economic
diversification and prepare for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Qatar ranks favorably in social and
governance indicators in the GCC region. The policy framework is being strengthened in the
areas of fiscal policy and institutions, financial regulation, macroprudential policies, and debt
market development, consistent with IMF advice (Annex I).
2.
The steep fall in oil prices provided a new context for this year’s Article IV
consultation. Having fluctuated in a narrow range of about $100-120 a barrel during the last
several years, the Brent oil price

RECENT MACRO-FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND
SPILLOVERS
3.
Qatar has maintained a strong growth momentum so far, with the recent oil price
slump driving a stock market correction. Real GDP growth has been stable at about 6 percent
over the past three years, mostly driven by a double-digit expansion of the non-hydrocarbon
sector. This rapid growth rate has in turn reflected large public investments to diversify the
economy and prepare for the FIFA 2022 World Cup (Figure 1). The strong growth performance
notwithstanding, Qatar’s financial markets have continued to be affected by spillovers from
geopolitical events and, in particular, oil price volatility (Figure 2). The sharp drop in oil prices has
triggered a stock market correction and a modest re-pricing in the Credit Default Swap (CDS)
1

Qatar’s investments by its sovereign wealth fund are estimated at about $250 billion by the Sovereign Wealth
Fund Institute. About 90 percent of Qatar’s population are expatriate workers. Remittances by these workers
amounted to an estimated $13 billion in 2014, about 6 percent of GDP. Qatar has also committed substantial
financial aid, especially to countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

market. However, the yield on the long-term U.S. dollar-denominated Qatar sovereign bond has
stayed broadly stable at around 3 percent.
4.
Rapid growth has been accompanied by substantial changes in relative prices.
With rents constituting over 30 percent of the CPI basket, a strong inflow of expatriate workers
amid a diminishing housing market slack pushed up inflation to 3¾ percent in summer 2014.
Headline inflation has eased to 2¾ percent in December 2014, assisted by falling global food
and other commodity prices and a stronger U.S. dollar to which the Qatar Riyal is pegged.
Meanwhile, growth in real estate prices accelerated to 35 percent year-on-year in December as
new housing supply is slow to accommodate demand from expatriates and the government
continues purchases of land for infrastructure projects. Anecdotal evidence also points to some
speculative activity in the real estate market in anticipation of public investments. Real estate
valuations appear on the upper end of a range consistent with fundamentals (Figure 1, Box 1).
5.
The budget continues to post large surpluses (Figure 3). The central government
budget surplus increased to 14 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2013/14 (the fiscal year ends March)
due to strong revenues and expenditure restraint, especially on non-wage discretionary
spending. The revenue strength partly

6.
Monetary and credit conditions remain accommodative in the context of the
exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. Following volatility driven by external events during 2013,
the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) has managed to keep banking system liquidity and T-bill rates
generally stable (Figure 2). Domestic credit grew by 10 percent year-on-year in December 2014,
with private sector credit growth accelerating to 20 percent, supported by robust demand from

construction contractors, services, traders, and consumers (Figure 4). Real estate credit has
generally grown in line with the non-hydrocarbon economy. In contrast, public sector credit has
recently been contracting, owing partly to the close monitoring of public sector borrowing by the
Ministry of Finance. Macroprudential policy setting has stayed broadly neutral, with the key
levers such as the loan-to-value ratio in line with international norms.
7.
Banks are well capitalized and liquid. As of September 2014, Tier 1 capital exceeds
15 percent of risk-weighted assets and non-performing loans (NPLs) remain below 2 percent. The
banking system is highly profitable, with a return on assets at 2 percent. Liquidity buffers are
strong. The aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio has remained at about 1 over the past year, with the
foreign funding of commercial banks continuing to fall modestly as a share of total liabilities.
Cross-border assets have grown to about 20 percent of banks’ assets (Figure 4).
8.
The authorities have made significant progress on financial regulation. Most
Basel III regulations were introduced last year. The QCB issued instructions for the loan-todeposit ratio in mid-2014. The authorities are implementing their December 2013 Strategic Plan
for Financial Regulation, which laid out a broad agenda for moving to risk-based regulation,
expanding macro-prudential oversight, strengthening market infrastructure, and enhancing
consumer and investor protection. The QCB Governor chairs the Financial Stability and Risk
Committee, providing a framework for common oversight by regulatory agencies.
9.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Qatar. The peg to the
U.S. dollar has served Qatar well in periods of both high and low oil prices by anchoring prices of
tradables and providing stability to income flows and financial wealth. Qatar also hosts a large
number of expatriate workers whose wages are set internationally. The potential disadvantages
of the fixed exchange rate regime in terms of the limited scope for independent monetary policy
can be addressed through fiscal and macroprudential policies, while the peg’s stability is
underpinned by Qatar’s large positive net foreign investment position. An assessment of the
exchange rate level is complicated by the undiversified structure of Qatar’s exports largely
depended on hydrocarbons. That said, staff estimates do not find evidence of a current account
gap using two alternative techniques (Annex II). In addition, staff analysis suggests that the
global share of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon exports and the share of Qatar’s imports in GDP have
remained broadly stable in recent years. The composition of financial flows appears to have been
relatively stable as well.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Staff expects growth to remain robust in the near term, with inflationary
pressures contained despite the tight real estate market.

GDP growth. Despite the fall in oil prices—which will pass through to Qatar’s LNG prices
with a lag of up to a year—real growth could accelerate to about 7 percent this year as the
Barzan field begins natural gas production. Non-hydrocarbon growth is expected to remain in
double digits in 2015 as the path of public expenditures is unlikely to be affected by oil market

11.
The authorities have not yet updated their quantitative macroeconomic
framework but have similar qualitative views as staff. The official forecast prepared by the
Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics last year was based on the crude oil price of
$97 a barrel. This assumption reflected market prices at the time, but is now considerably higher
than current oil prices. Back then, growth was projected at 7.7 percent and 7.5 percent during
2015-16, while consumer price inflation was forecast at about 3.5-3.7 percent. In February, the
Minister of Finance indicated he expected growth at 7 percent and inflation at 3 percent in 2015,
closer to the IMF forecasts. As for the medium-term outlook, the authorities agreed with staff
that growth will likely slow from current levels. The authorities will unveil their updated

macroeconomic forecast in the next Qatar Economic Outlook, which is typically published around
mid-year.
12.
In staff’s view, the large drop in oil prices will lead to a substantial deterioration
in fiscal and external balances. The delayed impact of the recent oil price decline on
hydrocarbon receipts will be increasingly felt over the course of this year. Despite the IMF staff’s
assumption of a gradual recovery in the Brent oil price to about $74 a barrel by the end of the
decade—reflecting indications from the futures markets at the time of the consultation—the
fiscal and external sectors will remain under pressure. The reasons are twofold: hydrocarbon
exports will stagnate, reflecting a voluntary investment moratorium and maturing oil fields, and
budget expenditures and imports will grow, albeit at a moderate pace. In sharp contrast to recent
years, the government budget is projected to fall into a deficit from 2016 onwards. However, the
authorities are projected to reduce public debt while accumulating net financial assets in the
medium run, thanks partly to capital gains from the QIA’s substantial investments. The current
account surplus will drop from over 30 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2 percent of GDP in 2020. The
authorities acknowledged that the sizeable budget and external surpluses recorded in recent
years will shrink given the lower hydrocarbon prices. The authorities are currently assessing the
implications of the oil price drop for Qatar Petroleum revenues.
13.
Staff noted that the main risks are related to the possibility of lower-than-expected
oil and natural gas prices and the public investment program.

External risks. The main external risk remains the possibility of lower-than-expected oil
and natural gas prices given slow global growth, rising unconventional oil supplies and, over the
long term, growing competition in the LNG market. Oil prices could also surprise on the upside if
geopolitical risks escalate or if the effect of the recent oil price decline on unconventional
producers exceeds expectations. Revenue losses from lower oil and natural gas exports would be
the most significant spillover channel for Qatar. The non-hydrocarbon sector would be cushioned
by the government’s spending commitments. However, spillovers could be amplified by falling
liquidity in the banking system if the government and hydrocarbon-exporting companies slow
deposit growth, especially if this coincides with tighter U.S. monetary policy, mobilization of
resources by participants in the infrastructure program, and the recently-introduced loan-todeposit ratio. Qatar’s external borrowing costs could increase if low oil prices persist, and there is
scope for adverse regional spillovers if investors fail to differentiate between Qatar and less
resilient oil-exporting countries. The financial channel could also become important in other
circumstances, given Qatar’s sizeable foreign assets and the increasing interconnectedness of
local banks and financial markets with the global economy.

Note: Upside/downside scenarios correspond to oil prices higher/lower by US$25 a barrel (one standard deviation in oil prices) from 2015 onwards.


Domestic risks. The ongoing public investment program—while essential for further
economic development and meeting FIFA-related commitments—entails the possibility of overheating the economy in the near term and low return and overcapacity in some sectors over the
medium term.
14.
The authorities agreed that hydrocarbon prices were the key channel for
spillovers from the global economy, while taking note of Qatar’s increasing
interconnectedness with global financial markets. Both futures prices and analysis of the oil
industry’s cost structure suggest that medium-term oil prices should be above today’s levels, but
may not return to the previous highs. Despite the adverse impact on the budget and external
balances, the authorities saw limited scope for spillovers from low oil prices to local nonhydrocarbon activity given the unchanged path of fiscal expenditures. The U.S. interest rate hike,
if it materializes this year, would have minimal immediate effects, partly because Qatar’s main
policy rate remains almost ¾ percentage point above the prevailing Fed Funds Rate. The crossborder activities of Qatar banks have increased substantially in recent years—albeit from a fairly
low level—and are closely monitored.
15.
The authorities and staff agreed that Qatar has policy space to deal with
unexpected circumstances in the short term. Fiscal buffers and Qatar’s available natural
resources are sizeable, and spending is unlikely to be affected by falling hydrocarbon prices or
market volatility in the near term. The QCB can inject liquidity into the financial system through
discount window and repo operations, and the government can provide additional liquidity,
including in foreign currency, by managing portfolios of the QIA and public sector enterprises.
The administration continually monitors risks from the public investment program.

This is an inverse of the above scenario with lower hydrocarbon prices, caused by sustained tensions

Large infrastructure spending could lead to cost overruns and inflation in the short term, while
delivering disappointing productivity gains over the medium term. In particular, if labor productivity
growth does not pick up, non-hydrocarbon growth could be only 2.5 percent in 2020. Reputational
risks associated with reports of poor labor standards of some expatriate workers could lead to
difficulties with hiring. Enhancements to the early warning system and a comprehensive public
investment management framework would help manage macroeconomic risks. Macroprudential
measures and liquidity withdrawal could address excessive credit growth while smoother public
spending would help contain generalized inflation. Consideration should be given to increasing real
estate transaction fees to deter speculators. Continued efforts to enhance labor protection and mobility
would mitigate reputational risks and make growth more inclusive.

If the U.S. Fed tightens monetary policy sooner or by more than expected, the net global growth and
oil price impact would be moderate and depend on whether tightening is in response to
unexpectedly-fast growth or lower-than-expected spare capacity. Oil prices could fall by less than
5 percent (see the first scenario to infer implications for Qatar growth). The normalization of U.S.
monetary policy would also tighten financial conditions in Qatar, although with a delay. If
reassessments of sovereign risk or geopolitical tensions stoke capital flow volatility, the risks would
be more significant. Tighter U.S. monetary policy could also prompt a surge in the value of the dollar
and hence the riyal in effective terms. The price of imports would fall, leading to an improvement in
the trade balance and lower inflation in the short term, while the trade balance would deteriorate
marginally once volumes adjust. The U.S. dollar strength would have a minimal impact on growth
given small non-hydrocarbon exports and limited substitutability between domestic production and
imports. Portfolios holdings abroad in non-USD currencies would suffer moderate valuation losses.
Banks should prove resilient as any open foreign exchange positions (subject to prudential limits) are
largely in U.S. dollars. Continued strong fundamentals would likely prevent excessive volatility in the
Qatar financial markets, but banks’ profit margins would shrink and some individual banks reliant on
wholesale funding could face liquidity pressures. Large financial cushions and a policy framework are in
place to mitigate the impact.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

POLICY CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES
A.

Living with Cheap Oil, while Maintaining Intergenerational Equity

16.
Staff indicated that Qatar’s public finances remain sustainable at projected oil
prices, but in contrast to the recent past, projected budget balances no longer appear
consistent with intergenerational equity. In the short run, staff projects a reduction in
government financial assets due to fiscal deficits and debt repayments. The net financial assets
will start growing again once oil prices

policies would be consistent with intergenerational equity if oil prices turned out to be higher
than IMF assumptions by roughly $10 a barrel. However, assuming the oil market stabilizes
around the IMF staff assumptions, additional measures to improve the budget balance worth
5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP should be phased in gradually over the medium term.5 These
could include further efforts to prioritize public investment while raising its efficiency, a gradual
reduction in subsidies, additional savings in administrative expenses, and new non-hydrocarbon
revenues (Box 2).

The authorities noted that fiscal policies became prudent well before the oil price
drop and budget reforms remain on track. The administration appointed in mid-2013 has
significantly slowed the growth of current spending, and restraint on current expenditure is
expected to be maintained going forward (Figure 3). Capital expenditures and related
operational spending are being reviewed, with the intention of establishing medium-term
envelopes. Discussions with key stakeholders on appropriate revenue-raising options could start
later this year. Policymakers have adopted a number of recommendations by staff to improve the

institutional framework, including establishing a macro-fiscal unit and a public investment
management department. The Ministry of Finance is preparing a medium-term strategy, planned
for completion by mid-2015, to inform the budget process starting next year—an important step
toward establishing a binding medium-term budget framework.
18.
Staff welcomed the ongoing budget reforms, reiterated the need for additional
consolidation measures, and stressed that the oil price slump highlights the need for a
clear medium-term fiscal framework, including contingency plans (see accompanying
Selected Issues Paper). In staff’s view, the strategy document should formulate clear medium-term
fiscal objectives and communicate

crucial to address risks (see Debt
Sustainability Analysis in Annex IV). With respect to possible tax policies, staff recommended
broadening of the corporate income tax base and introducing a low-rate value-added tax (VAT),
while cautioning against reliance on user fees and charges (Box 2). Further improvement in the
transparency of fiscal accounts, including financial transactions of the government, would
facilitate a more accurate assessment of Qatar’s fiscal position in the context of low oil prices.

B.

Managing Overheating Risks and Securing High Return from Public

Projects
19.
The authorities are mindful of the risks associated with the public investment
program, including related financial sector vulnerabilities. Given Qatar’s adverse experience
with double-digit inflation during 2006-08, the Ministry of Finance has taken steps to smooth the
time profile of investments. Additional land is being provided to priority sectors such as housing,
logistics, and warehousing. The National Logistics Committee follows price trends and tries to
address bottlenecks, including by taking pro-active measures to improve the supply chain.
Exposures to the real estate sector are tightly monitored by the Qatar Central Bank, with total
banking exposures limited as a share of capital and limits imposed on the borrower’s loan-tovalue (LTV) and debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios. QCB stress tests suggest that NPLs for real
estate, construction contractors, and consumer loans would need to jump to nearly 30 percent
before the banks’ capital ratios fall below the regulatory minimum. In addition, the loans to state12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

owned enterprises (which account for about 40 percent of domestic credit) have traditionally
been fully performing even during times of adverse macroeconomic conditions.
20.
In staff’s view, the recent sharp swings in relative prices warrant enhanced
monitoring and some changes to the policy mix.

Further enhancements to the policymakers’ early warning system are needed to monitor
emerging risks, in particular with respect to inflation and real estate sector risks (see
accompanying Selected Issues Paper). There is scope for substantial improvement of the
availability and quality of the real estate sector statistics including price indices, real estate
vacancies, and characteristics of real estate transactions.

Policymakers can take additional steps to ensure adequate supply of land and affordable
housing. To reduce any speculative pressures by cash investors in the real estate market,
consideration should be given to raising real estate transaction fees, which are at 0.25 percent
low by international standards.6 The fees could be differentiated so that first-time homebuyers
pay very little, while short-term investors are penalized. Rent controls to manage inflationary
pressures should be resisted since they would likely reduce the housing supply given rapidly
rising land prices—the key construction cost—and could thus prove counterproductive. In case
of excessive credit growth, further macroprudential measures (such as reducing the loan-to-value
ratio or suitably calibrating the planned countercyclical buffers) and liquidity withdrawals should
be deployed.7 If inflation accelerates, policymakers should slow public sector spending.
21.
The authorities’ recent efforts to improve public investment management are
welcome. The Ministry of Finance has been empowered to manage public investments, and
established an approximately QAR 600 billion 10-year spending cap on new investment projects
with yearly indicative targets. The MoF’s public investment management (PIM) department has
collated detailed data on the planned projects, is reviewing new major investment proposals, and
is refining a PIM system in consultation with other stakeholders—including through a recently
established inter-ministerial committee. In staff’s view, additional progress can be made on
deepening the cost-benefit analysis and conducting ex-post assessment of projects.

For instance, Dubai increased its real estate transaction fee to 4 percent last year. See Shukurov, B., “The Real
Estate Market and EXPO 2020 in U.A.E.: Avoiding Bubbles and Macro-Instability”, Selected Issues Paper for the
2014 U.A.E. Article IV Consultation, June 2014, for additional cross-country examples of structuring real estate
transaction fees.

Currently employed macro-prudential measures include LTV and DSTI ratios, and limits on real estate
exposures, lending concentration, FX lending, and open FX positions.

standards, concentration risks, and



Credit provision to construction contractors, services, trade, and consumers grows quickly
due to the large public investment program and associated population growth. This trend
could over time lead to greater accumulation of non-performing loans.



Although the banking system as a whole appears cushioned from real estate sector volatility,
developments at weaker banks should be closely monitored.



The largest Qatari banks have been boosting their presence in Middle Eastern and African
countries, some of which face a difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. This
regional expansion could stretch banks’ risk management capacity.8 On the liability side,
reliance on external funding could increase since low oil prices will largely eliminate the
current account surplus.

23.
Staff noted that, if low oil prices reduce financial sector liquidity, policymakers
should take timely measures. Options include reallocating deposits of government-owned
companies and the QIA from abroad and adjusting the size of T-bill and T-bond auctions. The
authorities noted that sizeable capital, liquidity, and policy buffers would provide ample
protection in case the risks materialize. They also noted the close coordination between the
Qatar Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance in managing liquidity in the banking system.
24.
The authorities highlighted that the financial sector regulatory agenda
continues to move ahead. Progress is being made in implementing the Strategy Plan for

Financial Sector Regulation and finalizing the Basel III agenda through the planned introduction
of the net stable funding ratio, capital surcharges for the domestic systemically-important banks,
and countercyclical buffers from 2016 (see Update on Basel III Implementation in Annex V). The
banks are in the process of upgrading their risk assessment and management practices, and the
Qatar Central Bank monitors loan-level details carefully. The Financial Stability and Risk
Committee has started its work, including on developing the risk-based analysis of the financial
system and assessing the impact of new policies and legislation. Staff welcomed this significant
progress, while noting that the authorities should continue strengthening their framework for
anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing (AML/CFT). The authorities expressed
interest in receiving further technical assistance in this area. Staff also appreciated the plans to
establish an AML/CFT regional training center in Doha.

D.

Pursuing Economic Diversification, Inclusive Growth, and Improving

Statistics
25.
Staff suggested that the prospects for persistently low oil prices and slowing
medium-term growth call for intensification of diversification efforts. Staff analysis found
that, while Qatar’s overall growth rates have been high over the past 25 years, this was largely
driven by labor and capital accumulation as opposed to productivity gains (Box 3 and
accompanying Selected Issues Paper). Qatar scores favorably on business environment indicators
in the GCC region, but there is scope for improvement relative to non-GCC peers (Figure 5). The
authorities indicated that recent measures to improve the business environment and promote
diversification include higher foreign ownership limits for companies listed on the stock
exchange, a merger of the Qatar Development Bank and Enterprise Qatar to better support
SMEs, a further expansion of e-government, and additional financial deepening through issuance
of long-term T-bonds. In staff’s view, further progress can be made to simplify business
registration, improve enforcement of contracts, and enhance the quality of education, while
aligning it with labor market needs. Privatization would also help stimulate private sector activity.
26.
Staff noted that further progress can also be made in fostering the inclusiveness
of growth. Boosting incentives of the Qatari citizens to work in the private sector would support
diversification of the economy (Figure 6). Greater mobility for expatriates would help increase
productivity by facilitating better matches between workers and vacancies, while reducing
reputational risks. The authorities highlighted steps taken to address reports of inadequate
working conditions of some expatriates. These include better enforcement of existing laws,
timely payment of wages, and measures to improve living conditions, such as opening a
dedicated Worker’s City. Moreover, reforms of the exit visa system and greater flexibility in
switching jobs are being considered.
27.
Substantial further efforts are necessary to improve the macroeconomic
statistics. The authorities started publishing quarterly GDP by expenditure and have finalized the
Foreign Investment Survey, which should improve the IIP and BoP statistics. The Ministry of
Finance plans to begin compilation of fiscal data according to the GFSM2001 methodology by
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

end-2015. Further important steps are needed to improve the real estate sector statistics, and
develop data on household, corporate, and government balance sheets. Collaboration with GCC
Stat is reinforcing the authorities’ efforts to enhance the national accounts and price statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Qatar continues to implement an ambitious diversification strategy through a
large public investment program, while retaining its systemic role in the global natural gas
market. In support of this effort, the policy framework is being strengthened in a number of
areas, including fiscal and financial policies.
29.
However, the recent large drop in oil and natural gas prices will lead to a
substantial deterioration of the fiscal and external balances, calling for intensification of
diversification efforts and some fiscal consolidation in the medium term.
30.
Qatar’s growth will remain strong this year, but is expected to slow going
forward. In the near term, growth will be propelled by the public investment program and a new
natural gas field. Non-hydrocarbon growth should stay in double digits. Over the medium term,
headline growth is expected to slow down significantly as the public investment program tapers
off and the private sector offsets only some of the decline.
31.
Consumer price inflation is contained, although real estate prices have grown
quickly. CPI inflation has eased in recent months, as rent increases stabilized and tradables
inflation fell. In the short run, lower international commodity prices, including for food, and a
strong U.S. dollar should reduce headline inflation despite the tight rental market. That said, real
estate prices—especially land prices—are increasing particularly fast, and valuations appear on
the upper end of a range consistent with fundamentals. Consideration should be given to
introducing a differentiated schedule of real estate transaction fees to deter speculators and
taking further measures to increase land supply. Imposing rent controls could prove
counterproductive. In case of excessive credit growth, further macroprudential measures and
liquidity withdrawals should be deployed. If inflation accelerates, policymakers should slow
public sector spending.
32.
The large drop in oil prices will lead to a substantial deterioration in fiscal and
external balances. In sharp contrast to previous years, the budget will be in deficit from 2016
onward and the current account surplus will largely be eliminated. While there is no immediate
concern about fiscal sustainability under staff’s oil price assumptions, additional spending and
revenue measures worth about 5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP are warranted over the
medium term to secure inter-generational equity in the context of low oil prices.
33.
The ongoing budget reforms are welcome and should be deepened further.
Significant progress has been made in setting up the macro-fiscal unit and public investment
department, and current expenditure growth has been restrained. The oil price slump highlights
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

the need for specifying a clear medium-term fiscal framework, including contingency plans. The
strategy document currently prepared by the Ministry of Finance should formulate binding
medium-term fiscal objectives and communicate expectations about the future trajectory of
budget expenditures and taxation. Annual budgeting process should be aligned with this new
medium-term framework so that spending overruns are eliminated. Further improvement in the
transparency of fiscal accounts would facilitate a more accurate assessment of the Qatar’s fiscal
position in the context of low oil prices.
34.
Banks remain sound and the financial sector regulatory agenda is moving
forward, but emerging risks and vulnerabilities need to be carefully monitored. Despite
broadly stable credit growth overall, potential emerging risks include the risk of falling liquidity
due to the oil price drop, and rapidly-growing credit to selected sectors and across the border.
Although the banking system as a whole appears cushioned from real estate sector volatility,
developments at weaker banks need to be closely monitored. Policymakers should continue to
closely monitor lending standards, concentration risks, and cross-border transactions of banks. If
low oil prices reduce financial sector liquidity, policymakers should take timely measures. The
continued progress in implementing Basel III and related regulations is welcome. Further
advances are needed in enhancing the early warning system, including improving availability of
the real estate market statistics and developing data on household, corporate, and government
balance sheets.
35.
The prospects of persistently low oil prices and slowing medium-term growth
call for intensification of diversification efforts. There is scope for further improving the
business environment and promoting diversification, including by simplifying business
registration, improving enforcement of contracts, and enhancing the quality of educational
curricula. Privatization would also help stimulate private sector activity. Growth would be made
more inclusive through labor market reforms.
36.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Qatar. The peg to the
U.S. dollar has served Qatar well in periods of both high and low oil prices by anchoring prices of
tradables and providing stability to income flows and financial wealth. An assessment of the
exchange rate level is complicated by the undiversified structure of Qatar’s exports, which are
dominated by hydrocarbons, but staff estimates do not find evidence of a current account gap.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Recent Trends in Qatar Real Estate Prices
Real estate prices accelerated last year, despite the sharp drop in oil prices. According to the
QCB data, price growth gathered speed especially in the second half of 2014, with the December
real estate values up by 35 percent year-on-year. Staff calculations based on transaction-level data
from the Ministry of Justice point to the following broad trends:


While the total number of real estate transactions has decreased from the 2013 peak, the
total value of real estate transactions has dramatically increased, reflecting higher average
prices and compositional changes.



Land prices appear to have increased at the fastest pace, followed by villas where land is
typically the most important cost component. Price increases have been slower for
apartments and villas with extension (e.g., a guest house).



While the Doha market experienced intermittent price hikes, price growth was recently
strongest outside of Doha, given development projects and urbanization. For example,
prices in Al Wakrah, a previously underdeveloped neighbor to Doha, have notably risen
over the past year in light of its proximity to the new Hamad International Airport and the
planned Doha Expressway route. Al Daayen has similarly experienced rapid price growth,
due in part to its proximity to Lusail City and various 2022 World Cup projects.

Box 2. Strengthening Fiscal Policy and Fiscal Frameworks in Qatar
Given low oil prices, measures to contain expenditures and increase revenues are needed to
save sufficient financial resources for future generations. As detailed below, policymakers
have a number of options to consider. Reforms should be accompanied by a communication
strategy and targeted mitigating measures to reduce implementation risks.


Revenue options: (i) broadening the corporate income tax base, as the current CIT does not
apply to domestic and GCC investors in the non-hydrocarbon sector; and (ii) introducing a
low-rate VAT (e.g. at 5 percent) that would raise new revenues efficiently, while helping to
strengthen tax administration.



Expenditure options: (i) freezing administrative expenses; and (ii) reducing subsidies, while
protecting those in need. Prioritization of investment projects is also essential.

Strong frameworks need to be in place to support fiscal reforms. The following sequencing of
steps to strengthen medium-term budgeting could be considered in Qatar:


First phase (to be completed by mid-2015): (i) formulate a medium-term fiscal framework
(MTFF); and (ii) prepare a medium-term fiscal strategy document that would serve as the
basis for annual budget preparation, translating the MTFF into a statement on fiscal policy
priorities. The authorities are on track to complete this phase on time.



Second phase (to be completed by end-2016): (i) prepare the medium-term budget
framework (MTBF) by matching the MTFF with a bottom-up estimation of the costs of
existing policy; (ii) integrate the MTBF in the annual budget process.



Third phase (to be completed by end-2017): (i) gradually turn the MTBF into a performancebased medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) by linking budget funding to results (i.e.
shifting the focus from controlling inputs to controlling outcomes and allocating resources
according to the results achieved by programs); (ii) continue developing competency in
policy analysis and performance management in sectoral ministries and agencies.

Box 3. Lessons from Qatar’s Growth Experience
Qatar’s growth has been consistently high, but not in per capita terms. Qatar is one of only
14 countries that, on average, have recorded annual real GDP growth of above 7 percent over a
period of at least 25 years. However, with

Productivity would be improved by strengthening oversight of public investment projects
and further lifting barriers to private sector development. As government investment will
remain significant in the near future, improving capital productivity will be essential and should
focus on strengthening public investment management. Qatar has launched important reforms by
establishing a new public investment management department at the Ministry of Finance. The
critical tasks of this department should include (a) obtaining objective information to better
estimate the returns of the public investments, and (b) ensuring that expenditure decisions react
to this information properly. Labor productivity will also be enhanced through improvements in
the quality of education and training as well as by liberalizing the domestic mobility of the
workforce and removing other regulatory constraints on the private sector development.

1/ Dividends paid by Qatar Petroleum and other state-owned enterprises.
2/ About 85 percent of corporate income tax comes from Qatar Petroleum.
3/ Part of UAE capital spending is reflected in loans and equity in the official statistics, and thus is not included in this chart.
4/ Fiscal break-even oil price that keeps financial net worth of general government stable (based on staff estimates of
hydrocarbon revenues and QIA investment income) equals $68 in 2020 (staff estimates).
5/ Cashflow to QIA is staff's estimate. Starting from 2013, these flows are accrued to the Budget.
6/ Hydrocarbon revenues include portions of investment income and corporate tax revenue from companies operating in
the hydrocarbon sector; these revenues are classified as nonhydrocarbon receipts in the budget.

1/ Starting a business encompasses the procedures, time, and cost (including minimum capital requirement) required for an
entrepreneur to start and operate a business.
2/ Getting credit is a combination of (i) the legal rights of borrowers and lenders that facilitate lending; and (ii) the coverage, scope,
and accessibility of credit information via public credit registries and private credit bureaus. Qatar scores better in the latter but
scores poorly by GCC standards in both cases.
3/ Protecting investors measures the strength of minority shareholder protection against directors’ misuse of corporate assets for
personal gain.
4/ Enforcing contracts measures the procedures, time, and cost involved in resolving a standardized commercial lawsuit between
domestic businesses through the local first-instance court.

Annex I. Status of Staff Recommendations Made in the 2014
Article IV Consultation

34

Remain vigilant about
overheating pressures

Consumer price inflation remains subdued and national logistics committee
monitors price developments and supply chain bottlenecks. However, real
estate price growth accelerated despite the large drop in oil prices.

Improve public investment
management

The Ministry of Finance set up a Public Investment Management department;
has established a 10-year cap on new investment projects; is reviewing
projects' operational expenditures; liaises with a number of stakeholders,
including through a recently-established inter-ministerial committee.

Continue fiscal reforms,
including strengthening
medium-term budgeting

The Ministry of Finance is planning to strengthen its medium-term revenue
and expenditure focus by preparing a medium-term strategy document. The
authorities contained growth in current spending in FY2013/14; increased
transparency of revenue accounting; made the Macro-Fiscal Unit operational;
work on GFSM2001 data compilation is in progress.

Implement financial regulatory
reforms

The Basel III circular was issued in January 2014; the remaining Basel III
agenda will be phased-in from 2016 through introduction of the net stable
funding ratio, capital surcharges for the domestic systemically-important
banks, and countercyclical buffers. The Financial Stability and Risk Committee
is developing the risk-based analysis of the financial system and assessing the
impact of new policies and legislation.

Pursue diversification

Recent measures to improve the business environment and promote
diversification include higher foreign ownership limits for companies listed
on the stock exchange, an integration of the Qatar Development Bank and
Enterprise Qatar to support SMEs, further expansion of the e-government,
and additional financial deepening through issuance of long-term T-bonds.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
According to the external sustainability and macrobalance approaches, the current account balance
appears close to fundamentals.
Qatar’s exchange rate has recently appreciated in line with the U.S. dollar. The riyal is estimated
to have appreciated by 2 percent in real effective terms in 2014, with stronger appreciation during
the second half of the year. This is helping to reduce inflationary pressures, while limited import
substitution, reliance on hydrocarbon exports priced in dollars, and use of foreign workers paid
wages that (analogous to intermediate goods imports) are set internationally limit the scope for the
exchange rate to affect trade volumes.
The permanent income model indicates the current account is not misaligned. The permanent
income model (“External Sustainability (ES) approach”) is the preferred method for Qatar because,
rather than reflecting traditional competitiveness issues, a current account gap would reflect
suboptimal saving of hydrocarbon

thus reduces the required norm in line with
projected oil prices in 2015, leaving the gap unchanged (the 2020 gap is also about 1 percent). The
gaps are too small to indicate misalignment, but the findings are qualitatively consistent with the
need to increase fiscal saving due to intergenerational equity considerations.
The macrobalance approach also implies the current account balance has broadly been in line
with norms. This approach uses regression analysis for a large cross section of countries to predict
the equilibrium current account consistent with a range of structural and policy factors, and
estimates the impact of changes in these factors on the norm.1 The model’s predicted value for 2014
is 20 percent of GDP based on actual policies. Imposing Qatar’s fiscal policy consistent with
intergenerational equity raises the norm by almost 2 percent, while also allowing for the 2014
estimates of global policy gaps results in a norm of 21 percent. The norms based on 2015 values do
1

This approach employs the IMF’s External Balance Assessment–Lite (EBA-Lite) model. This model has the advantage of multilateral
consistency but does not accurately capture all features of undiversified commodity exporters such as Qatar, despite the inclusion
of some hydrocarbon-related variables. When generating the norms, Qatar’s exceptionally high income per capita is replaced with
non-oil income per capita.

not fall by as much as the ES norms or current account forecasts. This is likely because Qatar’s
current account is more sensitive to oil price declines than implied by the model’s predictions for an
average country, and the model thus overestimates the current account gap during an oil price
slump.

Annex III. Fiscal Position and Permanent Income Hypothesis
Staff analysis based on the permanent income hypothesis suggests that the government does
not save sufficiently for future generations. The gap between the projected deficits and the
deficits consistent with a constant real per capita annuity is about 5 percent of non-hydrocarbon
GDP (see chart). 1 These calculations are based on the following assumptions:


Projections until 2020 are based on staff’s macroframework, including the WEO assumptions
about the oil price. After 2020, the baseline scenario assumes flat hydrocarbon production
and annual oil price growth of 2 percent, population growth of 0.5 percent (this includes a
departure of construction and other workers after the investment projects are completed,
followed by population growth of 1 percent), and real return on assets of 4 percent.



Alternative scenarios assume either constant nominal oil prices or lower real return on assets
by 1 percentage point.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of February 2015)
Cooperation with Qatar began in 2003 with a Public Transport Sector Reform study. A
manpower planning exercise launched in 2003 evolved to a Labor Market Strategy in 2004. In
2005, the World Bank provided technical assistance on payment systems to the Qatar Central
Bank, in the context of supporting the development of payment and securities clearance and
settlement systems in the Arab region through the Arab Payments and Securities Settlement
Initiative, led jointly by the World Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund and the International
Monetary Fund. In 2007, the Bank conducted a study on the Knowledge Economy (KE) the
results of which informed several high-level workshops.
The Government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, signed in 2010 the Framework
Agreement for Advisory Services with the Bank in order to enhance Qatar’s benefit from
available services. The Bank has since provided technical support in a number of areas including
a midterm review of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011-16 focused on institutional
development, human development, and infrastructure, enhancement of environmental
regulations and economic management, and development of the pension system. The Bank
also helped the authorities prepare for and deliver the Convention of the Parties (COP 18) to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that Qatar hosted in
December 2012, facilitating dialogue among various stakeholders on issues of climate change,
dry-land agriculture, and food security.
Dialogue is underway with the Ministry of Finance for possible assistance to enhance the
regulatory environment, with the Central Bank to enhance institutional capacity in the domains
of payment systems and banking sector stress test, and with the Ministry of Development
Planning and Statistics for assistance to prepare the National Development Strategy 2017-22.
The World Bank stands ready to help the authorities enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
public spending in health and education.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance but there is substantial
scope for improving their frequency, timeliness and coverage. The most affected areas are
the real gross domestic product (GDP), real estate sector statistics, financial accounts of the
balance of payments, international investment position, and external debt statistics.
National Accounts: Qatar publishes quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant
prices. The accuracy of data in the non-hydrocarbon sector is undermined by the lack of
comprehensive source data. The Ministry for Development Planning and Statistics (MDPS)
has begun to publish the quarterly Sequence of National Accounts including current GDP
by expenditure from summer 2014. Changing the base year (currently 2004) is also under
consideration.
Price statistics: Qatar has been publishing monthly CPI data based on a basket with a
significant share of rents. However, the rent component has limited geographic coverage
and only reflects new contracts. The household income and expenditure survey 2012-13,
which covers all municipalities, forms the basis for updated weights in a new CPI basket
(2013 base year) introduced for measuring inflation in early 2015. The rental share is
expected to fall due to the removal of imputed rent costs.
Real estate statistics: The Ministry of Justice records real estate data at the transactions
level, including some basic details about the type of transactions, and makes it available to
the public in Arabic in PDF format. The QCB uses this data to produce an aggregate
residential real estate monthly price index, which it publishes quarterly. The index covers
only transactions made between private parties. Disaggregated indices are not available.
The authorities are working on a measure of housing vacancies.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities are implementing the Government
Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which will enable compilation of
accrual fiscal accounts according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM)
guidelines. At the moment, the GFSM2001 figures are estimated by staff on the basis of
modified cash data provided by the authorities.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data for Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks
are generally timely and of high quality. The QCB reports monetary data regularly to STA
for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of
about three weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published in the Monthly and
Quarterly Statistics Bulletin.
Financial stability: Qatar Central Bank published and disseminated its fifth Financial
Stability Report in 2014, and plans to prepare a risk-based analysis of the entire financial
system in cooperation with the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority and Qatar
Financial Market Authority.
Balance of Payments: Since the 2010 technical assistance mission on balance of payments
statistics, as well as the participation of STA staff in the 2011 Article IV Consultation, the
authorities are publishing quarterly BoP data in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Exchange. Continuing
efforts are needed to further develop data sources, particularly for the private sector. The
2012 TA mission on CDIS has facilitated the Foreign Investment Survey for 2010-12.
Although it excludes public entities, this data will assist with compilation of comprehensive
data on Qatar’s International Investment Position (IIP). The authorities presented the
mission with partial mid-year IIP data for 2012, 2013, and 2014.
External debt: Detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are
provided to missions during the Article IV consultation discussions. The debt office at the
Ministry of Finance is collating information about public debt and debt of public sector
enterprises. The authorities are publishing data on public external debt on the QCB website.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Qatar is a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant since December 2005.
The GDDS mission of April 2007 updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage,
Periodicity, and Timeliness; assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness;
and identified major milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate from the GDDS
to the SDDS. To enhance data dissemination practices, staff assisted the authorities in
developing a National Summary Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar
(ARC).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Aasim Husain

This supplement provides information that has become available since the staff
report (SM/15/53) was issued. It does not alter the staff appraisal.
The authorities started compiling CPI data according to a new methodology, as
anticipated in the staff report. The new index shifts the basket weights from year
2007 to 2013 and implements other methodological changes. The main implication is a
drop in the weight of housing, electricity, water, and gas from 32 percent to 22
percent. The main offsetting item is recreation and culture, whose weight increased
from 4 to 13 percent. As a result of these methodological changes, recent inflation
figures are expected to drop modestly. Full analysis of implications is not possible at
present, since year-on-year inflation data are not yet available.
The Qatar Central Bank shared with staff updated financial sector indicators as of
December 2014. Under the Basel III standard, the Tier I capital was 15.8 percent of
risk-weighted assets, somewhat higher than the partial-year figure in the staff report.
Non-performing loans stayed low at 1.7 percent, and earnings and liquidity buffers
remained strong.

Press Release No. 15/151
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 2, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On March 23, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation with Qatar1 and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.2
Qatar is implementing an ambitious diversification strategy, while retaining its systemic role in the
global natural gas market. Qatar accounts for one-third of global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade
and has emerged as an important global financial investor, labor importer, and donor. The
authorities are executing a large public infrastructure program to advance economic diversification
and prepare for the FIFA 2022 World Cup.
The economy has maintained strong growth momentum so far despite the large drop in oil prices
since summer 2014. Real GDP growth has been stable at about 6 percent over the past three years,
mostly driven by a double-digit expansion of the non-hydrocarbon sector. Falling global
commodity prices have helped reduce inflation below 3 percent, despite a tight real estate market.
The short-term growth outlook is positive, but lower oil prices will lead to a substantial
deterioration of the fiscal and external balances. Growth is expected to increase to about 7 percent
in 2015 as the Barzan natural gas field starts production and the authorities continue implementing
the public investment program. Falling import prices should continue keeping inflationary

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

pressures in check. However, the government budget could fall into a deficit from 2016 onwards
and external surpluses will shrink substantially. Growth is expected to slow over the medium term
as public investment growth tapers and the private sector offsets the decline only partially. The
main risks to the macroeconomic outlook are the possibility of lower-than-expected oil and natural
gas prices and the possible side effects of public investments in the form over short-term
overheating and medium-term excess capacity.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV Consultation with Qatar, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Qatar continues to implement an ambitious diversification strategy through a large public
investment program, while retaining its systemic role in the global natural gas market. In support
of this effort, the policy framework is being strengthened in a number of areas, including fiscal
and financial policies.
However, the recent large drop in oil and natural gas prices will lead to a substantial deterioration
of the fiscal and external balances, calling for intensification of diversification efforts and some
fiscal consolidation in the medium term.
Qatar’s growth will remain strong this year, but is expected to slow going forward. In the near
term, growth will be propelled by the public investment program and a new natural gas field. Nonhydrocarbon growth should stay in double digits. Over the medium term, headline growth is
expected to slow down significantly as the public investment program tapers off and the private
sector offsets only some of the decline.
Consumer price inflation is contained, although real estate prices have grown quickly. CPI
inflation has eased in recent months, as rent increases stabilized and tradables inflation fell. In the
short run, lower international commodity prices, including for food, and a strong U.S. dollar
should reduce headline inflation despite the tight rental market. That said, real estate prices—
especially land prices—are increasing particularly fast, and valuations appear on the upper end of
a range consistent with fundamentals. Consideration should be given to introducing a
differentiated schedule of real estate transaction fees to deter speculators and taking further
measures to increase land supply. Imposing rent controls could prove counterproductive. In case

of excessive credit growth, further macroprudential measures and liquidity withdrawals should be
deployed. If inflation accelerates, policymakers should slow public sector spending.
The large drop in oil prices will lead to a substantial deterioration in fiscal and external balances.
In sharp contrast to previous years, the budget will be in deficit from 2016 onward and the current
account surplus will largely be eliminated. While there is no immediate concern about fiscal
sustainability under staff’s oil price assumptions, additional spending and revenue measures worth
about 5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP are warranted over the medium term to secure intergenerational equity in the context of low oil prices.
The ongoing budget reforms are welcome and should be deepened further. Significant progress
has been made in setting up the macro-fiscal unit and public investment department, and current
expenditure growth has been restrained. The oil price slump highlights the need for specifying a
clear medium-term fiscal framework, including contingency plans. The strategy document
currently prepared by the Ministry of Finance should formulate binding medium-term fiscal
objectives and communicate expectations about the future trajectory of budget expenditures and
taxation. Annual budgeting process should be aligned with this new medium-term framework so
that spending overruns are eliminated. Further improvement in the transparency of fiscal accounts
would facilitate a more accurate assessment of the Qatar’s fiscal position in the context of low oil
prices.
Banks remain sound and the financial sector regulatory agenda is moving forward, but emerging
risks and vulnerabilities need to be carefully monitored. Despite broadly stable credit growth
overall, potential emerging risks include the risk of falling liquidity due to the oil price drop, and
rapidly-growing credit to selected sectors and across the border. Although the banking system as a
whole appears cushioned from real estate sector volatility, developments at weaker banks need to
be closely monitored. Policymakers should continue to closely monitor lending standards,
concentration risks, and cross-border transactions of banks. If low oil prices reduce financial
sector liquidity, policymakers should take timely measures. The continued progress in
implementing Basel III and related regulations is welcome. Further advances are needed in
enhancing the early warning system, including improving availability of the real estate market
statistics and developing data on household, corporate, and government balance sheets.
The prospects of persistently low oil prices and slowing medium-term growth call for
intensification of diversification efforts. There is scope for further improving the business
environment and promoting diversification, including by simplifying business registration,
improving enforcement of contracts, and enhancing the quality of educational curricula.

Privatization would also help stimulate private sector activity. Growth would be made more
inclusive through labor market reforms.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Qatar. The peg to the U.S. dollar has
served Qatar well in periods of both high and low oil prices by anchoring prices of tradables and
providing stability to income flows and financial wealth. An assessment of the exchange rate level
is complicated by the undiversified structure of Qatar’s exports, which are dominated by
hydrocarbons, but staff estimates do not find evidence of a current account gap.
