IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$1.5 Billion Extended Arrangement
under EFF for Sri Lanka
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 36-month
extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with Sri Lanka for an amount
equivalent to SDR 1.1 billion (about US$1.5 billion, or 185 percent of quota) to support the
country’s economic reform agenda.
The IMF arrangement aims to meet balance of payments needs arising from a deteriorating
external environment and pressures that may persist until macroeconomic policies can be
adjusted. It is also expected to catalyze an additional US$650 million in other multilateral
and bilateral loans, bringing total support to about $2.2 billion (over and above existing
financing arrangements).
The Executive Board’s decision will enable an immediate disbursement of SDR 119.894
million (about US$ 168.1 million), and the remainder will be available in 6 installments
subject to quarterly reviews.
During the same meeting, the Board also concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation. A
separate press release will be issued shortly.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Sri Lanka, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Despite positive growth momentum, Sri Lanka’s economy is beginning to show signs of
strain from an increasingly difficult external environment and challenging policy
adjustments. The new government's economic agenda, supported by the Extended Fund
Facility, provides an important opportunity to re-set macroeconomic policies, address key
vulnerabilities, boost reserves, and support stability and resilience.
“A return to fiscal consolidation, targeting a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit to 3.5
percent of GDP by 2020, is the linchpin of the reform program. Rebuilding tax revenues
through a comprehensive reform of both tax policy and administration will be key in this

2

regard, supplemented by steps toward more effective control over expenditures and putting
state enterprise operations on a more commercial footing.
“Medium-term growth prospects also need to be supported through a greater role for market
forces and a decisive shift toward an outward orientation. A clear commitment to exchange
rate flexibility will enable adjustment to a shifting external environment while allowing the
central bank to rebuild foreign exchange reserves and focus more closely on its key mandate
of price stability. The economic program also supports the government’s objective of
boosting competitiveness and greater integration with regional and global markets through
comprehensive trade reform and improvements to the investment environment. Steadfast
implementation of these reforms should strengthen Sri Lanka’s ability to attract investment,
improve prospects for sustained medium-term growth, and reduce fiscal risks.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Macroeconomic performance in 2015 reflected a positive underlying growth momentum
mitigated by the negative impact of unbalanced domestic policies and an increasingly
difficult external environment. Real GDP growth was 4.8 percent in 2015 (broadly
unchanged from 2014), on the basis of strong growth in services (particularly tourism),
continued growth in agriculture, and a positive (albeit declining) contribution from
manufacturing. The negative growth in construction and weaker growth in manufacturing
were indicative of a slowdown in public and private investment, as well as the negative
effects of slowing world trade. The economy is currently estimated to be operating slightly
below its potential, while the unemployment rate remains at 4.3 percent in end 2015, close to
the historical norm.
The government fiscal deficit expanded to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2015. While revenue
increased by 1.5 percentage points to 13.1 percent of GDP, this mostly reflected one-off
measures and tax collections from a temporary surge in vehicle imports. Expenditures rose
by 2.1 percentage points to 19.9 percent of GDP, on account of a post-election wage hike, a
higher interest bill, additional spending on goods and services, and an increase in income
transfer programs.
The overall balance of payments deteriorated significantly in 2015 despite an improvement in
the terms of trade. The current account deficit was contained at 2.5 percent of GDP in
2015—the same level as in 2014. Capital flows have also been a key driving force behind the
deterioration in the balance of payments. The capital and financial account position has
weakened due to foreign exit from government securities, lower FDI inflows, and slow
implementation of externally financed public and private projects. Investor sentiment has
worsened, reflecting global market volatility and concern over domestic policies.

3

Tougher external conditions in the wake of China rebalancing and unwinding of
unconventional monetary policies were not outside Sri Lanka’s past experience. However,
spillovers were magnified by domestic imbalances, as evidenced by higher volatility around
the two elections (January and August 2015), and the official budget passed in November
2015. The rupee continues to face downward pressure—largely reflecting capital flow
developments. The foreign exchange and government bond markets were volatile in March
2016. highlighting rigidities in both systems.
Program Summary
The proposed new IMF-supported program aims to provide a policy anchor for
macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, while strengthening external resiliency in a
challenging global environment.
The key objectives of the program relate to fiscal policy and the balance of payments, and
measures to: (a) implement a structural increase in revenues, facilitating a reduction in the
fiscal deficit; (b) reverse the decline in central bank foreign exchange reserves; (c) reduce
public debt relative to GDP and lower Sri Lanka’s risk of debt distress; and (d) enhance
public financial management and improve the operations of state owned enterprises. The
program also aims to transition toward inflation targeting with a flexible exchange rate
regime and to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth.
To achieve these objectives, the program would envisage implementation of a set of reforms
under six pillars:
(i)
fiscal consolidation;
(ii)
revenue mobilization;
(iii) public financial management reform;
(iv)
state enterprise reform;
(v)
transition to flexible inflation targeting under a flexible exchange rate regime;
and
(vi)
reforms in the trade and investment regime.
Background

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
REQUEST FOR A THREE YEAR EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT
UNDER THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Sri Lankan economy has good underlying momentum but is starting to show
signs of strain from a combination of unbalanced macroeconomic policies and an increasingly
difficult external environment. A significant political transition has brought a new unity
government to the fore. There is now an important window of opportunity to re-set
macroeconomic policies to support stability and resilience, as well as undertake structural
reforms to help Sri Lanka achieve high and sustained economic growth.
Fiscal Policy. There is a clear need to put tax revenues on an upward path as part of a
growth-friendly phase of fiscal consolidation and debt reduction. The significant reduction in
the 2016 deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP will need to be followed by further revenue-based
fiscal consolidation over the medium-term, guided by the 2020 deficit target of 3.5 percent of
GDP (a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP). Support on tax policy and revenue
administration will be essential to successful implementation and creation of a simple,
efficient, and equitable tax system.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies. The recent tightening of monetary policy was a
necessary step given rising core inflation and high private credit growth. Further tightening
may be needed in coming months. Over the medium-term, the CBSL will shift to a flexible
inflation targeting framework. It is essential that the CBSL begin an exit from the present
intervention framework, which has bled reserves over the past 20 months.
Structural Reforms. Reform of state owned enterprises, trade policy, and the investment
environment are envisioned. Implementation of automatic pricing mechanisms for fuel and
electricity prices will be essential to preventing fiscal risk and enhancing the role of market
forces in the economy. Trade policy reform and elimination of para-tariffs is needed for a
stronger outward orientation and to build resilience.
Extended Arrangement under the EFF. The authorities have requested a three-year
arrangement with proposed access equivalent to SDR 1,070.78 million (185 percent of quota)
to meet balance of payments needs arising from a deteriorating external environment and
pressures which may persist until macroeconomic policies can be adjusted. Key objectives of
the program (related to fiscal policy and the balance of payments) are to: (i) implement a
structural increase in revenues to reduce the fiscal deficit; (ii) reverse the decline in central
bank foreign exchange reserves; (iii) reduce public debt relative to GDP and lower Sri Lanka’s
risk of debt distress; and (iv) enhance public financial management and improve the
operations of state owned enterprises. The program also aims to transition toward inflation
targeting with a flexible exchange rate regime and to promote sustainable and inclusive
economic growth by supporting trade and investment. Program risks are substantial given
the complexity of reforms and the need for strong political commitment. All prior actions
have been completed.

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Lack of coordination and clarity on policies as the country moved through two elections in less than
nine months gave rise to both macroeconomic imbalances and a decline in investor confidence.
1.
Macroeconomic performance in 2015 reflected a mix between positive underlying
growth momentum, the negative impact of unbalanced domestic policies, and an increasingly
difficult external environment. Real GDP growth was 4.8 percent in 2015 (broadly unchanged
from 2014), on the basis of strong growth in services (particularly tourism), continued growth in
agriculture, and positive (albeit declining) contribution from manufacturing. The negative growth in
construction and weaker growth in manufacturing were indicative of a slowdown in public and
private investment, as well as the negative effects of slowing world trade. The economy is currently
estimated to be operating slightly below its potential. The industrial production index grew by
3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 (somewhat lower than the 2010−15 historical average),
while the unemployment rate remains at 4.3 percent in end 2015, close to the historical norm.
Headline inflation ended the year at 2.8 percent and dropped marginally to 2 percent as of March
2016, but core inflation continued to rise—reaching 4.5 percent by end 2015 and hitting 5.7 percent
in February before dropping back to remaining at 4.5 percent by end-March. Private credit growth
(at 25 percent in 2015) was well above both the historical average and the authorities’ benchmark of
15–16 percent. Credit growth is expected to slow reflecting lower LTV ratios on vehicle finance
(70 percent compared to 100 percent) and the temporary use of a 100 percent cash margin
requirement on all Letter of Credits opened for vehicle imports (from October 30 to December 1,
2015).
2.
The government fiscal deficit expanded to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2015. 1 While revenue
increased by 1½ percentage points to 13.1 percent of GDP, this mostly reflected one-off measures
and tax collections from a temporary surge in vehicle imports. Expenditures rose by 2.1 percentage
points to 19.9 percent of GDP, on account of a post-election wage hike (0.8 percentage points), a
higher interest bill (0.5 percentage points), additional spending on goods and services
(0.5 percentage points), and an increase in Samurdhi transfers (0.3 percentage points). On the other
hand, capital outlays were compressed to 4.7 percent of GDP—about 0.4 percentage points lower
than in 2014. Public debt increased from 70.7 percent in 2014 to 76 percent in 2015—partly
reflecting debt financing of the fiscal deficit, but also the impact of rupee depreciation on the stock
of foreign-currency denominated debt. As of end-2015 there was also an estimated Rs 1.36 trillion
(11 percent of GDP) in government and state enterprise liabilities (the latter—Rs. 1.28 trillion—
accounting for about 94 percent of the total)—some of which is under a government guarantee (see
Box 1). Four SOEs (Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Sri Lanka
Ports Authority (SLPA), and Sri Lankan Airlines) account for the bulk of these obligations.

1
The authorities’ official figures for capital spending and the fiscal deficit in 2015 were 5.3 and 7.4 percent of GDP,
respectively. This reflects an accounting arrangement whereby cost overruns for capital projects amounting to Rs 62
billion or 0.6 percent of GDP (which were paid but not recorded in 2014) were recorded in the 2015 account,
according to an estimate provided by the recent FAD TA mission.

3.
The overall balance of payments deteriorated significantly in 2015 despite an
improvement in the terms of trade. The current account deficit was contained at 2.5 percent of
GDP in 2015—the same level as in 2014. A strong pickup in non-energy imports (notably vehicles),
negative export growth2, and flat growth in remittances more than offset a lower oil bill and robust
growth in tourism receipts. Excluding oil, the current account deficit deteriorated from a surplus of
$2.6 billion in 2014 to a surplus of only $691 million in 2015. An estimated windfall of some $1.9
billion from lower oil prices (and volumes) was largely consumed by a $1.4 billion in increase in nonoil imports, with consumer goods accounting for about 60 percent of the total. Notwithstanding a
boost from a September swap arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for US$1.1 billion
and a late-October issuance of a $1.5 billion sovereign bond, gross reserves declined from 87
percent of the ARA reserve metric in 2014 to 76 percent in 2015, with a drop in months of reserve
cover (prospective imports of goods and services) from 4.3 to 3.8 months. The RBI swap was repaid
in full in early March 2016, but a fresh swap line of $700 million3 was extended at the same time,
and fully drawn by the CBSL at the end of March.

2 The decline in exports followed lower commodity prices (notably for tea) and lower demand from the EU, Russia,
and the Middle East, including for garment and apparel exports.
3 The duration of the swap is three months, or until an IMF-supported program is approved.

4.
Capital flows have also been a key driving force behind the deterioration in the
balance of payments. The capital and financial account position has weakened due to foreign exit
from government securities, lower FDI inflows, and slow implementation of externally financed
public and private projects. Investor sentiment has worsened, reflecting global market volatility and
concern over domestic policies. Equity prices on the Colombo All Shares Price Index (ASPI) dropped
by about 6 percent in 2015. Sri Lanka’s spreads over the 5-year US Treasury have widened relative to
other EM Asian countries since the beginning of 2015, reflecting the weakening of macroeconomic
fundamentals and investor sentiment. Sri Lanka’s spread vis-a-vis the EMBI peaked at 490 bps on
February 11, but has since dropped to about 380 bps—compared with 220 bps for emerging Asian
economies. Tougher external conditions in the wake of China rebalancing and unwinding of
unconventional monetary policies were not outside Sri Lanka’s past experience. However, spillovers
were magnified by domestic imbalances, as evidenced by higher volatility around the two elections
(January and August 2015), and the official budget passed in November 2015.

The rupee continues to face downward pressure—largely reflecting capital flow
developments. The rupee was held relatively steady during the first eight months of 2015—
depreciating by only about 2 percent as the CBSL provided about $1.9 billion to the foreign
exchange market. Following the August elections, the CBSL shifted policy to cease giving a daily
reference rate, exit from daily intervention and allow the market a greater role in determining the
value of the rupee—with the rupee depreciating by some 4 ½ percent in that month despite net
intervention of an additional $517 million. Intervention resumed after a short period, with central
bank net sales of another $856 million in the remaining months of 2015, and the rupee depreciating
slowly by another 2 percent. After some signs of stabilization in February (when net CBSL
intervention fell to $190 million compared to a peak of $460 million per month in July−September
2015), market pressures resumed in March. At the beginning of 2016, gross international reserves
were short of gross foreign-currency claims coming due in the year.

The foreign exchange and government bond markets were volatile in March 2016—
highlighting rigidities in both systems. Amid stronger market pressures, CBSL actions (including
provision of another $437 million to the foreign exchange market) kept the spot rate virtually
unchanged and pushed a greater amount of foreign exchange trading to the forward market. The
daily average transaction volume in the spot market declined from US$20 million to US$11 million
between January and March, while the total transaction volume in the forward market increased
from $58 million to $72 million. This may suggest that moral suasion in the spot market has pushed
a greater amount of foreign exchange trading to the forward market. High short-term volatility has
also been visible, with the 3-month forward price jumping from Rs 146.5 per US dollar to 151.4
during March 28−30, before settling again close to Rs 145 per dollar. The government bond market
also became volatile in late March, as the CBSL initially announced issuance of Rs 40 billion in
treasury bonds, but instead issued bonds of Rs 80 billion at a higher rate than that prevailing in the
secondary market.
7.
Financial soundness indicators for 2015 were generally favorable. Profitability has
generally increased on the back of an increase in net interest income, and capital adequacy remains
comfortably above regulatory limits. Interest spreads have widened as commercial banks raised their
prime lending rates by about 150 bps since December 2015 (reflecting the tightening of monetary
policy) while increasing deposit rates by only 25 bps. Vehicle financing accounted for much of
banks’ loan growth in 2015 followed by other consumer related financing such as housing. The ratio
of NPLs to gross loans declined to 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 4 percent in the third
quarter because of growth in the overall portfolio of loans.

OUTLOOK AND KEY RISKS
8.
Sri Lanka’s short-term outlook is challenging, but medium-term prospects are favorable
if current macro-financial imbalances can be addressed. There are significant challenges for 2016
as the government seeks to undertake difficult reforms to re-start fiscal consolidation and tackle high
priority structural reforms. Nonetheless, with a solid commitment to reform, clear direction on
macroeconomic policies, and restoration of market confidence, there is room for a small uptick in real
GDP growth—based on a resumption of investment projects stalled in 2015, continued strong growth
in services, and a modest increase in foreign direct investment. Real GDP is projected to rise from 4.8
percent in 2015 to 5 percent in 2016, supported by a recovery in construction from negative growth
in 2015 (base effects), regaining of GSP plus status, and sustained momentum in services including
tourism, transport, and IT.
9.
Growth is projected to increase to 5½ percent (in line with estimated potential output)
by 2020, and inflation to stabilize at 5 percent. The negative output gap is thus projected to
narrow over the medium term and close by 2020. This relatively positive outlook is based on several
elements, including Sri Lanka’s comparatively buoyant performance during earlier periods of stress
(including during the civil war). The outlook is also supported by several macroeconomic pillars.
Notwithstanding current challenges, Sri Lanka has a strong base of human capital and reliable
infrastructure—especially compared with other South Asian economies. It also occupies a strategic
position in a fast growing and dynamic region, and capital investments over the last decade
(particularly on port and other transport-related facilities) have been geared to take advantage of this
opportunity. Services growth has been strong, particularly in such relatively new areas as tourism
(which continues to enjoy double digit growth as part of the peace dividend), IT, and accounting.
However, stronger macroeconomic management, a decisive return to an outward orientation, a
stronger role for the private sector and market forces, and further investment in physical
infrastructure and human capital are needed to achieve high, inclusive, and sustained growth.
10.
The key risks to the outlook (both short- and medium-term) stem from (i) government
inaction on key policies; and (ii) a significant deterioration in the external environment, as highlighted
in the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM, Annex II). Current policies are likely unsustainable. Over the past
1−2 years fiscal consolidation has been reversed, gross financing needs have increased sharply, public
debt has risen as a share of GDP, and persistent defense of the exchange rate has reduced net
international reserves by over $2.3 billion. Inaction on policies and continued reliance on borrowed
resources to fund fiscal deficits and defend the exchange rate is unsustainable over the medium-term,
and will undermine prospects for investment and inclusive growth. In this context, the key risks relate
to not achieving the envisaged increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio, a further decline in growth, or
additional losses from state enterprises—all of which would pose challenges for fiscal consolidation.
External risks are also clearly present. Pressure on the balance of payments is expected to continue in
the short run given global rebalancing and shifting investor sentiment—with the potential for
additional capital outflows beyond what is currently envisaged. Other external risks include a further
reduction in export growth in case of a slowdown in demand in key textile/apparel markets (the U.S.
and EU); a further drop in inward remittances in the wake of lower oil prices and the negative
economic impact on host countries in the Middle East; or a drop in services activity in line with slower

global trade and a downturn in tourism. These shocks can have substantial impact on the balance of
payments. Staff estimate that a “worst case” combined shock to the current account (through goods
and services exports and remittances) and the capital account (impacting FDI and foreign exit from
the government securities market) could widen the financing gap by as much as $1.8 billion over
2016-17 (assuming no policy adjustment).

A. Return to Fiscal Sustainability

General government tax revenue, 2015
(% of GDP)

11.
Successive IMF staff reports since the completion of the 2009–12 Stand-By
Arrangement have highlighted the fiscal framework and the steady decline in government tax
revenue as a key risk. The ratio of tax revenue to GDP has fallen from nearly 13 percent of GDP in
2006 to 10.1 percent in 2014, rebounding to 12.1 percent in 2015 (largely on the basis of one-off tax
measures and a short-term surge in import taxes). The composition of tax revenue has changed
dramatically. The share of revenue generated by the VAT has fallen by more than half, while the share
of excises, trade taxes, and other miscellaneous taxes has increased from about 40 percent of total
revenue in 2006 to 60 percent in 2015. A VAT-like indirect tax (Nation Building Tax, NBT) coexists with
the VAT, undermining the simplicity of the tax system (Box 2). Income taxes are plagued with an
extended list of tax incentives and concessions. The low level of domestic revenues has hampered
fiscal and macroeconomic management and magnified reliance on both domestic and external debt.

Box 2. Sri Lanka – the VAT versus the National Building Tax (NBT)
Two similar indirect taxes coexist in Sri Lanka: the VAT and the National Building Tax (NBT).




Sri Lanka’s VAT has such standard features as a credit offset system, a single rate (raised from
11 percent in 2015 to 15 percent in 2016), and zero-rating for exports. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by a large number of exemptions. The VAT raised only 2 percent of GDP in 2015.
The NBT is levied on a company’s turnover at a single rate (2 percent), imposed through all
production stages and on provision of services. Manufacturers can claim credits for imports and
purchases from registered manufacturers, but not for services. Refunds are not allowed, and
exports are exempted but not zero-rated. The NBT raised 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015.

Theory and experience suggest the VAT is a clear winner over the NBT as an efficient revenueraising vehicle. The VAT is more effective in terms of:






Limiting tax cascading. With its limited offset for tax on inputs, the NBT is a cascading tax that
leads to price distortions. This negative effect would be exacerbated if the NBT rate were raised
substantially above the current level. On the other hand, a standard VAT avoids tax cascading (up
to the minimum level implied by exemptions and the registration threshold).
Preserving export competitiveness. With exports exempt but not zero-rated under the NBT,
exports leave Sri Lanka burdened with the NBT paid on inputs. On the other hand, the VAT is not
levied on inputs for exports because they are zero-rated. Thus, the NBT weakens competitiveness
of Sri Lanka’s exports and provides disincentives for FDI.
Mobilizing revenue. Keen and Lockwood (2010 1/) find that countries with a VAT raise more
revenue than those without, although gains vary with countries’ openness and income levels.

The VAT does pose administrative challenges, such as preventing fraudulent VAT refunds. In a
standard VAT, the tax authority needs to refund taxpayers whose input taxes exceeds tax receipts on
final products (e.g., exporters and start-up enterprises purchasing capital goods). Country experience
indicates that the refund process can be the “Achilles heel” of the VAT, as opportunities for fraud often
result in tension between tax authorities and taxpayers as well as complex administrative measures
(Harisson and Krelove, 2005; Keen and Smith, 2007 2/). Sri Lanka is not an exception: concern over VAT
fraud led to introduction of the so-called Simplified VAT (S-VAT) system, under which large exporters
are allowed to purchase goods and services free of VAT from registered suppliers, thereby effectively
eliminating refund entitlements. The concern has also prompted policymakers to look at the NBT as an
alternative to the VAT because refunds do not occur.
Managing VAT refunds would require introducing a risk-based compliance strategy and
simplifying the VAT. Country experience suggests no panacea. In Sri Lanka, the S-VAT can increase
compliance risk, because it now allows VAT-free purchases for more than 10 percent of VAT taxpayers.
Thus, it would be important to establish a VAT compliance plan, encompassing a review of the S-VAT
implementation and introduction of risk-based refund audit. The S-VAT should be phased out and
replaced by a robust VAT refund system, supported by improvements in administrative capacity. Also,
simplifying the VAT system, including through minimizing exemptions and setting an appropriate
registration threshold, would help improve VAT compliance.

12.
As a critical first step toward medium-term fiscal objectives, the authorities revised
down the 2016 budget deficit target to 5.4 percent of GDP (0.5 percentage points lower than
the original budget target). To offset the impact of the one-off and temporary factors in 2015 and
maintain the revenue to GDP ratio at the 2015 level, the authorities introduced tax measures
including increasing the VAT rate to 15 percent (from 11 percent) and removing exemptions on
telecommunication services, starting from May 2016. They also scaled back initial plans to exempt
wholesale and retail sectors from VAT, introduce multiple VAT rates, and raise the NBT rate from 2
percent to 4 percent. On the expenditure side, the authorities plan to control spending within
available fiscal space by streamlining non-critical expenditure on goods and services and capital
spending.
13.
There is a clear need to improve the quality of tax revenues and put them on an
upward path as part of a growth-friendly phase of fiscal consolidation and debt reduction. In
this context, the staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to reduce the 2016 deficit to 5.4 percent of
GDP. This is a necessary first step on a path to restructure public finances, and shift from a plethora
of fees, excises, and levies to a core revenue base with a stronger emphasis on direct versus indirect
taxation. A well designed path of fiscal consolidation should be a cornerstone in addressing current
macroeconomic imbalances and restoring investor confidence. Over the medium term, a stronger
fiscal position and improved public financial management can also create the space necessary for a
reorientation of public expenditure toward levels of infrastructure and social spending needed to
ensure high rates of sustained income growth, a steady reduction in poverty, and improvement in
Sri Lanka’s social development indicators.
14.
Lower fiscal deficits, enhanced tax revenues, stronger expenditure management, and
mitigated risks from state enterprises are essential to reducing Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic
and financial vulnerabilities. Sri Lanka’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) continues to
demonstrate a high level of risk to medium-term sustainability (see Annex III). The debt burden
benchmark of 70 percent of GDP and gross financing need benchmark of 15 percent of GDP are
exceeded in all shock scenarios. Risks are estimated to be particularly high for a potential contingent
liability shock (e.g., assuming all or part of the debt of public enterprises).4 Continuation of the
envisioned fiscal stance for 2016 (a primary deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP) would reduce the debt to
GDP ratio only by 3½ percentage points over 2015–20, leaving public debt highly vulnerable to
downside risks (e.g., negative growth shock). Revenue mobilization will be essential to create fiscal
space for higher expenditure and deficit reduction, and reducing key vulnerabilities. Moreover, very
low efficiency of income tax and VAT collection suggest ample room to increase the tax-to-GDP
ratio through base-broadening tax reforms (see panel chart below). These efforts should be
supported by improving the quality and effectiveness of public expenditure and reducing fiscal risks
from state enterprises. In that context, the following elements should be emphasized:

4

Under a contingent liability shock scenario in the public DSA (the central government becomes liable for additional
debt of 10 percent of GDP in 2017), public debt and gross funding needs would reach 80 percent of GDP and 15
percent of GDP in 2020, respectively.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SRI LANKA



A medium-term commitment to revenue mobilization and fiscal consolidation, as
outlined in the fiscal framework under the proposed Extended Arrangement and following
the principles highlighted in Box 3. To the extent that contingent liabilities come onto the
government books, the additional interest cost will need to be absorbed while adhering to
the envisioned fiscal path.



Tax policy reform to create a simple, efficient, equitable tax regime aimed at
collecting revenue rather than distributing benefits and incentives. Rationalization of
income tax expenditures and a new Inland Revenue Act will be critical steps, and should be
followed by VAT and customs reform.



Building capacity in revenue administration. Government ownership of this reform is
essential. Staff recommends establishment of performance benchmarks for efficient and
effective tax administration, a shift toward risk-based audit, and efficiency-enhancing
organizational reform of IRD operations. To achieve these objectives, full and expedited
rollout of the IT systems for tax and customs administration (RAMIS and ASYCUDA) is
critical, including linkages between the two systems.



Stronger expenditure management. This should be supported by measures to rationalize
ineffective public spending (e.g., replacing ill-targeted subsidies with cash transfers targeted
for the poor). At the same time, improvements in public expenditure management, in
particular in the area of commitment control, are necessary. Spending arrears have recurred
because of overly optimistic revenue projections and heavy reliance on cash releases to
control expenditure. While the ministry of finance should start to implement commitment
record and quarterly commitment ceilings using the current IT system, the expected roll out
of the new ITMIS system should be implemented without delay for fully automated
commitment control.



Decisive reform of state enterprise operations. Loss-making enterprises such as Sri
Lankan Airlines need to be restructured or resolved to stop the hemorrhage of public
finances. Other enterprises need to operate on a commercial footing—with the essential first
step being market-based pricing of fuel, electricity, and other utilities. A clear commercial
relationship, based on annual statements of corporate intent (SCI5) signed by the Ministry of
Finance, the line ministry, and the SOE, will help ensure viable commercial operations, and
clarify government’s obligations with respect to non-commercial operations (e.g., subsidies).

5

Statements of corporate intent are important public accountability documents. They typically include a description
of the entity’s core purpose, operating environment, key objectives, financial targets (commonly for the mediumterm), and important accounting or policy rules.

15.
The authorities agreed with the need for revenue-based fiscal consolidation and
further improvements in fiscal transparency and public financial management. Starting from a
significant reduction in the 2016 deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP, the authorities aim to steadily reduce
the deficit further to 3.5 percent of GDP or less by 2020 (equivalent to a primary surplus of 1 percent
of GDP to ensure continued debt reduction). In light of substantial needs for social and
infrastructure spending, the authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation needs to be revenue based.
The planned introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act will help to simplify the income tax system.
Reforming the current regime of corporate income tax incentives toward a targeted, transparent,
and rule-based system would be also important. The authorities also highlighted the benefits of
digitalization, and that tax administration should also improve with support from newly developed
IT systems. On the expenditure side, the authorities have already started to streamline untargeted
subsidies and introduced zero-based budgeting to prioritize high-quality government projects. They
plan to further strengthen capacity to identify and execute efficiently infrastructure projects,
improve commitment control including by expediting roll-out of a new IT system, and move swiftly
on the issue of outstanding obligations of SOEs.

Box 3. Tax Reform Strategy in Sri Lanka
Future tax reform should be geared toward a simple, efficient, and equitable system tailored to Sri
Lanka. Low tax efficiency in Sri Lanka suggests large potential revenue gains from base-broadening and tax
administration reforms. Basic principles that should guide year-to-year reforms (as emphasized in IMF policy
papers and TA reports) are as follows:


Direct taxes. A simple and broad-based corporate income tax regime would preserve revenue collection
while facilitating competitive statutory rates. Corporate tax incentives should be limited to those linked to
strategic investment. The personal income tax regime should treat individuals equally regardless of
occupation, with a tax rate scale appropriately set to alleviate income inequality. Income from capital can
be taxed at a low flat rate and collected at source. In Sri Lanka, numerous tax expenditures have been
granted against these principles, including corporate tax holidays, low tax rates for professionals, and
exemptions for debt securities issued by listed companies. Rationalizing these expenditures could
significantly increase tax revenue. Estimated revenue foregone due to corporate profit exemptions was in
the range of 1 1/3 percent of GDP in 2012–13, roughly equal to corporate tax collections.



Indirect taxes. Sri Lanka’s single-rate VAT should have minimal exemptions and an appropriate
registration threshold. The degree of base erosion (including from recent measures to exempt excisable
goods such as petroleum products, cars, tobacco, and alcohol and replace with increases in excise rates),
should be reviewed. The Nation Building Tax should be abolished (see Box 2). Levying excises on a few key
items at appropriate rates can support revenue needs while addressing externalities.



Other taxes. Reform areas would include strengthening property taxes, streamlining import tariffs and
para-tariffs, and establishing simple and coherent regimes for taxing SMEs.



Tax administration reform. Effective tax administration makes proper use of tax withholding and thirdparty information to increase voluntary compliance, and uses resources efficiently through risk
management and taxpayer segmentation. In Sri Lanka, there is a need to set up risk-based compliance
strategies by tax type, taking advantage of a new IT system. Simplification of tax legislation will also
contribute to improved tax administration.

Reforms should take account of lessons from the past. Sri Lanka’s 2011 tax reform contained measures to
improve the efficiency of the tax system: Board of Investment tax incentives were brought into the legal
framework; import taxes were streamlined; VAT rates were unified; and some “nuisance” taxes were abolished.
However, it also reduced corporate and personal income tax rates without a commensurate broadening of the
tax base, and continued the use of the NBT. New tax incentives and exemptions have been added virtually
every year since—eroding the tax base and complicating tax administration. The Ex Post Evaluation (EPE) of
the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement noted that a more strategic approach to sequencing the reforms—by
prioritizing base broadening, carefully calibrating the pace of rate reductions, and carefully aligning revenue
targets—might have made a difference. As suggested in the IMF’s Ex-Post Evaluation report, annual revenue
targets should be supported by clearly-specified, bottom-up measures that are marked by strong ownership.

B. Upgrading Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
16.
Steps to tighten monetary policy in late 2015 and early 2016 were appropriate but
further tightening may be needed in the months ahead. The central bank uses market based
instruments, in particular policy interest rates and open market operations, as the main policy tools
along with adjustments to the statutory reserve requirement. The staff welcomed steps already
taken to tighten monetary policy given the steady increase in core inflation and high private credit
growth (the CBSL increased the statutory reserve ratio from 6 percent to 7.5 percent in January
2016, and then increased the standing deposit facility rate and lending facility rate by 50 basis
points to 6.5 and 8 percent, respectively, in February 2016). March data suggest core inflation and
private credit growth have begun to moderate. However, staff believes the CBSL should stand ready
to further raise policy rates and tighten liquidity should inflationary pressures continue and private
credit growth not continue to moderate, or to support adjustment to exchange rate flexibility.
Where warranted, the CBSL should be also prepared to strengthen macroprudential measures to
mitigate excessive credit growth while carefully assessing the nature of the risks. These actions
should also be supported by the planned reduction in the government budget deficit.

exchange rate misalignment suggests that Sri Lanka’s current account gap is small (-0.2 percent of
GDP) with a cyclically-adjusted current account deficit close to the norm predicted by fundamentals.
However, the analysis also shows that policy imbalances are high, at 0.8 percent of GDP. Other
analysis of the equilibrium real exchange rate point to an overvaluation of about 11 percent. A more
qualitative analysis based on central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market suggests that
recent intervention has been driven largely by capital account transactions.
19.
Sri Lanka’s external position is weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable
policies, and there are several concerns with respect to external sustainability (Annex IV). Amid
the CBSL’s accommodation of foreign exchange demands from non-resident exit of the government
securities market, gross international reserves have fallen to a point short of gross foreign currency
claims coming due in 2016. Renewed swap arrangements with the RBI ($700 million) and through
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) line ($400 million) provide additional
buffer space, but are likely to be short-lived.8 The net International Investment Position (IIP) has
been increasingly skewed away from equity investments and toward debt and loans. However, on
the upside, external debt remains sustainable with low rollover risk (medium and long-term debt
represents 83 percent of external debt), although currency risk is elevated (see external DSA in
Annex III).
20.
With corrective fiscal policies presumed to be coming in to place, and a clear
commitment to confidence-boosting reforms, the staff sees it as essential for the CBSL to
begin an exit from current intervention policy. The steady, one-sided intervention policies of the
past 20 months have drained net reserves by about $3.2 billion and are unsustainable. In the staff’s
view, foreign exchange intervention is useful to contain volatility, but not to respond to underlying
outflows (which require policy strengthening). The staff recommended that the authorities preserve
reserve buffers by phasing out intervention in the foreign exchange market, or buying foreign
exchange reserves while sterilizing intervention to avoid undermining measures toward monetary
tightening. As a second step, the CBSL should start to accumulate foreign exchange reserves to
replenish buffers, and limit supply of residual foreign exchange to the market to the minimum,
including cases where market imperfections hinder settlement of smaller transactions. Over the
medium term, the staff argued that structural reforms to strengthen the monetary policy
transmission mechanism and deepen markets could also support a durable transmission to a more

are not available.

The bilateral swap with the RBI is due to expire in June 2016, or upon approval of a Fund arrangement. The SAARC
swap line is also due to expire in June 2016, but could be rolled over upon approval of a Fund arrangement.

flexible exchange rate regime. Such measures, supported with IMF technical assistance as needed,
could include:


The functioning of the money markets could be enhanced through the continued use of
term operations, generally with maturities of between 7 and 30 days (longer instruments to be
used for managing structural liquidity) and the removal of restrictions on short-selling of
securities along with broadening the investor base.



The repo markets could also benefit from the adoption of standard repo documentation
across the markets.



To deepen foreign exchange markets and reduce volatility, it is recommended that the
CBSL undertake a review of foreign exchange laws and regulations and develop a timeline
for rolling back restrictions on banks’ net open and forward positions in foreign exchange, as
well as phasing out remaining capital account restrictions.

21.
The authorities consider that the current monetary policy stance is broadly
appropriate, but stand ready to adjust as necessary. They expect inflation to remain at the midsingle digits and private credit growth to decelerate from the current rapid pace to about 15−16
percent for the year. While they are committed to moving toward flexible inflation targeting, they
emphasized that the commitment of the government on fiscal consolidation is essential to avoid an
expansionary fiscal stance fueling domestic demand and crowding out private credit. The authorities
concurred that flexible inflation targeting should accompany greater exchange rate flexibility along
with transparent and clear communication with the market. They also expressed an interest in
technical assistance to conduct a comprehensive diagnosis on capital market developments, noting
that the money markets are shallow and need broadening the investor base.

Box 4. Sri Lanka: Pathway to Greater Exchange Rate Flexibility
The CBSL has shown a tendency to actively manage the rupee in times of stress. In the past year, the CBSL
has intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market, announcing daily the rate for spot transactions, and
supplying substantial amounts of dollar liquidity ($3.7 billion from January 1, 2015 to February 15, 2016). The
CBSL’s policy reduced reserves and increased Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to shocks. Such policies were not new—it
utilized similar operations in 2008 and 2012.
An exit from the “on-again, off-again” approach to exchange rate flexibility would better serve Sri
Lanka in times of economic stress or external shocks. Planning such an exit should take into account crosscountry experience, which suggests four ingredients for a successful transition to a floating regime: (i) a deep
and liquid market; (ii) adequate systems to review and manage exchange rate risks, (iii) a coherent intervention
policy consistent with a floating regime; and (iv) an appropriate nominal anchor (IMF Occasional Paper No.
256). Sri Lanka fares variably on these dimensions, and has experimented with periods of greater flexibility. The
most binding constraints are a lack of transparency, a shallow market, and large deficit financing requirements.
A coherent and transparent intervention rule would help restore market confidence. Currently, Sri Lanka
does not have a publicly announced intervention rule. Given that intervention becomes discretionary under a
flexible regime, setting up well-specified principles enhances credibility and signals commitment to a marketdetermined rate. It is also important in avoiding excessive smoothing, which could also be confusing and send
contradictory messages. An intervention rule would also avoid suppressing useful market signals that
strengthen market development. It could be calibrated based on a set of objectives, including meeting reserve
targets, supply publicly acquired forex, correcting misalignments, or calming disorderly markets.
A successful intervention strategy needs to be realistic, useful, robust, and clear. The strategy should be
realistic on the uncertainty around the fair value of the rupee, and help the CBSL gain credibility through a
viable monetary policy framework and measurable success in controlling key targets. To maintain credibility, an
intervention strategy should be set once, remain fundamentally unchanged, and be robust to shocks, although
parameters (e.g. specific intervention thresholds) can evolve as needed. Clarity helps guide markets and
provides actionable instructions to traders. A number of countries have used an intervention strategy which
consists of five components: (1) the mid-point (the middle of the desired daily trading range for each day), (2)
the maximum volatility band (maximum desired within-day movement of the spot rate), (3) the neutral band
(the range of the spot rate over which the central bank would not intervene), (4) the daily intervention limit, and
(5) the intervention frontier (at what level to intervene and maximum intervention volumes at that rate).
Continued efforts are needed to deepen the forex market to facilitate price discovery. The authorities
could reduce constraints on market participants (allowing higher net open positions), develop derivative
markets, and increase hedging opportunities to build capacity to manage foreign exchange risk. Although Sri
Lanka has spot and forward markets, they are shallow (average daily interbank volumes are about $30 million).
A number of official and customary practices foster the lack of depth. Transactions by intermediaries are
monitored by the CBSL, which asks for detailed information when a trader’s net open position is not consistent
with orders—creating moral suasion to limit trading. Traders cannot smooth interventions by building short or
long positions to anticipate large orders, which leads to higher market volatility and less depth.
A shift to inflation targeting could facilitate exchange rate flexibility. The monetary framework has been
anchored on such quantitative indicators as broad money. While monetary targeting can be an alternative
anchor, inflation targeting could enhance credibility by making clear that price stability is the first priority. A
flexible inflation targeting framework includes a mandate to pursue an explicit inflation target as the overriding
objective of monetary policy; central bank independence and accountability; and a forward-looking procedure
that incorporates forecasts into policy and responds to deviations from targets. These would help rule out the
“on-again, off-again” approach to exchange rate flexibility by prioritizing policy objectives and eliminating timeinconsistency, together with a transparent intervention rule. In line with recent steps toward the FPAS model,
the authorities could lay the ground for inflation targeting as an alternative anchor by increased communication
with the public and the markets about the plans and objectives of monetary policymakers.

C. Building Resilience, Competitiveness, and Outward Orientation
Sri Lanka has demonstrated a relatively high degree of resilience to external shocks, but
nonetheless faces challenges from stronger economic headwinds, competitiveness issues, and
the need for a stronger outward orientation.
22.
The Sri Lankan economy has shown considerable resilience during turbulent times, but
building greater capacity to weather shocks may be increasingly important in the years
ahead. During most of the past two decades, Sri Lanka’s growth has been faster than that of the
region, and well above the emerging market average despite the dampening effect of civil war.
Market turbulence from the “taper tantrums” of 2013 and initial steps toward a reversal of
unconventional monetary policies also had comparatively less impact on Sri Lanka than other
regional markets. Rebalancing in China and related market disruptions has also had limited
spillovers given stronger trade ties with the U.S. and EU, the resilience of tourist inflows from China,
and renewed efforts to cement new trade arrangements and investments. However, the period
ahead could pose new external risks with a sharper impact:


A sharper than expected global growth slowdown (particularly in European countries), and
lower non-oil commodity prices could further depress Sri Lankan exports, widen the current
account deficit, and reduce economic growth. These effects could be mitigated by a further
dampening of oil prices, although lower collection of oil-related fiscal revenue would reduce the
mitigating impact.



Slower global and regional growth could also deter new FDI projects and potentially slow
implementation of new projects—precisely at a time when Sri Lanka is seeking to make a
welcome shift from public debt to a greater reliance on private financing.



Tighter external financing conditions. Sri Lanka’s sovereign borrowing spreads have already
widened considerably in response to domestic risks and shifting investor confidence.
Rebalancing of global portfolio flows and closer scrutiny of emerging markets in the midst of
heightened turbulence could further increase spreads, increase public financing costs and public
debt rollover risks, and reduce activity in the still-nascent Sri Lankan stock market.



Stronger de-risking trends owing to profitability concerns, risk appetites and more
stringent AML/CFT regulations could put a dent in remittance inflows. Anecdotal evidence
shows that the ongoing remittances slowdown is not primarily associated to de-risking factors.
However, reduced financial services from global and regional banks could exacerbate this factor,
adding to CA pressures and slowing down growth through reduced households’ consumption
and investment.

23.
Sound macroeconomic policies and larger fiscal and external cushions (greater fiscal
space and higher net international reserves) are the essential elements for maintaining
resilience. An ambitious and credible fiscal consolidation path anchored around debt sustainability,
while being mindful of growth implications, would help replenish fiscal buffers. Recent interest rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SRI LANKA

hikes would help attract foreign capital, while monetary policy should remain attuned to domestic
conditions. A renewed commitment to exchange rate flexibility with minimal recourse to
intervention and capital flows measures would help the exchange rate to absorb new external
shocks—reducing balance of payments disequilibria and facilitating reserves buildup. Structural
reforms should also be part of the equation. As discussed above, reforms to strengthen the
monetary policy framework, deepen the foreign exchange market, and increase transparency in
foreign exchange intervention policy would help maintain an internally coherent monetary policy
framework and provide a clear operating environment for the market.
24.
Renewed efforts to improve competitiveness and integrate into regional and global
supply chains will be key to achieving sustained high growth and greater resilience. To boost
external trade and private sector development, the staff recommended reducing costs through
addressing protectionism. A key element in this work would be a review of Sri Lanka’s trade regime
including an evaluation of para-tariffs and other nontariff barriers (which have raised Sri Lanka’s
effective rate of protection to high levels). The staff welcomed ongoing efforts to enhance
competitiveness through other means, including removal of the EU fisheries import ban, and the
reinstatement of GSP plus status. Further steps are needed to increase the efficiency of trade
facilitation (including through full implementation of electronic customs documentation), remove
barriers to foreign investment entry and establishment, enhance access to finance, and strengthen
financial market infrastructure. A recent IMF Board paper9 showed that these reforms are among
those with the highest productivity payoff for emerging markets.

Box 5. Sri Lanka’s Trade Regime and Performance in World Markets
While statutory customs tariffs are relatively low, use of para-tariffs and other trade taxes make the
effective rate of protection considerably higher. This partly reflects the revenue problem, as progressive
use of border taxes somewhat compensated for weak VAT and income tax. Trade taxes currently in use are
the Cess Levy, Special Commodity Levy, and Port and Airport Development Levy, which amounted to 1.4
percent of GDP in 2015 while import duties were 1.2 percent of GDP. World Bank estimates suggested that
the average total nominal protection rate as of 2011 was about 24 percent, with para-tariffs amounting to
12 percent. The imposition of these para-tariffs and other trade taxes are often considered as complex and
unpredictable, reducing transparency. Cross country comparison suggests Sri Lanka has effectively gone
backwards on trade protection—defying both regional and global trends in policies and performance.
Sri Lanka’s weaker trade performance points to the need of reforms. Growth has not been driven by
expanding exports and shifting to more processed goods, but by domestic demand fueled by government
spending and inward remittances. This reflects in Sri Lanka’s trade performance – both exports and total
trade as a share of world market declined over the 2000s and stagnated in recent years (albeit with
fluctuations). Lack of integration and continued protection will only limit Sri Lanka’s growth potential and
undermine increased diversification and resilience to external shocks.

Reviving Sri Lanka’s outward orientation will also be essential to achieving growth and
other macroeconomic objectives. As noted above, Sri Lanka’s share in world trade has declined
over the years. Some of this was likely linked to increasing isolation and lower productivity during
the civil war, but a second component seems to have been a policy of creeping protectionism and
import substitution. Several of Sri Lanka’s neighbors have performed more strongly in this regard—
managing to boost their share of global exports between 2000 and 2015. Notably, the services
sector (which has been largely immune from para tariffs, excises, and other forms of non-tariff
barriers) has performed much more strongly than goods exports in recent years, mirroring the rise
of services in the economy as a whole, and more than keeping up with other lower middle income
economies. FDI remains relatively low, however, highlighting the cost of policy uncertainty.

The authorities largely agreed with
staff’s recommendations, and highlighted
the initiatives already started in these areas.
They noted the steady decline in Sri Lanka’s
exports as a share of world trade over the past
two decades as a sign of fundamental structural
bottlenecks and misguided trade policies that
had effectively made Sri Lanka more protective.
They highlighted the establishment of two new
agencies, for trade and development,
respectively, charged with taking stock of
current impediments and creating strategies for
structural reform. They were keenly aware that
a clear outward orientation was needed to
bolster competitiveness, and move Sri Lanka into higher value chains, as well as the need to foster
more equity-related investments to ensure less debt accumulation and greater transfer of
technology and management skills.

D. Deepening Financial Sector Surveillance
27.
While the financial system appears well capitalized and liquid, the authorities should
remain vigilant to the risk of a potential rise in non-performing loans (NPL). Financial
soundness indicators for the fourth quarter of 2015 were generally favorable with capital adequacy
comfortably above regulatory limits. Asset quality of state banks appears broadly sound, with most
of the loans to state enterprises guaranteed by the government—these loans amount to 18 percent
of total loans of state banks. However, in the absence of a clear and consistent government policy
with respect to non-commercial operations of state enterprises (such as subsidies—which frequently
end up as SOE debt to state banks), close scrutiny of these banks and stress testing which includes
an emphasis on contingent liability risk is recommended.
28.
Staff welcomed steps toward supervision on a consolidated basis and shifting to Basel
III. The preliminary draft on the amendments to the Banking Act to bring the single borrower limit
(SBL) and related party lending definitions in line with international best practices, are welcome, and
were assessed by an IMF technical assistance mission in mid-April 2016. The CBSL is also assessing
the possibility of introducing fit and proper assessments for owners of finance companies, and
requirements on the Basel III capital standard are expected to be introduced in the first half of 2016
in line with the international timeline.
29.
Staff concurred with the authorities that continued efforts are needed to strengthen
the legal framework for crisis preparedness and resolution. The Fund will work to provide
technical assistance in support of ongoing work toward a resolution framework to deal with finance
companies which are insolvent or currently operating below the regulatory minimum capital
adequacy requirement (which could be done through an establishment of a special purposed
vehicle—as suggested in the 2016 Budget).
30.
The authorities viewed the financial system as robust and well capitalized. They
highlighted that existing weaknesses in the financial system are mostly in the nonbank financial
sector. Some finance companies (comprising 16 percent of the non-banking sector) need to
replenish capital, although the size of capital injection needs would be limited because the total
assets of these companies are about 1 percent of GDP. The authorities reiterated their commitment
to finalizing a resolution framework for weak finance companies—through establishment of a
special purpose vehicle—by the end of this year, and are seeking support of IMF technical assistance
in this area.

PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
31.
The proposed new Fund-supported program aims to provide a policy anchor for
macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, while strengthening external resiliency in a
challenging global environment. As described in the Letter of Intent (Appendix I) and
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, Attachment I to LOI), the key objectives of
the program relate to fiscal policy and the balance of payments, and measures to: (i) implement a
structural increase in revenues, facilitating a reduction in the fiscal deficit; (ii) reverse the decline in
central bank foreign exchange reserves; (iii) reduce public debt relative to GDP and lower Sri Lanka’s
risk of debt distress; and (iv) enhance public financial management and improve the operations of
state owned enterprises. The program also aims to transition toward flexible inflation targeting with
a flexible exchange rate regime and to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth. To
achieve these objectives, the program would envisage implementation of a set of reforms under six
pillars: (i) fiscal consolidation; (ii) revenue mobilization; (iii) public financial management reform; (iv)
state enterprise reform; (v) transition to flexible inflation targeting under a flexible exchange rate
regime; and (vi) reforms in the trade and investment regime. The program is expected to meet Sri
Lanka’s BOP needs arising from the legacy of past policies and deterioration in the external
environment—providing sufficient reserve cover to buffer against new shocks as macroeconomic
policies are adjusted. The structural nature of key reforms and the time required to achieve durable
solutions (and an improvement in the BOP) support the use of an extended facility.

A. Pillar #1: Fiscal Consolidation
32.
The program envisages a return to fiscal consolidation, guided by the authorities’
goal of an overall deficit of 3.5 percent in 2020 (MEFP ¶4). To support this, the program sets
a deficit reduction path from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016 to 4.0 percent of GDP in 2018. The

although it will be
important for the government to work toward more effective social protection schemes going
forward.11 The revenue-based fiscal consolidation is expected to preserve fiscal space for
increasing infrastructure and key social spending,12 while ensuring (through a path toward steady
primary surpluses) a steady reduction in the public debt ratio from 76 percent in 2015 to
68 percent in 2020.13 At the same time, fiscal consolidation will reduce gross financing needs by 6
percent of GDP over the program period—allowing sufficient room for an orderly expansion of
private sector credit.

10

Under the baseline scenario, the projection assumes fiscal multiplier of about 0.3 based on the evidence for
emerging market economies, which would lower growth by about 0.2 percentage points during 2017–18.
11
The World Bank has committed to deeper analytical work with respect to the potential social implications of
the planned fiscal consolidation path, as well as to help the authorities with better targeted social protection
schemes.
12
The programmed level of capital spending is justified given the low base in 2015 (capex fell to 4½ percent of
GDP). The World Bank has also cited the need to finance infrastructure needs going forward to meet rising
demand; as well as higher spending on health, education and related areas to avoid undercutting Sri Lanka’s past
gains in human development.
13
These figures do not account for the outstanding obligations of SOEs, amounting to 11 percent of GDP as of
end-2015. If assumed by the government, these obligations will have a material impact on the stock of debt,
once assumed by government, and would effectively create a step-change in the path for public debt reduction.
Such a scenario is analyzed in the attached DSA.

B. Pillar #2: Revenue Mobilization
33.
Revenue mobilization is envisioned as the linchpin of programmed fiscal
adjustment, and would be achieved by base-broadening tax policy measures as well as
reforms toward efficient, risk-based tax administration. These will be complemented by
efforts to simplify the tax system. In line with recommendations made during successive technical
assistance missions, the fiscal structural reform agenda includes the following elements:


Tax policy measures (MEFP ¶7). In light of low tax efficiency, the program seeks to broaden
the base for income tax and VAT. To reduce income tax expenditures, the authorities will
publish a statement of tax expenditures, i.e., catalogue and cost all existing tax exemptions,
holidays, and special rates, and subsequently rationalize these tax expenditures, for example
by limiting corporate tax incentives to expenditure-based ones tied to investment. This is also
supported by introduction of a new income tax law with a view to simplifying and broadbasing the tax, supported by Fund TA. The income tax reform will be followed by basebroadening VAT reform including rationalizing VAT exemptions. Further, the authorities plan
to streamline the trade tax regime.



Tax administration reform (MEFP ¶8): There is ample scope to make tax administration
more risk-based, supported by ongoing efforts to upgrade IT systems. In this regard, the
program seeks to improve administrative efficiency of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)
through adoption of risk-based compliance strategies for VAT and income tax as well as
introduction of Key Performance Indicators on the number of risk-based VAT audit. The
program also support timely roll out of the new IT systems for domestic tax and customs
administration (RAMIS and ASYCUDA). Further, the authorities will pursue organizational and
business procedure reform for the IRD, including creating a design and monitoring unit.

C. Pillar #3: Public Financial Management Reform
34.
The program aims to improve expenditure management and fiscal risk monitoring
(MEFP ¶11). The recent emphasis on overdue payments and quasi-fiscal obligations related to
state enterprises highlights the need for measures to bolster public financial management (PFM),
as elaborated below.


Commitment control. To control expenditure within fiscal resources and without
incurring future arrears, the authorities will establish a commitment control system based
on commitment records and quarterly expenditure commitment ceilings, starting from
mid-2016. The program also supports timely roll-out of the new Integrated Treasury
Management Information System (ITMIS), which will significantly expand PFM
capabilities, including commitment control, budget preparation, treasury, accounting,
and procurement.



Fiscal reporting and risk. To improve fiscal transparency, the authorities plan to publish
quarterly financial bulletins summarizing government fiscal operations; ensure that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

SRI LANKA

annual budgets explicitly cost out tax expenditures; and adhere to Government Financial
Statistics Manual (GFSM) standards. The authorities also plan to include in the annual
budget analysis of fiscal risks including those related to SOEs and public-private
partnerships (PPPs).

D. Pillar #4: State Enterprise Reform
35.
Sri Lanka had some 235 public enterprises representing 17 percent of the nation’s
economic activity in 2010. Although some SOEs are profitable and performing well, collectively
they represent a drag on the private economy and a drain on public finances (both directly, and
through the state banks, which fund the largest SOEs). The obligations noted above are largely
tied to SOEs, which highlights the need for financial discipline. The Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation (CPC, the monopoly in fuel refinery and distribution) and the Ceylon Electricity
Board (CEB, the state electricity company) have incurred financial losses in fulfilling noncommercial obligations because of implicit energy subsidies—retail fuel and electricity prices
have been set below cost-recovery levels. Sri Lankan Airlines has been a loss-making SOE,
reflecting competition with international airlines operating within the region. Against this
background, the authorities will introduce far-reaching SOE reforms, as elaborated below (MEFP
¶12).


A resolution strategy for Sri Lankan Airlines will be completed by September 2016,
effectively removing this company from the government’s accounts.



Enhance oversight and financial discipline of SOEs. Drawing on FAD TA
recommendations, six major SOEs will establish (with agreement of MOF and the relevant line
ministry) a Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI), to include: the SOE’s objectives and multiyear
corporate plan; capital expenditure and financing plans; explicit financial and non-financial
targets; and cost of non-commercial obligations. The authorities will also consider
strengthening the legal framework for the governance and oversight of SOEs.



Reform of energy and other utility subsidies. The authorities will introduce a formulabased automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum products, so as to ensure that future
losses by the CPC and large retail adjustments are avoided. Also, the Public Utilities
Commission will be granted enhanced authority to set electricity and water tariffs in a costreflective manner. To support these objectives, the fiscal cost of non-commercial obligations
for SOEs will be included in the central government budget.

E. Pillar #5. Enhancing monetary policy effectiveness
36.
The focus of monetary policy will be to keep inflation in the low single digits, while
allowing for a durable transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime. Inflation
performance will be monitored through a monetary policy consultation clause, and exchange
rate flexibility will be enforced by the programmed accumulation of net international reserves.
The program establishes an inflation target band around the projected inflation path, and if

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

inflation falls outside the band, the authorities will consult with the Fund on the reason for the
deviation and proposed policy response, which may include adjustment in the CBSL’s policy
interest rates. The monetary policy consultation clause will be supported by monitoring of
reserve money as an indicative target. A strengthening of reserve adequacy (guided by the level
of net international reserves (NIR) as a percentage of the ARA reserve metric) will also be
programmed, anchored with a PC (floor) on NIR. Further, because the supply and demand for
foreign exchange will be uncertain over the program period, the program includes a clause
whereby the authorities would consult with the Fund staff on the appropriate policy response in
the event that the gap between supply and demand of foreign exchange results in a more
sudden and disruptive depreciation of the exchange rate than anticipated by the staff and
authorities.
37.
The program would support the move toward flexible inflation targeting and
financial market deepening. Technical work in support of this objective (focused on developing
more sophisticated econometric models for macroeconomic forecasting) has been supported by
Fund technical assistance. Further work is needed to develop a working model estimation of the
economy to support inflation forecasting. A roadmap would be developed to set milestones in
the development, testing and making operational a shift to inflation targeting within the period
of the program, supported by additional technical assistance. Such milestones would include
adopting an inflation forecasting model, announcing a medium-term numerical inflation
objective to serve as a nominal anchor, introducing a policy rate in the middle of the corridor
which will serve as an operational target, and establishing an effective communication
arrangement. Further, appropriate legal and organizational frameworks need to be put in place
to ensure accountability and credibility of inflation targeting.

F. Pillar #6: Supporting Trade and Investment to Strengthen External
Sustainability
38.
Achieving medium-term growth and reserve objectives will require a renewed
effort toward greater integration into regional and global supply chains, higher levels of
FDI, and enhancing prospects for private sector investment. In addition to better
infrastructure, this will entail improvements in the trade regime and investment climate, and also
restoring export profitability. Sri Lanka has been actively promoting further integration to the
world economy through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). It has signed FTAs with India, Pakistan,
and Iran, and further strengthened cooperation in technical areas with India through the India
Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) which was signed in early 2016. An FTA
with China is under discussion. Sri Lanka has strengthened the economic relationship with the
U.S. through the Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), the primary forum for bilateral
trade and investment discussions between the two countries. Notably, the EU announced the
lifting of a ban on fisheries imports from Sri Lanka in April 2016. This should facilitate talks
toward Sri Lanka regaining the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP Plus) status with the
EU, potentially by the end of this year. Sri Lanka is also a member of the South Asia Free Trade
Agreement (SAFTA), the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

SRI LANKA

Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) which aims to achieve its own
free trade area by 2017.
39.
To boost trade and private sector development, the program envisages reducing
protectionism to enable competitiveness. A key element in this work will be a review of Sri
Lanka’s trade regime including an evaluation of para-tariffs and other nontariff barriers. The
trade regime remains complex, and needs to be simplified by limiting the number of rates,
phasing out para-tariffs, and minimizing the number of duty exemptions. The authorities are
currently negotiating a program loan with the World Bank to enhance competitiveness. It aims to
increase the efficiency of trade facilitation (including through the ratification of the WTO Trade
Facilitation Agreement, the establishment of the National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC),
and full implementation of use of electronic customs documentation), remove barriers to foreign
investment entry and establishment (including access to land), enhance access to finance, and
strengthen financial market infrastructure. In this context, a one-stop-shop for foreign investors
has been created to reduce the processing time for investment approval. These steps should help
to attract FDI and complement public investment.

G. Program Modalities
40.
Semi-annual program reviews would be undertaken based on quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks, with quarterly indicative targets and staff visits between each review. Test
dates for the first and second review would be end-June and end-December 2016, respectively.
An update safeguards assessment of the CBSL is underway and should be completed no later
than the first program review. The last assessment was completed in 2009, and
recommendations in audit and controls areas have been implemented. The update assessment
will evaluate, inter alia, developments in the legal framework and autonomy against leading
practices for central banks.
41.
Proposed access is 185 percent of quota (SDR 1,070.780 million). This level of access is
based on staff’s assessment of the outlook, the strength of the envisaged reforms, and the
estimated gross external financing requirement during the program period. Of this, a financing
gap of US$1.5 billion would arise in order to keep gross reserves at an adequate and increasing
level as measured by the Fund’s composite metric. The program also envisages a steady increase
in net international reserves to a level commensurate with 75 percent of the ARA metric over the
medium term. The choice of a three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility is
motivated by the structural and longer-term nature of such key challenges as raising revenue,
enacting durable tax reforms, building revenue administration capacity, and bringing state
enterprise operations to a commercial footing.
42.
Sri Lanka is expected to be able to meet its obligations under the proposed
arrangement. With the proposed access, outstanding Fund credit would reach a peak of
SDR 1,070.78 million by 2019 (6.7 percent of exports). However, there are significant downside
risks related the economic headwinds cited earlier and their potential to combine into a
downside scenario that would necessitate either further adjustment or additional financing.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

While Sri Lanka has an unblemished repayment history with the IMF (and a strong external
repayment history in general), the broader context highlights high debt vulnerability, very low
revenue/debt ratio and a high debt service/exports ratio.
43.
Support from other donors. Staff has worked in close consultation with the World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, and key bilateral donors with respect to program design and timing.
There are firm commitments from donors to fill the entire financing gap for the first 12 months
of the arrangement, and good prospects that there will be adequate multilateral and bilateral
financing for the remainder of the program. Financial support from these partners is expected to
reach $650 million during 2016−18, with strong technical assistance also provided.
44.
Prior actions. The following prior actions are proposed to be undertaken by the
authorities ahead of the Executive Board meeting to underpin the upfront implementation of
reforms:
45.
Cabinet to issue a Memorandum requiring the Ministry of Finance to complete by
end-October 2016 a time-bound strategy to address the issue of outstanding arrears of the
central government obligations of state enterprises. The Memorandum will specify that the
strategy include: (i) completion (by end-2016) a comprehensive database of SOE’s financial
obligations, including a breakdown of arrears and non-arrears to be certified by the Auditor
General for use in creating a registry of such obligations; (ii) clarification of the government’s
responsibility over existing obligations related to subsidies and other non-commercial
obligations of the SOEs (i.e., what proportion of these debts to assume, if any).

Ministry of Finance to issue circulars to (i) formally implement tax policy and other
revenue measures outlined in the Cabinet Memorandum of March 4, 2016; (ii) detailing revised
expenditure ceilings for government ministries and agencies consistent with the overall budget
deficit target for 2016.

Cabinet resolution adopting a framework note (agreed with IMF staff) for a new
Inland Revenue Act, which embodies key tax policy drivers, overarching legal design framework,
and the tax law reform roadmap as outlined in the March 2016 IMF Legal Department technical
assistance mission Aide Memoire.

Formally suspend by Cabinet order the Board of Investment's capacity to grant tax
exemptions, tax holidays, and special tax rates until such time as the BOI Act can be formally
amended.
46.
Quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks (Table 1 and Table 2
attached to the MEFP). The program will be monitored with semiannual quantitative performance
criteria on the government primary balance and net official international reserves of the CBSL. A
monetary policy consultation clause will be applied with respect to inflation. A continuous
performance criterion (a zero ceiling) will be applied to new external arrears. There will also be
indicative targets on central government tax revenue (floor) and reserve money (ceiling).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

SRI LANKA

Structural benchmarks have been established to gauge progress in key reform measures
discussed above. Staff will also monitor the stock of gross debt, consistent with program
projections, adjusted for exchange rate changes.
47.
Risks. Key program risks include (i) revenue slippage or failure to implement key
revenue-related reforms; (ii) weaker than expected capital inflows could widen significantly the
projected financing gap given already high gross financing needs of close to 19 percent of GDP
in 2016 ; (iii) lower than expected growth and/or new pressures on the trade account; and (iv)
larger than expected losses at state owned enterprises and/or inability to carry through with
fundamental reforms to bring these firms first to a commercial footing. These risks could
challenge public debt sustainability (see DSA in Annex III). Risks would be mitigated by extensive
policy dialogue, as well as a steady pipeline of technical assistance from the Fund, the World
Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral institutions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Economic growth is showing some signs of strain, consistent with policy-induced
macroeconomic imbalances and a more difficult external environment. Despite a substantial
boost to consumption from public wage, salary, and transfer increases, real GDP growth has
stalled—reflecting a mix of lower public and private investment, as well as slower global trade.
Some of these dampening factors have the potential to be quickly reversed through a re-set of
fiscal and monetary policies, restoration of confidence, and a boost to trade from resolution of
current import bans and resumption of some preferential trading arrangements. However, the
risk of strengthening external headwinds also appears more acute than in past periods.
49.
The authorities’ economic program—supported by the proposed extended
arrangement under the EFF—offers a credible plan for correcting underlying imbalances, putting
public finances on a path to sustainability, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, and enabling
sustained and inclusive economic growth. The program seeks to (i) implement a structural
increase in revenues to reduce the fiscal deficit; (ii) reverse the decline in central bank foreign
exchange reserves; (iii) reduce public debt relative to GDP and lower Sri Lanka’s risk of debt
distress; and (iv) enhance public financial management and improve the operations of state
owned enterprises. The program also aims to transition toward flexible inflation targeting with a
flexible exchange rate regime and to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by
supporting trade and investment.
50.
Sizeable fiscal adjustment is needed over the medium-term to correct domestic and
external balances and put public debt on clear downward path. The fiscal adjustment profile
is ambitious and front-loaded, but the projected shift into primary fiscal surpluses over the life of
the program through gains in revenue reflect: (i) the very low revenue base, and the need to
make decisive progress in reversing the trend decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio through
fundamental reform of tax policy and administration; and (ii) the clear need to reduce Sri Lanka’s
annual financing requirement and public debt. The authorities will need to communicate how

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

basic reforms envisaged in the program will distribute more equitably the burden of taxation,
increase transparency, and reduce opportunity for discretion and favoritism.
51.
Tax policy and administration reforms will need to be sustained over several years
to change the policy dynamic (particularly around exemptions and other tax expenditures)
and bring concrete results to higher tax revenues. A new and modernized Inland Revenue Act
with minimal deviations from the basic principles outlined in the recent IMF technical assistance
mission is a critical first step. This will need to be followed by similar efforts to broaden the base
for the VAT and the customs code, and to strengthen significantly their administration. Building
capacity toward risk-based tax administration is critical, including setting specific performance
indicators, using automation to remove discretion and bolster credibility, and moving to riskbased audit.
52.
There is need to expedite public financial management and SOE reforms to avoid
recurrence of spending arrears and mitigate fiscal risks. An effective commitment control
system needs to be established quickly, based on commitment record and expenditure ceilings,
and expedited roll out of the new IT system. Addressing the outstanding obligations of state
enterprises as well as their day-to-day operations will be essential to curtailing fiscal risk and
strengthening the role of market forces in the economy. The authorities are already taking
concrete steps toward a solution for Sri Lankan Airlines, and the eventual fiscal implications will
need to be addressed going forward. For other key SOEs, the program lays out a course toward
clarifying the financial relationship with the central government, responsibility for noncommercial obligations now and into the future, and establishing market-based pricing for fuel
and electricity to minimize subsidies and enable operations on a commercial basis (capable of
servicing their current set of obligations).
53.
Monetary policy has started on a course of adjustment, but given the absence of
buffers must continue to play a role in stemming current imbalances. Initial steps toward
monetary tightening should play out over the coming months given the lags in monetary
transmission. Given the lags, the CBSL should stand ready to further tighten the monetary policy
stance should inflationary pressures continue, private credit growth not moderate, or capital
outflows and downward pressure on the exchange rate persist. With time, a durable shift to
flexible inflation targeting should both bolster the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhance
the shift to exchange rate flexibility.
54.
Exchange rate flexibility is embedded in the programmed accumulation of
international reserves, but a clear change in the policy framework is needed over the nearto medium-term. To reach the NIR objectives set under the Fund-supported program, the CBSL
will need to disembark from the active intervention policies that have dominated for the past 20
months. While the exchange rate does not appear fundamentally misaligned, there is evidence of
a market dysfunction stemming from both a loss of confidence in macroeconomic policies and
the one-sided nature of intervention. To ensure a durable shift to a flexible exchange rate
regime, there is a need to deepen the foreign exchange market, supported by credible

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

SRI LANKA

macroeconomic policies, and a clear and coherent framework for monetary and exchange rate
policy.
55.
Continued vigilance is needed to maintain financial sector stability. The banking
system at present does not appear to be a source of vulnerability. However, careful scrutiny of
balance sheets is needed with respect to the large stock of state enterprise obligations to public
banks, as well as the potential for rising NPLs as the rapid increase in private credit decelerates.
Pockets of vulnerability remain in the nonbank sector and should be addressed.
56.
Achieving high and sustained rates of economic growth over the medium-term
hinges on implementation of an ambitious program of structural reform. Reforms planned
for the structure of the tax system, revenue administration, budget management, utility pricing
and state enterprise operations, financial market deepening, as well as the trade and investment
regime can, if implemented fully, unleash Sri Lanka’s considerable economic potential and
capacity to fully exploit comparative advantages in geographical position and human capital.
57.
Risks to the program are significant. The proposed program will require strong
political commitment and implementation by a relatively new government. The key risk is that
essential reforms will be delayed, watered down, or abandoned in the face of challenges. External
shocks, such as weaker-than-anticipated capital inflows and lower-than-projected growth can
challenge the reform effort. The authorities’ top level commitment to the reform planned
outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies should mitigate this risk, but
public outreach should also be bolstered to explain both the short-term costs and the mediumterm gains to shareholders and the general public. Contingency planning for the most likely
shocks should also be considered.
58.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for an Extended Arrangement. In view of Sri
Lanka’s balance of payments need, the policy actions already taken, and the authorities’
commitment to implement an ambitious reform package over the duration of the program, staff
supports the authorities’ request for an Extended Arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR
1,070.78 million.
59.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Sri Lanka be held on
the 24-month cycle, subject to Decision No. 14747, as amended.

Annex I. Response to Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have actively engaged in a policy dialogue with the Fund (both before and after
elections in January and August 2015). Some IMF recommendations have been implemented, but
some policies deviated from previous IMF advice.
Continue fiscal consolidation and debt
reduction, but shift the burden of adjustment
to revenue generation.

Fiscal consolidation stalled in 2014 and 2015.
Revenue gains achieved, but only through
one-off measures and higher collection of
trade-related taxes (from increase in imports).

Debt targets could potentially be recast to
achieve deeper reduction over a longer
period.

Fiscal targets have been re-set, but without
setting a deeper reduction to the debt target
over a longer period.

A more systematic effort to broaden the tax
base to improve revenue collection.

Currently underway with redrafting of Inland
Revenue Act as first stage in comprehensive
reform of tax system.

IMF technical assistance to quantify the costs
of tax expenditures—as an input to
government’s own medium-term reform plan.

Technical assistance on tax policy, tax
legislation, and public financial management
undertaken (basis for current reform
program).
Monetary policy subsequently loosened.

Staff argued for keeping the current monetary
stance unchanged.
Maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, as
the CBSL’s interventions had effectively
stabilized the exchange rate.

Central bank intervention continued while the
exchange rate was kept virtually steady until
September 2015.

The mission highlighted some aspects that
might limit potential gains from the
government’s proposed financial sector
consolidation plan.

Financial sector consolidation plan was
abandoned following January 2015 elections.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Sri Lanka’s public debt and gross funding needs stand high compared with peers, with the ratio of
gross financing needs to GDP being the third largest among emerging economies. Fiscal
consolidation envisaged under the EFF-supported program would steadily reduce them. However,
there are significant downside risks including those related to contingent liabilities, with stress tests
indicating a high risk to public debt sustainability. External debt remains sustainable, though with
high currency risks. Risks to external debt sustainability are mitigated by long maturities and Sri
Lanka’s access to international financial markets.

A. Background and Key Assumptions
1.
Public debt reached 79.5 percent of GDP at end-2015. Public debt in this DSA covers
debt owed by the central government (76 percent of GDP) and outstanding amount of loans
guaranteed by the central government (3.4 percent of GDP). Foreign-currency denominated debt
accounted for 47 percent of total, while debt owed to official and multilateral creditors
accounted for about a quarter of the total. Gross financing needs are projected at 19.2 percent of
GDP in 2016, comprising short-term debt repayment of 7.5 percent of GDP, medium-and longterm debt amortization of 6.3 percent of GDP, and projected overall deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP.
Sri Lanka’s debt to GDP ratio remains higher than the median for emerging economies (57
percent; excluding major oil exporters), and gross funding needs are the third largest among
them. SOEs’ financial obligations identified by recent FAD TA (11 percent of GDP at end-2015)
are not included in the public debt outstanding. Nevertheless, the impact from possible
realization of the contingent liabilities is assessed under a shock scenario.
2.
External debt is estimated at 55.1 percent of GDP at end-2015. It is predominantly
owed by the public sector (55 percent held by the general government and 6 percent by the
central bank). However, private

of total debt (i.e., public and
private) is medium or long term and the next sovereign bond repayment is not due until 2019
(US$1.5 billion). About half of the central government’s external debt stock is denominated in
dollars.
3.
The baseline scenario of the DSA is built on the macroeconomic framework under
the EFF-supported program. Real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent over 2016−18 and
thereafter would pick up to 5.4 percent by 2020. Inflation is projected to stay around 5 percent

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

over the medium term. Fiscal deficit is expected to decrease from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016 to
the authorities’ target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2020. This implies that primary balance improves
from deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2016 to surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2018 and 1.0
percent of GDP in 2020. Interest payments are projected based on the projected interest
payments for existing debt, and the interest rates in the secondary government security markets
prevailing in March 2016 for the newly issued debt in 2016. The interest rates for newly issued
debt are assumed to decrease gradually by about 2 percentage points over the medium term.
Publicly guaranteed debt is projected to remain broadly unchanged at the 2015 level in nominal
terms. External debt projections are based on the projected widening of the current account
deficit from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2016 to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2020, and incorporate planned
purchases under the Fund’s Extended Arrangement and disbursements of program loans by
multilateral and bilateral creditors.

B. Public Debt Sustainability
4.
Fiscal consolidation envisaged under the EFF-supported program would steadily
reduce public debt. The consolidation path envisaged under the baseline scenario is projected
to bring down the ratio of public debt to GDP steadily from 79.5 percent in 2015 to 70.3 percent
in 2020. It will reduce the debt to GDP ratio by about 2½–2¾ percent annually from 2018
onwards, supported by a favorable debt dynamics with a negative interest-rate-and-growth
differential. Gross financing needs are projected to decrease from 19 percent of GDP in 2016 to
12 percent of GDP in 2020.
5.
Nevertheless, there are significant downside risks to the baseline scenario. If fiscal
consolidation stalls and primary balance remains unchanged at the 2016 level (-0.8 percent of
GDP), the reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over 2015−20 would be only 3½ percentage
points, much lower than in the baseline scenario (9 percentage points). Debt reductions would
become less significant under individual shock scenarios on primary balance (lower primary
surplus by 0.3−0.4 percentage points of GDP for 2017−18), GDP growth (2 percentage points
lower than in the baseline for 2017−18), the exchange rate (15 percent real depreciation in 2017
vis-à-vis the baseline), and the interest rate (an increase by 300 basis points for new borrowings
during 2017−20 vis-à-vis the baseline). When these shocks are combined, the debt to GDP ratio
would reach 85 percent in 2020. Similarly, in a contingent liability shock scenario (the central
government becomes liable for additional debt of 10 percent of GDP in 2017), the debt to GDP
ratio would reach 82 percent of GDP in 2020. In the combined shock scenario and the contingent
liability shock scenario, gross funding needs would remain elevated at 15−16 percent of GDP in
2020.
6.
Heat map analysis indicates a high risk to debt sustainability. The debt burden
benchmark of 70 percent of GDP and gross financing need benchmark of 15 percent of GDP are
exceeded in the baseline and the shock scenarios during the projection period, reflecting the
initial conditions (under the baseline, the debt to GDP ratio and gross financing needs as a
percent of GDP were 80 percent and 19 percent in 2016, respectively). Debt profile analysis

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

SRI LANKA

indicates moderate degree of vulnerabilities related to market perception, external financing
requirement, debt held by non-residents, and debt denominated in foreign currency.

C. External Debt Sustainability
7.
The ratio of external debt to GDP is projected to remain broadly constant over the
medium term. Under the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to increase by 2
percentage points of GDP to 57.1 percent in 2019. It will then start decreasing, driven by strong
GDP growth and subdued FDI loans and other debt-creating private capital inflows.
8.
Nevertheless, vulnerabilities linked to inadequate reserve coverage, exchange rate
depreciation, and early deleveraging could pose a risk for debt servicing. Currency risk,
notably related to the dollar, is high. Further rupee depreciation could pose a significant risk, if
sustained; as stress tests show that a 30 percent real depreciation would raise the external debt
to GDP ratio to about 82 percent. This is mitigated by low rollover risks with the large share of
medium and long term debt, though tighter global financing liquidity and declining investor
confidence could raise rollover vulnerabilities and costs—public external financing at non
concessional terms substitute gradually for concessional financing to which Sri Lanka does not
have access anymore. Lower than expected GDP or exports rebound from their current dip would
also deteriorate debt dynamics.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government and includes public guarantees, defined as outstanding amount of loans guaranteed by the central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Annex IV. 2016 External Sustainability Assessment External
Sustainability Concerns and Mounting Vulnerabilities
Sri Lanka’s external position is weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. The balance of
payments is under pressure because of anemic capital inflows and foreign investors’ exit from the government
securities market. Reserve coverage has deteriorated sharply owing to heavy intervention in the foreign
exchange market, and at the beginning of 2016, gross reserves were short of foreign exchange claims coming
due in the year. Quantitative estimations of the extent of the rupee overvaluation yield mixed results. External
debt remains sustainable. Currency risks are high, but mitigated by long maturities and Sri Lanka’s access to
international financial markets. Strengthening external sustainability will require addressing domestic policy
imbalances, greater exchange rate flexibility, and structural reforms to rebuild buffers, increase investor
confidence and improve competitiveness.
1.
External sustainability is a concern—reserve cover has decreased significantly and is short of
foreign exchange (FX) claims coming due in 2016. Gross international reserves decreased by almost $1
billion in 2015—a drop of 11 percentage points of the ARA metric1 to 76 percent (3.8 months of prospective
imports). Reserves fell further to 65 percent of the metric by March 2016—barely 3 months of import cover.
Moreover, gross reserves are largely borrowed. FX swaps with domestic banks of $2.1 billion, a swap
arrangement with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of $700 million, and SAARC arrangement of $400 million
provide a temporary buffer to the central bank, but could be short lived.2 At the beginning of 2016, gross
reserves were short of gross foreign-currency claims coming due in the year. Net international reserves were
also low, at 43.4 percent of the ARA metric at end-March 2016.

Reserve coverage has been dragged down by pressures on the balance of payments (Figure 1).

against the ARA metric for fixed exchange rate—which is a good comparator, as the rupee has been heavily managed in 2015.

A large part of the FX swaps with domestic banks are coming due in 2016, including $0.9 billion of long term swaps that are usually rolled

is also due to expire in June 2016, but could be rolled over upon approval of a Fund arrangement.

In the absence of decisive policy actions to boost investor’s confidence, reserve coverage is
likely to deteriorate further as the balance of payments remains under pressure, in particular from the
financial account. Pressures on the CA are expected to further recede as oil prices are expected to remain
on average lower than in 2015 and the peak of high vehicle imports growth has passed (Figure 1), owing to
macroprudential measures3 implemented by the authorities. Efforts to lift the ban on fish exports to the EU
and finalize trade arrangements with the United States could help boost exports in the near term, although
weak global demand (Figure 2) and commodity prices could generate headwinds. Further exchange rate
depreciation could also help further rein in the CA deficit,4 whereas growth of remittances is likely to remain
anemic as almost three fourths of inflows are originated from regions under economic stress (55 percent

The CBSL introduced a cap of 70 percent on loan-to-value on vehicle leases and loans on September 15, 2015 and imposed temporarily a

2015). Moreover, additional taxes were imposed on imports of certain motorized vehicles.

from the Middle East and 18 percent from the European Union). On the contrary, the capital and financial
account is expected to remain under pressures in the near term. Investor sentiment has worsened, reflecting
concerns over domestic policies, external vulnerabilities, and volatility in global markets. Foreign holdings of
government securities have dropped further to 6.1 percent of the stock at March 4, 2016 (from 6.9 percent at
end-December 2015). Outflows reached $551 million in the first quarter of 2016, higher than the amount of
securities maturing in 2016 ($248 million), reflecting large sales in the secondary market. There is also a risk
of further outflows—the remainder stock is $1.5 billion. However, the regulatory ceiling imposed on the
share of foreign holdings of T-bills and T-bonds to total stock during periods of inflows (10 percent in 2015)
has been helpful in containing the magnitude of spillovers. FDI inflows and project loans are expected to
resume only gradually, and the repayment of external liabilities will put a dent on reserves.

from January 1, 2015 to February 15, 2016, though it showed signs of stabilization in February, when the spot
rate was flat (Figure 4 of the staff report). Market pressures resumed in March, concomitant to capital
outflows. The CBSL depleted FX reserves further, supplying $437 million to the foreign exchange market,
which helped keep the spot rate mostly unchanged. However, the CBSL’s actions reinforced distortions in the
FX market, pushing a greater amount of foreign exchange trading from the spot market to the forward
market, which rates are more representative of market forces. The 3-month forward market rate stood at 151

External debt remains sustainable with low rollover risk, although currency risk is elevated.
External debt is estimated at 55.1 percent of GDP at end-2015, and predominantly owned by the public
sector (61 percent of total). The ratio of debt to exports is high, at 265 percent. Currency risk, mostly related
to the dollar (half of external debt is denominated in dollar), is elevated. Stress tests show that a 30 percent
real depreciation would raise the debt to GDP ratio to over 80 percent (see the external debt sustainability
analysis). Lower than expected GDP or export growth would also deteriorate debt dynamics. These risks are
mitigated by low rollover risks with 83 percent of medium and long term debt, though tighter global
financing liquidity and declining investor confidence could raise rollover vulnerabilities and costs. The
negative net international investment position reflects high investment needs, but has been skewed toward
debt as foreign investment shifted away from equity investments (Figure 1).
8.
External sustainability risks are mitigated by access to international capital markets and
support of bilateral and multilateral institutions. Sri Lanka has tapped three times international capital
markets in 2015, despite the backdrop of domestic policy imbalances and tighter global financial conditions.
Several bilateral and multilateral institutions (World Bank, ADB and JICA) renewed their commitment to assist
Sri Lanka finance its investment needs—providing a cushion against risks of private capital flight. However,
the authorities should be mindful of higher servicing costs from recent spread hikes and risks of losing
access to international financial markets if the country’s rating is further downgraded7 and the drag on
investors’ confidence persists.
9.
Reining in balance of payments pressures and strengthening external sustainability will
require rebalancing of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Improving investor sentiment to
contain capital outflows and attract more foreign investment is reliant on government commitment to
prudent macro policies. Commitment to exchange rate flexibility, within a strengthened monetary policy
framework is needed to deal with short-term volatility (Box 4). Structural reforms to boost competitiveness
and exports, which have declined as a share of world trade would also support external sustainability.
Current initiatives include ending the EU fishery import ban, regaining GSP plus status, bilateral trade
agreements, and a review of current weaknesses in the World Bank’s Doing Business index. However, against
the backdrop of weak global demand and declining non-oil commodity prices, gains of exports shares would
require deep structural reforms to improve competitiveness, as well as restoring eroding export profitability.

In end February, Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka’s rating from BB- to B+ and revised its outlook to negative. Sri Lanka’s spread vis-a-vis the EMBI

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Colombo, May 12, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Sri Lanka is experiencing serious economic challenges against the backdrop of an
increasingly volatile global economic environment. To tackle these challenges, we are
proposing a strong and ambitious reform program, aimed at reducing macroeconomic
vulnerabilities, strengthening public finance and financial management, and promoting
sustained high levels of inclusive economic growth.
While Sri Lanka’s economic fundamentals have remained strong, domestic imbalances and a
deteriorating external environment pose risks. Our revenue base has deteriorated over the
past two decades, creating an over-reliance on debt financing. Downside risks to the balance
of payments have materialized in 2015 and 2016 as the end of unconventional monetary
policy in the United States, regional rebalancing, and heightened global market volatility
have created significantly tighter financing conditions. We have also seen our position in
world trade deteriorate reflecting some decline in competitiveness. We are of the view that a
decisive change in the direction of macroeconomic policies is needed to ensure continued
growth and prosperity.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) presents the plans
and policies of the authorities of Sri Lanka for 2016−2019. In support of the policies in the
attached MEFP, the Government requests that the Executive Board of the IMF approve a 3year Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with access equivalent
to SDR 1,070.78 million (185 percent of quota). Table 1 and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding attached to the MEFP set out quantitative targets that are to be observed under
the Extended Arrangement. Table 2 attached to the MEFP sets out proposed prior actions for
approval of the Extended Arrangement and structural benchmarks under the Extended
Arrangement.
We believe the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives
of the program, but we will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this
purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the implementation of the policies
contained in the MEFP, and in advance of revisions to these policies, in accordance with the
Fund’s policies on such consultation.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
May 12, 2016
Sri Lanka has recorded significant economic achievements. Growth has been strong since the
beginning of the new century, inflation has recently been brought down to the low single digits,
and substantial progress has been made with respect to reducing poverty and improving social
indicators.
In some important ways, Sri Lanka needs a new phase of economic transformation to keep pace
with the major changes in global and regional growth. Further, macroeconomic management in
the past few years was at times uneven. While growth has been high, it has not yet reached full
potential. Our foreign exchange and fiscal buffers are lower than desirable given an increasingly
uncertain global environment. Public debt is a continued burden on both government finances and
development, and more needs to be done to ensure that both the gains from economic growth and
the cost of public services are distributed more equally.
In this context of the need for a new phase of economic management, heightened vulnerability, and
a significantly more challenging external environment, we aim to make progress in the economic
transformation under a 3-year program supported by an IMF Extended Arrangement under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Our main objectives are to achieve high and sustained levels of
economic growth, create a more inclusive economic environment where the gains are spread more
equally across the population, restore discipline to macroeconomic and financial policies, and
rebuild fiscal and external buffers to better weather adverse shocks. The government supports a
decisive strengthening of the nation’s outward orientation, based on a more open trade regime and
a welcoming environment for investment. We expect economic growth to come close to 5½ percent
over the medium term, inflation to remain contained to low single digits, and international reserves
to reach over 4 months of imports by the end of the program.
We have an extensive structural reform agenda in support of these goals. Fiscal reforms are critical
and include: (i) improvements in revenue administration and tax policy to raise domestic revenues
to levels commensurate with dynamic emerging markets in the region and reduce reliance on
borrowing; (ii) public financial management reforms to strengthen budget planning and execution,
as well as eliminate arrears; (iii) comprehensive measures to restructure and put on a more
rigorous commercial footing our state enterprises—thereby reducing both fiscal risk and economic
distortions. We plan to review and reform out external tariff structure to reduce effective rates of
protection while we simultaneously pursue new trade agreements and find other ways to support
productivity growth and bolster competitiveness. In the monetary policy area, we plan steps to shift
toward flexible inflation targeting and measures to help deepen foreign exchange markets and a
more flexible exchange rate regime. Strengthening financial sector supervision and increasing the
role of private credit and financial intermediation in the economy will remain an important
objective.

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
The economic outlook is stable and underlying momentum and positive prospects
for new investments should balance the impact of tighter fiscal and monetary policies.
Over the short run, real GDP growth is likely to improve to 5 percent in 2016, with sound
macroeconomic policy and restoration of market confidence, supported by recovery in
investment. There is a clear need to re-start fiscal consolidation in 2016 as part of the
government’s objective of macroeconomic stabilization and restoration of investor confidence.
Given expansive credit growth and rising core inflation in the second half of 2015, there has
already been some tightening of the monetary policy stance. While inflation has moderated to
2.7 percent in February 2016, we stand ready to tighten monetary policy further should
inflationary pressure emerge. A renewed commitment to exchange rate flexibility, low oil prices,
and the impact of measures to curb the rapid increase in credit and imports seen in 2015 should
lead to further improvement in the external sector. The current account deficit is projected to fall
from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.5 percent in 2016 allowing for accumulation of international
reserves by the central bank.
2.
Notwithstanding short-term challenges, we see ample room for more vibrant
economic growth going forward. Sri Lanka’s economic pillars are strong. Economic activity
should increase over the medium-term and be sustained near the estimate rate of potential
(non-inflationary) growth. This positive outlook is supported by the strength of Sri Lanka’s
economic foundation and the resilience shown during previous periods of economic and
financial stress. Sri Lanka has a strong base of human capital and reliable infrastructure—
especially compared with other South Asian economies. It also occupies a strategic position in a
fast growing and dynamic region, and infrastructure investments over the last decade
(particularly on port and other transport-related facilities) have taken advantage of this
opportunity. Services growth has been strong, particularly in such relatively new areas as tourism,
IT, and accounting—all of which hold potential for further expansion. However, we recognize that
stronger macroeconomic management, a decisive strengthening of Sri Lanka’s outward
orientation, a stronger role for the private sector and market forces in the economy, and further
investment in physical infrastructure and human capital are needed to achieve high, inclusive,
and sustained growth.
FISCAL POLICY
3.
A durable reduction of the fiscal deficit and public debt through a growth-friendly
emphasis on revenue generation is the main priority for fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation
achieved over the last decade was heavily skewed toward cutting expenditure in the face of a
secular decline in revenue. Sri Lanka’s tax-to-GDP ratio is now one of the lowest in the world, is
unsuitable from a developmental level (as we approach middle income status), creates an
unsustainable reliance on debt financing, and limits our ability to lower the overall level of public
debt and debt vulnerability. The lack of fiscal space also hampers our ability to mitigate the
impact of adverse shocks, which is a key consideration in an increasingly volatile economic
environment.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

SRI LANKA

4.
In line with these considerations, the government will move quickly to implement
greater financial discipline. The government aims to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to no more
than 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016, compared with a deficit of 6.9 percent in 2014. This reduction in
the deficit is to be accomplished through steps to durably bolster tax revenues—rather than oneoff measures—and close attention to recurrent, discretionary, and capital spending. It is vital that
fiscal consolidation continue over the medium-term, as we see a steady decline in budget deficits
and public debt as a linchpin to reducing Sri Lanka’s vulnerability, making room for private
investment, and restoring confidence in macroeconomic policies. We are committed to a steady
path of lower fiscal deficits—bringing the primary balance to surplus within three years to ensure
a steady reduction in the ratio of public debt to GDP and, as indicated in the Prime Minister’s
November 2015 speech to parliament, we aim to bring the overall central government deficit
down to at least 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020. This will bring a corresponding reduction in the
level of government debt. Specifically, we will target a primary balance to be achieved in 2017
and a primary surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2018. These targets will be anchored by an
increase in the tax to GDP ratio by about 1.2 percent of GDP annually in 2017−18. Annual budget
proposals to be submitted to Parliaments for 2017−19 will be in line with the program targets
(structural benchmark). Fiscal consolidation beyond 2019 will be ensured through revision of the
Financial Responsibility Act to include binding targets for the government deficit and level of
overall public debt.
5.
Fiscal consolidation will be achieved mainly through measures to broaden the tax
base and improve the efficiency of collection rather than slashing expenditure. Sri Lanka’s
fiscal deficits stem not from exceptionally high expenditures, but rather, from a steady erosion of
the tax base over the last two decades. Sri Lanka’s tax-to-GDP ratio is among the lowest in the
world, and the nation’s tax efficiency ratio is also now below that of comparator countries—
particularly for the VAT. This was not always the case. In the not too distant past, Sri Lanka’s taxto-GDP was at or above levels in comparator countries, and the VAT—which is used successfully
by some 140 countries worldwide—was a major source of government revenue. Rebuilding the
tax base is thus not an impossible task, but will require a fundamental re-set of tax policies and a
concerted effort to bolster tax administration. Our strategy in this regard will focus on (i)
broadening the tax base; (ii) rationalizing the tax system and removing the many exemptions,
holidays, and special rates that have undermined fair and effective tax administration; (iii)
strengthening capacity for risk-based revenue administration to improve tax compliance; and (iv)
bolstering public financial management, in particular on commitment control, and financial
planning and discipline.
6.
The fiscal framework for 2016 includes a number of measures to improve revenue
performance. To broaden the tax base, the VAT will continue to apply to wholesale and retail
trade (at a lower threshold), and has also been extended to telecommunication and private
health. The VAT rate will remain unified to make administration simple, and increased to 15
percent, while initial plans to raise the NBT rate to 4 percent have been scaled back given the
cascading nature of this turnover tax. Thresholds for personal income tax will be maintained at
levels that capture a sufficient portion of the tax base.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

7.
Further measures to broaden the tax base are envisaged for the medium-term. Past
administrations have offered various forms of tax incentives to encourage export-oriented
industrialization, and to provide benefits to selected groups. The proliferation of exemptions, tax
holidays, and special tax rates has not only been ineffective in boosting investment, they have
also resulted in a tax system that is largely inefficient, non-transparent, and unfair. It is now the
case that a relatively narrow share of the population provides the bulk of tax revenues. As an
initial step towards rationalizing tax incentives, the Cabinet suspended the Board of Investment
Act, precluding that body from the capacity to grant tax exemptions and other forms of
preferential treatment (these powers will henceforth be concentrated in the Ministry of Finance,
which has ultimate oversight of tax policy). Further, within the current year, we will redraft the
Inland Revenue Act, with a view to creating new income tax legislation that is both in line with
international best practices, but also clear, transparent, and aimed at widening the tax net such
that over time, tax rates may be reduced. We will submit the draft act to Parliament by March
2017 (structural benchmark). We will also conduct a diagnostic review of the VAT by June 2017
(structural benchmark), and implement amendments to simplify and strengthen this essential
pillar of our tax framework. To monitor our progress in reducing distortions, annual budgets will
henceforth include a catalogue of tax expenditures (tax exemptions, holidays, and other
incentives), along with an estimate of their cost such that their merits can be debated openly
(structural benchmark by December 2016). By December 2016, the Cabinet will adopt a timebound strategy to reduce or eliminate these tax expenditures, as agreed with IMF staff (structural
benchmark).
8.
Improvements to tax administration will complement tax policy reforms. Changes
to tax policy will be ineffective in raising revenue unless accompanied by a concerted effort to
strengthen capacity on revenue administration. We see it as vital to build a tax authority that is
not only efficient and effective, but that enjoys public trust. Laudable efforts have been underway
at the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) for some time—including essential steps toward
automation and the use of information technologies that are already standard in many middle
income economies. To bolster these efforts and raise our tax administration to the highest
standard, our structural reform agenda will consist of: (i) adoption by IRD of Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) on the number of risk-based VAT audit by September 2016 (structural
benchmark); (ii) adoption by IRD of a VAT compliance strategy that includes a time-bound plan
to implement risk-based audits by September 2016 (structural benchmark); (iii) adoption by IRD
of compliance strategies for corporate and personal income taxes by June 2017 (structural
benchmark); and (iv) fully rolling out new IT systems (RAMIS and ASYCUDA) for domestic tax and
customs administration (full roll out of RAMIS by December 2016, including web-based tax
filings, is a structural benchmark). Organizational and business procedure reform for the Inland
Revenue Department will also be pursued, including restructuring IRD along functional lines,
creating a design and monitoring unit, making management structure more efficient to speed up
interaction with taxpayers, strengthening the Large Taxpayer Unit, introducing mandatory efiling, and enhancing the use of taxpayer identification numbers.

9.
A disciplined approach to government spending and prioritization of public
investment (both in physical and human capital) will be a second pillar of fiscal
consolidation. We intend to keep the overall spending envelope under control, while
reallocating spending within this envelope to areas that will bolster our medium-term prospects
for high and inclusive rates of economic growth. We intend to review spending patterns and
identify areas of savings in government purchase of goods and services, and government
subsidies and transfers, with a view to making more resources available for critical spending on
public infrastructure, health, education, and social assistance. With the assistance of the World
Bank, we will also upgrade our procurement processes, produce a national policy statement for
public investment management, and strengthen our capacity in the area of debt management.
PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
10.
Further improvements in fiscal management and transparency are also planned to
address past irregularities and prevent future occurrences. With technical assistance from the
IMF we have identified outstanding obligations of the central government and SOEs totaling Rs
1.36 trillion. This includes (i) outstanding obligations of the central government, totaling Rs 58
billion, which are to be settled during 2016; and (ii) those of 4 SOEs (CPC, CEB, Sri Lankan Airlines,
and the Sri Lanka Port Authority), totaling Rs 1.2 trillion. These SOEs currently have no arrears in
their financial obligations. The government will devise plans for each SOE to resolve and repay
the obligations through a resolution strategy for Sri Lankan Airlines, establishment of Statement
of Corporate Intent, and reform of utility subsidies (see paragraph 12).
11.
For both credibility and to fully meet our financial commitments, we see careful
monitoring of government spending commitments as a pillar of good management. By July
2016, the government will implement a commitment control system based on a commitment
record system (with quarterly reports produced no later than one month after the end of each
quarter) and quarterly expenditure commitment ceilings for the 2016 budget and the 2017
budget (structural benchmark). The rollout of the new Integrated Treasury Management
Information System (ITMIS) should significantly expand PFM capabilities, including commitment
control, budget preparation, treasury, accounting, and procurement, among others. As an initial
stage, the introduction of the ITMIS, including the commitment control module to implement a
formal commitment record system and quarterly expenditure ceilings, will be completed for the
Ministry of Finance by December 2016 and for the Ministry of Health by April 2017 (structural
benchmarks). This will be followed by full roll-out to all ministries, agencies, and spending subunits by end-2017. To boost transparency, the MOF will begin publishing quarterly financial
bulletins summarizing government fiscal operations; ensure that annual budgets explicitly cost
out tax expenditures and adhere to Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) standards.
Budgets will also include an analysis of fiscal risks, including those related to SOEs and publicprivate partnerships (PPPs).

STATE ENTERPRISES
12.
The financial condition of some of our state enterprises and ultimate responsibility
for their existing obligations is a challenge we seek to address and resolve as part of the
program. Sri Lanka currently has more than 200 public enterprises representing a substantial
share of the nation’s economic activity. Although some SOEs are profitable and performing well,
collectively they represent a risk to public finances (either directly or through the state banks,
which fund the largest SOEs). The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon Electricity
Board (CEB) have incurred financial losses in fulfilling non-commercial obligations because of
implicit energy subsidies—retail fuel and electricity prices have been set below cost-recovery
levels. Sri Lankan Airlines has been poorly managed, and continues to incur significant losses on
a monthly basis. The government recognizes the need to decisively address the issue of SOE
performance and minimize fiscal risk. A comprehensive strategy for SOE reform and a more
rules-based approach to financial management is being developed. In the near-term, however,
our strategy encompasses the following elements:


A resolution strategy for Sri Lankan Airlines will be completed and approved by Cabinet
by September 2016, effectively removing this company from the government’s accounts
(structural benchmark).



To enhance oversight and financial discipline, the six largest SOEs (CPC, CEB, Sri Lankan
Airlines, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Airport and Aviation Services
Limited, and Sri Lanka Ports Authorities) will agree with MOF and the relevant line
ministry and publish a statement of corporate intent (SCI) which encompasses the SOE’s
mission, high level objectives, and multiyear corporate plan; capital expenditure and
financing plans; explicit financial and non-financial targets; and description and cost of
non-commercial obligations (structural benchmark by December 2016). We will also look
at strengthening the legal framework for the governance and oversight of SOEs,
including through establishment of coherent financial regulations for SOEs on
governance, accountability, and funds management.



Reform of energy and other utility subsidies. This would entail implementation of a
formula-based automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum products, so as to reduce the
possibility of future financial losses by the CPC and avoid large adjustments in retail
prices. We will also enact legislative reforms to ensure that the Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) will have sole authority to set electricity tariffs in a cost-reflective
manner. Automatic fuel and electricity pricing mechanisms that ensure retail prices above
cost-recovery levels and a financial position of CPC and CEB capable of covering debt
service will be introduced by December 2016 (structural benchmark). We will extend this
strategy for water tariff settings when the PUC starts regulating the water sector. To
support these objectives, the government will record the fiscal cost of non-commercial
obligations (such as utility subsidies) for SOEs in the central government budget, starting
from the 2017 budget (structural benchmark by November 2016).

MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
13.
The focus of monetary policy will remain at keeping inflation in the mid-single
digits. For most of 2015, the CBSL maintained an accommodative policy stance given continued
low inflation and anemic credit growth in 2014. However, private credit accelerated in the second
quarter of 2015 and into 2016, and together with steadily increasing core inflation signaled a
turning point in the policy cycle. The CBSL increased the statutory reserve ratio of commercial
banks from 6 percent to 7.5 percent in January 2016, followed by an increase in the standing
deposit facility rate and lending facility rate by 50 basis points to 6.5 and 8 percent, respectively,
in February 2016. Going forward, headline inflation is expected to gradually increase to about 5
percent by end-2016, reflecting the VAT increase in May 2016, the depreciation of rupee, and an
anticipated increase in international food prices. The CBSL aims at maintaining headline inflation
within a range of 3 percent from the projected path. This objective will be monitored through a
monetary policy consultation clause (see the Technical Memorandum of Understanding),
supported by monitoring of reserve money developments. The CBSL stands ready to further
adjust its policy stance to achieve its inflation objective.
14.
The CBSL has been making steady progress toward a more effective monetary
policy framework. We will continue to improve liquidity management so as to avoid extended
periods of excess liquidity in the financial system and to maintain good control of interest rates.
This should enhance the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.
15.
Over the medium-term, we intend to finish putting place conditions for gradually
moving toward a flexible inflation targeting framework. In such a framework, more weight
will be given to inflation as a nominal anchor, while also considering policy’s impact on growth
and the foreign exchange market. As a first step, we plan to formulate and make public a wellarticulated plan spelling out actions already taken and milestones for moving gradually to a
flexible inflation-targeting framework. The plan would lay out in detail the elements of a
successful inflation targeting regime, and how and when these will be developed. We will
address (i) the legal framework, including central bank independence from fiscal and/or political
pressures that would conflict with an inflation objective; (ii) a sound financial system that would
reduce the risk of conflict between monetary and financial system stability objectives; (iii) well
developed technical infrastructure, including improved forecasting and modeling capabilities; (iv)
the choice of targets and how unanticipated shocks would be dealt with; and (v) the policy
decision making process.
16.
We aim to transition over the life of the program to a market-oriented approach to
exchange rate policy. Sri Lanka’s approach to exchange rate flexibility has at times been
uneven—reflecting both the realities of a thin foreign exchange market, as well as a desire to
avoid turbulence in currency markets spilling over into inflation and external debt and debt
service. Historically, however, this has at times of stress resulted in a delayed adjustment and loss
of reserves. It is our attention to move forward with a durable transition to a more flexible
exchange rate regime. In this context, we will take steps toward meeting the essentialpreconditions for a truly flexible exchange rate regime, including (i) a deeper and more liquid
78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

foreign exchange market; (ii) adequate systems to review and manage exchange rate risks; and
(iii) a transparent intervention policy, consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework.
17.
A strengthening of reserve coverage (guided by the level of net reserves as a
percentage of the ARA reserve metric) will be programmed, supported by purchases under
the Extended Arrangement. Further, because the supply and demand for foreign exchange will
be uncertain over the program period, the program includes a clause whereby the authorities
would consult with the Fund staff on the appropriate policy response in the event that the gap
between supply and demand of foreign exchange results in a more sudden and disruptive
depreciation of the exchange rate than anticipated by the staff and authorities.
18.
During the program we will not impose or intensify restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions; introduce or modify
multiple currency practices; conclude bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent
with Article VIII; or impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments
reasons. The CBSL and the Government will also abstain from providing exchange guarantees for
foreign currency borrowing.
POLICIES TO STRENGTHEN TRADE AND INVESTMENT
19.
Achieving medium-term macroeconomic objectives will require a renewed effort
toward greater integration into regional and global supply chains, higher levels of FDI, and
enhancing prospects for private sector investment. In addition to better infrastructure, this will
entail improvements in the trade regime and investment climate. Immediate steps toward this
end have been the establishment of a Development Agency (which will seek to prioritize
infrastructure development), as well as a Trade Agency (responsible for trade promotion and
negotiation of trade and investment agreements). The EU ban on fishery imports will be removed
in the next few months, which will also help facilitate resumption of GSP plus trade status.
20.
To boost trade and private sector development, we will seek to reduce costs and
bolster competitiveness. A key element in this work would be a review of Sri Lanka’s trade
regime including an evaluation of para-tariffs and other nontariff barriers that have led to a high
level of effective protection and hampered exports. In addition, we are negotiating a
Development Policy Credit with the World Bank to enhance competitiveness. It aims to increase
the efficiency of trade facilitation, remove barriers to foreign investment entry and establishment
(including access to land), enhance access to finance, and strengthen financial market
infrastructure. These steps should help to attract FDI and complement public investment.
RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES
21.
In light of the high degree of uncertainty with respect to the global economic
environment, there are elevated economic and financial risks to the program. The main risks
include (i) a slowdown in the economic recovery of key external trade partners and continued
volatility in global financial markets; (ii) weaker than projected revenues; (iii) weaker than

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

SRI LANKA

expected capital inflows, which would widen the projected financing gap given already
substantial gross fiscal financing needs of close to 19 percent of GDP in 2016 ; (iv) lower than
expected growth and/or new pressures on the trade account; and (v) weaker than expected
performance at state owned enterprises. These risks could further challenge public debt
sustainability. Should such risks materialize, the government stands ready to adjust promptly its
policies, in close consultation with IMF staff, to ensure the achievement of a sustainable external
position at the end of the program.
PROGRAM MONITORING
22.
Our program will be subject to semiannual reviews with performance criteria and
indicative targets set out in Table 1 attached to this MEFP and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU). Completion of the first and second reviews will require observance of the
quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2016 and end-December 2016, respectively, as
well as continuous performance criteria, as specified in Table 1 attached to this MEFP. The
reviews will also assess progress toward observance of the structural benchmarks specified in
Table 2 attached to this MEFP. The first two reviews of the program will take place on or after
November 20, 2016 and April 20, 2017, respectively.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out a framework for
monitoring the performance of Sri Lanka under the program supported by the Extended
Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). It specifies the performance criteria and
indicative targets (including adjustors) under which Sri Lanka’s performance will be assessed
through semiannual reviews. Monitoring procedures and reporting requirements are also
specified. The first review will take place on or after November 20, 2016, and the second review
on or after April 20, 2017.
2.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets specified in Table 1 attached
to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are listed as follows.


a quantitative performance criterion on central government primary balance (floor);



a quantitative performance criterion on net official international reserves (floor);



a continuous quantitative performance criterion on new external payment arrears by the
nonfinancial public sector and the CBSL (ceiling);



a monetary policy consultation clause;



an indicative target on central government tax revenue (floor); and



an indicative target on reserve money of the CBSL (ceiling).

3.
Throughout this TMU, the central government is defined to include line ministries,
departments, and other public institutions. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), state-owned
enterprise, parastatals and other agencies that do not receive subventions from the central
government are excluded from the definition of central government. Debt is defined in
accordance with paragraph 8 of the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in Fund
Arrangements attached to Executive Board Decision No. 15688-(14/107), adopted December 5,
2014.

I. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Performance Criterion on Central Government Primary Balance
4.
The primary balance of the central government on cash basis is defined as central
government revenues and grants minus expenditures and net lending, plus interest payments.
Spending will be recorded in the period during which cash disbursements are made.
5.
For the purpose of program monitoring, the primary balance of the central government
on cash basis will be measured as the overall balance of the central government plus the interest

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

payment of the central government. The overall balance of the central government is measured
from the financing side, as the negative of the sum of the items listed below. Here, net
borrowings refer to gross disbursements minus principal repayments. For 2015, the primary
balance of the central government on cash basis measured in this manner was Rs –241 billion
(the overall balance was Rs –768 billion and the interest payment was Rs 527 billion).


Net borrowings from issuances of Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, and Rupee Loans.1 In
2015, the total amount of such net borrowings was Rs 257.6 billion.



Net borrowings from Sri Lankan Development Bonds (SLDBs) and commercial borrowings
including international sovereign bonds and syndicated loans. In 2015, the total amount
was Rs 455.7 billion.



Net borrowings from project and program loans. In 2015, the total amount was Rs 69.7
billion, after adjustment for program loans that were contracted and disbursed during
2014 but were recorded in the 2015 fiscal account (Rs 61.6 billion).



Net increases in non-market borrowings, CBSL advances, government import bills,
government overdraft from the banking system, cash items in process of collection, and
borrowings from offshore banking units of domestic commercial banks. In 2015, the total
amount was Rs –10.1 billion.



Net decreases in the deposit of the central government in the banking system. In 2015,
the total amount was Rs –4.4 billion (an increase in deposit).



Net borrowings from all other bonds, loans, and advances contracted by the central
government. In 2015, the total amount was Rs –0.5 billion (net repayment).

The following adjustment will apply:
6.
If the actual amount of gross cash disbursement of project loans in 2016 is higher than
US$1.5 billion in U.S. dollar terms, the floor on the primary balance of the central government for
end-December 2016 will be adjusted downward by the difference between the actual amount
and US$1.5 billion. The difference will be converted to the amount in Rupee terms by using the
exchange rates as indicated in Table 1 below. The downward adjustment of the primary balance
target will be capped at Rs 20 billion. If the actual amount of gross cash disbursement of project
loans in 2016 is lower than US$1.5 billion in U.S. dollar terms, the floor on the primary balance of
the central government for end-December 2016 will not be adjusted.

Rupee Loans are a medium to long-term debt instrument issued with maturities more than two years on tap
basis or as private placements by the CBSL on behalf of the government under the Registered Stock and
Securities Ordinance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

SRI LANKA

B. Performance Criterion on Net Official International Reserves
7.
Net official international reserves (NIR) is defined as (i) the difference between the gross
foreign assets and liabilities of the CBSL and (ii) the balance of State Treasury’s (DSTs) Special
Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan Revolving accounts, both expressed in terms of market
values. Gross foreign assets of the CBSL consists of monetary gold; foreign exchange balances
held outside Sri Lanka; foreign securities (valued in market prices); foreign bills purchased and
discounted; the reserve position at the IMF and SDR holdings; and the Crown Agent’s credit
balance. Foreign exchange balances, securities, and bills denominated in Chinese Yuan are part
of the gross foreign assets of the CBSL. Excluded from gross foreign assets will be participation in
international financial institutions; holdings of nonconvertible currencies; holdings of precious
metals other than monetary gold; claims on residents (e.g., statutory reserves on foreign currency
deposits of commercial banks and central bank foreign currency deposits with resident
commercial banks); pledged, non-liquid, collateralized or otherwise encumbered foreign assets
(such as the government’s war risk insurance deposit with Lloyds during 2001/02); and claims in
foreign exchange arising from derivative transactions (such as futures, forwards, swaps and
options). Gross foreign liabilities are all foreign currency denominated liabilities of the CBSL to
non-residents; the use of Fund credit; Asian Clearing Union debit balance and commitments to
sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options. In
addition, NIR will include the balance of the DSTs’ Special Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Chinese
Yuan Revolving accounts. DST accounts are foreign currency accounts held by the Treasury and
managed by the CBSL as an agent of the government. At end-December 2015, NIR defined in
this manner stood at US$ 5,028.8 million.
8.
For the purpose of the program, all foreign-currency related assets and liabilities will be
converted into U.S. dollar terms at the exchange rates prevailed on April 29, 2016, as specified in
Table 1. Monetary gold will be valued at US$1,274.1 per troy ounce, which was the price
prevailed on April 29, 2016.

II. CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Performance Criterion on New External Payment Arrears by the
Nonfinancial Public Sector and the CBSL
11.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the non accumulation of new external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the nonfinancial public sector
and the CBSL. The nonfinancial public sector is defined following the 2001 Government Financial
Statistics Manual and the 1993 System of National Accounts. It includes (but is not limited to) the
central government as defined in ¶3 and nonfinancial public enterprises, i.e., boards, enterprises,
and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake. External payments arrears
consist of debt-service obligations (principal and interest) to nonresidents that have not been
paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements, subject to any
applicable grace period. However, overdue debt and debt service obligations that are in dispute
will not be considered as external payments arrears for the purposes of program monitoring.

III. MONETARY POLICY CONSULTATION CLAUSE
12.
The inflation target bands around the projected 12-month rate of inflation in consumer
prices, as measured by the headline Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI) published by the
Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka, are specified in Table 1 attached to the MEFP.
For this purpose, the year-on-year inflation for each test date is measured as follows:
{ CCPI*(t) – CCPI*(t-12) } / CCPI*(t-12)
where
t = the month within which the test date is included
CCPI(t) = CCPI index (all items) for month t
CCPI(t-k) = CCPI index (all items) as of k months before t
CCPI*(t) = { CCPI(t-2) + CCPI(t-1) + CCPI(t) } / 3
CCPI*(t-12) = { CCPI(t-14) + CCPI(t-13) + CCPI(t-12) } / 3
If the observed year-on-year inflation for the test date of end-June 2016 or end-December 2016
falls outside the outer bands specified in Table 1 attached to the MEFP, the authorities will
complete a consultation with the IMF Executive Board which would focus on: (i) the stance of
monetary policy and whether the Fund-supported program remains on track; (ii) the reasons for
the deviation; and (iii) on proposed policy response. When the consultation with the IMF
Executive Board is triggered, access to Fund resources would be interrupted until the
consultation takes place and the relevant program review is completed. In addition, if the
observed year-on-year inflation falls outside the inner bands specified in Table 1 attached to the
MEFP for the test date of end-June 2016, end-September 2016, or end-December 2016, the
authorities will complete a consultation with IMF staff on the reasons for the deviation and the
proposed policy response.

IV. INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Indicative Target on Central Government Tax Revenue
13.
Central government tax revenue refers to revenues from taxes collected by the central
government. It excludes all revenues from asset sales, grants, and non tax revenues. The revenue
target is calculated as the cumulative flow from the beginning of the year. For 2015, central
government tax revenue defined in this manner was Rs. 1,356 billion.

B. Indicative Target on Reserve Money of the CBSL
14.
Reserve money of the CBSL consists of currency in circulation (with banks and with the
rest of the public), financial institutions’ domestic currency deposits at the CBSL, and the deposits
of following government agencies: the National Defence Fund (General Ledger Acc. No. 4278),
the Buddha Sasana Fund A/C (General Ledger Acc. No. 4279); and the Road Maintenance Trust
Fund (General Ledger Acc. No. 4281). At end-December 2015, reserve money defined in this
manner stood at Rs. 673.4 billion.
The following adjustment will apply:
15.
If any bank fails to meet its legal reserve requirement, the ceiling on reserve money will
be adjusted downward to the extent of any shortfall in compliance with the requirement.
16.
Changes in required reserve regulations will modify the reserve money ceiling according
to the formula:

M  rB0  r0 B  rB
where M denotes the change in reserve money, r0 denotes the reserve requirement ratio prior
to any change; B0 denotes the reservable base in the period prior to any change; r is the
change in the reserve requirement ratio; and B denotes the immediate change in the
reservable base as a result of changes to its definition.

V. DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
17.
Sri Lanka shall provide the Fund, through reports at intervals or dates requested by the
Fund, with such information as the Fund requests in connection with the progress of Sri Lanka in
achieving the objectives and policies set forth in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies. All the program monitoring data will be provided by the Ministry of Finance and the
CBSL. For the purpose of monitoring the fiscal performance under the program, data will be
provided in the format as shown in Tables 3 and 4. For the purpose of monitoring the monetary
targets under the program, data will be provided in the format shown in Table 5. For the purpose

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

SRI LANKA

of monitoring the external sector performance under the program, data will be provided in the
format shown in Tables 6 and 7.
18.
Data relating to the fiscal targets (Table 3 and Table 4) will be furnished within no more
than five weeks after the end of each month, except for the data on salaries and wages, goods
and services, subsidies and transfers (and its subcomponents) that will be furnished within no
more than seven weeks after the end of each month (the data on total recurrent expenditure and
interest payments will be furnished within no more than five weeks after the end of each month).

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit
volatility in the exchange rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized
arrangement as of December 31, 2014, because the Sri Lanka rupee stabilized within a 2 percent
band against the U.S. dollar during October 2013–October 2014. While the exchange rate has
exhibited a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar beginning in mid-October 2014, further
observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement remains classified as stabilized. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website
and in its annual report. Sri Lanka maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained
solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144 (52/51).
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was subject to
an update safeguards assessment with respect to a Stand-by Arrangement approved in July 2009.
The assessment found that the CBSL continued to have a relatively strong safeguards framework,
especially in the external audit, financial reporting and control areas. An update safeguard
assessment would be conducted and completed no later than the first program review of the
proposed 3-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility.
Article IV Consultation
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month cycle.



FAD. A number of TA missions in tax policy and administration took place during the 2000s. A
series of TA missions in revenue administration were conducted in 2003. Tax policy missions
took place in 2001 and 2009, to provide advice on the reform of the tax system. In 2012, a
mission visited Sri Lanka to evaluate the state of the Inland Revenue Department, with a
particular focus on the effectiveness of the administration of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and
secondarily the Nation Building Tax to identify measures to staunch and reverse the decline in
VAT collections and improve the overall performance of the VAT system and taxpayers
compliance. In 2015, a mission reviewed income tax expenditures and recent VAT performance.
In addition, a number of missions took place during 2012–2016 to strengthen Public Financial
Management, improving oversight of the State-Owned Enterprises, strengthening budget
preparation, and improving the commitment control system.



ICD. Since August 2015, TA missions provided the CBSL with assistance on macroeconomic
forecasting, including developing a Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) and a semistructural Quarterly Projection Model (QPM).



LEG. In March 2016, TA missions provided assistance on drafting a new income tax legislation.



MCM. In August 2001, a TA mission to develop a strategy for strengthening the framework and
implementation of monetary and foreign exchange cooperation took place. In May 2002, an
IMF/World Bank mission advised the government of Sri Lanka on options for reform of People’s
Bank. In 2003, TA mission on financial sector issues and financial sector reforms took place,
followed by 2005 mission to provide advice on the introduction of new deposit insurance
scheme. Recently, TA missions advised on strengthening the financial stability framework
(January 2016) and improving financial regulations, supervision, and the domestic government
securities market (May 2016),



STA. In November 2012, a mission visited Sri Lanka to report on data dissemination practices
with respect to the requirements of the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS). During
2013–2014, Sri Lanka has received TA provided by the IMF/STA as part of the Asia module of the
JSA Project on the Improvement of statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region. This TA focused on
improving data collection and compilation of ESS including balance of payments, IIP, EDS, and
Reserves Data Template (RDT), and supporting the authorities in their transition to the BPM6
format. In 2013, TA missions also took place to review work on methodological improvements to
the consumer price index and the development of the new producer price index, and to provide
guidance on rebasing of GDP estimates and quarterly national accounts. In 2014, a mission took
place to review the Government Financial Statistics (GFS) compilation system and make
recommendations on the implementation of the GFSM 2001 and its 2014 update (GFSM 2014).
More recently, STA has been closely engaged with the authorities through TA in various areas,
including national accounts, external statistics, GFS, and monetary accounts (see the Statistical
Issues Appendix).

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of April 28, 2016)
1.
In the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13–16, the World Bank Group supported
Sri Lanka to address long-term strategic and structural development challenges as it
transitioned to middle-income country (MIC) status. The CPS FY13-16) focused on: (i) facilitating
sustained private and public investment; (ii) supporting structural shifts in the economy; and (iii)
improving living standards and social inclusion.
2.
A CPS Progress Report prepared in FY 14 provided an opportunity to review the country
program and refocused the activities in line with the government’s evolving development
needs and agenda. The Progress Report proposed the inclusion of a fourth strategic area of
engagement, namely increasing resilience to disasters and climate change, deemed central to Sri
Lanka’s development agenda and poverty reduction efforts. As the country shifted from
reconstruction to addressing the challenges of development on a middle income trajectory greater
emphasis was placed on facilitating and creating the enabling environment for increased foreign and
domestic investment. Continued pockets of poverty also highlighted the need for renewed efforts to
better target the poor.
3.
The Systematic Country Diagnostic prepared in 2015 identified critical constraints and
opportunities that Sri Lanka faced in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD concluded that the
challenges of i) fiscal sustainability; (ii) enhancing competitiveness and promoting more and better
jobs for the bottom 40 percent, iii) providing for social inclusion for disadvantaged segments of the
population; and (iv) longer term sustainability (especially of the environment, political stability, and an
aging population) were priority areas. Governance was identified as a cross-cutting challenge.
4.
The Country Partnership Framework (2017- 2020) for the World Bank Group is anchored
in the analysis of the SCD and consists of three major pillars. Interventions under pillar one will
seek to improve macroeconomic stability and competitiveness, pillar two will tackle the promotion of
inclusion and opportunities, while pillar three will seek to enhance resilience and management of
natural assets. The IFC will give priority to sustainable infrastructure (through PPPs), financial inclusion,
and access to input/output markets, products, services and jobs. MIGA will where possible support
foreign investment projects, across sectors.
5.

The World Bank is supporting the GoSL in a number of macro-critical areas:
 The Bank is preparing a Development Policy Financing (DPF) operation to support the longterm competitiveness of the Sri Lankan economy through a first package of reforms to eliminate
obstacles to private sector competitiveness, enhance transparency and public sector
management and improve fiscal sustainability. The actions supported by the proposed DPF
represent an important initial set of reforms that are expected to be part of a longer-term policy

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SRI LANKA

reform package. In the context of this and possible future operations, the Bank anticipates to
give extensive implementation support to help achieve the intended results. The Bank
anticipates that some of this support will be carried out jointly with the Fund.
a. The Bank is providing support to increase competitiveness and FDI attraction, to develop
a Public Finance Bill and a strategy for its implementation, and to strengthen the public
debt management framework and analytical capacity.
b. The Bank is also providing ongoing support for statistical capacity building to better
measure poverty and to update the national poverty line, and is updating an analysis of
the distributional impact of tax and expenditure.
6.
The World Bank has been supporting Sri Lanka’s development for close to six decades,
having accompanied the country as it has grown to join the ranks of middle-income countries.
The current active World Bank portfolio comprises 12 projects (10 IDA and two IBRD operations) with
a total net commitment value of $1.48 billion. Human development accounts for 33 percent of the
overall portfolio followed by urban development (24 percent), water (21 percent) and resilience to
climate and disaster risk (14 percent). Trust funds have continued to play an important role with the
portfolio currently comprises six recipient-executed trust funds with a total net commitment value of
$54.4 million.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 2, 2016)
Country Partnership Strategy: ADB’s Interim Country Partnership Strategy (ICPS, 2016-2017) for
Sri Lanka, approved in 2015 included the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development
sectors in ADB’s priority sectors for operation in Sri Lanka. The ICPS continued other strategic thrusts
and priority sectors as in the CPS 2012–2016 that identified the three pillars: (i) inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, (ii) catalyzing private investment and enhancing the effectiveness of
public investment, and (iii) human resource and knowledge development. The priority sectors are
transport, energy, water supply and wastewater management, irrigation, and education sectors.
Indicative Resources: The allocation for 2016-2018 consists of $741.78 million from ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and $468.99 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Co-financing and
private sector operation opportunities will be actively explored.
Indicative Pipeline for 2016-18: Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) for the period 2016–18
indicates that the indicative project pipeline addresses the priority agendas of middle-income
countries. It emphasizes on human resource development, completes final stage of basic
infrastructure development such as rural road connectivity and rural electrification and shifts
towards advanced infrastructure such as expressway and railways, and supports inclusive growth
through small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and agriculture assistance. To the extent
possible, thematic priorities such as gender, governance, climate change, and regional cooperation
will be included in each project.
Lending for education will further strengthen support for human capital development. In addition to
continued support for secondary education and support for skills development, opportunity in
higher education will be explored. The Science and Technology Human Resource Development
Program will focus on science and technology faculties, industry linkages and entrepreneurship. The
proposed Skills Sector Enhancement Program (additional financing) will continue support for the
government’s Skills Sector Development Program for 2017–2020.
The Expressway Connectivity Investment Program (MFF) for 2017 will optimize the connectivity of
highways and expressways. This includes providing the access to the expressway network from
Colombo City to limit congestion. The priority highways to be constructed under the project will be
(i) elevated highway from Kelani Bridge to Colombo Port (port access road) and (ii) highway from
Meerigama to Kurunegala (central highway).
The proposed Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project will support achieving 100%
electrification (currently 98%) in Sri Lanka. It will provide electricity to more than 17,500 rural
households, including in the Northern and Eastern provinces. A TA loan for Preparing the Power
Development and Interconnection Project will support connectivity and power trade between Sri
Lanka and India. The Wind Power Generation Project is proposed to develop renewable energy

potential and ensure energy security. The use of a public–private partnership approach will be
explored.
In the urban and water supply sector, most of the interventions are continuations from the earlier
COBPs and consist of additional financing. The Local Government Enhancement Sector Project
(additional financing) will include additional works for areas affected by chronic kidney diseases and
expand coverage of the original scope. The Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Project
(additional financing) will construct a secondary wastewater treatment plant in the north catchment
area of Colombo city. The proposed Jaffna Kilinochchi Water Supply Project (additional financing)
will include a desalination plant (as a source of water) and improvement of the water supply system
in Jaffna Peninsula. For cities in Eastern Province (Trincomalee, Ampara, and Batticaloa), the Cities
Development Initiative of Asia will support development of an integrated strategic master plan.
The SME Credit Line provides funding to SMEs through participating financial institutions. An
auction mechanism was introduced to price the additional operating and credit costs of lending to
targeted sectors, such as uncollateralized working capital loans, new borrowers, women-led
enterprises, and SMEs outside of Colombo. An attached TA will support the enabling environment of
a promising export-oriented cluster.
Capital Market Development Program Loan is currently proposed as an additional loan for 2016. It
will combine policy reforms with information and communication technology investments and
technical assistance to enhance capacity and size of the capital market in Sri Lanka grounded on a
strong legal and regulatory framework.
In the absence of a public-private partnership (PPP) framework, ADB adopts a project-based
approach to promote PPP in Sri Lanka. Performance-based contracts are structured as part of
regular sovereign projects, such as in water and wastewater management and road maintenance.
ADB signed a Transaction Advisory Service mandate in February 2016 for the East Container
Terminal of Colombo Port. The project will add three deep water berths, increasing its
competitiveness. Projected capacity is 2.4 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) once the project
is complete.
ADB’s Private Sector Operations supports finance sector development by providing loans, equity
investments, or guarantees for banks or nonbank institutions to enable them to expand activities in
targeted areas including housing, small and medium-sized enterprise finance, leasing, renewable
energy, and infrastructure lending.

SRI LANKA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of May 1, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in
the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series.
National Accounts: In 2015, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) released a comprehensive
revision of the national accounts. The revision included a change of base year from 2002 to 2010; an
expanded coverage for the service sector; and several improvements in the compilation methods. An
STA mission in September 2015 found that the new annual estimates are robust and better reflect the
recent economic developments. The mission suggested a number of improvements to compilation
methods and data sources to further improve the quality of the estimates. The DCS also updated its
quarterly national accounts methodology and began publishing these estimates in 2015. The new
quarterly estimates are now based on quarterly indicators for most economic activities. GDP data by
expenditure are only available on an annual basis and rely mostly on commodity flow methods.
Price Statistics: The DCS released a new national Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price
Index (PPI) during 2015. The new indexes reflect international standards and best practices. The
national CPI is based on weights from the 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The
monthly PPI is currently disseminated on a quarterly basis, with the goal of releasing the index on a
monthly basis by the end of 2016. A core inflation index is also compiled by the DCS to provide a
measure of underlying inflation. The core index is calculated from the Colombo Consumer Price
Index by excluding prices of some food items, energy and transportation services. The Central Bank
of Sri Lanka (CBSL) produces a Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based on old weights (from 1974) and
methodologies.
Government Finance Statistics: In April 2015, a STA missions took place in the context of the Japanfunded IMF project on implementing GFSM 2001 and its update (GFSM 2014), for compiling,
analyzing and reporting fiscal data. As part of this effort, the authorities have incorporated the Chart
of Accounts aligned with GFSM2014 into the new IFMIS system. Additional steps are underway to
integrate fiscal data of the extra-budgetary central government, the local government and social
security funds into the annual general government GFS reporting. The Sri Lankan authorities report
budgetary central government debt data to the Public Sector Debt Statistics database on a quarterly
basis.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data for the central bank and other depository
corporations (ODCs) are submitted in a highly summarized format with limitations in the classification
of financial instruments and sectorization of the economy.
In January 2015, a STA mission started the introduction of the standardized report forms (SRFs) of the
central bank and other depository corporations. It is expected that a follow-up mission tentatively
scheduled for July 2016 will complete the introduction of the SRFs.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities report 11 core and nine encouraged financial
soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers and two FSIs on real estate markets to STA.

SRI LANKA

External sector statistics: Since 2014, the CBSL is reporting to STA its International Investment
Position (IIP) and balance of payments statistics (BOP) on a quarterly basis following the sixth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). A TA mission in May 2015 observed commendable
progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the previous TA missions and a
remarkable improvement of the quality of the data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Sri Lanka, graduated to the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) in November
2015.

A data ROSC mission visited Sri Lanka in 2001 and
prepared a comprehensive report on the quality of
its statistics.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The authorities report key data to the Fund on a timely basis. On government finance, annual cash
data were regularly reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook. These data cover only the
budgetary accounts of central government; and no data on the extrabudgetary funds or the
provincial and local governments are reported. At the same time, no sub-annual data are reported
for publication in IFS. The authorities have been encouraged to reduce the time lag for data
reporting.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Sri Lanka
Executive Board Meeting
June 3, 2016
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report on May
20. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Natural disaster: Heavy rains since mid-May triggered flooding and landslides in a number of
regions, including the Colombo district. As of May 29, 294,000 people were estimated to have
been affected (about 1.4 percent of population), with Colombo accounting for two thirds of this
total. 105 deaths have been confirmed, 116 people remain missing, and about 4,500 houses have
been damaged. With weather improving and water levels falling, the government has intensified
rescue and rehabilitation efforts, supported by the international community. The economic
damage of the flooding has yet to be fully estimated.
Data update. Headline inflation rose to 4.8 percent in May from 3.1 percent in April, largely due
to increases in health and communication prices, in addition to the impact of the increase in the
VAT rate from 11 to 15 percent. Core inflation rose to 6.6 percent and there is some upside risk
given recent flooding. Preliminary fiscal data suggest that the central government recorded an
overall deficit of Rs 233 billion (1.9 percent of annual GDP) and a primary deficit of Rs 37
billion (0.3 percent of annual GDP) during January–April.
Monetary policy and foreign exchange management. At its meeting held on 20 May 2016, the
Monetary Board of the CBSL decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance by keeping
policy rates unchanged. With respect to foreign exchange developments, the CBSL achieved net
foreign exchange purchases of US$78 million in the first 30 days of May—breaking the 20month pattern of net foreign exchange sales. Despite this shift, the rupee remained broadly stable,
with the spot and the 3-month forward rates depreciating only 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent,
respectively, since end-April.

Statement by Mr. Subir Vithal Gokarn, Executive Director and Mrs. Swarna
Gunaratne, Alternate Executive Director on Sri Lanka
Executive Board Meeting
June 3, 2016
1.
We wish to express our authorities’ deep appreciation to the Fund staff for the
candid discussions held in Colombo during 1-5 February, 2016 and 31 March - 11 April,
2016 and during the Spring Meetings in Washington D.C, on the proposed three-year
Extended Arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Also, we wish to express
our gratitude for the conscientious set of papers that have been produced in connection
with 2016 Article IV Consultation and Request for a Three-Year Extended Arrangement
under the EFF amounting to USD 1.5 billion (equivalent to185 per cent of Sri Lanka’s
quota). The economic program supported by EFF is expected to correct underlying
imbalances in the fiscal and external sectors, by improving fiscal sustainability and
rebuilding foreign exchange reserves while facilitating sustained and inclusive economic
growth in Sri Lanka.
2.
The conclusion of internal conflict in Sri Lanka in 2009 created a conducive
environment for attracting investment and enhancing economic activity including in the
conflict affected Northern and Eastern provinces. The rebuilding efforts of the country
after the internal conflict were supported by the Stand by Arrangement (SBA) program
which was successfully completed in 2012. Accordingly, the economy performed well
from 2010-2015, achieving average real GDP growth of 6.4 per cent during the period.
Inflation was maintained at single digit level throughout the period. Foreign reserves
improved and fiscal deficit declined. However, macro-economic performance in 2015 was
affected by the difficult external environment posed by the decline in commodity prices,
slowdown in demand for exports and capital outflows, and deterioration in fiscal accounts
due to low government revenue and increased debt level, as well as election related
uncertainties. The new government is strongly committed to the strengthening of macroeconomic and financial stability while reducing vulnerabilities, thereby supporting
sustainable high economic growth through the implementation of appropriate
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Our authorities expect that the extended
arrangement under the EFF, together with the support from other International Financial
Institutions (IFIs), would help to reinforce investor confidence and correct underlying
imbalances through buildup of fiscal and external buffers to better weather adverse
shocks.
Economic Growth and Outlook
3.
Sri Lanka’s economy grew by 4.8 per cent in 2015, compared to 4.9 per cent in
2014, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and favorable weather
conditions. The low and stable inflation and low interest rates facilitated economic activity
while credit growth remained high, though it was from a low base. On the fiscal front,

increase in public sector salaries and pensions and downward revision of administratively
determined prices contributed to the inducing of domestic demand. All the main sectors agriculture, industry and services- contributed positively to the growth of the economy.
However, the contribution from the industry sector moderated due to slow down in large
scale infrastructure construction projects, as a result of the change in new government’s
policy stance to re-evaluate several large projects with the intention of improving
transparency and effective implementation of the projects and to ensure that the associated
financial terms were not detrimental to Sri Lanka.
4.
The implementation of sound macro-economic policies by the government, in line
with the EFF program, is expected to improve market confidence and encourage
investment, thereby facilitating the economic growth of around 5 per cent during 2016 and
around 6 - 7 per cent annually in the medium term. Improved fiscal consolidation and
appropriate monetary policy measures to ensure low inflation are expected to create an
investor friendly environment for private sector participation in economic activities.
Recovery in the construction sector and the sustained momentum of the services sector,
including tourism, transport, communication and IT related activities, are expected to
contribute to achieve projected growth. It is also expected that the gradual recovery of the
global economy will provide the required impetus to maintain Sri Lanka’s external
demand at a favorable level. Sri Lanka’s strong base of human capital and reliable
infrastructure compared with other South Asian economies, along with its strategic
location in the Indian Ocean are the country’s strengths in achieving sustainable high
economic growth.
Recent Devastating Natural Disaster
5.
The heaviest rains in a quarter of a century in Sri Lanka, followed by cyclonic
conditions in the Indian Ocean during mid-May 2016 caused severe flood and landslides,
affecting human lives, destroying houses, other properties and agricultural crops. Official
figures show that nearly half a million people have been affected by the flood and
landslides, with a large number of them seeking shelter at state-run relief camps. The
death toll from landslides currently stands at 101 while about 125 people are reported
missing and over 200,000 are displaced. The floods and landslides have completely
destroyed close to 30,000 houses while around 128,000 houses have been left partially
damaged. This unfortunate incident has incurred a significant burden to the government
budget, in terms of providing immediate relief and compensation for the rebuilding of
destroyed houses, livelihoods as well as restoring public amenities. The total additional
cost due to the floods has been estimated at around USD 2.0 billion. Also, in the short run,
there is likely to be some upward pressure on inflation due to the destruction of
agricultural crops.

Fiscal Policy
6.
Fiscal management in 2015 was extremely difficult given the two key national
elections held during the year, the uncertainty that prevailed during the inter-election
period and the resultant slowdown in economic activity as well as external sector related
issues, including the tightening of international financial market conditions and the
slowdown in foreign inflows. These challenges were reflected in the fiscal performance
during the year, leading to a notable deviation from fiscal targets announced in January
2015 in the interim budget for 2015, despite the improvement seen in some areas. The
overall budget deficit widened to 7.4 per cent of GDP compared to the deficit of 5.7 per
cent in 2014 and the targeted deficit of 4.4 per cent in the interim budget for 2015. The
deficit was largely financed by domestic sources, given the slowdown in foreign financing
during the year. The debt to GDP ratio increased to 76 per cent in 2015 from 70.7 per cent
in 2014. This was partly reflective of the debt financing of fiscal deficit as well as the
impact of rupee depreciation on the stock of foreign currency denominated debt.
7.
The government revenue improved in 2015, in contrast to the declining trend in
the revenue to GDP ratio observed since 2011, mainly benefiting from the imposition of
several one off taxes and the significant expansion in revenue from excise duties on the
increased motor vehicle imports. However, higher government expenditure on salaries and
wages, interest payments and subsidies and transfers to households exerted a heavy
pressure on government finances, leading to a higher deficit than envisaged.
8.
Our authorities have taken a number of measures to address weaknesses in revenue
collection and to increase government revenue as well as rationalize and prioritize
government expenditure. Redrafting of tax laws with technical assistance from the IMF to
simplify the tax laws, improvements in tax administration, including the revenue
Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) at the Inland Revenue
Department (IRD), introducing single window system at Sri Lanka Customs (ASYCUDA)
linking all stake holders, automation of the activities of the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
and the setting up of Budget Implementation and Monitoring Unit (BIMU) to ensure close
monitoring of expenditure programs are among the important initiatives already taken in
this context.
9.
The medium term objective of the government is to reduce the budget deficit to 3.5
per cent of GDP by 2020. As a major step toward this objective, the government revised
down its originally anticipated budget deficit of 5.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent in 2016. The
government expects to reduce its primary deficit to zero level in 2017 and a gradual
increase in its primary surplus thereafter. This would enable to reduce debt to GDP ratio
to 68 per cent of GDP by 2020. One of the major steps taken by our authorities to achieve
revenue target has been the increasing of VAT from 11 per cent to 15 per cent and
removing exemptions on telecommunications services, effective from May 2016. Also,
VAT will continue to apply to wholesale and retail trade at a lower threshold. On the

expenditure side, measures have been taken to curb spending to within the available fiscal
space by streamlining non-critical expenditure on goods and services and capital
spending.
10.
As the financial condition of some of the State Owned Enterprises (SOE) has
deteriorated significantly, a comprehensive strategy is currently being developed by our
authorities to decisively address the issues related to SOEs and thereby minimize the
associated fiscal risk. The national carrier, Sri Lankan Airlines continues to incur
significant losses. A resolution strategy for Sri Lankan Airlines is expected to be
completed by September 2016, thus removing the company from government’s accounts.
Cabinet approval has already been obtained for the government to take over all its
liabilities and to identify a suitable partner who can successfully manage the operations of
the airline, on the foundation of a clean balance sheet. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation
(CPC) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have incurred losses due to implicit energy
subsidies. Therefore, an automatic fuel and electricity pricing mechanism that ensures
retail prices above cost recovery levels will be introduced by end 2016. To enhance
oversight and financial discipline, the six largest SOEs are expected to publish Statements
of Corporate Intent (SCI) highlighting their mission, objectives, corporate and financing
plan to meet future objectives. Also, the legal framework for governance and oversight of
SOEs will be strengthened.
Monetary Policy
11.
Inflation in Sri Lanka continuously remained at single digit levels for a period of
over seven years, due to favorable domestic supply conditions, subdued global commodity
prices supported by the demand management policies of the Central Bank. Inflation fell
further during the year, with substantial downward revisions to administratively
determined prices, including domestic petroleum products. Accordingly, year on year
headline inflation (as measured by Colombo Consumers’ Price Index) recorded negative
rates during July-September 2015 and was at 2.8 per cent by December 2015.
Nevertheless, core inflation increased to 4.5 per cent from 3.2 per cent reflecting buildup
of some demand pressures in the economy. The recent increase in the Value Added Tax
(VAT) rate and the removal of certain exemptions applicable on VAT and the Nation
Building Tax (NBT) are expected to have a one-off impact on inflation, while the supply
side disruptions due to prevailing adverse weather conditions could exert some upward
pressure on inflation in the immediate future. In spite of these temporary disruptions,
inflation is expected to remain in mid-single digit levels supported by appropriate demand
management policies.
12.
The monetary policy stance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) continued to
be accommodative during 2015 with the objective of supporting economic activity.
Benefiting from low interest rates and fiscal measures such as reduction in taxes on
selected motor vehicle imports, credit growth accelerated from 8.8 per cent in 2014 to 25

per cent by end 2015, while money supply expanded from13.4 per cent at end 2014 to
17.8 per cent by end 2015. As credit and monetary expansion was higher than expected,
and excess liquidity in the domestic money market remained persistently high, CBSL
commenced tightening of its monetary policy towards end 2015. Accordingly, the CBSL
raised the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of
commercial banks by 1.50 percentage points to 7.50 per cent in January 2016 and raised
its policy interest rates viz; Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and Standing Lending
Facility (SLF) rates by 50 basis points to 6.50 per cent and 8.00 per cent respectively, in
February 2016.
13.
Several other measures were also taken to contain credit flows to selected sectors.
As a significant surge in motor vehicle imports was observed in 2015, a minimum cash
margin requirement of 100 per cent was imposed on Letter of Credit (LCs) opened with
commercial banks for the importation of motor vehicles with effect from 30 October 2015
as a temporary measure for a period of one month. Subsequently, as a macro-prudential
measure, a maximum Loan to Value ratio (LTV) of 70 per cent was imposed in respect of
loans and advances granted for the purpose of purchases or utilization of motor vehicles.
The CBSL is closely monitoring any signs of buildup of demand and inflationary
pressures and stands ready to take any further monetary tightening measures should it be
required.
14.
Over the past several years, the CBSL and the government have fulfilled a number
of prerequisites required to moving towards Inflation Targeting in the medium term. At
present, as an interim arrangement, the CBSL conducts its monetary policy within an
enhanced monetary policy framework with features of both Monetary Targeting (MT) and
Flexible Inflation Targeting frameworks (FIT). Under this framework, CBSL focuses on
stabilizing inflation in mid-single digits level over the medium term, while supporting the
growth objectives and flexibility in exchange rate management. The CBSL currently uses
the average call money rate as its operating target and increasingly relies on market based
instruments, namely policy interest rates and open market operations. Over the medium
term, as our authorities continue to address the remaining barriers for gradually moving
towards FIT regime, the CBSL will continue its current initiatives with the IMF to
improve its macroeconomic modelling framework and forecasting capabilities.
External Sector
15.
Sri Lanka’s external sector showed a subdued performance in 2015, due to
challenging global economic environment and several domestic factors. The decline in
external demand for major export commodities due to the slow recovery of the global
economy and the withdrawal of foreign investments from the government securities
market anticipating normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies and the
slowdown in FDIs were major reasons for the lower performance of the external sector.
Also, increased consumption demand through excessive fiscal expansion, as well as policy

uncertainties amidst two national elections exerted a pressure from the domestic front on
the external sector in 2015. However, foreign investors’ appetite for the International
Sovereign Bonds remained intact during the year, and two sovereign bond issues
amounting to US dollars 2.15 billion were completed successfully.
16.
Although the trade deficit continued to widen due to an increase in non-oil imports
and slowdown in export earnings, a substantial increase was largely avoided as a result of
the low expenditure on oil imports. The current account deficit, at 2.4 per cent of GDP,
remained almost unchanged from the previous year’s level, benefiting from increased
earnings from services exports and the surplus in the secondary income account. Inflows
to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) was adversely affected by the
decline in foreign investments, slowdown in inflows to the government and unwinding of
foreign investments from the government securities market. This resulted in the BOP
recording an overall deficit of US dollars 1,489 million in 2015. Gross official reserves
remained at US dollars 7.3 billion at end 2015 which was equivalent to 4.6 months of
goods imports.
17.
Promoting Sri Lanka’s export sector with greater integration into regional and
global supply chains is one of the main priorities of our authorities. For this purpose, a
Development Agency for the prioritization of infrastructure investments and Trade
Agency for trade promotion and negotiation of trade and investment agreements will be
established. On the more positive note, Sri Lanka is now delisted from the EU ban on
fishery imports while measures are being taken to regain the GSP+ trade status.
Exchange Rate Policy
18.
An increased pressure in the foreign exchange market was witnessed since late
2014. This was largely due to the increased trade deficit, slowdown in net capital inflows,
increased debt service payments of the government as a result of the depreciation of Sri
Lanka Rupee against the US dollar, repayment of the matured International Sovereign
Bond of USD 500 million in early 2015 and the unwinding of foreign investment in
government securities market. The CBSL intervened in the foreign exchange market to
reduce undue pressure on the exchange rate by supplying about USD 1.9 billion, on net
basis, during the first eight months of the year. However, on 03 September 2015 the
CBSL decided to limit its intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market and
allowed the exchange rate to be largely determined in the market. This resulted in Sri
Lankan rupee depreciating at a higher magnitude during the rest of the year. Accordingly,
rupee depreciation against the US dollar during the year was 9.03 per cent. The CBSL’s
net supply of foreign exchange during the year amounted to US dollar 3.2 billion, largely
driven by capital account transactions.
19.
During the first four months of 2016, some pressure was observed in the foreign
exchange market despite the correction in the nominal and real exchange rates, partly

attributable to market uncertainties and delays in repatriation of export proceeds. CBSL
intervention during the period was amounted to US dollar 1.16 billion while the rupee
depreciated by 0.1per cent. However, the renewed SWAP arrangements with the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) for USD 700 million and the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) for USD 400 million provided an additional buffer. During May
2016, a turnaround of CBSL intervention was seen with CBSL purchasing about USD 76
million, on net basis, alongside the stabilization of the exchange rate. This could be
mainly attributed to improved investor confidence in the wake of the successful
negotiations for a program facility with the IMF. Going forward, our authorities will take
necessary steps to meet essential preconditions for an increasingly flexible exchange rate
regime.
Financial Sector
20.
The financial sector stability and soundness improved in 2015, reflecting high
capital and liquidity levels and increased profitability. The Capital Adequacy Ratios
(CAR) in the banking sector have been maintained well above the regulatory minimum
ratio of 10 per cent. As at end 2015, the total CAR and core CAR remained at 14.2 per
cent and 11.9 per cent respectively. The banking sector recorded increased level of profits
in 2015, largely attributed to the healthy growth in net interest income. Meanwhile, nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio declined to 3.2 per cent in 2015 from 4.2 per cent in 2014.
However, total loan loss provisions have been increased with an increase in the specific
provisions made for NPLs in the loss category. In line with the current regulatory
developments, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio under Basel III was implemented in 2015 and
the Basel III Capital Standards are expected to be implemented in line with international
timelines. Our authorities are committed to the finalization of a resolution framework for
weak finance companies (the total assets of which approximately 1 per cent of GDP)
through the establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle and the IMF’s technical assistance
is currently being sought for this purpose.
Conclusion
21.
The Sri Lankan authorities wish to thank the Executive Board for considering their
request for financial support under a three-year EFF. They believe that the proposed
arrangement by the Fund would support implementation of essential policy reforms to
improve external and fiscal buffers and create a conducive environment to achieve high
and sustainable economic growth with the support of the international community. Our
authorities have already completed required prior actions and are fully committed to
implementation of the program. While program ownership will be strengthened, there
could be elevated economic and financial risks to the program due to uncertainties with
respect to the global economic environment as well as uncertain domestic conditions
similar to the recently experienced devastating natural disaster. Such conditions need to be
taken into consideration for suitable adjustment.
